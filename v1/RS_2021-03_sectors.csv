stocks,How is it possible the stock market is NOT WILDLY over valued?,"It seems by every metric the stock market is incredibly over valued, much more so than it was before just before the Great Depression and the .com bubble in the early 2000s.

I have a lot of money sitting in my bank account that I want to invest but I feel like I may be picking a really bad time to enter the market.

cybersecurity,"My path to a SOC analyst job(a bit of a career change), looking for feedback/advice","So, currently I work as a Business Systems Analyst for the U.S. federal government(contractor).

personalfinance,Took some bad advice and royally messed up my 2018 taxes and now it's coming back to haunt me,"In 2018 I moved from Virginia to Maryland and failed to update my W4 with my employer (someone said I didn't have to, but I never double-checked so ultimately this was my mistake). I was let go at the end of 2018 and when I found a new job in 2019 I made sure my new W4 reflected my Maryland address.

I now realize that I should have split my 2018 state taxes between the two states and I'm horrified that I am going to get reamed in taxes and penalties.

personalfinance,"Low Tax Refund ($29), consistently. Did I do something wrong?","I regularly get back what others tell me is a really low refund, and I'm honestly not sure why.  


I got back $29 filing this year, and was only going to get only 4 before the retirement tax credit. I use TurboTax, and know next to nothing about taxes.  


The Federal tax withheld was about 1,200, and my wages were about 24,000. I am single, with no dependents, and am not claimed as a dependent.  


Getting less back than my peers, even who make the same amount as me, is not uncommon for me (most people are shocked when I tell them), though prior to about 2017-2018, I got at least about 140-200 back.

It took me years, but I’ve successfully finished paying off everything with high interest rates. This was lingering debt from school and a job I took that opened a lot of doors for me. This debt was crippling and now we’re on the other side. The investment and risk paid off big time. 

All we have left is a HELOC with $109k at 4.75%, and the mortgage of $400k at 3.25%. I know 4.75% isn’t bad, but I hate making the interest payments. 

Right now I’m set up to be saving $25,000/year into brokerage and retirement accounts. My wife’s entire $80k salary is set to pay against the HELOC except for her 401k contributions. At this rate it will take us about two more years. Once the HELOC is paid off, her entire $80k salary goes into investments—plus her employer pays 50% of dependent college tuition. We have three kids. 

I know we should have a larger emergency fund, but I’m viewing the brokerage accounts as an extension of that cash and we just hit this point of getting out of the credit cards. It’s a simple VTI investment. I’m not trying to go to Vegas via Fidelity. I just know it’s time to aggressively save so I can catch up with my retirement and nest egg. 

Would you continue in this way, or aggressively attack the HELOC? There’s a good chance I will get a bonus that could knock out 30-50% of the HELOC in one swing... but VTI will hopefully beat the 4.75% of the HELOC.

personalfinance,"""Identity cannot be verified"" of my 19y/o brother, so he can't even open a checking account!! How do we go about ensuring his identity can be verified?","I (25F) am posting this on behalf of my 19-year-old brother. He has had virtually no support or guidance from my parents throughout his entire life, but especially as a teen and young adult. I could tell that he was not meeting basic young adult milestones, so I've been helping to get him ""caught up"" in ""Adulting 101.""

Now, I consider myself pretty financially-savvy, but I am absolutely stuck on this one. My 19M brother, a U.S. citizen born to U.S. citizen parents, has a basic child's checking account that is linked to his mother's checking account at a local credit union. As his current account allows his mom to manage his account/money, we decided to open an independent/adult checking account for him. Despite personally ENSURING all information was correct, he received notices that his checking account applications were not approved (no reason provided).

I never encountered a problem like this, even though I opened my first independent checking account at the age of 17 just 8 years ago. So, I tried opening accounts on Experian and CreditKarma to see if it was an identity issue and -- lo and behold -- his identity cannot be verified.

**Any advice on what I should do next to try and figure this out?**

Here is what I have tried/confirmed/noted so far:

* I ensured the info on his existing childrens checking account is accurate (editing to add that his existing childrens checking acct is at a local credit union, not sure if that makes a difference!)
* I ensured the info on the application for a checking account was accurate (and also matched the info on his childrens checking account)
* He has had 1 job on an official payroll and they had his correct SSN
* He has filed taxes once and used the correct SSN
* I tried to obtain a tax transcript for him (just to triple-check the above) but cannot because they want a credit card with his name attached for verification
* There is nothing ""weird"" about him/his situation -- he's a 19y/o, U.S. citizen, he hasn't grown up in some ""off the grid"" cult/he attended public schools his entire life, he has a state-issued ID and birth certificate, along with federally-issued SSN/card, he has no name changes and only lived at 1 address his entire life...
* Editing to add: ChexSystems cannot verify his identity either, which seems especially odd to me because I assumed that the info tied to his childrens checking account would be on file with ChexSystems? Maybe I'm way off here!

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

\--

**Edit:** Many have suggested going to a physical branch to open a checking account, which is good advice; however, he has already done this when he opened his current childrens checking account 3 years ago. Personally, after I opened my first checking account in person, I never had to return to a branch again to open a checking account. **HOWEVER, it seems like this is the best step forward -- we will head to the branch of a local bank to open another checking account**. This is just frustrating that he is limited to these banks when they are definitely not offering the services he's looking for. Sheesh, what a hassle! Thanks all :-)",finance
CryptoCurrency,Black Swan &amp; Crypto,"I'm finally getting around to reading the Black Swan by Nassim Taleb. If you follow him on Twitter you'll find that he is not a fan of Bitcoin, but I get the feeling he is attacking a certain kind of devotion to Bitcoin and arrogance is blinding him to his own principles that reveal a lot of upside.

As Taleb says, history moves by jumps, not by crawling. I'm trying to discern how his now tried and true philosophy of skeptical empiricism applies to the world of cryptocurrency, and how to build those lessons into a strategy.

A few thoughts that I've had so far:

- Assume I don't know anything more about future crypto prices than what my Dad knows from watching Fox News or any less than Elon Musk himself.

- The least likely outcome is that Bitcoin/crypto just keeps growing at x%/year right now. That might happen when it's actually used as a primary currency but until then, speculation makes it entirely unpredictable.

- There will be significant disruptions that can't be predicted by any ""rational"" person using conventional wisdom. If they could be predicted then they probably wouldn't happen. These disruptions could include market collapse, inflation, war, famine, pandemic, etc. These may have positive or negative impacts on crypto.
    - As an example of this, the idea that the United States dollar will be worth anything in 50 years seems to be taken entirely too much for granted, especially when you consider how many nuclear weapons exist, the last decade of monetary policy, and the general whims of populist and socialist politics.

- Put myself in position to gain from positive outlier events and avoid risk of ruin from negative outlier events.
    - Make small/ medium bets on cryptos that appear to solve real problems
    - Hedge a traditional portfolio with crypto or hedge a crypto portfolio with something else. 
    - Make bets on items where profit seems likely but avoid ruin. (Don't dump all available funds into a single Dapp)
    - don't over leverage
    - Don't get too emotionally attached to any currency or project. Continue to evaluate.

These are just a few thoughts, but I'd love to see discussion or other thoughts or musings from those who have read Taleb.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Helping my recently widowed mother,"I've visited reddit for a number of things but never did I think financial advice for my mother would be one of them. I look forward to any and all advice given on here as I'm trying to assist my mother through the passing of my father and what her best course of action is.

Father passed away on Christmas Eve and now the dust has settled. Long story short; Dad left mom about 300k in his company stock, about 70k in his 401k, and 120k in life insurance. Which is great, but aside from me just recently buying my first house last year and only a novice at my own 401k (Federal TSP) I'm unsure of what's best for my mother. She retires in roughly 10 years with almost nothing in her own 401k because my dad handled all the finances. Brain cancer put a stop to that and my mom is clueless with her own retirement on the horizon.

She plans on rolling my father's 401k in hers, but I don't know the options Fidelity offers for her to potentially grow that 70k into something a bit more, safely, by the time she retires.

She can sell off the stocks and refinance her home to knock down the principal and hopefully get a lower rate on a mortgage that she can easily afford with her current income and beyond with SS.

She plans on paying off their only car to eliminate the car note.

The stock and life insurance will help make everything manageable for her but I also don't want to see her with nothing in the bank by the time she retires.

Please, feel free to ask any necessary questions to make a conclusion on what advice would be best for her. I'm just looking for options I can look/read more into so I can educate not only myself but my mother on these matters.

TLDR: Dad died, Mom has monies but almost no retirement. What should she do?

personalfinance,TaxAct did not eFile correctly. Not sure what I'm supposed to do next,"So every year for the last 13 years I have submitted my taxes via Tax Act. I submitted mine this year just like I always do, I entered my bank account and routing information and had the eFile do a direct deposit for my State refund and a withdrawal for my Federal amount owed.

I was wondering why I had seen no activity in my bank for the last 2 weeks. This weekend I received a paper check with my State refund. It made me wonder so I checked my Tax Act account. It shows that I elected for direct deposit on my State so that's weird but whatever. My Federal however is showing that I elected to pay at a later date via VPS.

I've never had to do this before, I don't know what VPS is and how I actually go about paying for my taxes now.  I went to the IRS [Pay your Taxes by Debit or Credit Card](https://www.irs.gov/payments/pay-your-taxes-by-debit-or-credit-card) page and see their partners. If I go through the process of making a payment via these services am I all good to go? Nothing else to do on my end? When  I go to them, such as the pay1040 website, they ask me which Form I submitted. I did a 1040 with my wife (filed jointly). There are several different kinds of 1040s and I don't know which form I'm actually supposed to use. Just a plain 1040 if all Tax Act says is ""1040""?

I appreciate any guidance on this. I don't know why this year Tax Act kind of screwed up... perhaps I shouldn't have filed as early as I did (January 31st).",finance

stocks,Can someone help answer some questions I had about bond yields interest rate and stock market?,"So last week I finally started to learn some basic things like 

high interest rate = treasury bonds more attractive = money pulled out of stock market and into those bonds.

Now another term I saw being thrown around is ""bond yield""

I Googled this and here is kind of my understanding

- High yield = bond price fall down because it has to adjust for that high yield

- But isn't high yield means their is higher interest rate? But FED said interest rate is low so whats the reason behind the high yield? When we are in a situation where interest rate is still low but yield is going up it means the old 10 year bonds are being sold off for newer high yield bonds? I saw an article that 50B bonds were unloaded causing higher yield. So I guess that means selling bonds = higher yield EVEN if interest rate is low am I correct here? I guess what I want to know is what causes yield to go up? Does people selling their bond causes it go up? Also why would you sell of the bond if the price can be adjusted down to account for the new yield? 

- FED only controls interest rates and not yield, but assuming my thought process is correct above. High yield was caused by 50B whales unloading and they unloaded because of inflation fears and stimulus and since the economy will open up where people have been saving money on the side lines are all factors behind the high yield and this 50B sell off? So is it safe to assume that the money from the sell of the 10 year bonds is currently sitting on the sidelines and maybe the whales doubt the FED can keep inflation down and expect interest rate to rise and at that point is when they use the money from the 50B sell off to the new bonds that have will theoretically have higher interest rate cos FED will be forced to raise rates to combat inflation?



So to summarize

Bond yield goes up with high interest rates and bond price goes down to account for the high yield right? How does bond yield going up affect market? When people see bond yield is up they say the risk is less than stock market and causes they to migrat over to bonds which is why we see sea of red? So really high interest rate causes market sell off and high bond yield causes market sell off right? 

HOWEVER, since interest rates are low but bond yield still went up, this means selling off mutual bonds can ALSO increase bond yield, doesn't necessarily have to ONLY caused by high interest?

What can the fed do to combat the high yield? Heard people say ""the fed will maybe step in when it reached 2% yield"" but what do they mean by ""step in"" what will fed do exactly? I would assume they would make interest rate go even lower which would in turn drive up price of the bond and lower price of yield?

Finally, should I be worried? If interest rate is low but yield is up, this shouldn't be a cause for concern right? If so, what benchmark should I go by that a crash is coming? My brain wants to keep it simple and say ""sell when you see interest rate going up"" and their is nothing to worry",finance

personalfinance,90k in private &amp; federal undergrad student loans. Trying to set up a strategy before I graduate.,"As the title suggests, I will be graduating undergrad with about 90k in debt. (Yes, I know this was not a wise financial decision.) I would just like to bounce my plan ahead of graduation off of some of you here to see if it’s feasible. Here’s some background: 

I went to a in-state to flagship university and while my grades were good I did not qualify for academic scholarships. As for need based, my family made far too much money to qualify anything more than the minimum federal loans. My loans upon graduation will be about 70k in private (at about 7.5% avg interest rate) and 20k in federal direct.

I will graduate with a degree in Political Science, minor in Econ, and a certificate in Professional Writing (tailored to public service) December of 2021. I have work experience as a campaign and retail employee (I worked most of my time through college) and am currently doing an internship. Although with the economy as it is my employment prospects after grad are uncertain as of now. 

I plan on putting my federal loans into IBR and focusing on knocking down my private loans asap. Upon graduation my payments will be about 800 per month for a 10 year period. I want to refinance those down to a lower monthly payment over a longer period to give myself some breathing room as I start my career, then start paying way over the minimum as soon as I can. I would be bringing on my dad as a cosigner here because while my starting salary is likely not going to be very high (lets say somewhere around 30k-40k), he makes about 140-170k per year depending on bonuses and has a good credit score. 
He had expressed willingness to help me with payments but after a very messy divorce with my mom (which, of course, was finalized just as I finish my schooling) he is waffling so I want to get into the mindset of taking on this beast myself. 
There’s a fair amount of room for growth in my field, *especially* if I went to grad school, however with this debt burden I don’t see how I would get there without being sponsored by an employer, or winning the lottery. 

So that’s about it. I’ve been trying to psych myself up and tell myself everything will be okay but given the large amount of uncertainty in my future I am almost nauseous on the daily. If anyone has any add-on’s or suggestions for this strategy I’d love to hear. Or if you’re in a similar situation to me, how you’re handling it. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Looking for advice/guidance on debt management,"I’ve managed to accumulate quite a bit of debt in my 33 years here on this planet. Not proud of it. Goes without saying, but financial literacy has never been my strong suit. 

Currently, I have the following debts: 

Credit Cards 
2k credit card (24% interest)
4K credit card (24% interest) 
23k in credit card debt management program (7.99% interest)

Student Loans (all around 6-7.65% interest)
5.5k myfedloans
15.7k direct plus 1
21.8 direct plus 2 
30k sofi 

All the credit card debt was accumulated in my early to mid twenties after having just moved to NYC and not understanding the real weight of a credit card swipe. 

The last few years have been a bit tougher and a kind of awakening for me as I also took over my student loan payments. My parents had been helping until I got a promotion at work about 2 years ago. Upon taking on the student loan payments, I really started to feel the weight of all this debt. 

I received said promotion at a company I’ve managed to maintain a job at for about 7 years now. Im lucky to earn six figures there. I also have a 401k that they match on up to 4 or 500. (at least they did pre-pandemic.) I’ve managed to save 85k roughly in the 401k. 

My savings acct is barely existent and my checking acct feels month to month when you factor in expenses living in NYC. That said, I have been starting to budget better. 

I understand I’m in a better situation than most and am very thankful for that. that said, I do feel embarrassed making this kind of salary and not having more financial freedom. Im also constantly wondering if I could be doing something better with my debt situation. 

Over the last few years, I’ve refinanced some Student loans for lower interest rates (sofi). I’ve settled 2 old credit cards via a credit card debt management program. I’ve also started to incorporate the snow ball method of debt payment but I’ve let the pandemic and govt deferred student loan payments get in the way of really starting to let the snow ball get going. 

One thing I’m currently pondering is borrowing against my 401k to pay off all the credit card debt to help my credit score. Would that be worth it? Or should I just keep on the path I’m on? 

Right now, I have a target of 2025-2026 to pay off everything, but I’m wondering if maybe there’s other options or alternatives I’m not aware of or may have missed. 

I genuinely want to better at all of this but I feel like I’m just now learning that there’s a game called Personal Finance that everyone else has been playing for some time and I still don’t know all the rules or even how to gauge if I’m doing well at it.

CryptoCurrency,Daedalus SCAM in pictures:,"On the 26th of February I watched a YouTube video about staking my ADA.  Hearing that over 72% of it is staked and visiting the site, using the staking calculator there and understanding I only plan to hold it anyways, I decided it was best for me too.

Neither the YouTube video or the Daedalus website told me anything about a Daedalus mobile app.  I just assumed that there must be one since so many exchanges and crypto-related products have them already.  I also assumed that since there are crypto wallet apps as well, that any Daedalus app would serve as a wallet for staking, especially since there are wallets that let you stake ADA already.  This scam definitely banks on those assumptions.

I checked off ""I agree with the terms of service"" and wouldn't you know it, this scam gets right to business!

[What's your Security Phrase?](https://preview.redd.it/pblv9ru4xdk61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ba8a7b57c1d7fca459f30ebe8a36d6b9fd7b118)

It asks for your security phrase right off the bat!  The app looks legit too, even has a moving logo when you first open it that looks incredibly professional.  I wish I had a way to show you it here just so you all would know they spare no expense.

I paused here.  My first response was that I did not download this to restore a wallet, I downloaded it to start a wallet that I can stake my ADA with.  I then tried to close this window and found that it did not close, in any way.  I tried to close it using every method I've ever learned and then some, all of 3 minutes I would say.  Confused, I reloaded the app and same thing.  It was clear to me at this point that I could only restore a wallet here to get started, the lack of options demanded it by default.

Fortunately, I did not fall for this scam.  I can definitely see where many would though.

I get scam calls all the time from the other side of the world.  One is to lower my credit card interest rate to zero!  Nice, huh?!  I'll waste a bit of their time if I have nothing better to do, it's for fun.  They all have the same spiel.  They take the limited information they get from their leads, in this case my name and the last four digits of my credit card (which is shared information everywhere) and they hope that you will think they have the whole number, asking you to verify the rest.  Suddenly they have your credit card information.

Well, seeing this screen I couldn't escape the fact that this felt just like that.  They made themselves seem legit in hopes I would give up the information they did not have.

Even though I felt this might be a scam, I still thought that maybe it wasn't and I would figure it out later.  I am very glad I waited a couple of days and I am extremely glad I am a part of this community.  I managed to see that it was very much a scam because of the work you all put in here today and I want to thank you by showing you what a scam is capable of looking like:  professional.

I am positive that plenty of you have much bigger bags than I do.  I would say the greater percentage of you hold bigger bags than I do actually.  However, what's mine is mine.  When I think about what I would have felt if I had fallen for this scam, it terrifies me honestly.  I can only imagine what extremes of emotion this would prompt from people giving up their wallet security phrase and falling for the scam with holdings of, for example:  $50,000, easy!  In crypto, that's nothing for some people.  Gone in an instant and possibly well before you realize.  Just gone!  It terrifies me to think scams like this exist, that they work and that people can be that horrible.

Be careful out there guys and gals.  I hate to admit it, but this one almost fooled me and it still kind of terrifies me to know I came so close.

GOOGLE Play Store has NO validation process it seems.

Thanks again guys and gals for all you do.  You probably saved me today...",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,[OC] My personal text mining project in reddit cryptosphere + results.,"Hi.

Over the past week, I decided to put use of the time I spend on reddit, and as a data enthusiast, I thought maybe defining a few projects for myself would be a good idea not to feel guilty about F5ing reddit on a constant basis. 

I decided to scrape /r/CryptoCurrency + the subreddits stated in the wiki, and see their activity patterns, what keywords they use, and what is the relationship between subreddit activity and market cap. Data is from 20th to 26th February. Out of nearly 70 subs, only around 10 of them had more than 1000 comments in a span of a week, and because of noisy data I had to get rid of most of the subs.

You can see the results in here:

1. First I decided to create a wordcloud of the data I had from /r/cc. You can see it [**here**](https://imgur.com/KkRVtMr).

2.  What really intrigued me was that there wasn't much going on in the subs of some of the highest mcap coins, while some smaller coins had tons of activity. You can see their distribution [**here**](https://imgur.com/XjTffxs). 

3. The keywords used in different subs(excluding /r/cc) seemed to look interesting. I created a Treemap visualizing it [**here**](https://i.imgur.com/AqKUTXW.png).

4. The overall keyword graph and their dominance is visualized **[here](https://imgur.com/3Ct7szy)**. (Also excluding /r/cc)

--------------------------------

How I got the data? I used `psaw` to scrape reddit comments in python. I preprocessed them and removed markdown + links and tags, then fed them to my algorithms. For worldcloud there is a very good python package named `wordcloud` that I used. For keyword extraction, I used `spacy` to detect named entities in each comment, and used a bag of words model to create a co-occurance matrix.


If you had any questions, I would be glad to answer them. Thanks!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Housing budget realistic and are we crazy to buy in this market?,"My wife and I (late twenties) live in a very hot area of Colorado. Housing prices here have been growing at a hot pace for a while (friend bought her home in late 2019 for 380k, now estimated at 455k).


Stats:
- Income: Me 82k, her 48k
- Student loans: 19k left, payment around 250/month after covid forbearance
- 1 paid off car, 1 loan with 4K left @ 2.6%
- 200k in retirement
- no non tax advantaged investments
- 73k saved up for down payment/house expenses
- no other monthly debt


We currently pay $1400 for rent, expecting that to keep going up yearly and we probably spend around $1500-
/month on other expenses like food, travel, gas, utilities, insurance, etc. We’ve been looking at houses in the 350-400k range but we haven’t liked what we’ve seen. We’re considering looking up to 450k but this sounds like a lot to us, with a payment of around $2300. At this price we could get into the better neighborhoods and more convenient locations. We plan on staying in this area for the next 5-10 years and probably having kids in the next 3 or 4 years.


We’re first time homebuyers and we’ve started looking for our own home in this crazy market and are a little discouraged as like everywhere, houses going well above asking with cash appraisal gaps and interest rates are on the rise. All I seem to hear about is how our friends got in at 50-70k lower price than us with lower interest rates... Anyways We’re planning on 5% down so we can keep maximum cash on hand.


Is 450k pushing it and is it a terrible time to buy?


Thanks for any advice!

EDIT: I guess I should’ve prefaced this saying we want to buy and own a home. We’re tired of renting and want our own place that will be better for a future family and our dog. We tried buying last year but lost a job due to Covid temporarily. The equity gains in this market (if they continue) would just be a bonus.",finance
personalfinance,EV State Tax Credit Query 1099-G,"I have tried to google around and search this issue and I'm having a hard time finding a clear answer. I have only lived in the USA / CO for 5 years and up until now I always just had a standard deduction on my taxes. This year I am once again back on the standard deduction. Last year was very different though, I had large credits for my Tesla and Solar, most of which was Federal but it included a $5k credit for Tesla purchased in 2019.

This year as tax season approached I received a 1099-G in the mail that stated this ~$5600 refund, $5k of which would be the Tesla.

I got to the part of my FreeTaxUSA tax return that indicates the 1099-G and answer accurately on the check boxes. From what I'm reading though, it seems like this $5000 from my Colorado refund is now taxable? I'm left with this box that just says ""Put in the amount of your state refund that is taxable"". If I throw in the amount on the 1099-G, it takes a good 1k or so off my refund. The other option seems to be just leaving it at zero and it has no impact.

Long story short, is this refund/credit from my Tesla on state taxes (CO) actually taxable on the next year's federal income tax?

Thanks to anyone that can offer me help.",finance
personalfinance,"30-Day Challenge #3: Prepare your tax return accurately and file early (March, 2021)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Prepare your Tax Return Accurately, and File Early**. 

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've filed your US federal income tax return by March 31st.

Recommended Steps:

###Plan
1. **Learn how US income taxes work:**
* Watch [Basics of US income tax rate schedule](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/basics-of-us-income-tax-rate-schedule)
* Watch [Tax deductions introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/taxes/v/tax-deductions-introduction)
* Read /r/personalfinances's very own [wiki page on income tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes)
* *Understand* what exactly your tax return is: A form you fill out, telling the government how much money you made, calculating how much taxes you owe on that money (your ""tax liability""), and ""squaring-up"" with the government: Figuring out if you already paid more than your actual tax liability throughout the year with paycheck withholdings (in which case you will get a tax *refund*), or if you haven't paid enough throughout the year, and owe a balance to the government.
2. [Determine your filing status](https://www.irs.gov/uac/what-is-my-filing-status) and determine whether you can be claimed as a dependent by anyone (for example, your parents), or can claim any dependents. ([IRS Dependent Tool](https://www.irs.gov/uac/who-can-i-claim-as-a-dependent))
3. **Prepare a ""map"" for what documentation you will need to fill out your tax return**, then go through the list and make sure you have the documentation for each. **Don't worry if you forget something.** The software you use to fill out your tax return (or the tax return form itself) will remind you of things you might have forgotten.
* Jot down every possible way you made money this year (remember, even if you don't get a form, you still need to report it):
    * paycheck from my job (W-2 form)
    * interest on my bank account (personal records like your December account statement, or a 1099 form)
    * dividends from my stock (1099-Div)
    * income from my small business or self employment (personal records, or 1099 form)
* Make a list of all the possible deductions you might think you are eligible for, and make sure you have documentation:
    * mortgage interest you paid (1098)
    * student loan interest you paid (1098-E)
    * education expenses (1098-T)
    * state or local income taxes (W-2)
    * charitable contributions (personal records)

### Prepare and file your Tax Return
**Using one of the following methods**

1. See if you are eligible for [completely free tax return preparation software](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) sponsored by the IRS
2. Use paid (or free) tax return preparation software. Examples: TaxAct, TurboTax, CreditKarma, AARP, FreeTaxUSA, TaxSlayer. [See our megathread for discussion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%28Tax+Filing+Software+Megathread%29&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=year#res-hide-options)
3. ""Manually"" fill out the tax return form online using [IRS Free Fillable Forms](https://www.irs.gov/uac/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)

By starting early, it allows you more time to deal with unanticipated questions about your tax return. ""Wait, can I claim my girlfriend as a dependent""? ""Do I have to report income from renting out the spare room in my house to a friend?"". When these come up, feel free to create [a new post](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/submit?selftext=true) asking for help with as much details as you can provide.",finance

personalfinance,"Personal finance tips you may not know, including tax hints","A lot of personal finance advice is straightforward applications of math: Keep expenses less than income.  Pay off highest interest rate debts first.  Compound growth is your friend.

Then there are legal requirements and benefits:   Use tax-preferred retirement / HSA accounts.  Keep insurance in force.   Know how self-employment taxes work. 

This post is about less-obvious ways to use existing US laws to your advantage.   (Our friends in other countries are welcome to lobby for local versions *in their associated personal finance subs*.)

Provisions you may not know, though your tax software should be able to help with these if you tell them you qualify:

Taxes / tax planning:

- Take advantage of ""[adjustments](https://smartasset.com/taxes/tax-breaks-you-can-claim-without-itemizing)"" like IRA/HSA contributions,  student loan interest,  self-employment taxes/health insurance paid, etc., to reduce taxable income if you are eligible.  You can take these even if you do not   itemize.   There is a special $300 charitable contribution adjustment for non-itemizers for the 2020 tax year. 

- If you are not a full-time student and earn less than 33K single / 66k jointly, you can use the [Saver's Credit](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit) to get a tax credit (better than a deduction!) for a portion of your IRA or 401k contributions, even for Roth contributions.  You can even deduct a contribution to get your income to qualify.  

- if you are a full-time student, you can take advantage of tax breaks such as the [American Opportunity Tax Credit](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/aotc) if you meet the requirements.  Note also that scholarship money for tuition is not taxable income.  

- If you have children who will be full-time students in the future, you can often get a current break on state taxes with a [529 plan](https://www.savingforcollege.com/intro-to-529s/what-is-a-529-plan).  Growth on this money is untaxed if used for educational expenses, but taxed and penalized if used for something else.  

- Gifts and inheritances are generally not taxable to the recipient, even if over $15,000.  Other untaxed ""income"" includes most insurance payouts and damage awards; child support;   rebates and credit card spending bonuses.  Remember that loans are not income, though forgiven loans typically are.  

- You don't owe any [capital gains taxes](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-are-capital-gains-taxed)  on appreciated investments until you realize them by selling.  If you do have a taxable gain, you can't eliminate it just by buying something else.  You can deduct same-year realized losses from realized gains.  If you have more losses than gains, you can deduct $3000/year from other income and keep taking that loss against gains in future years until it is used up.  

- You pay [no federal income taxes at all on long-term capital gains](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-use-the-zero-percent-tax-rate-on-capital-gains-2388995) if your taxable income (including those gains) is less than the top of the 12% tax bracket.  That could be $105,000 gross income for a married couple filing jointly, $52,000 single.  You can can do this at any age, unless you are someone's dependent.

- Sales of a personal residence often have [no capital gains tax](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/capitalgainhomesale.asp) as well.  You have to have lived in the house as your primary residence two of the past five years; you get $250,000 per sale ($500,000 for a married couple).   This is often enough to make selling a house better financially than keeping it to rent. 

- If you rent a room in your house, part of all of your housing expenses (including insurance and utilities) [can be Schedule E expense deductions against your rental income](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-out-room-your-house.html) (but you need to declare the rental income.)  You don't have taxable income / deductions if your roommates who share the lease give you money to send to your  landlord.  

- You might get a 1099K for things you sold online; this is not necessarily taxable income to you, since you can reduce that income by the cost of the items you sold.  If you received a 1099K reporting income that wasn't really yours , e.g. for selling something on behalf of someone else, use a [nominee distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nominee-distribution.asp) declaration to avoid being taxed on it.

- If your spouse owes money to the federal government from before you were married, use an [injured spouse](https://www.irs.gov/irm/part25/irm_25-018-005.html) form to keep the IRS from withholding your share of a joint tax refund.  This is different than an [innocent spouse](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc205.html) situation, where your spouse tried to evade taxes without your knowledge.

Retirement:

- Think you make too much money to contribute to  a Roth IRA?  Think again!  The [Backdoor Roth IRA](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/backdoor-roth-ira-high-income-how-to-guide/) may work for you.  There's even a [mega-backdoor Roth](http://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/) for high-income people with certain 401k plans.

- Always take the 401k match if you have it.  Employer contributions to your 401k [don't count](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112315/how-401k-matching-works.asp) against the 19.5k limit.  

- If you change you mind about making an IRA contribution, e.g. your income becomes too high for it to be deductible  / allowable, or you just contributed too much, you can [remove the money](https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/excess-contribution) or recharacterize / convert the money to another type of IRA before the tax filing deadline without penalty.

- Self-employed people have [lots of options](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people) for retirement accounts, including a solo-401k and a SEP IRA.  This can apply even if you have employment retirement savings.  The solo-401k allows more contributions but has to be set up in advance. 

Health insurance:

- If you change jobs and don't have insurance coverage for a time, you have 60 days to elect continuing (COBRA) coverage, during which time you are eligible to be covered even if you haven't and won't pay for it.  [This works retroactively](http://www.mymoneyblog.com/cobra-and-retroactive-health-insurance-coverage.html); you can decide to take COBRA at day 59 if you do have major expenses, pay for it, and be covered for the previous 59 days.  

- You have to have an [HSA-eligible HDHP](https://www.peoplekeep.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-your-high-deductible-health-plan-is-hsa-qualified) to contribute to an HSA.  You can keep prior contributions even after you give up an HDHP, you just can't contribute more to it.  If you change plans mid-year, it might change how much you can contribute to your HSA that year.  

- The penalty for lack of health care coverage is gone at the federal level, but check if your state has a penalty now.  There are five states including California with a penalty, as well as DC.",finance

stocks,Trillions to be added to SLR Calculation on March.31st: Bullish or Bearish?,"I'm no expert, but shouldn't any large changes to the supplemental leverage ratio be viewed as a negative catalyst for the stock market?

Risky Finance took note of this back in November, writing that regulatory capital had been decreased by as much as $3 trillion for the 6 largest banks due to the feds forbearance measures in response to the virus outbreak..

&gt;**“The biggest forbearance measure was a move by the Fed in May to exclude treasury bonds and** **central bank** **deposits from the leverage exposure measure. That wiped $2 trillion off the** **SLR** **denominator, including $619 billion at JP Morgan alone.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;**""Just one of the regulatory changes implemented by the fed in the response to the economic shutdowns would have reduced the denominator (total assets) for calculating the** **SLR** **by $3 trillion for the 6 largest banks (regulatory balance sheets)...""**  
&gt;  
&gt;**""...without three critical forbearance measures, some banks such as** **Citigroup** **or Goldman Sachs would have been just 30 basis points away from the minimum, which would prompted the Fed to restrict their trading and lending activity.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.philstockworld.com/2020/11/05/how-covid-forbearance-gave-banks-a-three-trillion-dollar-boost/](https://www.philstockworld.com/2020/11/05/how-covid-forbearance-gave-banks-a-three-trillion-dollar-boost/)

To calculate the SLR , just divide the Tier 1 Capital by a bank’s assets.

**Tier 1 Capital = reserves, common equity, plus retained earnings and certain instruments with discretionary dividends and no maturity.**

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-leverage-ratio.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-leverage-ratio.asp)

In the past, when the banking industry was much more competitive, it was common for banks to market themselves on their surplus (reserve) in order to attract new customers.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1823156?seq=1#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1823156?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

Changes to the leverage ratio can lead to very large increases--or decreases--to a banks’ ability to lend. To put that into perspective, according to Thomas Hoenig, a former Vice Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, if share buybacks of $83 billion, representing 72% of total payouts for the top 10 BHCs in 2017, were instead retained, under current capital rules, **this could have increased small business loans by $750 billion, or mortgage loans by almost $ 1.5 trillion...**

[https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/07/run-dollar-due-panic-or-greed](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/07/run-dollar-due-panic-or-greed)

But how does this affect the stock market, you might be wondering?

Well, if J.P. Morgan is going to be adding roughly $619 billion back to the assets used for calculating this leverage ratio, it should theoretically reduce the amount of credit that will be available for investors to speculate. This, of course, would not be a good thing..

[Nick Panigirtzoglou](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nick+Panigirtzoglou&amp;rlz=1C1NHXL_enCA704CA705&amp;oq=Nick+Panigirtzoglou&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), a top analyst at JPM, seemed to support this idea back in November when he argued that lockdowns could actually become a bullish signal because they would increase the likelihood of more quantitative easing from the fed.

&gt;**""Although it has had a negative impact in the short term, the reemergence of lockdowns and resultant growth weakness could bolster the above equity upside over the medium to longer term via inducing more QE and thus more liquidity creation.""**  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.nxtmine.com/in-moment-of-brutal-honesty-jpmorgan-says-economic-disaster-and-more-lockdowns-will-be-great-for-stocks/](https://www.nxtmine.com/in-moment-of-brutal-honesty-jpmorgan-says-economic-disaster-and-more-lockdowns-will-be-great-for-stocks/)

If a top analyst at America's largest bank believes that quantitative easing is more important to the stock market than real tangible business activity--even during worldwide pandemic related economic lockdowns--than it only makes sense to assume that any kind of drastic changes to the SLR should also have some kind of impact on equity markets as well.

**May 15, 2020,** **Federal Reserve** **Press Release**

&gt;""For purposes of reporting the supplementary leverage ratio as of June 30, 2020, an electing depository institution may reflect the exclusion of Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from total leverage exposure as if this interim final rule had been in effect for the entire second quarter of 2020. Because the supplementary leverage ratio is calculated as an average over the quarter, this will have the effect of maximizing the effect of the exclusion starting in the second quarter of 2020.

personalfinance,Interest rate arbitrage - should I borrow as much as I can on my mortgage?,"I respect the down-to-earth and practical advice of this community, so I was hoping to get your thoughts on something that has been on my mind. 

I'm 32 and my wife is 30. I work in tech and my wife is a second-year resident. We are fortunate and are without any debt. We cash flowed my wife's medical degree and have been living well below our means for a long time--much in part thanks to the advice here.

We haven't purchased a home yet because we haven't lived long enough in one place for it to have made sense. 1 year here, 3 years there, another 1 year over here. 

But we have saved up a significant downpayment (or potential cash purchase depending on the market) for a home, however, I've come to learn about a ""physician loan.""

We qualify for these thanks to my wife's degree. It allows us to borrow at jumbo loan rates with only 5% (sometimes zero 0%) down and with no PMI.

Depending on where we move to after my wife's residency, making monthly payments on a 0% down loan shouldn't be an issue.

So are we better off putting as much down on the home as possible, or taking advantage of the doctor loan and putting our money to work over a 15-30 year period? Is the right answer somewhere in the middle? Thanks in advance for the help.",finance

Is there anything I can do to correct my taxes and still get this credit? Or is it already too late since I got the check/he claimed me as a dependent?

stocks,All you need to know about JNJ’s vaccine,"While you were debating blueberry smoothie vs. greasy b/e/c on Saturday, the FDA authorized Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine for emergency use. 

Game = changed. The federal government expects to distribute 100 million doses of the J&amp;J vaccine by the end of June, starting with 4 million this week. On top of the doses provided by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, that means a vaccine will be available to every American adult who wants one by the end of July. 

J&amp;J’s vaccine is only one dose and can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, so it’s ideal for use at drive-thru vaccination sites and with “transient population groups,” such as those on college campuses. 
It’s the Covid era, so you know there’s a “but.” The US is still dealing with new Covid-19 variants, particularly B1351, and the decline in case numbers looks like it’s plateaued. Plus, the J&amp;J vaccine’s effectiveness rate is a bit lower than the other two, so public health authorities are worried about people dismissing it as a second-rate option. 

Bottom line: The vaccine works really well and health leaders encourage everyone who’s eligible to get it.

My husband and I are both very young (19 and 21). I will use the crappy acronym DH to refer to him for the rest of the post. DH has his associates, and was going to be getting a bachelor's in web design. The semester that he finished his AS last year and was trying to sign up for his next classes, he couldn't find them. He then found out that the university he went to literally poofed the program for rework.

We live in Utah, btw. Weber State still has the program, but we currently live in Cache, and after unsuccessfully trying to get me back in college for 2 years (I graduated at 16), when I got into Weber, we decided to just put me through for a bit since generals are mostly online, especially right now. He got a job with the USPS in order to support me going through college, and then the logic was that when I got my teaching certificate I could turn around and do the same since the positions make about the same amount of money (at minimum I should make $50k a year). 

Unfortunately he is an extremely good worker and has been taken advantage of, and the USPS is starting to damage his physical health. Among other things he has lost an incredible amount of weight and can't seem to put any back on. So we are trying to get him out. At this point going from one crappy job to another is pointless so we want to get him into his actual career field if he goes anywhere else. 

Which brings us to our issue. He programmed in high school and his original college major was CS so he knows how to code and has some experience in languages but not enough for a piece of paper that says he knows it. That piece of paper is pretty important nowadays as I'm pretty sure you all know, especially in Silicone Slopes. At this point even an 18 month course at a tech school would be great so he could get a certification and qualify for an entry level something somewhere that won't kill him but will still pay our bills. 

But since he works USPS unless the classes are at night or online we're kind of out of luck until I finish college which is a hot second away. I've been looking for night classes for him and struggling. It's hard to tell what online stuff is legit. I don't know if a universities do fully online web design or cyber security degrees.

CryptoCurrency,ECB seeks to ban interest-generating crypto assets,"In an [opinion of the ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/en_con_2021_4_f_sign~ae64135b95..pdf) (pdf) dated 19 February they seek to prohibit the payment of interest on crypto assets. This is an opinion at this stage, but certainly ECB is listened to closely by regulators.

If this would become regulation, it would hamstring DeFi usage in the euro area, and drive away financial innovation to less restrictive regions and countries. It would certainly have much wider implications than mere DeFi, and it is likely similar regulation is being draft in G7 countries given their recent posturing.

It should be noted that ECB's CBDC (digital euro) which they sought feedback on from euro area citizens a few months back would most certainly be excluded from this restriction, thus monopolizing interest-generating monetary instruments in the area into the hands of ECB.

Section 2.1.1 is crucial here (emphasis mine)

&gt;Unlike the case of crypto-assets exclusively used either as a means of payment or as a store of value,  the  monetary  policy  transmission  implications  of  crypto-assets  that  fulfil  both  of  these functions could be significant. In this respect, the ECB notes the **prohibition on payment of interest on  crypto-assets**  stipulated  in  the  proposed  regulation 13  in  line  with  the  regulation  of  other instruments mainly used as a means of payment, such as e-money. In this context, this prohibition might make the relative attractiveness of e-money tokens and asset reference tokens from the perspective of the holder dependent on the interest rate environment. The possibility cannot be entirely  excluded  that  this  could  potentially  create  inflows  and  outflows  when  the  interest  rate environment  changes  significantly,  which  could  have  implications  for  financial  stability  and monetary policy transmission.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I leverage my house and invest it for a down payment on our next house? (USA),"So my wife and I lucked out about five years ago into a great deal on a house in an absolutely red-hot housing market. It's a multi-family home and we rent the upstairs and live in the downstairs.

The house is quite small and since we bought it we've had a child. We know we want to upgrade to a larger home in the next five years but building up the down payment on a larger house in our area is daunting. What we want is going to be in the $300k range, so we're looking at around $60k for a down payment. 

Since we got such an insane deal on our house right now we owe only about 180k on a house that we could reasonably sell for $350k. We also pay our entire mortgage from the rental income to this house.

Should we refinance our mortgage and leverage the house (maybe get a $200-220k mortgage)? We could get our interest rate down a hair so we'd probably only raise our mortgage payment by a little bit, and we could make up by raising our rent a bit in the apartment (we currently rent a decent bit below market so we can have the power to be picky about renters). 

My thought would be to take that extra $~30k and invest it in something relatively safe and get a 6-7% growth on it for the next five or so years. It would get us quite a ways to a down payment on our next house, and we could then transition our current home to al all rental property to offset the second mortgage.

TL;DR - We have probably about $100-$150k USD equity in our home, which we rent part of. Should we leverage that home and invest the money to seed the down payment on our next home so we can turn our current home into a full rental property?",finance

Paid off home mortgage early in 2005.  Haven't had a credit card in years. Paid cash for a new Toyota Highlander in 2006 and a new Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2019.  Interest rates were higher back then.  The Jeep was an impulse buy from my spouse while I was out of town, but that's a post for r/wivesarecrazysometimes.

However, as I suspected our bank basically says we have zero credit line and the best they could offer was a 5.25% loan.  I suspect we would have the same problem financing through Tesla.  

I realize we would still be better off borrowing at the higher rate and investing the money instead, but it still galls paying that high a loan rate.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin: A Libertarian's Nightmare,"I am considering investing corporate cash into Bitcoin; however, thinking about a Bitcoin future has actually kept me up at night.  I'd like an expert to dispel my concerns.

First, I think Bitcoin's value is derived from the benefits it can bring to individuals and businesses if it is able to realize its potential as a transactional currency. I understand right now that people view it as a crypto asset or store of value, but I think that definitely puts an upper limit on its value on the long-term. I don't think it should be valued close to gold as gold has many unique properties and is used in many industrial applications. It's beautiful to look at and has always held a special allure to humans. Most societies across continents with no contact for thousands of years developed an affinity for gold. I think it's lower value is sustained by black market activities(for the time being).

I think it's real benefits are not to individuals in developed nations (with the exception as a potential, but speculative hedge against inflation), but rather to businesses.  Individuals today can already make instant payments, store their money in bank accounts with close to no fees, use credit cards and get significant rewards if you're smart about it. It's really corporations who end up paying the highest fees to banks and financial intermediaries. These fees are essentially passed down to us as consumers. Think of merchant processing fees (fees to accept credit cards) these are typically some of the largest line item costs for retailers. Unlike individuals, corporations typically have to pay fees to open accounts, to maintain accounts, they pay fees for all payments and receipts, for generating reports, for integration with their ERP systems, to make foreign currency transfers, and more. It can take months to open foreign accounts due to KYC requirements. Sending cross-border foreign currency payments, are costly due to intermediary banks that sending banks use, it can take days and sometimes weeks due to sanctions screening of payments, and any errors take a long time to fix. While there are schemes to limit help some of these payments in regions like the SEPA scheme in Europe, cross-border banking is very costly and time consuming. \[EDIT: while I was writing this, Citi's in-house think-tank came out with a though piece saying that Bitcoin could be the currency of international trade in 7 years. If anyone has access to this document, please provide a link.\]

I think this is where Bitcoin's real value comes from. It can cut out all this waste and of course you have all the ancillary benefits to individuals. This and only this way is how someone could make an argument that Bitcoin could actually go to $1 million per coin. This means however that the US dollar which has traditionally been the transactional currency would lose its global hegemony. This would be disastrous for the United States. The US dollar's hegemony has allowed the US Government to continue to print money, raise debt, and fund it's deficit spending. If Bitcoin was adopted as the currency of international trade, you'd see much smaller demand for USD and USD assets like treasuries. This would mean that interest expense on US debt would skyrocket and the US would not be able to continue funding its deficits. We are running multi trillion dollar and we would have to cut back massively transfer of wealth schemes like social security, Medicare, federal unemployment and welfare, as well as general government spending on the military. For any Libertarians still reading this, you're probably thinking, ok where is the bad news? While you might think this is better for society in the long-term, you can't deny that huge human cost this would have while in transition. This would likely be much worse than the Great Depression at least in the US, but would likely reverberate around the world. It would likely be the US' most vulnerable populations that would suffer the most. I also don't know how smart is it to be limiting our military while China, which has showed little care for human right's, is becoming increasingly aggressive and spending more on their military. 

I see the US Government doing everything in its power to stop this from happening. Let's not kid ourselves, while the US Government can't get rid of Bitcoin, by using penalties and jailtime they could make the risks for the vast majority or individuals and businesses to hold Bitcoin far too high to make any economic sense. This of course would crush the value of Bitcoin. I don't see any Bitcoin zealots on these forums talking about these points. I think they just all want rosy discussions that prop up the value of Bitcoin. ZeroHedge recently put out a good article about what the government could do to limit Bitcoin. It's interesting that Gary Gensler has recently been appointed to lead the SEC. He taught a 25+ hour Bitcoin course to MIT nerds so he knows his stuff and claimed himself to be a center-minimalist on Bitcoin. He said that if Bitcoin grows to 5, 10, 20x it's value that's when we should start considering regulation. That was when Bitcoin had a market capitalization of \~$250 billion.

For the sake of argument though, let's ignore all the potential road blocks for Bitcoin becoming the international currency of trade and say it happens. Let's also say it becomes the currency for most individuals around the world. My understanding of the long-term goal for core developers is to eventually make Bitcoin much more feasible for everyday transactions between customers and businesses. We already have the Lightning Network which makes this feasible and I think solutions will continue to be made to make it easier for everyday consumers.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the strategy now is to keep the transaction fees relatively high so that it continues to attract significant mining capacity. As the Network continues to grow and maintain it's #1 status, its security also grows which will make and has made it the #1 Cyrpto for corporations. Once, there's greater adoption, that's when the core developers will make it more feasible for consumers. As I mentioned before, it already is much more feasible for corporations given the much higher fees related to the traditional banking system. The main issues are just acceptance and volatility.

Getting to my final point, if Bitcoin does become the global currency and does rise to $1 million per Bitcoin, KYC is not going away. Everyone will likely have to register their wallet with the IRS, Treasury, or their respective counterparts in other countries and every payment will be tracked. Who knows who the governing bodies of the world will be, but they will be able to literally ban people completely from the financial system. If your wallet ID does not come back as approved, you won't be able to transact. People will literally have to go back to physical forms of currency by trading goods or precious metals to survive if they are banned from the system. We will be living in a society likely ravaged by the Great Depression 2.0 because of the massive pull-back in spending required by the US Government as investors stop buying US Debt. Further, today when you have money sitting in your bank account, financial institutions, are able to put it to good use by lending it to other businesses. Lending is like air to many economies. While people will still be able to send their Bitcoin to financial intermediaries for lending purposes, the lack of available capital will further reduce the economy. The more I think about it, I don't want to live in a future where Bitcoin wins. It seems horrible and filled with misery.

personalfinance,House offer accepted. How do I shop for rates?,"My wife and I just got our offer on a house accepted.

I asked the current lender about closing costs and he gave me an estimate of about $12,000 but didn't give me a specific breakdown. Is that usual? Do I just provide the above information to other potential lenders and see if they can come back with something better? Should I be worried about closing costs being inflated? We have a quick closing of escrow, so I want to get locked in within the next day or two with a lender. Thank you for any advice.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 1 , 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 1, 2021**

Stocks staged a remarkable rally Monday as the market celebrated another effective coronavirus vaccine and Treasury yields stabilized. Each of the major indexes gained more than 2% today after suffering one of the worst weeks since October. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete \[economic\] recovery.” Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell’s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. 

Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March.

In Washington DC, over the weekend, the House of Representatives advanced the $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package without any Republican support. The bill includes an additional payment of $1,400 to Americans, $400 per week in augmented Federal unemployment benefits, and $350 billion in State, local, and tribal aid. The bill now heads to the Senate, with lawmakers aiming to pass the bill before the mid-March deadline when current Federal unemployment benefits are set to expire. 

The Democrats are employing a process called reconciliation in order to get the stimulus bill passed without Republican support. Through reconciliation, Congress can enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with only a majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. As a reminder, there is a 50/50 split in the Senate, but Kamala Harris, as the Democratic Vice-President, has the power to break a tie.

My parent’s accountant claimed me as a dependent as usual, so I couldn’t claim myself and take advantage of the recovery rebate credit. A bunch of my peers did claim themselves, saying their parents only get $500 for claiming them and they’d just pay them the difference. 

My parent’s accountant told them they’d be losing out on $4400 and I’d get $3200 (don’t know where he came up with this number from).

My understanding of federal taxes for 2020 was that adult dependents are only a $500 credit from what I read online, so I’m confused. Can’t speak with the accountant directly because he won’t discuss their return with me.

investing,"Near-term investing thoughts: No recession this year, but perhaps a ""Black Monday""","There appear to be two schools of wildly-diverging thought among investors right now, and I've been thinking how to bridge the two camps, since I can't imagine them being *both* so incredibly wrong given the amount of money on the line.

On the pessimists side are numerous successful investors (Ray Dalio, Jeremy Grantham, Charlie Munger, Michael Burry) who believe stocks are in a massive bubble.  The [Buffett Indicator](https://i.imgur.com/caRQtOq.png) and [Shiller PE](https://i.imgur.com/YB3MCn8.png) both say the stock market is highly overvalued.   Even though I likewise believe we're in a massive bubble, those indicators give little information about timing, and they could conceivably keep inflating for some time.

On the optimists side is the bond market, where the [yield curve is normal](https://i.imgur.com/LG1dLuf.png) and not inverted, and showing signs of modest short-term inflation.  With the Fed's foot firmly on the gas pedal and with a massive fiscal stimulus working its way through Congress, the odds of a recession related to the business-cycle or Fed overtightening this year is basically zero, though some shock like war or natural disaster could come out of left field.

But we've seen instances where the stock market crashed even when the real economy kept on growing.  The best example in my lifetime is the [""Black Monday"" crash of October 19, 1987](https://i.imgur.com/auZia85.png).   The S&amp;P 500 dropped 20% in a day, but the real underlying economy (as measured by GDP) kept chugging right along.

My suspicion is that something similar to a ""Black Monday"" will play out this year.   The stock market, or at least the overvalued sectors of it, will crash and wipe out a lot of paper wealth, but the underlying economy will keep strengthening in the short term.   

In the long-term I suspect we'll have a massive crash once fiscal stimulus tapers off, or we'll admit that the US economy is ""going Japanese"" and continue passing repeated fiscal stimulus as long as that's viable.

personalfinance,Best way to navigate my way through student loan debt/buying house/investing with new income,"My wife finished grad school and landed a solid job and now we are both set into our careers. Grad school loans total $135,000 which are all federal loans at an avg of \~ 7% interest but currently on hold til end of Sept. When that time comes, the original plan was to pay down on it entirely or at least a big chunk and refinance the rest. However I am trying to consider if there is a better strategy to go about it in terms of purchasing a home/investing some. We've been pedal to the metal, all in saving to get rid of this debt.

Currently we have $75,000 in the bank. Both cars are paid for so the only major expense is rent. We have been saving an average of $8,000-$9,000 a month, so barring any emergency expenses will be on pace to have about $130,000 +/- saved by the time the student loan interest kicks in again.

Where we live, a reasonable house in a decent area will cost about $650-800k, so were looking at 130-160k before being able to make a 20% down payment. Any suggestions on the best strategy to go about saving for a house with this? Should we just go all in and get rid of that debt then start from 0 again for a house down payment? Pay down lets say 80-90, carry the rest after refinancing to a lower rate and hold on to a chunk to get a jump start on the house down payment? Thanks in advance for your input.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

{[One](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/lv0rnf/eurusd_to_all_time_high/)}

Added analysis and answers to comments/questions in post one.

&amp;#x200B;

**There's no support yet. Why would anyone buy?**

This can be disputed depending upon what timeframe you're looking at. my post references a swing of 3,000 pips to retest the high and then if there is a breakout a rise of 1,000s of pips more. It's based on the weekly chart. The first signs of support have been long established.

 

https://preview.redd.it/3sqnon5p8ik61.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be5306f73c7a6cca9ba39b497a21823709425bbe

 

Support hit in 2014. Confirmation of the support being strong through 2014 - 2016 and first sign of big buying activity in 2017. Into 2020 we made the double bottom. The rally we've seen since then can be classed as confirmative, if anything ever truly does give confirmation.

To those of you who may not have been trading in 2014, when the EURUSD hit that support level it was *a big deal.* EURUSD had been falling for months. All the rallies it had very quickly put back into new lows and the bear rallies were really strong when heading into new lows. These conditions had been going on in EURUSD for many weekly solidly (And in other USD crosses). When EURUSD hit that level the price swing that followed was about 400 pips right up. I can't remember how long that took, but it was minutes. I think there might have been a FOMC at the time. Long story short, when EURUSD hit that level a very bullish signal was generated intraday.

On timeframes I am using EURUSD is uptrending. It's been the fledgling stages of this uptrend for seven years. The recent bearish trends down on the small timeframes may be nothing more than this.

https://preview.redd.it/mrxuyp5s8ik61.png?width=1353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=413f7baf261ff5453135a03c6de63033f98ebf52

 

And why'd I not want to buy into the low of that?

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's some trendlines I drew and this means the one you drew does not matter.**

Here are some trendlines someone posted.

https://preview.redd.it/a16b6gtu8ik61.png?width=1891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d75079d659b59671e94610315b267ced08903e33

 

Let me run through some criteria I use for choosing trendline signals to take and ignore.

&amp;#x200B;

**Angle** \- A correction to a trending move will usually have a trendline with an angle somewhere within the 32 - 48 degrees range. This is due to the way the first part of the correction is fast but then over a while it draws itself out before eventually flatting at the low. Trendlines with more of an angle that this are usually showing the current leg to be trending. The breaks of them more usually retracements that reversals. So remove all the ones with the trendlines that are too steep an angle. These did what they should do, had retracements and then new lows as the short term trend continued.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/due36xwx8ik61.png?width=1358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17b7d488f33ee3f729436ee2fdf23cffcfe5f7b7

 

**Starting point:** I am looking for trendlines starting from the high of the move because I am looking for signs of the big move reversing. I don't randomly start my trendlines anywhere that is not the high. So remove all the ones that start at random places where any sort of high point is. I'm looking for *the* high.

Once you've removed the invalid ones, there is one trendline.

 

https://preview.redd.it/96sk7em09ik61.png?width=1360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb5a0cd1b7d239ae5dc5c2f507071236c13ce55

 

There are four touches of the trendline over 15 years. All of them send it into an bear market. Until recently all of them sent EURUSD to a new low. But then there was the double bottom and now that trendline has broken. For 15 years sellers have come in on that line and now they have not. Lower lows have failed and the first higher high ,may be coming soon.

On a breaking of a trendline the pattern we always want to be looking for is a cup and handle pattern.

https://preview.redd.it/dzhzxoo29ik61.png?width=1751&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee9adfc379e68485b46d9c330ee4c7989c4ba305

 

From as far back as 2014 this could have been on the watchlist but only in 2017 did we get the rally that start the formation of this pattern.

The following years brought the handle.

https://preview.redd.it/eohrh9k49ik61.png?width=1369&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af437a0820faff79f10a58d9ea9ef3586e68cea4

 

And now we are getting close to the breakout point that would confirm the cup and handle breakout pattern. That could be the beginning of a strong trend to retest the highs and even drive EURUSD into all time highs. We're probably talking a timeframe of multiple years but if the rally begins and the high breaks I think we can see EURUSD running at over 2.00.

The Euro up trend could be even bigger. If the first rally of the Euro from its inception gives any indicator of how big a second rally would be, we could see EURUSD over 3.00. This would seem like a very strong shift for the dollar but I do think we'd probably be a few years away from seeing Euro being double the dollar. My trade plan for now does not extend beyond trading for a retest of the high.

**Did you get stopped out / why do you use tight stops on a 3,000 pip target**

Yes. I was stopped out my first trades. I hit stops on some of my trades. Others I sold shorts against them to flatten my position when price broke a support level and I then traded out my longs and shorts for a slightly reduced net loss while price was retracing. I am still floating one short trade (0.2 lots) and I have closed my long trades.

Here are my losing trades.

https://preview.redd.it/uk5cdvn69ik61.png?width=1426&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0daf4b7970fd2f7297c6b49cef561c3c1c1420f6

 

I will be buying back in at 1.08 to - 1.088 and if that level breaks my next buy will be 1.06.

I use small stops because I've never went broke sitting out of a market. I can not say the same for letting a loss run. I know if I set a 200 pip stop when we get close it's easy to convince myself to add on 20 pips, it's only another 10%. All these 10%'s add up and when I worked that bit out, I adjusted my risk management style to turn that in my favour, saving myself a little bit of loss on each trade that does not work out.

My stop loss on this trade in the sense of a level I will no longer want to keep trying to buy is 1.028. I've watched that hold for seven years. If it broke that'd make me really bearish on EURUSD.

my intention at this point is to ready myself for if there is a short term higher high made and that then becomes a rally of this magnitude.

personalfinance,Advice on If I should keep paying CC or Take out personal loan to consolidate debt,"Ran into some unfortunate external issue after graduating and was unemployed for a while, used CC to get by and make minimum payments (never missed those).

Total Debt 30k with 80% utilization 

My question to you knowledgeable ppl is that, 

Should I pay credit cards down based on high interest rate? (I can make 3k payment per month on a single card after making minimum on everything else, and my monthly expenses, this will keep my savings at $0) 

Or 

Should I get a personal loan which will allow me to have a lower monthly payment and save those 3k, I can pay off the loan faster than the term while saving money as well, paying less in interest.

CryptoCurrency,HODL 2020 Tax Questions - What will you do?,"I know people have posted about this before, but the IRS did update its instructions for the virtual currency question on the first page of the 1040, and I don't know if this makes things more confusing or not. The question being asked is this: *""At any time during 2020, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?""*

To be clear, I'm **only asking about the situation where someone bought crypto and then HODL'd** (no selling, trading, earning, etc - just straight up buy and HODL).

&amp;#x200B;

On Dec 31st, the IRS released a set of draft instructions stating a ""purchase"" of a crypto means you need to answer yes. But then a week later, they released the final instructions and omitted the ""purchase"" example, but left the front page question in there.

[https://www.currentfederaltaxdevelopments.com/blog/2021/2/6/irs-revises-instructions-to-virtual-currency-question-but-not-actual-question-creating-uncertainty-on-what-answer-is-appropriate-in-some-cases](https://www.currentfederaltaxdevelopments.com/blog/2021/2/6/irs-revises-instructions-to-virtual-currency-question-but-not-actual-question-creating-uncertainty-on-what-answer-is-appropriate-in-some-cases)

In this article it states:

&gt;In an article published in the February 8, 2021 issue of *Tax Notes Today Federal*, an IRS spokesperson is quoted as saying that “\[i\]f the only activity someone has is a purchase/acquire and hold, then they don’t have to check the box.”[\[4\]](https://www.currentfederaltaxdevelopments.com/blog/2021/2/6/irs-revises-instructions-to-virtual-currency-question-but-not-actual-question-creating-uncertainty-on-what-answer-is-appropriate-in-some-cases#_ftn4)

From everything I've read, it seems like the whole thing is being left up to interpretation (which is ridiculous when it comes to taxes). On one hand, someone could answer ""no"", knowing they only bought and HODL'd and therefore there is no taxable transaction that needs to be claimed. On the other hand, someone could answer ""yes"" because they did acquire financial interest in a virtual currency and then just not report a taxable transaction on their taxes.

Saying ""no"" when you did buy and HODL could lead to audit trouble in the future, but claiming yes when all you did was buy and HODL could put a target on you. Then again, maybe if a ton of people say ""yes"" it might lead to the government taking it more seriously (for better or for worse).

Curious to see what this community thinks. **Again, this is only for those people who only bought and HODL'd.**

*Edit: By no means am I suggesting people evade taxes or lie in any way on their taxes. This is clearly a confusing tax question that doesn't seem to have a clear answer (even among employees of the IRS), and I am opening it up for discussion/interpretation.*

Edit 3/4/21: they have formally clarified the answer should be no. https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions

stocks,"Market Commentary (Rates soar, growth stocks selloff, and how to position yourself in this environment) - 2/28/2021","Hello investors,

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I wanted to talk about the recent market actions.

I think it's imperative to assess the current market environment given not only the magnitude of the changes in the rates markets but also the speed at which it happened.

If this were the sort of correction that occurred in September 2020, I wouldn't reassess at all because that was simply a large whale in the market coming in and driving up the prices and eventually the market corrected itself. Not much movement in yields or other markets.

This time is a bit different as yields have moved significantly, which has a significant impact on not only risk assets (stocks particularly) but also fiscal and monetary policies.

If you recall from the recent market commentaries (see below), I mentioned that in the short to intermediate-term, risk assets are driven by fiscal and monetary policies.

Dramatic changes in interest rates can impact the policies so it is time to reassess where we are.

I typically take four steps to pick out the securities I want to trade and these steps include macroeconomics, technicals, and fundamental analyses. As I've repeatedly said before, the name of the game is piecing together different pieces of puzzles to create a whole picture. You can't just ignore what's happening at the White House when picking out securities.

**That leads me to make one additional comment, the memos in this subreddit are only for those ""actively buying and selling securities"", not for those buy and hold (""BH"") group.**

Don't get me wrong, I am a huge believer in BH strategy. In fact, I suggest you read Warren Buffett's annual letters which went out this past week.

Yes you get to spend less time on markets, pay little taxes, and grow your wealth with discipline.

I have a friend who is an ardent BH person and he keeps trying to convince people ""just buy and hold Disney and Amazon for 20 years!"" Everyone knows that BH is a good path to wealth creation. Don't need to reiterate that or even try to convince people to do that.

I actually do BH on half of my portfolio and actively trade on the other half.

My point is if you are a huge BH believer and don't want to actively trade, please stop trying to convince me or others to do it. We all know it is a good strategy and this is a game against yourself.

Enough with the intro, here are the main topics for today's memo.

4 steps I take to determine what to trade.

1. Determine where we are in the market cycle
2. Decide how we should position ourselves
3. Select which securities will give you the highest return for a unit of risk
4. Allocate appropriate weights

These steps are not mine but a mixture of what I was recommended to do by my mentors, bosses, and other resources.

This accomplishes a few things:- It forces you to step back and see the bigger picture.

\- It allows you to be more objective.

\- It allows you to assess your performance.

**1) Determine where we are in the market cycle**

How is the current market environment? Bullish or bearish? Euphoric or panicky? What changed?

Well, let's look at a few charts to see what's changed.

Equity markets

S&amp;P futures

📷

Nasdaq futures

📷

We are just starting to test the 50D MA for the S&amp;P and have already broken 50D MA for the Nasdaq. It's hard to make any conclusions from these so we move on.

Bond markets

10-year yield

📷

10-year rose almost 100 bps from the lows in August 2020. This is attributable to economic recovery, inflation expectations, and Georgia run-offs.

What's more fascinating is how much the yield curve bear steepened since the peak of the pandemic.

This was what the majority of the market participants were expecting throughout 2020 and post-election but I was very off on the timing of the events. The majority of the steepening happened towards late 2020 and early 2021.

This is an expected development as the economy recovers, inflation expectations soar and treasury market is flooded with new issues.

Below is what's making me more concerned.

📷

The MOVE index is basically the VIX for bond markets. The higher the index the higher the expected volatility in rates. It's still at relatively low levels but the rate at which it is skyrocketing is certainly disturbing.

Why is this all happening?

From what I have gathered, it's the Janet Yellen bomb.

On 2/16, Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary, announced her plans to drawdown on TGA (treasury general account, a sort of checking account for the federal government).

📷

What this means is that the Treasury will offload its enormous amount of cash ($1.6 trillion) into the banking system for the banks to be able to perform PPP lending and do all sorts of fiscal policy-related activities in the next 3 months.

The magnitude of this balance is simply enormous. Take a look at the chart below.

📷

We have never ever had TGA balance running above $500 billion and now we have close to 3x that flooding into the banking system.

From another perspective, we have about $3T reserves in the banking system. So that $1.6 trillion adds about 66% over the next few months to the banking system.

This video nicely summarizes what happens in the next few months.

&amp;#x200B;

This provides so much liquidity to the banking system that banks will be buying tons of treasuries, which may push short term rates to the negative territory and experts like the guy in the video anticipate that the Fed may have to actually raise IOER (interest on excess reserves) to prevent rates from falling below zero.

Now, what does all of this mean for the equity markets?

I mentioned before that majority of the bear markets must have some sort of liquidity problems, whether that be short term borrowing rates rising, bid-ask spread widening, or short term rates spread widening.

Right now, there are some signs that the bond markets are volatile but the short term funding rates are so low and so liquid due to the expected TGA drawdown and Fed purchases.

**In conclusion, the way I see it, we are likely still in the recovery phase of the market cycle but we are experiencing intermittent corrections on the way. The Fed has not changed its policy stance, the gov't is continuing to push its stimulus plans, and the markets are flooded with liquidity.**

Yes, higher long-end rates will inevitably bring down the valuations because by definition, higher rates result in higher discount rates and thus lower present value of future cash flows.

Yet, take a look at the chart below published by Bloomberg.

During most of the periods when the 10-year treasury yields rose, S&amp;P rose together. And this makes sense because yields rising indicates that the economy is growing, which translates to bullish equity markets.

**2) Decide how we should position ourselves**

My mentor once told me that you can never guess where the rates or stock price will move, but you can probabilistically bet on those movements.

Let's say you are betting on 10yr treasury futures. Do you think it's more likely to go from 1.4% to 2% by the end of 2021 or 1.4% to 0.8%?

We can never guess where it's going to go but I think we can all agree that it is more likely to move up than down.

Same for stocks. You can never guess where NVDA will go but in the next 2-3 years, it will likely be higher than it is now.

**My point is that we should position ourselves to benefit from a probabilistic standpoint, not predicting rates movement or stock price movements.**

This brings us back to the idea of convexity. As long as we make bets that yield asymmetrical returns, you just need to win half of your bets because on average, you will be up ahead.

Theoretically, out of ten stocks, you only need to win five and those five will asymmetrically outperform your losers. If your losers lose 10% on avg, your winners will win 20% on avg and you end up winning on net.

**Given that it is more likely that we are still in the recovery phase of the market cycle, I believe that we should position ourselves cautiously aggressive.**

I don't believe we are headed for a bear market, yet. We will likely see an intense correction (5-10% drawdown on S&amp;P) but we won't see anything like 25-30% for a bear market period of 8 months.

Therefore, however deep this correction may go (and it may go further), it is a buy-the-dip opportunity.

With that said, don't underestimate how long this potential correction may last. It may last for 1 month, 3 months, or even 10 months. Buy the dip is not as simple as buying when the markets go down but you have to think about your carrying costs if you use options (theta decay) or margin calls.

**Remember, Nasdaq had five +15% corrections on its way to the 2000 top.**

**Therefore, I am buying the dips in small amounts. I would spend 5-10% of your capital on every dip that happens on a daily basis. This way, you get at least 2 weeks worth of time to deploy your capital.**

**3) Select which securities will give you the highest return for a unit of risk**

This really depends on your risk appetite and your views. I will simply share mine in hopes to provide a guide for everyone but it is up to you to do your due diligence and make sure you are comfortable with what you are holding.

At the moment, below are my plays.

Stocks

\- Short-term, leveraged longs (options, margins, etc.): OZON, FUTU, FVRR, FRHC, ENVA, TIGR, OPEN, SKLZ, PDD

\- Long-term, BH longs: TTD, ETSY, NTES, JD, TWLO

Bonds

\- Long 5/30 spread

Commodities

\- Long gold

Currency

\- Bitcoin

**4) Allocate appropriate weights**

Weight allocation is just as important as security selection, as it expresses your conviction and magnitude of expected price moves. Below are my allocations (rough percentages because it's hard to compare futures and shorts in percentage terms).

Stocks (80%)

\- Short-term, leveraged longs (options, margins, etc.): OZON, FUTU, FVRR, FRHC, ENVA, TIGR, OPEN, SKLZ

\- Long-term, BH longs: TTD, PDD, ETSY, NTES, JD, TWLO

Bonds (10%)

\- Long 5/30 spread

Commodities (5%)

\- Long gold

Currency (5%)

\- Bitcoin

**Summary**

Look at the bigger picture, see what's happening across not just equities but other asset classes, and determine where we are in the market cycle.

Be very careful with security selection and do not put all eggs in one.

I am also constantly learning. I had no idea the yield would take this long to break 1.5%. I had no idea gold would underperform. It's a game where you learn constantly and I would also appreciate any critiques on any topic I discuss.

personalfinance,Negotiating $1K/month Student Loan Minimums,"My federal student loans are currently in forbearance. Due to C-19 and personal issues, I haven't been able to make payments during the pandemic. However, now I'd like to start making regular payments. The loans are under my mother's name. She's trying to buy a house and this massive debt ($84000) is hanging over her head. However, I just checked the account and Great Lakes Borrowers is asking for  $932/month as a minimum payment. The estimates for income driven repayment give me an even higher minimum payment of $1300/month. In the past when I've spoken to GLB about refinancing under my name (to at least take the heat off of my mother), they refuse because my income is too low. My mother makes $72,000/year and I make $58,000/year. So I started looking for a new job. I thought if I made more, I could refinance. This was two years ago. My job search has been fruitless and so utterly demoralizing.

I plan to call them tomorrow to try and work something out. I budget to the penny using spreadsheets and there is no way in this plane of existence that I can afford $1,000/month; this is essentially my rent. I have another, smaller loan ($10K) under my name that is also in forbearance due to C-19; the minimum on that one is much more manageable ($100) and before C-19 I made monthly payments of $200. Besides these two loans, I have no other debt. I try to live frugally and my credit score is 750. (I thought if I boosted my credit score, it would help my refinancing application; no dice).

I haven't been on vacation in years. I can't even afford to go to the doctor for a yearly physical because my insurance is dog water. I want to give my mom a chance to finally get a house, but I feel like I'm drowning and taking her with me. Is there any way for me to prepare for tomorrow? At this point, I'm willing to give up a kidney to pay this off.

I'm really sorry for the long rant. I'm just so sad and defeated. 2020 was such a hard year and it feels like 2021 is following in its footsteps. I'm open to all advice.",finance

CryptoCurrency,100% uptime,"On January 3rd, 2009 the first bitcoin block was mined.  11 Years and 2 months Ago.  Since then,  the network has maintained 100% uptime.  This makes bitcoin and other crypto the most stable computer system on earth.  Not only for currency but for the transfer of anything that is digital that needs to be separated in units.  The first message posted when bitcoin was mined ironically was that the banks were on the verge of being bailed out.  Last week, the federal reserves intra-bank transfer system went down.  https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/the-feds-system-that-allows-banks-to-send-money-back-and-forth-is-down.html.  Yet, bitcoin and other crypto currencies have never gone down(as a system, not price).  This is huge.  So what if a transaction takes a couple minutes?  Knowing the system will never go down should bring people more peace knowing that they are using the most reliable currency system ever created(as long as you use it right).  We have all gotten way too caught up in worrying about transfer speed or transfer fees.  The market will sort those things out.  What’s important to realize is we now all have the most reliable transfer system man has ever created, and we all have access to it.  The federal reserve should be jealous.

Edit: I did realize after some comments there was one instance where a rewind happened.  It was before I bought in though.  Minus the one event, it would be 100% uptime.",cryptocurrency

The UAE gave additional help to the Yemeni people. Today UAE committed US$230 million, ahead of the United Nations Pledging Conference co-hosted between the Swiss Confederation and the Kingdom of Sweden. This support is in addition to ongoing bilateral UAE assistance efforts and will help fund international programs that meet the medical, nutritional, and food security needs of the country. It will work with the stakeholders and address the needs as set forward by the UN Humanitarian Response Plan. 

 Since 2015, the UAE has provided more than US$6 billion in assistance to Yemen, which has focused mainly on supporting the humanitarian situation, as well as providing public services to ensure continuity of education in schools, medical programs, and vital services such as energy and transportation. The UAE has also been one of the largest international contributors to Yemen’s COVID-19 response

Forex,The Pound Emerges As A Frontrunner,"The Pound has established the most sustained rally that the currency has seen in 5 years. Optimism for a faster recovery has buoyed Sterling rates as the vaccine rollout has seen 20 million Britons already receiving the vaccine to date. The UK has also seen a second monthly rise in payrolls, as 83,000 new jobs were filled in January 2021. Fears of inflationary pressures were squashed by Bank of England Governor Bailey at The Monetary Policy Report Hearings last week. Despite a rise in household savings during lockdown and a potential for a spike in demand as restrictions are soon lifted, the committee believes the price stability mandate of 2% will remain intact. The positive sentiment also spanned to Europe. The German Ifo Business Climate index reached a peak not seen since last October, as the industrial output continues to support Europe’s largest economy despite confinement measures. 

A moderate upward revision to U.S. GDP estimates was made in the second official release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis last week. Growth for the fourth quarter currently stands at 4.1% as a rise in residential investments and government spending contributed to the revision. The manufacturing sector looks to be a source of strength, once again, during a period of weak growth in the U.S. as investment spending in the first quarter of 2021 has surged. Durable Goods Orders spiked 3.4% in January, representing the ninth consecutive monthly rise. In an address to the Senate Banking Committee last week, Chairman Powell reiterated the Fed’s current monetary policy stance, stating that no changes can be expected until there is “substantial further progress” in economic conditions. 

Japan’s industrial production saw a boost from global demand as major trading partners embark on economic recovery. Output climbed for the first time in three months, reaching 4.2% in January.

Trading,Key Fed Events for March,"There are a few dates to watch in the coming weeks as it relates to bonds, which then have implications for the dollar, gold, stocks, and Bitcoin.

**March 4th:** Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is[ scheduled to give a public talk.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm)

**March 17th:** Fed FOMC meeting, where they may adjust Fed policy.

The main one is whether the Fed will extend a [supplementary leverage ratio](https://www.risk.net/definition/supplementary-leverage-ratio-slr) “SLR” rule change, which was put in place last year during the crisis and is set to expire next month on March 31st. This was a temporary program over the past year to basically allow banks to buy more Treasuries.

In late 2019, the plumbing of the US financial system ran into a bottleneck, resulting in a spike in the overnight lending rate. Basically, there were too many T-bills flooding the system compared to bank reserves. The Fed had to respond by ending its balance sheet reduction and moving to indefinite balance sheet expansion, creating new bank reserves to buy some of the T-bills on an ongoing basis.

And then during the pandemic crisis several months later, with massive Treasury issuance and Fed balance sheet expansion about to happen, the Fed changed the rules for the supplementary leverage ratio so that banks could buy more Treasuries and similar assets. This chart shows US bank holdings of Treasuries:

&amp;#x200B;

With the government passing the $1.9 trillion aid package, that’ll result in a lot of net Treasury security issuance later this year. The foreign sector isn’t buying many Treasuries; they only accumulated about 5% of net Treasuries issued last year. If the SLR rule change expires, banks are limited in how many Treasuries they can hold, so it could be hard to find buyers for all those Treasuries. The Fed is currently buying about $80 billion Treasuries per month, or about $1 trillion expected for the year, which ironically might not be enough compared to the supply.

Our base case is that the Fed will be forced to extend the SLR rules change and/or increase its purchase rate of long-duration Treasuries by the end of the year. March 17th is a decent candidate for an announcement of the SLR rule change extension, but we’ll see.

In other words, buckle up. Bonds, stocks, the dollar, gold, and Bitcoin are all potentially impacted by Fed decisions later this month.",finance

Forex,Currency Primary Sentiment Drivers,"So what are the Primary drivers of the different currency pairs? Below i made a short explanation:

USD

Federal Reserve - The US' monetary policy outlook remains highly influential to USD's fundamental outlook. Policy easing from the FOMC is already at unprecedented levels, and expectations regarding the duration and extent of their emergency measures will continue to influence USD's fundamental outlook. Further and more aggressive easing from the Fed will likely weigh on USD, while expectations for eventual tapering and policy normalisation will likely prove supportive.

Risk Tone - As the world's reserve currency, USD is the most liquid currency in the world, and consequently, the ultimate safe-haven. Although USD does not always exhibit safe haven properties, when markets begin to panic and participants dump almost all other assets to rush into cash, USD becomes the safe haven of choice.

EUR

European Central Bank - Europe's monetary policy outlook remains key to EUR's fundamental outlook. EUR is likely to be supported when the ECB holds a hawkish stance and begin tightening policy, but come under pressure when the central bank holds a dovish stance and is expected to ease policy.

Month-End Flows - During the last few trading days of every month, EUR is usually influenced by month-end flows as banks and institutions rebalance their books and settle transactions. Although not always the case, more often than not, month-end flows tend to be EUR positive, especially against GBP.

EURUSD is the most traded currency pair in the world, making up 24% of daily forex trades according to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). As such, movements in USD often influence EUR, with EUR weakening when USD strengthens and EUR strengthening when USD weakens.

&amp;#x200B;

GBP

Bank of England - Monetary Policy in the UK remains highly influential to GBP's fundamental outlook. Expectations for policy tightening should prove GBP positive, while expectations for policy easing should prove GBP negative.

&amp;#x200B;

AUD

Reserve Bank of Australia - Australia's monetary policy outlook plays a pivotal role in AUD's fundamental outlook. A hawkish stance from the RBA and expectations for policy tightening will likely prove AUD positive; while a dovish stance and expectations for policy easing will likely prove AUD negative.

Risk Tone - Due to its high-beta status, AUD is strongly correlated with the overall risk tone; strengthening in risk-on environments and weakening in risk-off environments.

Commodity Markets - Due to Australia's dependence on its commodity exports for economic growth, AUD is strongly correlated with commodity markets, particularly iron ore, which accounts for 20% of all Australian exports.

China - China is Australia's largest trading partner, accounting for 35% of all Australian exports and 24% of Australia's imports. As such, developments in China and Chinese economic data can prove highly influential to AUD.

&amp;#x200B;

NZD

Reserve Bank of New Zealand - New Zealand's monetary policy outlook plays a key role in NZD's fundamental outlook. A hawkish stance from the RBNZ and expectations for policy tightening will support NZD; while a dovish stance and expectations for policy easing will pressure NZD.

Risk Tone - Due to its high-beta status, NZD is strongly correlated with the overall risk tone; strengthening in risk-on environments and weakening in risk-off environments.

Commodity Markets - NZD is indirectly correlated with commodity markets due to New Zealand's dependence on China and Australia for trade. As both Australia's and China's economies influence and are influenced by the commodities complex, NZD tends to move in accordance with the commodities markets, but also with AUD.

&amp;#x200B;

CAD

Bank of Canada - Canada's monetary policy outlook remains key to CAD's fundamental outlook. Expectations for policy tightening will likely support CAD, while expectations for policy easing will likely pressure CAD.

Oil prices - Oil is Canada's largest export, accounting for over 17% of Canada's exports. As such, CAD is highly correlated with oil prices; strengthening when oil prices rally and weakening when oil prices fall.

Risk Tone - Due to its high-beta status, CAD is strongly correlated with the overall risk tone; strengthening in risk-on environments and weakening in risk-off environments.

Global Economy - Canada is a relatively open economy. As the world's 12th largest export economy and with exports accounting for 34% of GDP, Canada's economic performance and outlook is closely tied to the global economy and the global economic outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

JPY

Risk Tone - With a consistently positive current account and incredibly low interest rates in Japan, JPY has become synonymous with the term safe haven. As the world's leading creditor nation, times of uncertainty result in repatriation flows, supporting JPY.

At the same time, as investors often use JPY as a funding currency due to Japan's low interest rates, investors are often forced to buy JPY to close their risky positions when market's shift to risk-off, further supporting the currency.

&amp;#x200B;

CHF

Swiss National Bank - Swiss monetary policy, or the market's outlook for monetary policy rarely proves market-moving. Instead, the primary influence from Switzerland's central bank comes from their constant interference with exchange rates as they continue to actively weaken CHF when they consider the currency to be highly valued.

Risk Tone - As a safe haven currency, CHF is strongly correlated with the market's risk tone, strengthening in risk-off environments and weakening in risk-on environments

&amp;#x200B;

Okay hope that cleared some things up for you all and trade safe.

I am in my early twenties and I'm just getting my career started and I want to start my retirement off on the right foot.

* Income: 67k will increase to 90k within 3 years
* Employer Retirement: TMRS I must put in 7% Traditional and my employer puts in 14%. Balance - $0
* Employer also offers a 457(b) with no match. I currently have 10% Roth funds going in. Balance - $0
* Roth IRA: I plan on maxing every year. Balance - $26k
* Brokerage Balance - $31k
* Single
* Will probably live in an apartment for a few years or more

I currently plan on retiring around 60. I am looking for advice on whether I should keep my funds going into my 457(b) Roth or change to Traditional. I plan on withdrawing around 80-90k in retirement. I will probably eventually increase my 457(b) contributions and max it out yearly. Just looking for advice on if I should go the Roth or Traditional route to come out ahead. Max Trad 457(b) then contribute to Trad IRA thus making it possible to take the full deduction as long as I stay under the income limit? Just trying to play all the scenarios out in my head to see what I should do. I am currently looking at having 21% Traditional funds and around 16%-28% Roth funds (depending on if I max 457(b) at retirement. I have read that having a 50/50 split is good and multiple other things. Just looking for others opinions.

 TMRS will give me a monthly benefit once I retire but the amount is dependent on:

* Your total member deposits plus interest
* City matching funds and other credits granted
* Your remaining life expectancy at retirement
* Your beneficiary’s life expectancy (if you select a payment option that pays a lifetime benefit to a survivor)
* The future interest rate assumption as set by law
* The TMRS monthly payment plan you choose
* Whether you choose to take a Partial Lump Sum Distribution

TMRS also guarantees at least 5% interest each year under current law. My estimated monthly payments for retiring in 2058 is 6.5-8.5k and 2065 (I'll probably retire somewhere in this window) is 10-14k depending on the payment plan I choose. The estimate does not account for raises and calculates off my current 67k pay.

I'm sure this is really simple as people say and I'm just overcomplicating it but I just want to make sure I set myself up for success 40 years from now! Thank you in advance! If any information is needed just ask!",finance
personalfinance,My tax return ended up being less than I filed for?,"I’m in the US, recently filed my 2020 taxes. My return just showed up in my bank account, but it’s around $300 less than what I filed for. When I log back onto TurboTax, it says the full amount of my return has been accepted, but it’s less in my bank account. 

I understand sometimes adjustments are made, but from my research it seems the IRS will send an email/notice about this, which I definitely didn’t get.

Does anyone know why this could’ve happened? For the record, I owed taxes as I did some freelance work, but I also claimed the Recovery Rebate (stimulus checks that I missed because I was filed as dependent by my parents in 2019), so my return should’ve been around $1100 and ended up just under $800.

I don't want to work hard until I get an heart attack, I want to spend my last decades travelling around the world and doing what I love.

I don't want to trust government on keeping me alive and fed when I'm old.

I don't want to rely on banks and inflatable currencies.

I want to escape the system and stop worrying about money, finances.

All of this is possible thanks to the crypto world. It's our future, and even if I won't see coins being mass-adopted for everyday use when I'm alive, I know I was one of the few enligthened ones who believed in a better financial system.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-2-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks set to drop after S&amp;P 500′s best day since June

&gt; * U.S. stock futures dipped Tuesday after starting March with a broad rally. Shaking off the late February rough patch, the S&amp;P 500 on Monday gained 2.4% for its biggest one-day advance since June. Covid vaccine optimism and the 10-year Treasury yield off its one-year high spurred stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 603 points, or 2%. The Nasdaq, which shed 4.9% in last week’s tech sell-off, popped 3%. The Dow and Nasdaq had their best sessions since November.

*****

&gt; # 2. Target, Kohl’s quarterly results beat estimates

&gt; * Target on Tuesday exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter, thanks to a strong holiday season and stimulus checks. Still, Target declined to provide a forecast for the year ahead, saying the pandemic has made it too difficult to predict consumer patterns. Target reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $2.67 per share on revenue of $28.34 billion, which jumped 21% year over year. Shares were little changed.

&gt; * Shares of Kohl’s rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the department store chain Tuesday delivered adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $2.22 per share, more than double estimates. Revenue of $5.88 billion, which fell 10% year over year, was slightly better than expectations. Kohl’s said it sees sales growth in 2021.

*****

&gt; # 3. Zoom Video shares surge after earnings, sales skyrocket

&gt; * Shares of Zoom Video Communications rose 8% in Tuesday’s premarket, the morning after the company reported adjusted fourth-quarter profit of $1.22 per share, crushing estimates by 43 cents. Revenue surged 369% year-over-year to $882.5 million, also beating forecasts. Zoom, which became all the rage during Covid, issued an upbeat current quarter forecast in anticipation of millions of people and businesses continuing to use its video-calling platform.

*****

&gt; # 4. Senate Democrats work on their version of Covid relief bill

&gt; * Democrats’ hopes of including a federal minimum wage increase in their $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill seemed all but dead, four days after the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian said the chamber’s rules prohibited its inclusion. Senate Democrats hope to unveil their version of the House-passed package and begin debate as early as Wednesday. Congressional leaders want to send President Joe Biden the measure by March 14, when a federal jobless benefits boost, approved in December’s aid measure, is set to expire.

*****

&gt; # 5. Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduces a wealth tax

&gt; * Sen. Elizabeth Warren revived the idea of a wealth tax, which was central to her failed bid to become the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who also ran unsuccessfully for president last year advocating a wealth tax, is among the co-sponsors for the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act. The bill, unveiled Monday, proposes a 2% annual tax on wealth ranging from $50 million to $1 billion and a 3% annual tax on wealth over $1 billion.

personalfinance,"IRS adjusted my refund, do I need to amend?","I skimmed the wiki and couldn't find an answer to this. Basically, when I e-filed my 2020 return I hadn't received my second stimulus check yet due to changing bank accounts. Everything I saw online said that if it hadn't come in the mail by then to claim it on your federal return, so I did.

As it turns out, the check arrived the same day I e-filed, and the tax software I used wasn't prepared to handle amended returns yet. I just received my federal refund with the correct amount I should have received (the IRS didn't include the stimulus since I'd gotten and cashed the check since filing). Do I still need to file an amended return to note that I claimed the stimulus credit in error or would I be good since the IRS didn't overpay me?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"If you're annoyed with the proclivity of Libertarianism in the crypto community, here's what to do:","Try and understand why.

Listen to what caused the Libertarian community to embrace cryptocurrency, and you'll find about the Federal Reserve, the Austrian Business Cycle, (the little known theory that shows that the Federal Reserve actually is the culprit of the many recessions in history) and you'll find out that inflation is not only theft but unsustainable. Inflation will actually eventually cause the world's economy to melt before our eyes, and the secret is that it could happen at any moment. [Source: The Biggest Scam in the History of Mankind](https://youtu.be/iFDe5kUUyT0)

Most people, in my experience, who get angry that there is such a Libertarian bent to the crypto community have never actually taken the time to understand what Libertarianism is, and why we care so much about inflation. It should concern you, too, and as far as I see it, this isn't a thing that only Libertarians should care about. Our money is fake, and they steal from everyone every time they print it. They're also signing their own death certificate every time they do it. (Watch the video above)

Militaries can't actually pay for any of the things they do with taxes, and they would never get approval from the citizens for half the things they do, so they print money to pay for it. Huge businesses and central banks convince their friends in washington that they need a bailout, and there aren't funds to pay for them, so they print money.

This is why crypto exists. This is why Satoshi started this whole thing: to rob the government of it's greatest weapon; that is the mint. As soon as the government can no longer fund itself, it is forced to downsize to the point where only voluntary taxes can fund it, or it involuntarily asphyxiates and a government based on voluntary contribution takes its place.

So, please, if I point out that X project has issues because it's centrally controlled, and is fully willing to inflate the supply if told to, (cough cough Hashgraph), then don't reply ""hurr durr, Libertarian mad"", try and understand where I'm coming from.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin's volatility analogy: the liferaft,"One of the frequent criticisms of bitcoin is its volatility.

The boat sinks slowly and imperceptibly. Its fall causes a lot of turmoil around it which makes the raft rock.

From the point of view of the ship's passengers, the raft rises and falls following the waves. It doesn't look safe, unlike the sinking boat which seems stable. But over time, the deeper the boat sinks the higher the raft is relative to the ship.

Me: 27yrs old, $73.2k salary, 5% traditional contribution 

Wife: 27yrs old, $92.5k salary, 5% traditional contribution

We are currently looking at upping our contributions to 8% each.

We have two questions:
(1) age old question...should we contribute our 8% each to traditional or roth? I've heard and read the arguments for both sides.  FWIW: We will both top out around the 123k range in the next 5-10 years.  

(2) Since we both are lab demo federal civilians, is it better to contribute 8% each, or should we stack up one account (i.e. I make 5% contribution to get government matching, but instead of contributing an additional 3% in mine, we up my wife's to 11% since she makes more, etc.) What is the thought on this? Does this make more money in the long run or does it matter?

personalfinance,Am I ready to buy my first home?,"Greetings Reddit!  

As some background, I’m in my early 30s and have lived with roommates my entire life either in an apartment or renting a room in a house.  I have been working overseas for a couple of years to pay off debt/save for a house.  As of today I am down to just a 15k federal student loan (my plan is to pay that down to 10k next month and leave it there).  The plan is to keep enough money in my savings that I can pay this off completely when the interest free period ends, but I’m hoping something happens with this 10k loan forgiveness so I can use that 10k towards a house instead. 

By July I will have right around 30k in savings.  My retirement accounts are a bit lacking for my age, as I’ve only got about 11k in my Roth IRA and 8k in my 401k with a target date fund 2055.  I’m currently making 97k/year, but obviously when I return to the states I can expect a reasonable salary to drop to the mid-to-high 50k’s.  I have no other debt aside from that current 15k fed student loan.  I own a 2016 Camry outright and plan to drive this into the ground.  

Am I crazy for thinking I might actually be ready to buy a home?  Ideally I would be looking for a 2bd/2ba and at least 1k sq ft.  I would love to have a garage for storage and to facilitate a small home gym (really just want a bench, squat rack, and some dumbbells).  The downside is that in my preferred location in coastal Georgia, home prices for what I would like are in the 150k-170k range.  

As I mentioned at the beginning, I have only ever lived with roommates, and as such, I really only have bedroom furniture.  I am setting myself a budget of 2k to furnish the living room/dining room, and to buy other necessities (pots and pans, vacuum, etc).  That would leave me with a max of 28k savings including my emergency fund.

I have been contemplating renting an apartment for 6months-1 year when I return to the states to get settled with a new job and maybe start accumulating some furnishings.  

With all of that in mind, and let’s assume on the low end I get hired at 52k salary.  I have VA healthcare if nothing else is provided from work, and also receive an additional $450/mo in VA disability.  I also have access to the VA home loan, as I spent 10 years in the military.  Am I reaching for the stars with a 150k-170k home?",finance

So we are filing a Schedule 1, 2, C and SE. I know on schedule C and SE I should put my spouse's name and SSN as they are the one who received the 1099-NEC. My question is on the Schedule 1 and 2, whose SSN should I list?

The only information on Schedule 1 will be the business income from Schedule C and the deductible part of the self employment tax from Schedule SE. And the only number on Schedule 2 will be the self employment tax from schedule SE. I will list both names as it says on form 1040, but there is only space for one SSN. Should I list mine, or my spouses since they were the one who had the income referred to on these forms?",finance

stocks,Caterpillar vs Deere for capturing autonomous construction growth,"[ARK-Q](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_AUTONOMOUS_TECHNOLOGY_&amp;_ROBOTICS_ETF_ARKQ_HOLDINGS.pdf), Cathie Wood's autonomous and robotics ETF holds both $CAT (2.78%) and $DE (5.25%).

My thesis is that $CAT is a much better investment because it has heavier concentration in construction and mining, whereas $DE's concentration is more agricultural. Some positives for $CAT:

* Automation in agriculture is already fairly advanced, while automation in construction is barely just getting started.
* New infrastructure and green energy investment from Federal government will raise demand for $CAT products.
* New supply chain security concerns means United States will open more mines.
* In the next 20 years, global warming is going to cause a lot of infrastructure damage. Whenever there's massive flood, fire, energy outage, $CAT products will be there to rebuild.
* $CAT is paying 1.91 dividend yield vs $DE's 0.87.

However, I have some reservations about $CAT. For some reason this stock is barely mentioned on Reddit. Plus $DE has a heavier weighting in ARKQ. This stock seems like the perfect play -- pays dividends, will participate in the autonomous growth, is the leader in the industry it's in, etc. I'm kind of worried that I'm missing something here due to my lack of general experience and specific experience with construction/mining industry. Would love to hear your thoughts on $CAT.",finance
personalfinance,Needing advice on the wisest decision,"My wife not I come from families that made wise financial choices, so we are stuck on what would be the best idea.

I have roughly $9,800 left on my loan, with almost $500 a payment due to rolling over negative equity(long story).

Would it be smarter to pay off the entire car, and then wait to purchase another car used, or would it be better to pay like half, and use the other half to do a down payment on the used car? We aren't sure if we can refinance the old loan, and try to get another car within a short time, plus we are looking at selling our house and buying another.

Any advice?

Edit: 6% interest rate. I currently have two vehicles, one was inherited. We have two adults that work, and one that stays with the kids. One adult works 10 minutes away, the other an hour away. The inherited car for now goes to the commuter, the one I'm paying on is used by the rest of the house with two children. I may be going back to work soon, so I will have an hour drive, leaving one adult at home with the kids with no vehicle. Therefore unable to do doctors appointments, school, and the like.",finance

personalfinance,Check my 2020 W4 math please.,"I've had multiple threads on the correct withholding for the new W4 and like others I was confused but I think I have understanding now. However my situation is unique and Im trying to find a way to estimate withholding in this scenario.

Im selecting MFJ and she is staying single. I don't want to get into why, and i know it doesn't make sense but just for the sake of argument assume this is not changing.

The IRS estimator cannot give me an accurate number for line 4c because it assumes we are both MFJ. Since I am the higher earner I am the one selecting 2 jobs. However this does not take into account that she is withholding at higher single rate.

So considering we were always safe and always got a return previously, could I in turn check her current fed withholding, (we both get paid biweekly)  and just subtract that from what the estimator tells me to withhold as extra? Since she is covering that amount on her end and we do file joint, this would make sense to me but not sure on the accuracy of this method.

Please tell me Im in the ballpark of reason here. 

The estimator is telling me $330 a pay but not accounting for her withholding as single. Does the estimator assume I am covering the total tax liability for our combined incomes?",finance
stocks,Charter ($CHTR) DD,"Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be doing a DD into Charter Communications ($CHTR). They have seen a surprisingly large appreciation for such a large-cap company, so I figured I'd do a bit of digging.

**Business**

Charter is an internet service and cable provider operating throughout 43 states. They offer services to both commercial and residential customers through Spectrum on a subscription basis. Spectrum strives at driving synergy across products by selling bundles of mobile, internet, and cable services together. This strategy has paid off as over 56% of customers subscribe to any one of these bundles.

The average residential customer spends $111.15 per month and the average commercial customer spends $165.60 per month.

Spectrum's operations can be broken up into 3 segments: Internet Services (52%), Video Services (36%), and Other Services (12%). Let's take a closer look.

**Internet Services (52% of Revenue)**

This is a fast-growing segment that's seen massive tailwinds due to COVID-19. They saw 11% growth YoY. Most of that growth occurred because of a savvy promotion they did for students. While there is a lot of competition against established giants like VZ and T, I still think they can eke out growth in their commercial and small business internet offerings.

**Video Services (36% of Revenue)**

Yikes.

It's no secret cable is a dying medium. Fubo, Hulu, Prime Video, and many others take customers from this segment and promise to continue to do so. Spectrum Cable lost 484,000 customers in 2019 and managed to maintain steady revenue from this segment through price increases which will quicken the pace of customer outflow further. If Spectrum doesn't diversify or spin this segment off, it could be nasty.

**Other (12% of Revenue)**

This segment includes the newly established mobile internet service product (88% revenue growth YoY), voice services (-6% revenue growth YoY), and advertising sales (8% revenue growth YoY). This segment could see significant growth if Spectrum plays it right. As everyone knows, competition in the mobile service industry is fierce. AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile Sprint are all players that promise to force operating margins down and competition up. The same goes for advertising services as well.

I think the thing you should take away from this segment is if Spectrum plays their hand right they can have a big success on their hands, and if they don't, this segment's going to be a huge flop.

With all the segments covered, let's move on to the fundamentals.

**Revenues**

[TTM Revenue 12/31/15 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/8kxebxy)

Charter has enjoyed positive revenue growth recently. YoY they've grown revenue 4.90%, over the last 3 years they've grown revenue by 15.44%, and have enjoyed revenue growth of 392.31%. In 2016, CHTR closed on their acquisition of Time Warner Cable, so the 5-year number is misleading.

Switching over the COGS (cost of goods sold), it's slightly lagged behind revenue which is good. COGS grew 4.39% YoY, 14.15% in the last 3 years, and 759.23% over the last 5 years. Again, this COGS increase is affected by the TWC acquisition.

Finally, taking a look at Net Income, we're shown a pretty inconsistent mess.

[TTM Net Income 12/31/15 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/42kmPsI)

We see a lot of spikes and downturns throughout the first 3 years followed by a consistent and large increase in the last 2 years. To quantify that, we've seen 92.14% Net Income growth YoY, 161.78% growth over the last 2 years, and -67.47% Net Income growth in the last 3 years.

**Margins**

CHTR currently has a 6.70% current Net Margin. This compares well with the 3.64% margin seen a year ago and poorly with the 23.80% margin seen 3 years ago.

**Assets/Debt**

CHTR has total assets of 144.19B, cash on hand of 1.28B, long-term debt of 77.95B, and total liabilities of 110.48B. Subtracting long-term debt from total liabilities, we see that CHTR's COH cannot cover its short-term liabilities.

[Total Assets 12/31/15 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ogq4uP3)

[Total Liabilities 12/31/15 -&gt; 12/31/20](https://imgur.com/gallery/Tt7GQmG)

Looking at trends, we see that both liabilities and assets rocketed following their acquisition of Time Warner Cable. Following that initial spike, assets have slowly decreased and liabilities have slowly increased.

**Dividends**

CHTR doesn't currently pay a dividend, however, I can see it paying one in the near future for a couple of reasons. First of all, they have the Free Cash Flow to support one. In Q4 2020, CHTR brought in 1.65B in Free Cash Flow. Comparing this to Comcast which pays a 1.76% dividend and only brought in 1.52B in Free Cash Flow, I think it's not outlandish to say CHTR could easily afford to pay a 1-2% dividend.

The other reason is that they're in a defensive sector with poor growth prospects going forward. Cable is declining and the other sectors they're in are low-margin and high-competition. The only way they're going to be able to attract shareholders in these market conditions is to pay a handsome dividend.

**Price Ratios/Other**

CHTR has a current PE of 40x, which is higher than the average telecom sector PE of 29.65x. In the same vein, CHTR has a PEG of 2.1x which is decent considering the abundance of frothy valuations in today's market. CHTR has a current ROE of 9.40% implying that they're moderately efficient at generating income.

To further put that ROE number in perspective, Comcast has an ROE of 14.40%, AT&amp;T has an ROE of 9.06%, and Dish has an ROE of 14.02%.

**DCF**

I calculated 2 scenarios. The first was assuming they continue the current year's revenue growth and grow 4.9% annually. I used a 7.5% Discount Rate for this scenario and, under those conditions, I got a fair value of $682.38 representing a &gt;10% upside.

In the second scenario, I used far more conservative, and, in my opinion, more realistic inputs. I assumed a 2.5% revenue growth rate and a 7.5% Discount Rate. Using these new inputs, I got a fair value of $556.87 representing a downside of -10.1%

**PE Valuation**

Using a PE Value of 49.95x (the average PE over the last year), I get a fair value of $771.23 which implies a potential upside of 24.63%.

PE Valuation is definitely rudimentary, but it can be effective as a sanity check for a DCF Valuation.

**Valuation Takeaways**

Averaging my conservative DCF price target with my more optimistic PE valuation, I get a probable fair value of $664.05 which implies a potential upside of 7.30%.

**Risks**

For any business of any size, there are risks. Here are some of the biggest ones for Charter:

1. Competition - The industries Charter operates in are highly competitive. Some of the largest and most established companies in the US (such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast) operate in direct competition with Charter. This has and will continue to draw down margins.
2. The Decline of Cable - Charter is very exposed to Cable which is losing customers at record paces. Anyone that still wants to retain cable services with one company or another has ruled out Charter because of their price hikes aimed at short-term revenue preservation.
3. Inability to Respond to Innovation - Being as large and as archaic as Charter means that any product changes they make occur at a very slow pace. This leaves them susceptible to any innovation that may occur in one of their operating segments.
4. Large Debt - Charter has a large amount of debt that they have to pay interest rates on. This amount of debt restricts Charter's ability to deploy large amounts of capital and makes potential creditors wary of lending them more money.
5. Warren Buffett - This is probably the least important risk, but it could have a large impact on the stock price. Charter is one of the most expensive stocks Warren Buffett owns and that makes it likely he'll begin trimming his stake at some point in 2021.

**Conclusion**

Despite its size, Charter is far from a safe play. Its large debt and exposure to cable are unappealing. Couple that with no current dividend, slow rates of growth, high competition, and a low margin of safety, and you get a stock to stay away from.",finance

We did get a 1098-T form from our college and shows $2229, which were all from federal student loans, we didn't make any of our own payments. From what I've read, the college still received payments and the loans are still there, this is still allowed to be claimed under the American Opportunity Credit. Does this sound correct? I've found this information on TurboTax blogs and TaxSlayer, but the IRS doesn't go into much detail.

My other question is, is a laptop considered a school expense if it was purely purchased for school in 2020 as my wife didn't have a laptop and 3 of the 4 classes were online? The community college doesn't say it's a requirement, but realistically it's required for online classes. This would have to be applied to the America Opportunity Credit and not itemized, as we need to file for the Standard deduction for best gains.

Education tax credits

The government uses tax policy to encourage activities such as paying for education and saving for retirement. While the names and amounts vary, the IRS generally provides for some type of educational tax credit to help offset the costs of qualifying tuition and related expenses.

A computer for school purposes may or may not qualify for these credits.

Generally, if your computer is a necessary requirement for enrollment or attendance at an educational institution, the IRS deems it a qualifying expense.

If you are using the computer simply out of convenience, it most likely does not qualify for a tax credit.",finance
personalfinance,Collections Negotiations: 'Stop Reporting' vs Pay-to-Delete,"I'm working on settling a debt of 2.5k that has been sent to collections. My main priority is settling and getting this removed from my credit report. My agency is ACT.

While doing research on a pay to delete option I came across this resource that says

&gt; We’ve discovered virtually no collection agencies will agree to a pay for delete. This is a frequently suggested method of dealing with collection agencies, the idea being you pay them to delete the item from your credit reports....
We must get Account Control Technology to agree that in exchange for your payment, they’ll stop reporting your account information to all three credit bureaus. It’s a lot easier for them to agree to stop reporting your account information, versus deleting the negative mark.

With the idea that...

&gt; This federal legislation gives you the right to challenge and dispute credit report items, you believe are inaccurate, misleading, or made in error. Naturally, we’re going to dispute the ACT collections mark.
During which they’ll contact Account Control Technology and ask them to verify your account. As per your settlement agreement ACT will not verify your account during the credit bureaus investigation.
To comply with the FCRA, this means the credit bureaus must remove this collection listing from your credit reports. 

Is this doable? And if so, is there a better chance ACT will agree to that rather that rather than pay to delete (even if you settle instead of pay in full)? It seemed plausible, but I haven't heard this advice before, and I want to check.",finance

I had a decent job making about 40k a year and had gotten my credit score into the 700s.  I had just paid off my car that I bought from a terrible used car dealership, at a ridiculous interest rate, and things were looking good.  I was able to finance a brand new car for less than what I paid for a used car with over 100k miles in the past, I was buying a house and even able to save money.  Everything was stable.

That is until I found myself unable to work at my job for the next year.  I figured I would consider this a vacation and things would be fine until I could get back to work.  Well things weren't fine.  I ended up drinking a lot and doing drugs and basically just not caring anymore.  Before long I was living in my car.  Shortly later that car was repossessed.  $15,000 in credit card debt piled up.  Got a woman pregnant.  My credit score plummeted.  I basically threw everything away that I had worked for up to this point.  I was worse off than where I started.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 2, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, March 2, 2021**

Stocks retreated on Tuesday, pulling back after rallying yesterday, underscoring how volatile the market is right now. Market participants continue to focus on the Treasury yields, a new coronavirus vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), and additional stimulus from Washington. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury yield retreated to hover below 1.45% after spiking to a one-year high of 1.61% last week. The swift rise in interest rates last week spooked equity investors last week, with rates reflecting inflationary fears and impacting both corporate and consumer borrowing costs. Last week, during his testimony to Congress, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell tried to temper fears over higher rates and inflationary pressures. He said,  rising Treasury yields are a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete \[economic\] recovery.” Central Bank officials from the United Kingdom and Australia echoed Powell’s sentiments and committed to maintaining accommodative fiscal policies. 

Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (JNJ) single-dose coronavirus vaccine, making it the third vaccine approved in the US.  [The company has already begun shipping its COVID-19 vaccine ](https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-u-s-cdc-advisory-committee-recommends-first-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-for-adults-18-and-older-in-u-s)and expects to deliver more than 100 million doses of the single-shot vaccines during the first half of 2021, including more than 20 million by the end of March.

In a note to clients, S3 Analytics said, “RKT’s stock price and short selling activity is reminiscent of another recent high flying meme stock – GameStop Inc (GME). Both stocks saw their share price spike due to high retail buying interest (predominantly due to significant social media activity) and an options based gamma squeeze. Both stocks also had/have relatively high short interest and high stock borrow rates which imply strong short-selling demand and limited stock borrow supply.""

personalfinance,Mortgage Loan Modification and Refinancing CA/USA,"I am having a crisis right now over my financial situation, particularly with regard to the mortgage on the house my husband and I own. There is $400k in principal at the moment with 4.4% annual interest, monthly payments are around $2.5k. Equity is around $300k.

Because of COVID, we went into forbearance and haven’t made payments for almost a year and now owe $25k in overdue payments. We cannot afford to deal with the delinquency payments out of pocket, so my husband wants a loan modification that will keep our current interest rate on the mortgage, but turn it into a 40-year mortgage with a higher principal. He then wants to refinance under a lower interest rate, 3%, or even close to 2% with a shorter term, 30 year and monthly payments of $2.5k.
I do not want to be stuck with the 40 year loan and much rather pay off the house as quickly as possible. The conundrum is that I’m not sure what my husband’s plans are for his share of the equity. He is already a senior 65+ and talked about retiring or divorcing. I’m worried that he might write the equity on his half of the deed to an extended family member or friend. What kind of protections can I have to ensure that I will not be slaving for 15 years to pay off a mortgage that half will end up with somebody else? My husband is unstable, has bipolar, and is possibly getting senile/dementia, so I really do fear that I’ll be thrown under the bus financially and have to pay half of the value of the house all over again.

I do not want to sell my house or move out somewhere cheaper. Divorce might not be an easy option, I won’t be able to easily get another loan for the house and a 10 year mortgage with half of the equity would be financially impossible for me to pay.
Any advice would be appreciated, especially with regard to protecting his half of the equity from being sold or given to an extended family member in his will.

CryptoCurrency,Booze-induced panic.,"I want to share a story with you guys, since nobody else would understand me. It's quite embarrassing for me and English is not my first language so please bear with it, here we go.

I strictly abide the rule ""DYOR"" and in the last few days I was getting interested in a new ICO;  to me it looked pretty interesting and promising but I was not entirely convinced yet, something felt ""off"" and I needed more time to study.

Until one evening I got mildly drunk and bolder, so I decided to throw 10€ (\~12$) at it. I mean, what's the worst that could happen with such a small sum? Now, there are three different paying methods:

\- debit/credit card: when buying online I always use a debit card that's basically empty until needed, so this seamed the safest option. Unluckily the card was not accepted but at this point I was more determined than before.

\- ETH transfer via MetaMask: meh, I didn't want to end like the Racoon trying to wash cotton candy (it's been all over the sub recently, you know what I mean), pass.

\- via Coinbase: ok, this was feasible. I swapped part of my Stellar for Lite (it was painful) and used them to finally add to my collection a new token.

Satisfied, I drank some more and shortly after went to bed. I couldn't sleep so I picked up my phone to see what reddit and twitter had to say about this token. That's when I started to freak out a bit, because the word ""scam"" appeared a bit too often... Ok, calm down, what's the worst scenario? I got my credentials sniffed and I lose 20€ worth of crypto earned on Coinbase? I don't have a paying method linked to the site. But then I discovered, to my horror, that you can have a negative balance! I know, I know, nothing of this works like that but drunk and panicking me was not very rational. I pondered my options, then I got up and turned my PC on to at least change my password. Nice, done, this gave me a bit of peace of mind and I went to bed again.

After an almost sleepless night (thank you too, goddamn mosquito) I got out of bed and the more rational me realized two things: everything was protected by the 2fa and, from the beginning, the purchase was *totally legit*: they never asked for anything, they only gave me an address and the amount to pay. Even if in the end they disappear with my money, well... I mean, I just gave them 10€; I would be disappointed at most.

Anyway, never again I'll drink and mess with money at the same time. I hope that this story can put a smile on your face. By the way the ICO in question is Studentcoin, opinions?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,1099-R Code M Annoyance,"UPDATE TO ORIGINAL POST: In case someone else has a similar issue and sees this – after trying CreditKarma Tax, H&amp;R Block, TaxSlayer, and FreeTaxUSA (free for federal, marginal fee for state), FreeTaxUSA was far and away the easiest software to deal with the code ""1M"" issue. In fact, as far as I can tell, the only one that would properly put ""Rollover"" in the right place on the 1040 as mentioned in the comments below. Highly recommend!

\--------------

Hi all. I left an employer mid-year last year right around the same time that a 401K loan I had taken out was fully repaid. I thought I'd timed it so the entire balance was paid, but it seems I miscalculated by a pay period, because in addition to the 1099-R's I received for my Roth and traditional rollovers to my IRA, I've received a third 1099-R with a very small amount ( under $200) tagged with distribution code 1M (qualified plan loan offset). Two questions:

1. Based on research, it seems that as long as I deposit this amount into my IRA before my tax due date, the amount is not taxable – does this seem right?
2. I was planning on using Credit Karma Tax as it's \~free\~ and my taxes are simple. However, they are missing the option to choose code (M) on a 1099-R. I contacted support and they basically told me ""tough luck, use something else."" I'd really rather not pay \~$100 to file using a different service just because of this dumb issue, particularly since as I understand it, that amount won't be taxable anyway. As long as I move the money over, would there be any *material* harm in me just not inputting this 1099-R?

personalfinance,"How much house can my fiance (30) and I (29) realistically afford? Southern California, West LA","Hi all,

We've been doing a lot of research about what the correct proportion of your income should go to a mortgage using different calculators, etc. Some advice we've seen recommends budgeting for after tax, but others use gross -- so we're a bit torn on what is the best way to see what is a good starting point for our budget, etc. Below are our stats:

**Combined Yearly Income of:** $235,000 (base, but with year end bonuses it's closer to $255k-$260k but I'm not factoring this in).

**Monthly**: \~$19,588 gross and around \~**$13,000 net** (after tax, payroll deductions, etc)

**Current Rent:** \~$2800 (2bd/1ba) in Santa Monica

\----------------------------

**Debts**:

**Car loan**: $10,000 remaining at $235/mo (we only own one car)

**RV Loan:** $50,000 remaining at $500/mo

**Student loans:** \~$80k ($60k mine, $20k his).  Both through the Federal government, subsidized and currently deferred. Payments would range from $200-$500 for me (depending on repayment plan, and around $100-$250 for him) once we begin paying.

**Credit Cards:** $0

\----------------------------

**Savings:**

**Emergency Fund:** Currently have 6 months of rent + expenses saved.

\----------------------------

**Monthly Budget Items:** Instead of breaking this out, we currently spend about $850/mo in groceries, household items, pet supplies, utilities, etc.  We both work from home so automotive transportation is minimal.

\----------------------------

**Now to the real questions:**

1. When determining how much house you can afford, is it better to use gross or net income?
2. Do we NEED to save 20%? We would be first time home buyers.. isn't there a program that allows for 3.5% but we would have to have PMI insurance until 20% of the home value is paid off?
3. What else should we keep in mind?

Ideally, we'd love to be ready to start getting pre-qualification offers in about a year which would give us some time to save up money for a down payment, etc.

We're both completely new to this and unfortunately our parents aren't in the best financial positions to offer this sort of advice, and considering we're still relatively young, any guidance from you guys would be very much appreciated.

personalfinance,Looking for help on some refinance scenarios,"Hi r/personalfinance \--

My wife and I are looking into a refinance and have a few different options available to us, and I'm hoping I'll find some advice here about what makes the most sense financially.  I've done some comparison shopping on our refinancing and have included details about what seems to be the best options below (along with the other relevant details about our dilemma):

Primary residence

Current outstanding mortgage \~$480k

Interest rate: 3.875%

Estimated home value $650-$680k

&amp;#x200B;

Rental property

Current outstanding mortgage \~$50k

Interest rate: 4.25%

Second HELOC with a balance of \~15k and a variable interest rate

&amp;#x200B;

Our other major debts are our student loans -- we each have \~70k at 6.8% (and, at this point, won't be eligible for any sort of forgiveness short of the 20 year payment forgiveness).

&amp;#x200B;

Our refinancing options as explored to this point are:

Refinance only the primary residence mortgage ($480k) for: 20 years at 2.25% or 15 years at 1.99%.

Refinance the primary residence mortgage and take cash out (probably enabling us to take \~$50k out depending on the home appraisal) for: 30 years at 2.875% or 20 years at 2.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my questions are, assuming we can afford the payment at each option, do we just refinance the mortgage?  Or do we take the cash out?  And if we take the cash out, do we pay down the student loans (put it all into one? Pay them both equally? Does it matter?)?  Or do we pay off the HELOC and rental property mortgage (so far, this seems like the least likely choice)?  Or something else entirely?

datascience,Mathematical definition of the bias-variance tradeoff,"This is a topic that I have discussed heavily in the past, and I constantly see it popping up as a question and source of confusion among the community, asking what exactly is the bias-variance tradeoff, why is it called that, and how do you actually define them in objective terms? I was lucky enough to have a professor in my university days by the name of Shai Ben-David who co-authored an excellent textbook titled *Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms* that is theoretically oriented, and it had the best definition of the bias-variance tradeoff that I have seen to this day, which is a topic that I think is heavily misunderstood today, though I would love to hear the opinions of others that might disagree with me.

**Common misconception:** For example, I have seen people define the bias-variance tradeoff as referring to the volatility of outputted predictions of your model relative to small local changes to input features. However, we all know that variance refers to the overfitting error in bias-variance tradeoff, and this definition would imply that a constant-predictor model *f(x) = k* that simply outputs a constant value (parameter that is learned) would have a variance of zero, and therefore will not overfit? Even if it is given a training set with only a single example, it will not overfit at all? Also, we all know that increasing the size of training dataset should reduce variance, but how would more training samples change the volatility of the outputted predictions relative to input feature space? This definition clearly does not make sense. I think it is common to see highly overfit models with high variance that also happen to have highly volatile predictions relative to small changes in input features, however that is NOT a requirement nor is it a good definition.

**Another common misconception:** Another common definition of bias-variance or overfitting-underfitting that I have seen before is usually referring to models that have a learning curve over the course of their training (usually neural networks or ensemble models) where you can see the training error and validation error change over the course of training. Typically, the training error always improves, while the validation error improves for a while until it reaches its 'peak validation performance' iteration and then the validation error starts getting worse while training keeps improving. Sometimes, people will refer to the model iterations BEFORE the 'peak validation' as being underfitting or high bias, and then refer to the model iterations AFTER the 'peak validation' as being overfitting or high variance. I understand why people often make this association and confusion, but again it doesn't make much sense. Why are model iterations before considered underfitting while the iterations after are overfitting? Does this mean that the 'peak validation' iteration is not overfitting or underfitting? How do you even define bias/variance for models that don't have a learning curve? There is a lot lacking here and it just doesn't make sense if you think about it deeply, and again is another case of looking at the symptom to define something.

**So then, what is the bias-variance tradeoff?**

The bias variance trade-off is a useful concept that stems from decomposing the generalisation error. Before we can understand this, we need to define a few concepts that are important.

First, we need to frame the training of a model as a mathematical process. What are we doing when we take a linear regression model and feed it a bunch of training data? One way to look at this, is that we have a model hypothesis class *H = { f(x) = kx + m | for all k,m }* which is the set of all possible simple univariate linear regression models that we could learn. Then, training a model, is basically running a TrainingAlgorithm that takes in the training dataset as input and outputs a linear model *f(x)* that is from the hypothesis class *H*. So basically, *H* is the set of all possible models, and training a model is basically trying to find the best model in *H* that fits our training data best and that we think will generalise the best to future unseen data.

Given those definitions, we can now define the key terms that we need to bring it all together.

**What is generalisation error?**

The generalisation error, in this example, is the error that we expect to observe by training a linear regression model on the training dataset that we have and deploying it on future unseen data examples drawn from the target distribution. Basically, it is the true error of the model that we will have. The reason that we have a 'test set' is so we can estimate the generalisation error. Now, thankfully, smarter people than me have gone ahead and done a bunch of mathematical wizardry to decompose the generalisation error into the following definition:

*GeneralisationError = TrueError + Bias + Variance*

Note that *Bias = Underfitting Error* and *Variance = OverfittingError*

***What is TrueError?***

TrueError is defined as the underlying error of the target distribution. For example, suppose that we are given training data from the target distribution of samples (x, y) where y = 5x + 2. Then we can clearly see that this can be perfectly predicted (if we know the underlying true distribution and can model it), and the TrueError would be 0. However, for another example, maybe the target distribution is y = 5x + 2 + u, where u is a random Normal variable with mean 0 and variance 1. Well clearly, even if we know the true underlying distribution, we won't be able to perfectly predict it because of the underlying error of the target distribution, and the TrueError is equal to the variance of the random variable u.

**What is Bias?**

Bias is defined as the difference between the generalisation error of the BEST model from our hypothesis class *H and the* underlying *TrueError*. For example, if the true underlying target distribution is y = 5x + 2, then we can see that our model class of simple linear regression models *H* contains this exact model! So therefore, the best model instance is *f(x) = 5x + 2* where *f in* H, and we can see that our Bias/UnderfittingError is equal to 0! As you can see, *Bias* or the *Underfitting Error* is basically the error introduced by choosing our model hypothesis class *H.* If our hypothesis class contains the true target distribution model, then our bias will be 0, otherwise the farther our 'best' model in the class is from the true underlying target distribution, then the higher our bias will be. Notice that this definition has nothing to do with the volatility of the model output predictions, and has nothing to do with the learning curve. Basically in machine learning, we assume that a good training algorithm with infinite training data should always choose the best model from your hypothesis class *H*, so Bias can be thought of as the expected error of your model trained with infinite training data (minus the TrueError).

**What is Variance?**

Variance is defined as the expected squared difference between the generalisation error of the BEST model from our hypothesis class *H* and the error of the EXPECTED model that will be learned from our class *H* given the finite training set of size *N* that is fed into the training algorithm. To continue with our example from above, we know that the best model in our class *H* is the model instance *f(x) = 5x + 2*. However, suppose that we are given a training set of size 1 with only a single sample of (x,y). Given only 1 sample, our training algorithm may choose the model instance *f(x) = 4x + 1*, which is worse than our best model and will have higher generalisation error. The difference between the expected GE of our model trained on the dataset of size 1 and the expected GE of our 'best model' is the variance or overfitting error component of the GE. Notice how the variance is dependent on the model hypothesis class *H*, the training algorithm *A,* and the size of the training dataset. This is why we can reduce overfitting by increasing the size of our training dataset, or we can reduce overfitting by reducing the size of our model hypothesis class (by choosing a simpler model or adding regularization which typically reduces the size of the model hypothesis class).

**TL;DR:** An accurate mathematical exact definition of underfitting/overfitting A.K.A the bias-variance tradeoff is useful to understand even beyond a theoretical context. For a more comprehensive understanding, I recommend that you read the textbook I mentioned at the beginning of the post.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT NOTE: A couple people have been confused by the exact terminology. I should clarify that bias-variance decomposition is technically different than the approximation-estimation error decomposition. But they are extremely similar, and in most cases they are mathematically equivalent. In fact, it is useful to think of the approximation-estimation decomp as a sub-case of the bias-variance decomposition, if we make the assumption that our training algorithm is expected to output the best model in its hypothesis class. If this assumption can be made, then they become mathematically equivalent most intents and purposes. It's important to note that most modern class machine learning algorithms and classes satisfy this assumption, so they are equivalent. I also find that the approximation-estimation decomp is practically more useful because it simplifies things and provides more direct applicability to the real world problems that we typically face as data scientists.",technology

personalfinance,Should we sell this condo that's earning good rental income?,"Hi, I'm hoping to get a bit of advice. 

My spouse and I recently finished the ""student"" phase of life and entered the income earning phase. We're in our 30s with 2 kids. During grad school we squeaked by and bought a small condo that we started renting out when we had to move for internship/postdoc. When my spouse landed a job last fall we bought a second condo, using the rental income from the first to offset its debt. 

Here's a quick breakdown of our current assets and liabilities: 

||Equity|Debt|Interest rate|Payment |Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Condo 1|$200,000|$97,000|4%|$1,258 mo (including HOA)|Rented for \~$1,600/mo|
|Condo 2|$20,000|$278,000|3%|$2,155 mo (including HOA)||
|Student Loans||$124,000|6%|$0|On hold due to COVID|
|Savings|$60,000||\~0.3%|||
|Retirement|&lt; $5,000||?||Now contributing 10% of income|

Current income is about $125k per year (up from under $50k last year)

The condo has been rented out for 2 years 9 months. There's a big tax deadline coming up where if we sell it in the next 3 months we don't have to pay capital gains tax on its (substantial) appreciation. We're strongly considering selling it and using the cash to nuke the student loans. But there's a part of me that really likes owning a physical income-producing asset. The rent easily covers all the expenses and then some. We're also way behind on saving for retirement, having only started that like 4 months ago. I hope to increase our contributions and diversify a bit when things stabilize. 

The question is: what would you do in our situation, specifically with the 1st condo?

Just wanted some feedback on what I wrote about bitcoin awhile back when I was trying to convince people about bitcoin.  I thought it would be interesting to read people's feedback.  Thanks!

\-----------------------

**Why the world needs bitcoin**

Imagine your currency suddenly losing 96-98% of its value. People rushing to the grocery stores to buy whatever they can before the rest of their currency goes to shit. Increase in crime and violence everywhere as people try to survive. Well that’s exactly what happened in [Venezuela ](http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/22/news/economy/venezuela-currency-crash/index.html)and [Zimbabwe ](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/390/inflation/hyper-inflation-in-zimbabwe/)a few years ago. 

A variety of sources affect a country's monetary value; irresponsible printing of money supply, excessive regulation, even increases in commodity prices, just to name a few. But that is not the point of this article, this article is on how we can protect ourselves from irresponsible government.

If you’re saying to yourself, “This won’t happen in my country. I live in a country with a responsible government that looks out for my best interest”, let’s cut the bullshit and save the stories of Santa Claus and the tooth fairy for the children. Government are run by people and if you haven’t been living under a rock, you’ll notice that sometimes people in power fuck things up for the rest (mostly the poor). Whether it be for power, greed, or stupidity, it happens. This maybe not your government today, but what about the next election or the one after that.

Here's a list of some examples of hyperinflation:

Yugoslavia 1993 – 1994 \[1\]

Soviet Union 1990 – 1991 \[2\]

Greece 1943-1946 \[3\]

American examples of irresponsible government/banks include the 2008 American mortgage crisis and America's growing federal debt. 

**How does having bitcoin help?**

Bitcoin helps take away some control over the economy from the small group in power and gives it back to the people. Banks have been allowed to dictate the rules that benefit themselves and fund governments that help keep these regulations in place. Let's go back to the mortgage crisis of 2008: banks were blamed, no one was arrested, millions of lives destroyed, government bailed out the banks and taxpayers were handed the bill. The more money we keep in the banks, the more control they will have over the government. 

For instance, you lent money to your brother-in-law and find out he actually using it to gamble. He loses it all and asks you for more money. Like any sane person, you tell him to fuck off. However, your wife insists on helping her brother and lends him more money from your shared account. Is this a good metaphor for the mortgage crisis or the story of my life? I'll let you decide, but you bet your ass I have a separate bank account.

**Technology never stops advancing:**

Think of when the internet first became live in 1991. The majority of people laughed at how slow it was and how it would never amount to anything. Only a hand full of hardcore supporters worked on it, believed in it and it grew slowly. But as the technology grew, more and more people got involved. Bitcoin is in its beginning stages just like when the internet started. It needs to mature and become more accepted as a means of financial transactions before we can move on to the next stage.

**So what should I do now?**

I don't suggest [selling all your possessions to buy bitcoin](http://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-man-sells-house-possessions-cryptocurrency-682459), because just like starting a business or explaining to your fiancée that wedding rings are pointless, there's risk involved. I think of bitcoin as an investment for myself and everyone's future. Purchasing this technology is like having a stock in a company you believe in.  Would you put all your money in one stock? No, but a good portfolio is diversified. (Note: This is just my opinion and not financial advice)

**Why not just keep gold?**

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/spencerbogart/2017/11/08/7-stats-that-highlight-a-millennial-propensity-for-bitcoin/#4706220032c4), ""more than 1 in 4 millennials prefer Bitcoin to stocks: 27% of whom said they would prefer to own $1,000 of Bitcoin over $1,000 in stocks. The number was even higher for male millennials—38% of whom said they prefer Bitcoin"" (millennials = aged 18 - 34).

Millennials are the future. Millennials are the ones buying bitcoin. Do you want to have gold when the last dinosaur who believes in gold dies?

**Conclusion:**

Albert Einstein stated, ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."" and if nothing is done to try and prevent corruption, then it will persist. I'm not saying adopting bitcoin going to 100% succeed, but this could be the chance to make a change, not just for one country, but for the entire world. If we let this fail without giving it a shot, then we may well deserve what’s coming to us.

Bitcoin,Refinancing my mortgage to buy BTC? Yes? No? Your thoughts?,"Hey all,

I have DCA'd in and currently own a bit of  Bitcoin... BUT: I want more &amp; think the price is going to rise sharply over the next year

I'm Canadian &amp; want to refinance my mortgage to pull 100K out of the equity of my house to buy (2) Bitcoin. Yes, I've heard the cautions: don't invest more than you can afford to loose, it's volatile, etc...  I'm looking for feedback (not a criticism of the idea) of why or why not to do so (something I'm not considering). I'm looking to retire in 10-15 years so will likely just HODL (not trade) till then. I feel like I'll never be able to borrow this amount of money at this interest rate again and the gains upside is extremely appealing. Thanks for your thoughts, much appreciated.

Other info: it would pull out almost all the equity in our house, we would be getting a better 5-yr-term (25 year) fixed rate of 1.69% for 373K, yes we can afford the increased payments. No debt, no car payments (for about 2-3 years), household income 150k/yr, 60K in accessible TSFA savings if needed (RRSP's can't be pulled out).",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Received unemployment from two different states. Now what?,"Hello all,

So last year, shortly after the pandemic became a big thing, my wife was furloughed from her job for about two months. This was from sometime in May to around July, so the additional federal unemployment boost of $600 was in place. The company that she worked for is based in Tennessee but their parent company is based in Georgia. We also live in Georgia. Her employer filed for unemployment benefits for her, but apparently messed up and filed with the state of Georgia. They realized they had made a mistake after a couple of weeks and re-filed for the state of Tennessee. 

After a week or two she began receiving unemployment benefits from both Georgia and Tennessee. Both were the normal state amounts with the extra $600 added to them. We were never able to contact either state’s unemployment office to get it corrected and so she received payments from both states for about two months until she went back to work. None of her other coworkers had this issue but they all live in Tennessee. Due to a glitch in both state’s systems, taxes were not withheld from any of her benefits, even though she elected to do so. 

What is our best course of action now that it is tax season? We’ve continued trying to contact the unemployment offices but have gotten no real help. Both websites are incredibly vague and aren’t much help either. Neither state has tried to contact us in any way to tell us that we have to pay anything back. 

I definitely don’t want to seem guilty of unemployment fraud when it was out of our control, but it would also be great to not end up having to pay back several thousands of dollars because of someone else’s screw up.",finance
personalfinance,My current mortgage holder offered to drop my interest rate with no strings attached. Is this legitimate?,"I am 6 years into a 30 yr jumbo mortgage with Chase at 3.5%. Last week I started exploring a refinance with other banks with the main goal of lowering interest paid over the life of the loan.

Chase must have caught wind of the fact that I was shopping around and didn't want to lose my business because today I got an unprompted offer from them to drop my rate from 3.5% to 3.0% ""without refinancing"". All I have to do is click 'accept' on their website. No application, no fees, no appraisals. 

This is a jumbo loan so 3.0% is actually very competitive compared to what I was seeing in my research. But the kicker is according to all the documentation I can find about this offer, everything about my loan stays exactly the same, aside from the rate which is fixed and drops permanently to 3.0. To me this means I'm not resetting the clock which is obviously a huge appeal.

Is this real? Is this something others have encountered? Is there some hidden fine print that I can't see even though I've looked pretty hard for it?",finance

Trading,How will Biden's Executive Order impact the markets?,"The report about [Biden’s Executive Order for “Securing America’s Critical Supply Chains”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/24/fact-sheet-securing-americas-critical-supply-chains/) generally points to an acceleration of changes in the global economic, monetary, and geopolitical world order. In our view, this executive order strongly suggests that those changes are not only accelerating, but that they are becoming acute. 

The US government (in fact, most governments) almost never reacts until either there is a crisis or to close the barn doors long after the horses have already left. The US government has known about the vulnerability of its supply chains for 20 years, yet the “establishment” US government that Biden represents is only now reacting. Ergo, this executive order suggests a crisis is here.

The US’s role in the post-1971 USD system was to hollow out its manufacturing base to run the deficits to supply the US Dollars (USD) the world needed to function. In the post-71 USD system, the US’s biggest exports are US Treasury (UST) bonds and the USD, and biggest imports are manufactured goods from the rest of the world. What the US has done is to provide the working capital to the production facilities in countries with lower labour costs while US corporations have benefited from the higher profit margins and US consumers have benefited from the deflationary pressure in the form of ever cheaper consumer goods.

This is why Washington and Wall Street have done so well while US middle- and working-class wages have stagnated on a real basis – the US subjugated the middle- and working classes to support this outsourcing machine. The only sacred cows were valued technology in sectors such as weaponry and aviation. The US is now waking up to the fact that in reaping the benefits, their eyes have been closed to the fact that consumer goods like semiconductor chips which used to power only trivial things like pocket calculators and home computers are now a strategic resource that can bring a nation to a halt, if its supply was curtailed. 

Biden now appears to be starting to reverse this process, potentially with help from the Fed.

This is likely to be structurally inflationary (higher prices as the production facilities are moved home or to US allies which usually have higher labour costs), and should be a continual source of upward pressure on UST yields until the Fed caps those yields. This would support our continued key thesis that US real interest rates are likely going to remain ultra low and may even go far more negative than virtually anyone believes.",finance

personalfinance,Wondering which student loans would be better to pay off first: higher interest rate subsidized or lower interest rate unsubsidized?,"Hello everybody,

I'm a sophomore in college getting to the end of my academic year here (at least in terms of actual tuition payments), and it's looking like I'm going to have a credit of around $6,000 in my college billing account (this is due to several reasons, including me no longer having to pay for food/room and board as I wasn't able to be on campus for much of this academic year). So basically, I'm hoping to use that money to instantly refund some of the extra loans I took out that ended up being unnecessary. I'm trying to decide which would be a better one to target first:

* 2020/2021 College Subsidized Loan of $1,391 with an interest rate of 5% and 10 yr repayment plan (plus grace period of 9 months)
* 2020/2021 Federal Unsubsidized Loan of $5,117 with an interest rate of 2.75% (but technically 0% until Sept. 2021 as far as I'm aware because of COVID relief) and 10 yr repayment plan (plus grace period of 6 months)

I technically also have two other outstanding loans:

* 2019/2020 Federal Unsubsidized Loan of $5,500 with an interest rate of 4.45% and 10 yr repayment plan (plus grace period of 6 months)
* 2020/2021 Federal Subsidized Loan of $1,383 with an interest rate of 2.75% and 10 yr repayment plan (plus grace period of 6 months)

So I'm pretty confident I can rule out paying off the 2020/2021 Fed. Subsidized Loan first because the interest accrual for that is going to be delayed until 6 months after I graduate (Jan 2024) and it has the lowest interest rate out of any of the loans.

In a vacuum, it looks like it would make a lot of sense for me to try and cover that 2019/2020 Fed. Unsubsidized Loan because it's got a higher interest rate than the other federal loans, interest accrual will start up again in September, and it's also the largest principal at $5,500. My only hesitation there is I don't know the ethics of sort of using the extra money from the more recent loans to pay off an earlier loan. I imagine that's getting into dangerous territory.

So if those assumptions are correct, then I'm choosing between the 2020/2021 College Subsidized Loan and the 2020/2021 Fed. Unsubsidized Loan. My gut tells me just to pay off the loan with the highest interest rate ASAP, and then I'd still have a few thousand dollars of credit left on my billing account to refund **most** of that 2020/2021 Fed. Unsubsidized Loan and bring that principal down pretty low. But I don't really mean to speculate, I'm interested to hear what you all have to say.

What order should I approach these loans with the credit I have of around $6,000? Keep in mind that I am a college sophomore and that none of these loans are technically accruing interest at the moment because they're either subsidized or federal loans.

Thank you so much, I really appreciate the help!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Undervalued coin discussion - Luna (Terra): Backed by Coinbase + Galaxy Digital. Top payments app in Korea,"I dont see much discussion about Luna/Terra here, so I am sharing some facts about this coin:

1. The project is a DPoS based platform built on Terdermint (Cosmos) for issuing stablecoins and is focussed on defi adoption by end users. One of the apps Chai offering contactless payments is really big in Korea with millions of users and backed by giants like SoftBank. Chai is also used by retail players like Nike and Phillip Morris. Being based on Tendermint, the transaction fees on Luna are very tiny (in cents). 

2. Terra natively supports stablecoins in multiple fiat currencies like USD and KRW. For each USD worth stablecoin issued on Terra, an equal value worth LUNA is burnt as issuance tax. For example, lets say right now LUNA =$6, so for each new UST issued 0.16 LUNA is burnt. This results in deflationary supply. 

3. Stablecoins on the Luna/Terra platform are used by DeFi applications, and one such application is Mirror protocol which lets you invest in synthetic assets such as stocks, commodities etc. Mirror is currently the second largest synthetic DeFi protocol and offers DEX based trading of assets like MSFT, QQQ, TSLA, AMZN, AAPL etc and associated liquidity mining rewards. For each mAsset issued, Luna also requires to be locked up. Also usage of Mirror increases UST circulation, resulting in additional Luna burn. 

4. Luna has recently raised funds from players like Coinbase ventures, Galaxy digital etc. Several more projects like Anchor, Spar will be launched soon and they will follow Mirror's distribution model i.e. rewarding existing users and stakers in the ecosystem. Anchor plans to develop native interest rate protocol for DeFi. Spar is a DeFi asset management protocol. Some of the projects plan to offer weekly distribution model.

stocks,Regaining Control of Your Trading Plan,"Hi all,

I was inspired by the choppy market action to do a write up on losing control when you trade. It's extracted from my blog (no self promote, no links or sneaky sheet), maybe it resonates with you:

It's about losing and regaining control on the holy grail of trading YOUR trading plan:

What Happens When we Lose Control.

I posted this in Daytrading but the exact same applies for investors or long term traders.

Many destructive emotions or situations stir up feelings associated with loss of control. **Some examples of what's happened to me in the past:**

*You buy a stock, it goes down, you sell it to avoid losing money and it literally goes back up the next second, so you jump back in and it goes down again!*

Essentially, you are trying to control whether or not you make money. The obvious problem here - **you don't control price.**

This is probably one of the most common root causes of over-trading. And comes down to a few things:

1. You do not have a trading plan that you understand
2. Emotions are acted on instantly
3. Fear is in the passenger seat and you are trying to gain control of your emotions
4. Your current system doesn't suit your personality

Trading is so full of paradoxes it would make you sick to your stomach, in fact, it does make some people literally sick to their stomach. The very need for control and our primitive brain  is basically wired to stop us from making money. Admitting we don't know where a stock will go is the first step to recovery, and a long road it is.

**Example 2 (Based on the above):**

*Holding onto losses in order to avoid the pain of ""loss"". There are many terms for this, for more info you can look into the disposition effect. Here we have the metamorphosis of a ""trader"", someone who always tells you when they are winning to an ""investor"", someone who holds shit stocks while they tank.*

Again, this ties into control (and ego) which quite frankly are like peas in a pod and feed from one another.

By trying to control the outcome of a trade, we find all sorts of ways to really fuck up our trading strategy in all sorts of creative ways. The very things we try to avoid, which in ""normal life can be easy"", in the stock market, are impossible. If your wife/husband asks you if you look fat, you can tell a white lie. If a stock goes down and you own it, no lie will bail you out.

The stock market doesn't give a shit about how much money we make or lose, it's totally objective. Therefore, saying it's ""rigged"" or ""manipulated"" is totally irrelevant because it is rigged for all of us with few exceptions.

What we Can't Control

The reality of trading in terms of control is simple. It's much better to avoid things we can't control as the energy expended in this way removes focus from what we can control.

Very easy to say but the long term impact will be successful trading or mediocre trading. As it turns out, we can't actually control the entire world - who would have thought! Some examples:

1. If a stock goes up or down
2. Black Swan events #Rona-19, 2008
3. How much the central bank prints or doesn't print
4. How governments will react to certain situations
5. Anything to do with the news
6. If country A decides to bomb country B
7. People (long term)
8. Interest rates

Ironically, the things outside of our control are what freak us out of positions, push us into making rash buying or selling decisions and trigger our fight or flight reactions and derail any half-decent trading plan.

I will openly admit I spend too much time on what I can't control. When it comes to people, stressful situations and even macro-economics. It is very hard to drown out the inputs from social media, friends, family and others. Even worse still is to avoid holding strong opinions on all of the

**So What Can we Control**

All is not lost though. If we could not control any variables in our stock market endeavors it would be pretty damn pointless to trade. The ingredients for success are truly found in the decisions we make in relation to:

1. When we buy a stock
2. When we sell a stock
3. What strategy we decide upon
4. Our environment
5. How much of whatever we buy or sell
6. The types of things we decide to watch, listen to and or read
7. The people we surround ourselves with
8. The daily habits we create around trading
9. Keeping a trading journal
10. Trading reviews

The significant difference between what we can and can't control is this little thing called **effort**.

It takes **significant effort** to find, test, understand and lose money when we start trading, the learning curve really can't be understated. Even worse, those who do well initially end up getting ruined because the precedent is set that ""this is easy"". That lack of experience always catches up, be it in stocks or any other pursuit. This is the Dunning Kruger effect in action.

Having logged my trades for a number of years, many patterns show up and repeat themselves most notably in times of duress. For me personally this included the following  - for which I now am 100% accountable.

1. Buying too soon, usually due to FOMO
2. Selling too soon, usually due to fear
3. Buying on tips from Twitter and friends - the worst of the worst, I still fall for this one
4. Not taking trades out of fear

These are just a few which were underpinned by one major theme: **not following my trading plan.**

Sure, I still have my days and even months where I have lost control of my process and am tired, sick of everything and slip up. Yes of course, it costs me money every time and if you think I have down days because of it - you are absolutely correct. The real difference now is I know where I am going wrong, that I can improve it and make serious money trading stocks in the long run. **I know what I can and can not control.**

It all starts with having a clear plan, a very understandable unambiguous trading system, tons of real trades and a meticulous journal to keep track of where you are winning and losing.

Over time, taking these lessons and reshaping habits, patterns and hang-ups to eventually become consistent and eventually have it down to a performance art.

The apex of these points is total control over what you do during the trading day, how you can manage your emotion and execute that trading plan. The ability to follow this plan and learn from will either create or destroy potential traders, especially in the long run.

Looking ahead, highlights include US services PMIS, UK Budget, US ADP, ISM services, DoES, OPEC JMMC, ECB's Panetta, de Guindos, Schnabel, Fed's Harker, Bostic, Evans, BoE's Tenreyro

&amp;#x200B;

USD - The Buck is trying to stop the rot and draw lines in the sand right across the board following yesterday's fall from grace, with some assistance from a resumption in UST bear-steepening that has pulled the recovery rug from bonds in general.

However the DXY only just evaded a cleardownside breach of the 90.627 within a 90.871-626 band and the Dollar remains mixed vs major counterparts and weaker for choice against EMs ahead of a busy agenda including weekly MBA mortgage applications, ADP, the final Markit services and composite PMIs, non-manufacturing ISM and more Fed speak before the latest Beige Book.

&amp;#x200B;

GBP/NZD/AUD/CAD - All firmer vs the Greenback, as Sterling hovers around 1.4000 in the run up to the UK Budget and the Pound also picks up momentum relative to the Euro following indecision in the cross around 0.8650 even though final services and composite PMIs were somewhat underwhelming vs manufacturing, flash readings and their Eurozone prints.

Meanwhile, the Kiwi is holding near 0.7300 where 1.4 bn option expiries lie in wake of eyewatering rises in GDT auction prices, the Aussie has taken firmer grip of the 0.7800 handle on the back of firmer than expected Q4 GDP and the Loonie has extended gains to test 1.2600 following decent Canadian Q4 growth and gleaning support from firm crude prices ahead of building permits.

&amp;#x200B;

EUR - Not the biggest net mover or even on a cumulative basis, but in focus amidst the aforementioned mostly firmer than forecast Eurozone PMIs, bar German for a change, and an ECB report via sources suggesting that the GC sees no need to take drastic action to cap debt yields, in contrast to some officials that have advocated enlarging the PEPP. Eur/Usd is back below 1.2100 from circa 1.2113 at one stage when a 38.2% Fib retracement level was hurdled (1.2088) to expose a 50% Fib (1.2117) of the same pull-back from 1.2243 to 1.1992.

&amp;#x200B;

CHF/JPY - The Franc is looking rather deflated after weaker than anticipated Swiss CPI, with Usd/Chf pivoting 0.9150 and Eur/Chf revisiting recent peaks into 1.1100, but the Yen is underperforming and still looking vulnerable to losing its battle to stay afloat of 107.00 given dovish Boj vibes from Kataoka overnight.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-3-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow futures jump after Tuesday’s early gain fizzles and reverses

&gt; * The Dow is set to rise 200 points Wednesday after late-day selling reversed strong gains earlier in Tuesday’s session. Coming off their best days since November, the 30-stock average Tuesday fell 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 1.7% as tech stocks pulled back. The S&amp;P 500 slid 0.8%, a day after its biggest one-day advance since June.

&gt; * The latest ADP report on private sector employment is set for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before Wall Street’s open. U.S. companies are expected to have added 225,000 new jobs in February compared to January of gains 174,000 positions. The ADP lately has not been the best predictor of the government’s monthly jobs report, which comes out Friday.

&gt; # 2. Senate to begin debate soon on $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill

&gt; * The Senate is expected to start debate as soon as Wednesday on its version of the House-passed, $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. However, it excludes a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Democrats to stand united and approve the measure, even as some party moderates sought to dial back parts of the package. Democrats, with the slimmest of margins in the Senate, are using special rules that would allow them to pass the bill without GOP support.

*****

&gt; # 3. U.S. will have enough Covid vaccines for ‘every adult’ by end of May

&gt; * The U.S. will have a large enough supply of coronavirus vaccines to inoculate “every adult in America” by the end of May, two months earlier than previously expected, Biden said at the White House on Tuesday. The announcement came as the administration works to increase production of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s newly cleared single-shot vaccine, and rival Merck agrees to pitch in.

&gt; * The Republican governors of Texas and Mississippi both announced Tuesday that they’re lifting mask mandates in their states and allowing businesses to reopen at full capacity even as the decline in new daily Covid-19 cases slows. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Monday warned states against lifting public health restrictions too quickly.

*****

&gt; # 4. America’s biggest firms push for path to citizenship for ‘Dreamers’

&gt; * America’s biggest companies are urging Congress to establish a permanent path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. In a letter Wednesday, a coalition of more than 100 companies and trade associations — including Facebook, General Motors, Marriott, Target, Visa and Uber — asked Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to pass the bipartisan Dream Act of 2021. The move comes as Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill look to immigration as a major legislative priority.

*****

&gt; # 5. Stocks to watch: Rocket Companies, Las Vegas Sands, Oscar Health

&gt; * Rocket Companies fell 6% in Wednesday’s premarket trading after more than doubling over the past three sessions. On Tuesday, the Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage parent surged over 71% on no apparent news. The heavily shorted stock appears to have garnered bullish interest from day traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.

&gt; * Casino operator Las Vegas Sands said Wednesday it would sell its Vegas real estate and operations to private equity giant Apollo Global Management for about $6.25 billion. The properties include the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Sands Expo and Convention Center. Shares of Las Vegas Sands were up almost 3% in the premarket. Apollo fell nearly 1%.

&gt; * Oscar Health is set to debut Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The health insurance startup backed by Google-parent Alphabet priced its initial public offering Tuesday evening at $39 per share, above the already-raised expected range of $36 to $38. The IPO gives Oscar Health a market value of $7.7 billion ahead of trading.

&gt; **Nordstrom (JWN)** – Nordstrom earned 21 cents per share for its latest quarter, 7 cents a share above estimates. The retailer also reported better-than-expected revenue.

defi,Looking for advice in terms of fundraising,"In the coming years, I, like many other users, hope to see every financial service we use in today's fiat system rebuild for the crypto ecosystem. It is important for me to take part in it and make a contribution to DeFi, namely to catch up with today's financial services industry. As an entrepreneur, I need your advice on financing my DeFi project.

My brainchild is the DeFi Wallet designed to give users full control and secure custody of their crypto. It works quite simply: you pick a coin to lend, pick a smart contract, and enter the amount you wish to lend. Your crypto is then deployed directly to the smart contract to start earning interest. Once you’ve loaned out your crypto through the app you can watch your interest grow. The earning interest rates up to 9%.

What is the most relevant option to raise the first capital? Where can I list my project to receive funding?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I owe some money on state income taxes from previous years. In how much trouble am I?,"Hi!

I came to college in the US a few years ago, and had a taxable stipend as part of my financial aid. I paid federal income tax every year, but apparently I also had to pay state income tax, and I never did (I want to blame the software that the University provided us with, but I know I should have been more informed). I got a letter from the [IL] revenue department saying I owed X amount from 2015, and I realized I probably also owe money from 2016-2019. I have the resources to pay now, but I am worried I may be in legal trouble or something like that. How should I go about fixing this?",finance
personalfinance,New Home Purchase - How much down payment?,"An overview of my financial/personal situation

-Western PA, medium to low cost of living area
-Make around 120k annually
-34 years old, 2 young kids (both under 3), with a wife that's currently staying home with them.
-Have about 85k in cash in bank accounts
-Have about 220k in retirement (couple different 401ks).
-Only debt I have is a 17k car loan (high 3's interest rate) that has a $320 monthly payment, a credit card I pay off every month that I utilize for the rewards.

We are under contract for a new house. For the new house, I have a 2.5% 30 year fix loan. We are currently contingent with the sale of our current home. When that sells, I will net around 220k after paying off 1st mortgage, realtor fees, taxes, etc. 

The way the new mortgage is structured as of this moment, I am putting 170k down, which is roughly a 33% down payment. I have been thinking of pivoting and just putting the minimum 20% down to avoid PMI and that would equate to around 104k down (freeing up an additional 65k in cash). With how low the interest is, doesn't it make more sense to borrow MORE money and use the excess cash for other investment vehicles that will return a ROI better than 2.5%?

At 170k down, PITIA payment is around $2,000monthly. 
At 105k down, PITIA payment is around $2,260 monthly

My current plans with the excess funds
-Open a roth IRA for my son and for my daughter for college (I've read this is better than a 529 plan)
-Buy additional furniture (it's a bigger home)
-maybe pay off my car loan?
-Open a brokerage account at either fidelity or schwab or somewhere similar and probably input around 30k for initial funding.
-All that totals around 65k, and the remaining money funds of 50k keep in either a CD or high yield savings for emergency funds. 
-keep around 80-90k in cash

We got 1 preapproval for the mortgage we want, but I want to shop around since even the smallest difference in interest rate magnifies over the 30 year length of the loan. The bullshit catch-22 is they give you a hard inquiry for each preapproval, which of course makes the interest rate worse with each hit. My credit is excellent and my girlfriends is over 700 and we would like to keep it that way if possible.

personalfinance,Hit my EF and now thinking of investing but don't know where to start (24yo),"I make around 40-45k annually and have 42k of federal student debt. My interest rates are 5% and below. Due to covid forbearance I stopped making payments and built up my emergency fund. Now that my emergency fund is where I want it to be, I'm looking to use the snowball approach to start paying off my loans. I don't want to pour all of my money into my student loans given the political climate currently and possibly a 10k forgiveness.. With that said I'm thinking of investing a portion of my money for eventually purchasing a house, wedding, more student loans and etc. I am currently contributing 6% to a roth 401k my company offers. 

Is me looking to invest a smart or dumb move? I just dont want to wait to pay off all of my student debt before I start having some money aside for other things other than retirement. 

Should I open up a roth IRA or a brokerage account? 

I am 24 years old and trying to make smart financial decisions, any advice helps. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Invest student loan savings during deferment, or hold and pay off a big chunk when payments resume?","I have about $26k in student loan debt from undergrad. Average interest rate is 4.5%.  My monthly payments are around $290/mo and I have set aside these payments since the student loan deferment began last year. I use YNAB and I can see that I have set aside around $3,500 for these payments.  

My question is, would it be worthwhile to open an IRA and invest this money instead of it just sitting around in my bank account?  I do not qualify for 401k matching through my employer for another two years, and haven't opened an IRA before.  After next month, I will have finished my 6 month emergency fund so I am ready to move on to the next step of the PF prime directive. I make around $42,000/year.

I am having a hard time determining if it would be better to aggressively pay down my student loans, or just make the minimum payments and invest the rest.  I understand that my student loans would provide a guaranteed 4.5% return, but with the possibility of some forgiveness in the air, and with the deferment going on, I don't know if paying down right now is the best idea.  Also, not 100% sure on Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA or 401k.  Does it make sense to invest this money I've saved?",finance

personalfinance,Odd scam affecting a coworker; has anyone seen this type of thing?,"Hopefully someone in this sub has encountered a similar scam. This situation doesn't seem like a ""glitch"", but it also seems like a very inefficient way to commit a possible crime.



Here's what is happening from the co-worker's perspective:
1. Has FedEx shipping notifications at his address (West Coast USA)
2. Receives notification that 25 packages have ""shipped"" from his address
3. Cannot find record of payment for these outbound shipments
4. Few days later, corporate vendors start contacting him to ask about orders he's placed
5. He's super confused and has to message each vendor that he is unaware of anything regarding the order or payment
6. He has no unrecognized charges to any of his accounts



Here's what I believe to be the perspective of the vendors who received the checks:
1. FedEx envelope with an origin address that matches my co-worker's home comes into their Accounts Receivable desk
2. Inside the envelope is a check; sometimes ranging upwards of $200,000
3. Checks appear to be from real credit unions and regional banks (All over the USA)
4. Checks have correct routing #s and are printed on real check-stock
5. Enclosed in the envelope is a reference to an unrecognized PO/Invoice number... no bill of sale details of specific items requested
6. Accounts receivable is confused and does not process the check since there is no order to execute upon
7. Accounts receivable tries to contact name on the letter/package, which leads them to my co-worker



So my guessing is that some scammer has spent great lengths to:
1. Create fake?/real? paper checks from various bank accounts across the USA
2. Put them into real Fedex [E] Express envelopes
3. Reference my co-worker's info as the originator
4. Pay to generate a waybill and mail the letters

I think someone is trying to launder money from hacked small/medium business accounts. But they're doing it in such a weird way that I cannot fathom how the perpetrator would actually succeed unless one of the vendors actually sends out random goods on a random purchase order. And I guess using my coworker's address became a smokescreen to deflect suspicion onto a random person.
Even if my co-worker was the sus one, this ploy still makes no sense.

investing,Theory for Market Outlook in back half of 2021 - please poke holes,"Economy has been heating up for the last quarter or two. As economy heats up with the gradual reopening we have seen in last few quarters inflation has slowly ticked up alongside. I’m hardly the only person that has noticed. My thesis is that with the additional $1.9B stimmy being injected into an economy that is already running hot we will start to overheat more. Then when vaccine rollout completes the economy flips into straight nuclear growth mode with ridiculous pent up demand exploding into the market back half of the year. This makes inflation run through the fuckin roof. With runaway inflation the Fed has one real option (correct me if I’m off here) which is to raise rates. The market has priced equites with the assumption that rates stay at 0 until 2023. I see the potential for the Fed to be cornered with inflationary pressure to raise sooner and the stock market absolutely shitting itself, similar to the last taper tantrum. Only this time, Fed can’t walk it back because they have no choice. 

Please point out any blind spots in this theory. This potentially shifts my whole investment approach for the rest of this year.

Edit: Thank you to all for your input, really love having educated discussions like this and I hope it helps prove a sounding board for your theses as well.

personalfinance,"Hopeless, I don't know how I'm supposed to get ahead... Discouraged twenty something","A bit of backstory... I put myself through college and managed to graduate without debt by being extremely savvy with scholarships, generally working my ass off at 2 jobs, and going to a really boring rural school that was affordable. I have always been scrappy and frugal, and have been keeping meticulous spreadsheets detailing all of my expenses and income since I was on my own at 18. I have always, always, saved money each month. This comes in handy now that...

I got out of college took a job paying 30K a year in a capital city. I moved, got the cheapest place I could afford to live alone, and continued keeping careful track of every penny I spent. Each month, the money was so tight but I would manage to stock away $100-200 a month. Today, I realized that I made a stupid error on my W4 and had all federal income tax withheld for the year of 2020. I can't begin to fathom how I could owe MORE on top of all of the mandatory contributions, state taxes and social security that's taken out of each check. I will have to take money out of savings to cover the cost of taxes.. in between federal and state I am projected to owe $1700. I don't know how I will be able to survive now that I've corrected the error and my monthly checks will reflect the federal taxes. Already, I am struggling to put anything away at the end of each month. I have been lucky to be covered by a parent's health insurance all this time, but those benefits expire in a few months. How can I afford to pay money for health insurance on top of all of my other bills? How can I afford to plan for retirement? What happens when my car with almost 300,000 miles kicks the bucket?

I do not live a lavish lifestyle. I don't go out to eat, go on trips, or spend money on unessential material goods. The only reason I have some semblance of calm right now is because I have been saving my entire life for the smack of reality I've received today. But when the savings run out, and I can't get ahead, what do I do? Every time it feels like I'm getting ahead I fall back to where I was before. I'm soon to be 26 and feel like it shouldn't be this hard. I work 40 hours a week, quite frankly hate my job and have been risking my life throughout this pandemic for a check that can barely keep a roof over my head. I am burnt out from work and can't imagine taking on a part time job on the side. 

What do I do? Does this get better? Please encourage me.",finance

personalfinance,Financial Game Plane Advice (Recovery From Financial Abuse),"Edit: Oops. ""Game PLAN Advice""\*\*   


Made a throw away account for this.

I am a survivor of domestic violence and a lot happened during the 4 years (took me 2 years to get away). During that time, my ex destroyed my finances and my credit. I am now safe and finally able to focus on cleaning up the financial mess that was left. I have attempted to talk to financial advisors before but they don't understand my situation and legal options in regards to financial abuse and are always just trying to get me into whatever program they are trying to sell.

Long story short, 2 loans were taken out listing me as co-signer, and my 4 credit cards were taken and run up. I am also upside down in my car loan and it has high mileage and some minor issues. I was looking to get into something used but newer with less mileage. Can I purchase a new car in one of my businesses' names?

I am no longer afraid to fill out a police report because I was told by an advocate that I could just have one done to be kept on file and not as a start to opening any investigation (I still risk retaliation if that were to happen). Bankruptcy is not an option for me and I have too much to lose as a start-up business owner.

My credit score went from 730 to now 570s and the 2 loans/3 leftover cards are now charged off as bad debt. One of the loans was a vehicle which has now been repossessed so now that is no longer constantly dragging my score down. I pay all of my bills on time and every time I would get my score raised 20 points, his non-payments on everything would immediately drag me back down.

My game plan is to go file a police report and then send that report to each creditor so they will delete the debt from my report and not pursue me in collections or sue me. Or would I be able to just fill out a Federal Trade Commission report and give that to the creditors instead?

I owe $12,000 still on my vehicle but the trade-in value is only between 2 and 4k, leaving me upside down around $8,000. My current loan terms are still for a long time. Would it be better to just refinance it? I honestly don't want the car anymore and want something newer with less mileage. Can I use it as a trade-in and get a new loan under one of my businesses?

personalfinance,Credit Card Interest Rate Question: Is this typical?,"Hi! So I received a charge of about $70 interest on my Discover card, which previously I was getting interest charges closer to $4. I called up to ask about it so I could understand what was going on a little better, and they explained that I was on a promotional rate that had expired in January, so my interest rate shot up to 19% or so. I jokingly asked if there were any other promotions I could hop back on, and I was more seriously transferred and told that yes, there was another promotion. I could have my interest rate put down to 0% until a year from now. This was surprising to say the least, and it feels like a too good to be true situation, especially since I asked multiple times if there's anything I'd need to do on my end, or anything I should know about for later, and was assured that no, they can just kind of, do that.

I feel like there's a catch? I've only really had one credit card in my life so far, so I haven't done much balance juggling in terms of moving things over to a new card to avoid interest for a set period of time, and a lot of this still feels fairly new to me. Is this a normal thing credit card companies can do? Will it impact my credit score negatively? Just looking for a more in depth explanation, thanks!",finance

My husband worked a number of jobs in 2020, and most W2's came back fine. One, however, has reported that they withheld ~1% federal income tax. (Taxable income: $6900, Fed taxes withheld: $75.)

Too good to be true? No. There is certainly risk in the form of rug pulls, exploits, hacks, scams, and black swan events. And UI/UX barriers to overcome.

Regardless of where your employers office is and regardless of the state address on your W-2, the location where you ""work from"" is literally the location where your ass is physically planted while you are performing the work. 

Therefore, in my case if I interviewed for the job in Michigan, the main office where I originally worked from is in Michigan, my boss works at the office in Michigan, all of my co-workers work from the main office in Michigan, I regularly join calls with my coworkers who work in Michigan, BUT I have a standing agreement with my boss to let me permanently work from my living room in Texas .... then I would not have to pay income taxes in Michigan.

The state where you work from is quite literally dependent on the physical location where you are physically located while you are performing the work. Therefore it wouldn't matter if I was hired originally to take a job in Michigan for a company in Michigan. 

If I move to Texas, and decide to permanently reside in Texas because my company has now come to terms post-covid that its employees can really work from anywhere, then I would NOT have to pay income taxes to Michigan so long as I am working from home in Texas.",finance

stocks,Why the market is not crashing:,"First off, let's go straight to the point. The last few weeks have been a bloodbath for most of the market. To many, especially new traders, this seems like a full blown market crash. Well, it's not... a market crash needs a catalyst. Think back to every single crash, whether it was the dot com bubble, the housing bubble in 08, and even the flash crash on black Monday in 87' they all had a catalyst, if not many catalysts.

I keep reading over and over again in the media that the bond yeilds jumping is the reason for this market crash speculation. Let's think about this for a second though - besides the fed trying to hammer home the message to investors that the bond yeilds are absolutely no cause for concern, and actually it's not even close to reaching concerning territory yet, as well as the bond yeilds are actually signaling strength in the economy - how in the world do people come to conclusion that the market is about to crash because of this? Is there any real basis to this? Ask yourself this.

 Another narrative that i keep seeing the media push is ""the economy is overheating"". Seriously? What does that even mean? The economy is recovering so fast that the market is going to crash? This has to be the most insane thing I've read yet. I can also note that the same journalists who publish this FUD about overheating, are the same journalists who will also write that the market is crashing when there is BAD economic data (such as the job report this morning). So let's ask ourselves, how can both a booming recovery and a slow, painful recovery BOTH be ingredients for a crash? I cannot comprehend how ridiculous this is becoming. Good news = market crash, bad news = market crash. What do we need for the market not to crash? 

I can't talk about all of this without mentioning a wild phenomenon. My portfolio. A very well diversified array of etfs which hit almost all sectors of the market. The best thing to happen to it? A global pandemic/ lockdown. The worst thing? Economic strength indicators, covid cases plummeting and vaccines and stimulus getting pumped into the masses. Has the world gone mad?

My conclusion is only this. Plain and simple, fear. Fear is what's bringing this bloodbath upon us. Panic selling over irrational news articles. Just compare the VIX (fear gauge) chart with almost every single tech stock or major company's stock chart. It's literally an inverse. A mirror image.

If there is anything to take away from this is that I truly believe this is just mass hysteria and it the dust will settle. Stocks will rise again. Invest in what you believe in and avoid the FUD that's being pumped out for click bait by seemingly every news outlet.

Tl;dr: there is no crash. This is panic selling on a mass scale. Don't believe the media fud - the pandemic is ending and there is light at the end of this Corona virus tunnel. Buy the dip with money you can afford to potentially lose and all shall be good again on wallstreet. *Edit* I am not an expert, do not take this as financial advice. I was merely venting/ ranting during this paragraph. Only invest what you are willing to lose. 

Edit: I almost forgot to mention a big one: 

Another theory that is floating around is the market being in a bubble. This is probably the most spread rumor. This one is pretty simple to shut down I think. Earnings season was insane. Comoanjes blew estimates out of the water left and right. Banks, big tech, e commerce, etc. These are the sectors that are being targeted heavily by fud in the media. These are also the companies doing the best they ever have. So how is this a bubble? Of course, companies like tesla and gamestop (lol) can be viewed and argued as in a bubble. But these companies are few and far between.

Edit#2 as someone here pointed out, the current p/e ratio is at around 40 for the s&amp;p500. Is this really a cause for concern? The all time high for p/e of the s&amp;p is may 2009.

Stocks fell for the second straight day, with technology stocks dropping sharply as the Treasury yield ticked higher once again. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.3%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.7%, the second consecutive decline for the tech-heavy index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held up better, edging down 0.4%.

President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate. As a reminder, over the weekend, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (JNJ) single dose vaccine received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), making it the third coronavirus vaccine available in the US, following Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA). Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced it was going to help Johnson &amp; Johnson produce its coronavirus vaccine. 

In other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation. Reconciliation is a way for Congress to enact legislation on taxes, spending, and the debt limit with a simple majority (51 votes, or 50 if the vice president breaks a tie) in the Senate, avoiding the threat of a filibuster, which requires a 60 vote supermajority to overcome. Because Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate—plus a Democratic vice president—reconciliation is a way to get a tax-and-spending bill to the president’s desk even if all 50 Republicans oppose it

The likelihood of more stimulus and widespread business reopenings as the vaccine is distributewd has raised the specter of both speedy growth in the U.S. economy and rising inflationary pressures. Last week's jump in Treasury yields – with the benchmark 10-year yield reaching a one-year high of 1.61% – remains fresh in the minds of investors, who have been eyeing the rise in interest rates as a possible hindrance to the recovery and deviation from last year's ultra-low borrowing costs backdrop. The 10-year Treasury yield currently sits at 1.48% at the time of writing.

stocks,The case for inflation: Simple math in layman's terms,"Hi team,

I had a lot of traction with my previous post on $ARKK so I thought I would lay out a very simple case as to why, in my view and others, we may experience more inflation in the coming years than the US has experienced in the last 50 years, and the potential implications of such a scenario.

**********************

The math is simple and it relies on two basic concepts from Macroeconomics 101:

1. M2 Money Supply - this is an estimate published by the Federal Reserve that approximates dollars in circulation (and things like savings accounts, money market funds, and other sources that are liquid and can behave like cash)

2. M2 Velocity of Money - Also published by the Fed, this seeks to estimate the number of times that each dollar in M2 exchanges hands over the course of the year (turnover)

The equation linking these two concepts to Gross Domestic Product is quite simple as well.

M2 Money Supply x M2 Velocity = Nominal Gross Domestic Product (NGDP)

What we saw throughout 2020, as a result of the pandemic and the fiscal and monetary policies that followed, was a substantial increase in money supply (stimulus) and a substantial decrease in the velocity of money (stay-at-home orders). Based on our simple equation, these factors mostly offset each other and therefore were not visibly inflationary.

1. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 money supply increased from $15.1 trillion to $19.4 trillion (+28%)

2. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 velocity declined from 1.4 to 1.1 (-21%)

Plugging into our equation:

Year-end 2019: 1.4 x $15.1T = $21.14T annualized nominal GDP

Year-end 2020: 1.1 x $19.4T = $21.34T annualized nominal GDP

This represents a change in NGDP of just 1%! No inflation!

**********************

What happens next? Some of you have already gotten vaccines, others have already been sick and developed immunity. States have recently announced reopening completely, and national case counts are showing relatively steep declines as we approach vaccination and illness-induced herd immunity.

What does this mean? Consumer spending habits are changing. Record high savings rates and savings balances are likely to revert to normal. We'll take vacations, go to concerts, eat out at restaurants, etc - all things we haven't been able to do for the last 12 months.

This means a recovery in M2 velocity but with a new much higher base of money.

**********************

Let's look back at our equation and make a few assumptions about the recovery of velocity.

***Scenario 1: Velocity recovers to pre-COVID level at end of 2019***

1.4 x $19.4T = $27.16T NGDP (+27% compared with year-end 2020)

***Scenario 2: Velocity recovers and overshoots the pre-COVID level, say to the trailing 10-year average velocity of 1.5***

1.5 x $19.4T =$29.1T NGDP (+36% compared with year-end 2020)

***Scenario 3: Inflation becomes widely recognized and consumers/investors look for alternatives to holding cash, velocity spikes to the highest it has been in 10 years at 1.75 and inflation feeds on itself***

1.75 x $19.4T = $33.95T NGDP (+59% compared with year-end 2020)

**********************

It is likely that this inflation will be spread out over more than a year, but the key question at hand is:

*""How long will it take for the price level to reflect all of this new money in the system and how long will it take for velocity to fully recover (or overshoot)?""*

In each scenario, even if it took 2-3 years we are talking about ***double digit annualized inflation rates*** AND THAT IS BEFORE WE SEE THE IMPACT ON MONEY SUPPLY AND VELOCITY FROM YET MORE GOVERNMENT STIMULUS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED IN CONGRESS.

Inflation rates may be much higher... and despite all of this the Federal Reserve continues to say that they see no inflation, that they are content to keep short-term interest rates at zero until 2023 or later. Asleep at the wheel if you ask me.

**********************

What does it mean for r/stocks and your investment portfolio? In a nutshell, nominal interest rates are likely to rise, commodity prices (oil) will increase, real estate (REITs) values will increase, the prices of all *real assets* will increase. Companies that are able to index their revenues to inflation (pricing power!) will be able to defend their earnings, while others will see input costs skyrocket and revenues fail to keep up.

Those with fixed rate debt (e.g. 30-year fixed mortgages) will be well-protected as home prices appreciate and the dollars owed to the bank depreciate.

Those on fixed incomes and those who hold cash balances will be punished by inflation. Those who are unable to see their wages increase with inflation will see their quality of life decline. Inflation will punish those without real assets, those on fixed income pensions, and those who save their cash. There's a whole other discussion about income inequality in here but we'll leave that for another day.

stocks,The case for inflation: Simple math in layman's terms,"Hi team,

I had a lot of traction with my previous post on $ARKK so I thought I would lay out a very simple case as to why, in my view and others, we may experience more inflation in the coming years than the US has experienced in the last 50 years, and the potential implications of such a scenario.

**********************

The math is simple and it relies on two basic concepts from Macroeconomics 101:

1. M2 Money Supply - this is an estimate published by the Federal Reserve that approximates dollars in circulation (and things like savings accounts, money market funds, and other sources that are liquid and can behave like cash)

2. M2 Velocity of Money - Also published by the Fed, this seeks to estimate the number of times that each dollar in M2 exchanges hands over the course of the year (turnover)

The equation linking these two concepts to Gross Domestic Product is quite simple as well.

M2 Money Supply x M2 Velocity = Nominal Gross Domestic Product (NGDP)

**********************

What we saw throughout 2020, as a result of the pandemic and the fiscal and monetary policies that followed, was a substantial increase in money supply (stimulus) and a substantial decrease in the velocity of money (stay-at-home orders).

1. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 money supply increased from $15.1 trillion to $19.4 trillion (+28%) Note: Fastest growth rate since WWII

2. From year-end 2019 to year-end 2020, M2 velocity declined from 1.4 to 1.1 (-21%)

Plugging into our equation:

Year-end 2019: 1.4 x $15.1T = $21.14T annualized nominal GDP

Year-end 2020: 1.1 x $19.4T = $21.34T annualized nominal GDP

*AND THAT IS BEFORE WE SEE THE IMPACT ON MONEY SUPPLY AND VELOCITY FROM YET MORE GOVERNMENT STIMULUS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED IN CONGRESS.*

Inflation rates may be *much higher* than the figures outlined above... and despite all of this the Federal Reserve continues to say that they see no inflation, that they are content to keep short-term interest rates at zero until 2023 or later. Asleep at the wheel if you ask me.

2. Companies that are able to index their revenues to inflation (pricing power!) will be able to defend their earnings, while others will see input costs skyrocket and revenues fail to keep up.

3. The equity markets are going to be volatile, with winners and losers. Companies that are highly leveraged and don't have pricing power may go bankrupt when they need to refinance debts at higher rates.

4. Other companies with pricing power, low variable costs, or durable intellectual property will be huge winners.

5. Tech/growth stocks that trade at obscenely rich valuation and who promise real profits years or decades into the future are going to get smashed. These so called ""long-duration"" equities, many of which are favorites on r/stocks and r/wallstreetbets, even if they survive, may go from trading at 25-50x trailing revenues (on zero net income) to 5-10x revenue or less - examples: SHOP trades at 50x trailing revenues and 470x trailing earnings, ROKU trades at 27x trailing revenue on *negative earnings*. 

6. In relation to point 5, inflation-driven equity volatility is likely to result in *higher equity risk premiums*, or higher discount rates on forecasted growth. 

7. Those with fixed rate debt (e.g. 30-year fixed mortgages) will be well-protected as home prices appreciate and the dollars owed to the bank depreciate.

8. Those on fixed incomes and those who hold cash balances will be punished by inflation. Those who are unable to see their wages increase with inflation (American middle class) will see their quality of life decline. Inflation will punish those without real assets, those on fixed income pensions, and those who save their cash.

personalfinance,Stressing over Student Debt/Savings/Investing,"Hello, I have been graduated from college for about 2 and a half years now and when I graduated my student debt was arond $63k with monthly payments of about $700 each month. My starting salary was about $74k. 

Since I started working, I have been able to get a savings account with about $6k, my 401k through work is around $37k, an additional personal ETRADE account I have where I use my after tax dollars and thats at around $17k.

My student debt since then has gone down to about $46k, composed of a federal and private loan, both at about $23k each

* One loan is $500 a month, private, 4% and 5 year payment plan. Should be done in about 4 years now
* The second loan is $267 a month, federal 4% as well(currently 0), and has about 8 years left.

&amp;#x200B;

My question for all you handsome people, what are your thoughts on me selling a good portion of my personal Etrade acconut money to help knock down the private loan? My thought process is if I can pay off the debt it will be like a $500 raise every month that I could put back into etrade or start saving for a house. I currently live comfortably and typically wil save/invest/pay down about $700 extra each month with my excess money. And I know each person is different on this issue and it really does come down to myself, but I would like to hear your thoughts as well. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Should I use money from personal etrade account to pay down/off private student loan, so I can in turn have an extra $500 a month, or just keep mixing my excess money into savings/inivesting/paying down loans slowly",finance
personalfinance,I’m finally reaching a place of financial stability and don’t think I’m emotionally equipped for it. I want to buy a home and I don’t trust what the budget calculators tell me.,"Hi, everyone. I apologize in advance because I’m on the spectrum and i know this is going to get long winded or rambly.

I’m in need of financial advice but also.... moral support? Emotional money advice?

my husband and I are in our mid/early 30’s and, for the first time ever, we are entering a stage of financial stability after spending our entire adulthood thus far pretty broke and very in debt. 

Like a lot of people, we of course had big dreams of being financially stable and homeowners and all that good stuff, but it felt so hopeless and the pit of debt was so deep, that we just kind of gave up eventually. We were low wage retail employees for most of our 20’s and relied on credit cards for everything. We grew up in lower income families who never taught us to have healthy relationships with money. 

About 4 years ago we both started good corporate jobs with decent pay, but the debt hole was so deep, and a little lifestyle creep happened too, so we just stayed stuck in the cycle. 

For the past few years, our monthly debt obligations were more than our rent even. It got so depressing that we stopped trying to save and just started enjoying going out to eat and buying ourselves nice things, because we figured we were stuck here and our jobs were so stressful anyway, so we may as well enjoy it. We basically said “fuck it” and other than using YNAB to make sure we could pay our bills and not overdraft, we stopped giving a crap about paying off debt or saving. (Edit: what i mean is, we have not had to use our credit cards for over a year, but we didn’t have much extra to snowball them, so we had not been making huge payoff-amount payments, just paying minimums or extra when we can. We have not accumulated new debt since 2019, we just also haven’t made massive progress in paying off either, until recently)

And then...suddenly... when we least expected it, within the past 4 months we had a bit of an avalanche of financial positivity. 

First my husband got a huge raise unexpectedly. I then got a large chunk of retroactive missing pay from my job and used it to pay off a couple old giant personal loans AND I paid off my car early. 

Last month we also ended the lease on my husband’s car. We aren’t replacing it because we both wfh and don’t need two cars.

And NOW I just got a giant raise and a giant bonus that I was not expecting. Like, my bonus is big enough to be a small down payment on a house. 

We still have about $20k in credit card debt, but I set up a snowball calculator that has us paying it all off this September, and that’s considering I budgeted conservatively for the snowball.

Basically, we very suddenly, after raises and paying off loans and cars, have like five thousand (edit: actually around 4K, I rounded up, bad mental math) more dollars a month in disposable income. I feel bad and uncomfortable talking about this because I don’t want to brag. I’m just... shocked and overwhelmed. I’m here on Reddit because I don’t feel like I can tell anyone in my real life. 

My dream for so many years was to own a home but we had kind of given up - now the dream is back on???

We have decided to start researching home buying while we snowball the remaining credit cards, and because I’ve never had this much money before, I don’t even know what our home budget could even be. I’m also very bad at math. 

last night i did a bunch of the mortgage calculators you can find online and they all tell me we can comfortably afford a mortgage anywhere from 400k to even mid 500k depending on how I play around with the down payment and interest rates.

I even padded and rounded up our debts and obligations when I do the calculators, and it still gives me these numbers.

I’m beside myself. I want to throw up. I can’t believe it. This is so much more than I expected. 

We could buy ourselves a nice home in a nice neighborhoods we’ve always driven through and daydreamed about.... ??? We’ve been living in a 700 sq ft roach trap condo we rent from family in a crummy neighborhood for a decade because that was all we could afford, with all our other financial obligations. 

Now, browsing zillow, looking at the nice homes I could maybe afford, I’m just in disbelief. It doesn’t feel real and I’m incredibly suspicious. Are these calculators for real??? I keep saying I must have typed in a number wrong, but they all come back the same.

I guess tldr:

1) can I trust these online mortgage calculators? What really is the equation I should be doing to figure out my home buying budget? What should I be considering when calculating this?

2) how do you go from being eternally broke to suddenly having disposable income? How do you cultivate a healthy sense of gratitude and appreciation for what you have without becoming selfish and greedy? I’m so scared of losing it all, so I want to hoard it and be cheap, because I’m afraid of losing sight of things and blowing up my lifestyle. I want to stay humble and frugal but also enjoy and appreciate what we’ve worked so hard for. Do I need therapy? Any advice on how to adapt to this would be greatly appreciated.


Edit to add: I don’t think I explained this well, but my raise and bonus were just told to me today. I haven’t received it yet, so I just doing preemptive math and day dreaming. We started snowballing our debt a few months ago starting with large loans and car debt. 

Today when I found out about my upcoming bonus my instinct was to use it to pay off the remaining credit cards all at once, but my husband and I are paranoid of not having an emergency fund so we thought we would hold onto it and just keep snowballing the debt instead since we can afford 3 to almost 5k monthly. My snowball calculator has a low ball payment amount but we send as much as we can each month, so September is a really modest estimate. My goal is much sooner. We don’t want to buy a house until the debt is gone, the comment about the bonus being a downpayment that was a hypothetical to illustrate the amount. HOWEVER - Seeing as how I know nothing about personal finance and what to turn my life around and start making good choices, i am open to all advice and want to know: SHOULD I just pay off all the debt immediately and rebuild the e-fund/house fund from scratch? I am looking for advice because I really don’t know what’s the right thing to do. Thanks everyone 🥲",finance

stocks,The Power of the FED,"I am seeing a lot of posts here talking about corrections and crashes so I just wanted to point out one thing that I believe is quite unique in the current market situation. For starters, my buddy started getting into the market a few months before the COVID crash in March. I believed that this was a bad idea because I thought that the market was due for a correction with the way that companies like $TSLA were running up the debt in expectations of future growth and revenue flow. The FED was beginning to [raise rates] (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS) prior to the COVID crash, signaling, at least somewhat, the end of rampant speculative investing in the name of future growth. However, we all know what happened next. The coronavirus hit, and the FED decided to drop rates to the floor. They are now actively engaged in monetary policy and money management to a level that I don't think they have been inclined to do so prior. Furthermore, I think we can all acknowledge that Alan Greenspan and Bernanke to some extent were definitely asleep at the wheel, scared to do too much with monetary policy for the simple reason that they did not want to get into a liquidity trap and have no remedies to alleviate any crises on the horizon. At least, I give this much credit to Bernanke, but Greenspan was literally just incompetent or just hated regulating the banks and firms that much in my personal opinion.

The point of all this is that Jerome Powell and the rest of the FED, at this time, has such a heavy hand in the market compared to the FED pre-COVID, and *especially* pre-2013. They literally cannot afford to let any major market crash occur simply because they have a plan that they have to stick to in order to get America back on track in a major way. This is not to say that a major correction or crash CANNOT occur, but I do believe personally that the FED has more of an interest in not letting this go tits up than ever before. GDP growth in the U.S. has been at dismal levels for quite a while and inflation has been MIA. With the post-COVID economic recovery on the horizon, I believe that the FED sees extremely loose monetary policy as a way to kill these two birds with one stone.

Finally, what I think is somewhat proof of this. The fact that after the COVID crash, the market literally only went up. I am not saying 2020 market growth is sustainable forever or even if its here to stay, but merely using it as an example to show how powerful the FED is right now when it comes to manipulating and ensuring strong market conditions for institutional investors. I thought that rates so low was a recipe for disaster as the FED would have no real policy to mitigate against COVID ravaging the economy for the foreseeable future. However, I was forced to eat my words as to what the FED was doing and how the market was reacting (and my friend's positions) as, so far, a low interest rate policy *has worked and has shown no real signs of failure*. The FED has shown absolutely NO interest in raising rates for the next two years and any changes in the Treasuries are (in my opinion) not sufficient enough to spook them as they have such a heavy role in the current marketplace. To conclude, I am not a financial advisor, expert, or professional investor, so if you think my post is dumb, wrong, or skewed, please comment and let us have a discussion in order to further our knowledge, perspectives, and predictions of where the market is going :)

TL;DR: The FED is so heavily invested in ensuring low rates and economic recovery that it is very, very, very, very unlikely, in my personal opinion, that a major *marketwide* correction or crash will occur on Jerome Powell's watch. If one does occur, then we are truly doomed and monetary policy is bunk.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Reminder: Actually USE your cryptocurrency!,"I feel like a thread like this is a given, but I feel like sometimes it needs the reminder!

Every cryptocurrency has some useage of it, and especially if you're talented in other regards remember to actually USE the networks you're supporting!

If you're an artist and you're hearing about how much money people are making by selling artwork on the network? Make some art and submit it!

You want to buy something? Use some Nano, Bitcoin, Litecoin, BCH or anything and buy something from a local store or online vender that accepts it! Just instantly replenish your stack if you're worried about using any of your holding.

If you're using network coins (ETH, ICON, NEO, ETC) make sure you're staking them or using them to get your passive rewards to help secure the network and gain passive money!

If you're just holding casually, put your holdings into DEFI projects and EARN free money on your interest! Most exchanges (bad rates) and companies and cryptos also have solid interest rates usually above 5 % that EARNS you crypto as you're holding and also brings more people to the scene.

Are you a developer? Make something! Eth, stellar, neo, icon, all these crypto networks have A LOT of things that are needed and could be heavily used in the future! Why not spend some time on a side project to help develop the networks even more! Even if it's bad, you'll learn new tech and could possibly be useful in the next 10-15 years for possible job opportunities and resumes! Even good for ""normal"" jobs as well! Shows drive and commitment!

Some exchange coins give dividends to holding, so why not buy some more coins and trade and support your own coins?

stocks,"The Biggest Crash Since the Roaring 20's is Upon us, Here's Why.","Not financial advice.

I don’t want to scare anyone, that is not my intention in writing this post. Rather a warning to those who are less educated in what moves the market. I bet 90% of you reading this don’t even know what a government bond is (this was originally meant for WSB, I assume more than 10% of you know what Bonds are here lol). Buckle up, I’m about to blow your socks off with this publicly available information and maybe even help you not lose money, or even make some if you play it right! 

At this point I find it impossible to argue that we are not in a bubble. Let me explain why I think we are about to witness a market correction the likes of which we haven't seen since 1929.

The bond market is related to interest rates and inflation because the bonds issued by the U.S. treasury serve as a debt holding between the treasury and the fed.

A bond is basically an IOU of the government. They are debts. The treasury yield is the return you get for buying the government's debt.  

Feds control the money supply and interest rates by buying and selling bonds. To INCREASE money supply they will buy bonds back from the banks, which is the fed buying back their own debts. In turn, this gives the banks more money to put into circulation. The fed can REDUCE the money supply by selling the bonds. When this happens, it reduces money in circulation because the fed puts it in the ""safe"" so to speak. 

Rising treasury yield means lowering demand for bonds. Investors increasingly prefer high risk investments. (As seen with the disruptive growth sector exploding \[think Cathie Wood's ARK\]) 

That causes the demand for bonds to be low. When the demand is low, prices of bonds are at a discount, and the treasury yield goes up which gives an investor more incentive to buy in. 

BUT, if the demand for bonds is EXTREMELY low, how can the fed fight inflation? They can't decrease the money supply as discussed above because there's no buyers for their bonds!!! 

So instead, they print more money. 40% of all dollars in circulation were printed during the pandemic. Naturally, this makes the dollar lose value. 

The OTHER way to decrease inflation and money supply is through raising interest rates, which takes money out of circulation from the investors pockets, and back to the fed. 

HOWEVER, it is clear Jerome Powell doesn't want to raise interest rates (currently). They want borrowers to borrow more money. Banks won't do it though, as they have no incentive to do so (low interest rates are bad for banks because they make less money on their loans) 

So, they do it in the repo market. They lend money out to institutions and hedge funds, Which puts money in the stock market. This is what has been causing the massive bull run and the ""to the moon!"" or ""only go up"" sentiment of retail investors currently. 

My first big warning sign was the treasury yield hitting 1.5%. The next one would be the fed stopping repos. 

Interest rates low means everyone is naturally pumping money into the markets. 

This is because your Apple, Tesla, Google, Netflix etc have extremely high debt as compared to the biggest corporations of 50 years ago. And nowadays corporations can leverage their debt. 

So, if Company X is in 100 billion debt, they can refinance that debt from the loaner and invest the 100 billion.

so now instead of 100 billion debt it's 200 because they invested borrowed money. What happens when you invest borrowed money and the market crashes, except on a massive corporate scale? 

Debt is through the roof while investors are MANIC, no other time in history have investors been as manic now as in the 1920s. 

Think about it... roaring 20s: rich got richer poor got poorer 

But that’s just looking at it fundamentally

Attached you will find charts of $DJX, the first being 1990 to 2020 without the covid crash.

The second is $DJX from 1915 to 1945. 

[https://imgur.com/ZlBEeRM](https://imgur.com/ZlBEeRM)

In the earlier graph, there was a flash crash followed by about a year of recovery before the bigger crash ensued. Now look at the 1990-2020. We just had our covid crash, a year later we're pumping to all time highs. Look familiar?

It was a 90% correction when it all came crashing down in the roaring twenties... 

And not to get political, but Democrats have had a tendency throughout history to act like everything is okay until the very last second. Think 2007 recession with the democratic senate and house. No one thought it was a bubble, everyone was saying everything's fine. 

On top of that, Michael burry recently tweeted (I believe it was since deleted, I can't seem to find it) something along the lines of ""Last time I warned you and nobody listened. This time I warn you again, and still no one listens. But this time I will have proof I warned."" Something big is about to go down.

Much is the same, other posters have made other DD comments recently, the short interest has been beaten to death, you can read about that elsewhere.  The annual report has come out since I last posted, and since I actually sit down and read 10-K's now (yes i am old), so I'll share my thoughts:

Before I do that though, this guy from Seeking Alpha did the same, and has pretty graphs to go along with that.  I'm not going to try to write out ascii charts here in reddit markdown, so here you go:  https://seekingalpha.com/article/4408746-s-official-tanger-survived-pandemic

I'm going to repeat some of the things he does, but here's my take on the 10-K (which you can read here:  http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000899715/cb76277e-f5f1-4304-9899-6e8259a30b10.pdf)

Bullish case:

* 99% of stores back open, 99% leased square footage.  Traffic levels back to 96%, 99% if you exclude Canada.  I live very near the Tanger Outlets in Rehoboth Beach, and it is PACKED, and tourist season hasn't even started here.  Nike and Crocs in particular always seem to have lines out the door.

* For those that don't know, these aren't just strip malls or outlets in middle America -- they choose vacation/tourist destinations, where when you take a week's vacation, ""going to the outlets"" is something you do on one of the days.  *I* don't do it, I hate shopping, but it's unquestionable this happens.

* Given that these outlets are in tourist destinations, this is generally high value real estate, which obviously has shot up in value.  The 10-K states that out of the 31 outlet centers they own, they own the land underlying in 25 of them, and ground leases on 6 -- the nearest lease expires in 2024 (Riverhead, NY) but they have a 15 year option on renewal.  Granted these types of real estate holdings are relatively illiquid, but the value gives them plenty of access to credit.

* Speaking of credit, their loans are at very low interest rates, and they have plenty of available credit on hand.  Given the worst has passed, and they've already reinstated a dividend (though not fully back to what it was), there's really no risk here in regards to this.

* 95% of 4th quarter rents collected, 1% deferred, 1% under negotiation, 1% concessions/lease restructuring, only 2% at risk due to bankruptcy of tenants/financial weakness.  The stores are open, paying on time, all is basically back to normal already.

* New CEO, Stephen Yalof, starts off 2021 -- came from Simon Property Group, which is *great* -- I'll get into that bit later.


Bearish cases / danger signs:

As the SA article said, Tanger gets 16% of their rent from 4 companies:

* The Gap (Gap, Banana Republic, Janie &amp; Jack, Old Navy)
* PVH Corp (Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, Calvin Klein)
* Ascena Retail Group (LOFT, Ann Taylor, Lane Bryant, Justice)
* Under Armour (duh)

While some of those have struggled, usually there are other stores in the portfolio picking up the slack.  GAP/Banana Republic isn't doing as well, but Old Navy has been crushing it, for instance.

The risk is some of those companies don't bounce back as expected and enter bankruptcy.  Generally, the outlet stores though are the *last* to close.. random mall stores will be first, outlets will go out last.  I'm not overly familiar with what's up and coming in new clothing stores / chains / etc, so this is where, for me, it gets a little nebulous.

The base rent per square foot took a dive in 2020, but to be expected.  It was 21.10, 92% occupancy.  2019 was 97%, 25.35/sqft.  Going back further years, those #s are pretty steady -- 2016 was the best, 98%, 26.10/sqft.  So we have had some slippage, though pretty minor, from 2016-2019.  It's a question of what they can get 2021 sqft/occupancy levels back to and how quickly.

---

One thing that annoys me about Tanger Outlets though from an investor standpoint, is that restaurants are not a real part of the outlets they have.  The one by me has a Chipotle and a lol Applebee's, and that's basically it for food options.  

Having more mid-tier sit down restaurants in the outlets, so people can come shop, eat, and then shop some more, is what I'd like to see.  Given the new CEO comes from [Simon Property Group](https://www.simon.com/), and they have more restaurants in their tenant list, I'm hopeful that if there are vacancies, we'll see restaurants fill in the gap.

Disclosures:

I've been long on Tanger for a while now, own 1100 shares of stock, and Jan 2022 20c and 30c options.  My intent is to hold onto the shares for some time as I'm happy with the dividend and want to see what the new CEO does with it, but close out call positions if we get a significant pop.",finance

investing,Money printing and inflation,"Hey guys, 

because of the current craziness in the stock market I did some resesearch on the yield curve and inflation in general. I am no economic expert but with the little I know I always thought that central banks are the only actors which can ""print"" money. And right now the central banks print much more because of the pandemic. Ergo, I thought, that's why people fear inflation.

But then I stumbled over a for me shocking article of the Bank of England. The FEDs and ECBs of this world do not create most of the money in the economy.

It's the commercial banks which created 80% (!!!) of it. Each time they issue a loan they can ""print"" new money. And apparently in the EU banks only have to hold a minimum of 1% of liabilities.
Example: you put 100 € in your bank account. The bank then has to deposit 1€ as liability with the central bank. And then they can lend the remaining 99€ as credit to let's say your friend. Your friend perhaps spends 9€ immediately and puts 90€ back in his bank account. And guess what? The bank then can deposit 90 cents and create a new loan with the remaining 89,10€. 

Can anyone tell me if I understood this right? And then if this is the case and central banks up until now only account for 20% max of the total money, why is their money printing said to potentially causing inflation while noone cares about the money printing of commercial banks?! 

I seriously have problems to understand this and would appreciate if you could help and explain this to me.


Sorry in advance for my flawed English.

stocks,"DD for $OTRK - low float/possible squeeze, trading at a discount with solid long term outlook","So we all know about shorts by now, and the crazy effect they’ve had on the market lately. I’m still holding $GME with the rest of you apes and have been keeping my eye on other heavily shorted stocks for a while now, so I’d like to share with you my DD on one of them. I am not saying this will be the next $GME, I am not a financial advisor, and the following is only my amateur opinion.  I just like the stock.

$RKT is the second most shorted stock right now and while it’s coming back to earth today, it had an amazing run yesterday (+78%) and is still up 15% from Monday’s close. The #1 shorted stock (55% of float) is $KMPH which had an 80% gain premarket and is currently sitting at 50%. I did not get in on either of those stocks, and they have moved up too much recently for me to mess with them. Which brings us to the #3 shorted stock (34% of float), $OTRK. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**What is $OTRK?**

$OTRK, Ontrak, Inc., operates as an artificial intelligence powered, virtualized outpatient healthcare treatment company that provides in-person or telehealth intervention services to health plans and other third-party payors.  Its Ontrak PRE (Predict-Recommend-Engage) platform predicts people whose chronic disease will improve with behavior change, recommends care pathways that people are willing to follow, and engages people who aren't getting the care they need.  The company's technology-enabled OnTrak program is designed to treat health plan members with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that cause or exacerbate chronic medical diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, COPD, and congestive heart failure.  The OnTrak integrates evidence-based psychosocial and medical interventions delivered in-person or via telehealth along with care coaching and in-market community care coordinators who address the social and environmental determinants of health. Ontrak is known for its proprietary methodology in understanding and engaging members who need treatment, as well as for quickly translating proven science into practice. The company was formerly known as Catasys, Inc. and changed its name to Ontrak, Inc. in July 2020.  The company was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Santa Monica, California.

Telemedicine is obviously huge right now, and it’s great that they have an in-person option as well. The pandemic has also increased the need for mental health and substance abuse treatment and their AI system should help keep costs down and improve over time. And I love their mission of stopping diseases before they start, therefore reducing one’s lifetime medical costs. Unfortunately this mission is in contradiction with some health care providers’ goal of maximizing short term profits (more on this later). 

A similar company that you may have heard of is Livongo ($LVGO) which was just acquired Teladoc ($TDOC) at the end of last year. At the time, Livongo’s revenue was about 4x higher than Ontrak’s current revenue, and they had a lower EPS of -$0.26. And the deal valued Livomgo at $18.5 billion! Up to the merger, $TDOC and $LVGO were up 153% and 431% YTD, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR;** They are an in-person and telemedicine B2B provider that uses AI to address behavioral health and substance abuse in order to prevent other, more serious conditions. They have a very high growth potential and are a prime target for acquisition.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats**

Ontrak, Inc. is a small company. With a market cap of only $506M, they are unfortunately (fortunately?) too small for me to post about them on WallStreetBets. They have impressive financials, however, and have shown consistent improvement over the past 5 years. They just pre-released 2020 Q4 financials on March 1, and the full earnings report is scheduled for March 9.  EPS of -$0.07 beat expectations of -$0.30. Revenue for the full year of 2020 was $82.8 million, representing a 136% increase from 2019 and a CAGR of 120% since 2017. They have also continued to show considerable improvement in all valuation, profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios. Their balance sheet is strong too, as they are sitting on $86.91M in cash. And here are the other highlights from their March 1 press release:

&amp;#x200B;

* Record Quarterly      Revenue of $29.3 million in Q4 2020, up 149% year over year and up 22%      from Q3 2020
* Operating loss of $1.8      million in Q4 2020, a 74% improvement year over year
* Record Quarterly      Adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million in Q4 2020, achieving quarterly positive      Adjusted EBITDA for the first time
* Full Year Revenue of      $82.8 million, up 136% Year over Year
* 2021 Outlook revenue of      $100 Million
* Raised $44.9 million in      Q4 2020, $41.4 million net of related fees, by completing a second      offering of Non-Convertible Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock
* Acquired LifeDojo Inc.      in Q4 2020 ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201029005301/en/Ontrak-Acquires-Science-Backed-Behavior-Change-Platform-LifeDojo-Inc](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201029005301/en/Ontrak-Acquires-Science-Backed-Behavior-Change-Platform-LifeDojo-Inc))

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Why the drop?**

$OTRK is currently down around 74% from its 52-week high of $99.89 reached on January 27, was downgraded by a few analysts yesterday, and so far four law firms have announced that they are “investigating” the recent drop. This all seems to come from the typical playbook of the shorts, and I expect more negative news to come. There was a catalyst, however I believe the shorts are hiding behind this and using it to induce an overreaction. It also wouldn’t surprise me if some of the top holders are involved so they can make a quick profit and increase their long position. 

The catalyst was their announcement in their March 1 press release that they have lost their biggest customer, Aetna. From the release, Aetna is focused on “the lowest possible cost per medical visit, and not on clinical outcomes data or medical cost savings, which were meaningful and significant.” So as I mentioned earlier, this model conflicts with the goal of maximizing short term profits.  This is huge news, as Aetna provides 64% of their revenue, but the contract doesn’t expire until June 26 and the company is hoping to rebound quickly.  As the CEO mentions in the release, “We have a strategy in place to regain the Ontrak-A business and are *currently in late stage discussions with other customers* whose metrics align with our value proposition of an integrated approach to whole health that delivers an average ROI of 3.7, average cost savings of 40% to 50%, and durable clinical outcomes with exceptionally high program retention and member experience scores. Collectively, we have a *market opportunity of over $30 billion*.""

This news did cause Ontrak to adjust their estimated 2021 total revenue down to $100M from their previous estimate of $165M. This is a sizable decrease of 39%, however the stock is down almost twice that amount. $100M is also still an increase of 21% from 2020 revenue, and they project to return to 100% revenue growth in 2022. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR;** The company just lost their biggest customer, and revenue estimates have fallen significantly. The market has overreacted, however, indicating investors believe more customers may leave as well. Company guidance seems to indicate the opposite and projected financials are still strong. Trading at a huge discount IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The Short**

As I said, Ontrak is a very small company. They are shorted 34% of float (4.76 short ratio), but that only represents 2.52M shares as their float is only at 7.2M. That’s lower than the total amount of WSB subscribers and only 3 shares per member of r/stocks! This could be a stock where our community actually does have some power. And while the shorts have succeeded in the past few days, there are currently only 250k shares available to borrow ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/OTRK](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/OTRK)). 

One company involved in the shorting is Culper Research, who used to often short companies in tandem with our favorite, Citron Research. They tried shorting $OTRK last year but failed miserably, and it looks like they are at it again ([https://twitter.com/CulperResearch/status/1366395871877877765](https://twitter.com/CulperResearch/status/1366395871877877765)). While there are some legitimate concerns, it’s hard to see any of them as a “death knell” as Culper puts it. Culper recently shorted (a stock that I can't mention here due to market cap) which drove the stock price down over 35%, however that company has responded with an investigation of their own (we’ll see if anything actual comes out of it). Sure, shorts play an important role in the market, but Culper seems to be one of those really nasty companies that tries to push companies to bankruptcy with baseless claims that their targets are completely “worthless.” I can’t find any evidence yet, but there are rumors that Culper actually lobbied Aetna to terminate their contract with OnTrak. There are also rumors that OnTrak is still in talks to retain Aetna (please share if you have any info on this!).     

Total shares outstanding is 17.54M. 28.3% of those shares are owned by institutions, the top holders being big names like ArrowMark, Credit Suisse, Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, and our other favorite, Citadel. That number has grown significantly in the past few months as well (22.67%), and as we all know these guys don’t lose often. Even if the shorts cover their positions, and no squeeze is forced, these institutions should be increasing their positions now that it is trading at a discount to what they just recently paid. 

57.4% of shares are held by insiders and even with the recent rise, there have been no sales by insiders in over a year. The vast majority of insider shares, however, are all owned by the CEO, Terren S. Peizer (just under 9.2M shares). This amount of control is a little concerning, and I honestly can’t tell if Mr. Peizer is a genius or a scam artist (if anyone has more info on him I would love to hear it). On the other hand, it does give him a lot of incentive to maximize the share price and he has no reason to sell right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR;** Possible short squeeze, great long term outlook. High ownership by CEO and large institutions. Extremely low float means little volume needed to move the stock – could help with a squeeze, or be a trap, but just one subreddit or one whale could do a lot of damage here. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My Position**

Shares continued to drop this morning and spent the day hovering between $26 and $28. It closed just over $26, and if it breaks downwards again tomorrow, my next target is around $20. Call volume is very bullish right now though and it looks extremely oversold. I really like the chances of a strong reversal here, so I opened a position of 140@26.95 today. Just one new customer could bring this back up to it previous ATH, and an acquisition could push it even higher.",finance

Why would that person pick ETH, over a token such as Algorand?  Aside from the argument of supporting the project, and just looking at this from a financial aspect. 

From what I gather, you need 32 ETH to stake, and from what I understand that locks those ETH up not letting the owner access them. Versus Algorand that lets you stake just by having them in your wallet (more liquidity). Algo also boasts a 7% interest rate, does ETH have a scale to determine how much you get in returns? If I needed to sell my 32 ETH would I be able too? What are the downsides of staking ETH? What are the upsides?

personalfinance,Which re-fi option should we go with?,"A little context: 

My wife and I bought a new construction townhouse in 2015. With interest rates still relatively low we have decided to refinance, but we are conflicted on which term to choose. Option 1: we can do a new 30 year loan at 3.5% which would reduce our monthly payment by ~$300 per month. Option 2: a 20 year loan at 3.375%, which would increase our monthly payment by ~$50. We have no kids (yet) and don't plan on moving for at least the next 5-10 years. We both have relatively secure, average jobs.  

She thinks we should take the new 30 year loan and use the savings on stuff like investments, plus if we do have a kid, that extra $300 per month can be pretty helpful. I think we should take the 20 year loan and focus more on paying down the principal on the loan, even if we don't think we'll stay in the house past the loan's maturity date.

Bitcoin,Single biggest thing any true btc whale could do for the future of bitcoin?,"We're all waiting and wondering what future application/adoption of Bitcoin will really cement it as a global store of value. Governments right now can still tax and regulate it to make it really hard if you still rely on the fiat system for your daily needs, so the single biggest thing that would propel BTC to really squash or at least dent those risks would be for the system to be adopted in a serious way in monetary policy somewhere. If a national bank of a real nation with real people were to adopt it and tie its currency at least partially to Bitcoin then other governments and institutions that are key trading partners with that nation would not really be able to avoid also thinking of partially adopting Bitcoin to avoid imbalance, and so on so forth. This of course is both the chicken and the egg.

There needs to be a spark. An incentive for a government to even want to think of such an (experiment/investment) with their monetary system. It could be that COVID and the crazy debasing of fiats all over the world ultimately force this question, but I wouldn't underestimate the system's ability to survive in creative ways. Is it really going to matter for e.g. the US FED to spend a relatively very small amount buying some BTC down the road (they seem to be buying everything anyway). It might be good for the value, but its not going to propel it into a reserve currency. So this got me thinking, with the crazy concentration of BTC ownership this actually could be a real opportunity. What if, Satoshi if he is alive, were to offer a small but stable nation (say Denmark) 99% of his BTC in exchange for their central bank agreement to peg their currency (at least partially) to Bitcoin. Essentially making BTC the national currency. It would instantly change Bitcoin forever. Any true Whale or group of Whales could do this, at least if the value keeps going up. The funny thing is if they all say commit 50% of their holdings to this they'd probably recover the value of that ""donation"" almost instantly because of the spike in value that will come along with such a move.

In the example of Denmark, its a small enough nation that 1.1 million bitcoins represents a significant portion of both their GPD and M2. There's probably not going to be a lot of incentive for said nation to even consider this now, but the way things are going, at some point maybe soon there might be. Just a thought...

The FX markets, the DXY held on to most of yesterday's gains with price action choppy around the 91.00 level amid the declines in stocks and with the currency unfazed by the weaker than expected ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and ADP Employment numbers.  


The latest Fed comments continued to suggest a lack of concern regarding the rise in yields as Fed's Evans viewed the current rise in rates as healthy in which he attributed the increase to real factors and expectations for a rebound, while Evans also stated he is not thinking about YCC as a policy proposal at the moment and has not set his forecasts for the March SEPs but does expect it will be stronger than December.  


EUR/USD remained subdued around 1.2050 with ECB officials continuing to provide a dovish tilt.  


GBP/USD was uneventful after yesterday's budget announcement given that many of the details had been leaked beforehand.  


USD/JPY retained its recently reclaimed 107.00 status owing to the USD strength and antipodeans were choppy amid the downbeat risk sentiment and mixed Australian data releases where Retail Sales fell short of estimates but Trade Balance printed at a record surplus; antipodeans have picked up ahead of the EU open.  


\- Australian Retail Sales (Jan F) M/M 0.5% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.6%)  
\- Australian Trade Balance (AUD)(Jan) 10.1B vs. Exp. 6.5B (Prev. 6.8B)  
\- Australian Exports (Jan) M/M 6% (Prev. 3%)  
\- Australian Imports (Jan) M/M -2% (Prev. -2%)  


WTI Crude futures were back near yesterday's best levels above the USD 61.00/bbl level as focus remained on OPEC+ in which the JMMC meeting ended with no policy recommendation, although there were mixed views as some member states appeared to be pushing for a higher level of easing of the cuts, while others were more cautious with several members supporting the idea of no curb easing and to roll over the current cuts.  


Elsewhere, gold was indecisive in tandem with the consolidation in the greenback and only marginally benefitted from its haven status, while copper lacked direction amid the broad negative risk tone and weakness in Chinese commodity prices which saw Shanghai stainless steel decline by 6% to hit limit down in early trade.

personalfinance,I made a self employment tax accident and I need to rectify it,"So I made a mistake and it started back in 2012. My wife has been doing random jobs like baby sitting and tutoring since 2012. Because she never really made much income from it I never thought that there would be anything other than reporting it and having the Fed tax and State tax just come out of my main employment refund.

Well, she has started a new thing she is doing and she has started making a bit more money than usual from her self employment ventures. I do my taxes on Turbo Tax and this is the first time it has presented me with a page notifying me if I wanted to defer Self Employment taxes. I read up on this and I guess it has to do with the COVID relief stuff. Well, in seeing this and reading more about it I just now realized that even though she wasn't making a lot it was still over the $400 minimum needed to pay the SE taxes.

So I went back and looked over my tax records and starting from 2012 to now she has accumulated a total of $1,847 in SE taxes. What do I need to do to fix this problem? I guess we have been lucky for this to not have actually become a problem so I want to take care of it as soon as possible. I read that I can use the EFTPS site to make estimated payments but does that apply to the SE tax?

I'm really worried that there is probably interest on these late payments. I'm hoping it's not a crazy amount of money (Fingers crossed)

Any info would be extremely appreciated on this.

Forex,US 10 year yields pull back to 15m resistance turned support,"The title says it all. Indexes and risk-on-off traders need to be watching the bond market right now.  


For those who haven't followed this, the US 10 year bond price action is saying that the fed will need to raise rates sooner than it thinks.  


Markets are watching these yields, so if this works as a support level that is bearish for equities and bullish for USD, so we may switch to risk-off.  


It's bearish for equities because with ""safer"" bonds yielding more or less the same as the S&amp;P index, stocks become a less attractive investment. The reason they were so strong was the search for yield. If that is over then so is the rally....

In our view, stories like the ones above are merely leading indicators of the Fed moving to some version of Yield Curve Control (YCC) itself, likely sooner than consensus currently expects.

US Treasury (UST) bond yields are the risk-free rate used to discount all other assets. If UST yields are being understated by a rising Fed balance sheet/Fed YCC, the valuation of all other assets will be overstated relative to where they would otherwise be trading.

Rising UST yields will therefore push valuations of other asset classes lower. This is the phenomenon that is currently spooking the stock markets.",finance

Super chuffed to share this -  

We all know that recently, Bitcoin has seen more and more corporate interest, and this will most likely be pivotal to its growth moving forward.

The general sentiment is that, as more companies add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, it’ll create a positive feedback loop - the price of Bitcoin will increase and as it does so, more &amp; more companies will be enticed to buy BTC, further increasing the currency’s price and signaling to other companies that it’s a sound investment. However, having a volatile asset on your balance sheet means potentially increasing the volatility of *your* stock price. Thus, the general correlation between BTC and a stock price is important for shareholders, and those looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin through these companies, as well as CFOs looking for empirical data about other companies who’ve added BTC to their balance sheet. Additionally, stocks with Bitcoin on their balance sheet can act as an intermediary for those looking to participate in options on Bitcoin.

personalfinance,Pay Student Loans or Invest,"My wife and I are trying to decide whether to aggressively pay off student loans or invest our savings.  


Stats:  
$160k income ($120k for me, $40k for spouse)  


$180k mortgage ($205k house, 2.999% interest)  
$125k student loans (6.2% average interest; $25k in unpaid interest that has not capitalized)  
$38k auto loans (0% interest)  
No credit card or other debt.  


My student loans are in IBR, and my income has more than doubled over the past two years. So, I'm not sure I will have a choice but to focus on student loans once the payment amount adjusts to the  higher income level. Assuming my income doesn't drop significantly in the near future, getting aggressive with my student loans might be a wise choice. If I were to refinance or change to another payment plan, the interest accrued due to the low IBR payments for several years would capitalize, offsetting some amount of any potential gain from lowering the interest rate. 

Moral of the story, we've ramped up our income dramatically and are determined to keep as much of it as possible by reducing taxes and interest paid and improving interest earned. 

We have an emergency fund, so that's one step out of the way. We are treating our current situation like we have zero saved and are either going to accrue savings to invest or attack the student loan debt.

We already contribute about 14.25% of our combined income to tax advantaged retirement plans. I am considering maxing out my HSA contribution, as I am already at the max for my 401k and the tax deduction at my income level would be significant (22% income tax bracket). My HSA is also invested in index funds, earning interest free. I had been considering saving in a taxable investment account, but cannot guarantee earnings greater than the amount of interest paid on student loan debt, particularly considering the income or capital gains tax on earnings. Maxing out our Roth IRA contribution may be a worthwhile alternative in that respect, but the max contribution amount doesn’t cover our full savings potential.

Rather than investing in a taxable account, we are mulling over staying in our current house for another year, then renting it out and buying another. We like buying houses that are rough around the edges, so they’re not selling day 1 in a bidding war. I am willing and able to do repairs and improvements myself, allowing me to get the house into prime condition with minimal financial cost. This has worked out for us so far, but I am more inclined to gain rental properties than slowly upgrade into bigger/nicer personal houses.   


We are not aggressive with paying off our mortgage, considering it is only 2.999% interest. The only expensive debt we have is student loans, and the interest rate won’t be 0% forever. Much investment advice says to tackle debt first, then start building a diversified portfolio. Other advice recommends leveraging and out-earning low interest debt (6.2% for student loans isn’t unbeatable). I would appreciate the community’s thoughts!",finance

Deeper look into FX

AUD/JPY/DXY - Marked divergence between the Aussie and Yen, but not necessarily as a direct reflection of broad risk sentiment that traditionally drives the cross one way or the other.

Instead, Aud/Usd rebounded from just above 0.7750 to circa 0.7815 largely on the back of a record trade surplus swelled by exports rising twice as fast as the previous month, while imports fell at the same pace.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the Greenback is grinding higher across the board, with the index looking to retest recent highs above 91.000 between 90.970-91.223 parameters, and the Aussie also faces relatively formidable option expiry interest in the form of 1.5 bn at 0.7820- 25 assuming it can clear 1 bn expiries at the 0.7800 strike convincingly alongside a pronounced retreat in copper and other base metals.

&amp;#x200B;

Conversely, Usd/Jpy has made a clean break above 107.00 and breached another technical resistance level in the form of the 100 WMA at 107.24, leaving the Yen with only half round number support at 107.50 to rely on.

&amp;#x200B;

CHF - The Franc's fortunes are going from bad to worse, but the SNB will be cheering from the side-lines as Usd/Chf climbs towards 0.9250 and Eur/Chf scales 1.1100 ahead of Swiss reserves data for February on Friday and this month's quarterly policyreview.

&amp;#x200B;

NZD/CAD - Some compensation for the Kiwi as Aud/Nzd holds below 1.0750, but Nzd/Usd is losing more upside momentum having failed to retain grip of the 0.7300 handle, while a dip in oil prices is keeping the Loonie anchored around 1.2650 after its fleeting foray above 1.2600 yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

GBP/EUR - Both conceding ground amidst the latest Dollar upturn, as Cable meanders mostly in the low 1.3900 area in the UK Budget aftermath and not really reacting to a firmer than forecast construction PMI.

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, mostly better than expected Eurozone construction surveys have not really lifted the Euro's spirits, while a big retail

sales miss was largely flagged by member state data and partly offset by a steady jobless rate following a downward revision to the previous month.

&amp;#x200B;

Hence, Eur/Usd is still straddling 1.2050 and also capped by decent option expiry interest as 1.3 bn rolls off at the NY cut from 1.2085-1.2100 before attention turns to Fed chair Powell at a WSJ event on the labour market and US economy.

&amp;#x200B;

Trade safe all and if you like this press the tumbs up.

personalfinance,(CAN) What are the prepayment charges for breaking your mortgage after already going through an early renewal (blend-and-extend)?,"I am looking at ways to save on my mortgage payments. With the current low interest rate environment, I was trying to look at ways to refinance, and get a lower rate. 

My original mortgage was a 5-yr fixed that I got into in May-2019 at a rate of 3.48%. Since then, I have gotten an early renewal in Feb-2021 with my lender (they call it a blend-and-extend), which blended my remaining ~3yr mortgage with a new mortgage. In the end, the early renewal resulted in a new 5yr mortgage at 2.9%, incurring no penalties in the process. Seemed like a win. 

However, now that I have this new mortgage, my current break penalty has dramatically reduced from what it was before my early refinancing. In my original mortgage, the break penalty for the remaining ~3yrs was a calculation of an IRD for ~$22k. Thus me not refinancing it outright with a new lender initially. Now that I have a new mortgage, the IRD is no longer used, and is actually the 3-months worth of interest. Break penalty now is only $2.7k. 

I asked my mortgage advisor about this, and they quoted that they are familiar with this ""loophole"" and have been advised that clients cannot break a mortgage within the 1st year of signing, otherwise they would actually incur a larger break penalty, not the one they quoted at $2.7k. 

All my mortgage documents never talk about this 1yr period, and that the break penalty would somehow be calculated differently in those situations... I have also asked to have a realistic break penalty estimate if I went with it anyways, and they could not quote me. Mind you, this was mentioned after I started the conversation asking what my current break penalty is, and them responding that it is only $2.7k. 

I am confused If I should not listen to this, and only expect to pay $2.7k, and go on anyways to break the mortgage and find a new lender willing to offer a ~1.9% rate. 

Please help if you have been in this situation!

First one did pretty well and I really enjoyed writing it so here I am again! I kinda feel like one of those god awful youtubers with the clickbait thumbnails, at least im not shilling promo codes to you guys! I am back again with another poorly researched yet unbiased post on the top 5 biggest scams that ever hit the cryptocurrency world. Let me start this off by saying the amount of scams in the world that go on it would be a safe bet to say less than 1% of all scams are crypto based. There are far more scams associated with the dollar or fiat currency. I'm sorry if you got scammed by these and do not like the way I am talking about them. My intention is not to make fun of you, it is to bring these scams to light in a slightly comedic way.

This  top 5 list is in no particular order and my research is my own and poorly done.

Again, I'm doing this kind of post to get some focused discussion in this sub, so please sound off in the comments!

u/huskernatchamps2020 **‘s top 5 biggest scams to ever happen in crypto**

1. **Mt Gox-** Now if you are new to the cryptocurrency space you probably haven't heard of Mt Gox yet, as it happened in 2014 (what feels like 50 years ago). Mt Gox was a japanese based exchange and back in 2014 they were handling nearly 70% of all bitcoin transactions. In February they suspended trading and months later began liquidating their assets. Claiming that over 850,000 of YOUR bitcoins had been “stolen” or “hacked”. NOW I bet you're thinking, “hey dumbass how is an exchange getting hacked a scam?!” Well it’s a scam because in order to get ALL your bitcoins hacked you have to leave a glaringly obvious hole in your security system. This company gave the illusion that your bitcoins  were safe with them when in reality they were safer printed on paper and given to your grandma. Mt Gox users got scammed by the exchange with the illusion of safety.
2. **BITCONEEEEEEEEECT-** Holy hell I am so old I remember when this happened and I thank Satoshi everyday that I was too stupid to figure out how to invest in Bitconnect. This one is my favorite and I know the most so this will be the longest one. Bitconnect was released in 2016 with the goal of allowing users to lend the value of Bitconnect coin in return for interest payments. The marquee program was the so-called lending platform where users traded Bitcoin for Bitconnect Coin and could lock in the instantaneous value of the coin for a set period of time while earning interest calculated daily. The shares went from .17c to around $436 when they went full Ponzi and disappeared with everyone's coins after the feds sent a cease and desist. How in the world did they scam so well? They got influencers to promote their referral links to earn more money, simple as that. They got people you trust to give you their money, and in return the people you trust got paid.
3. **OneCoin-** OneCoin is probably the most insane scam on my list. These bumbling fucks managed to promote a cryptocurrency that didn't even have a blockchain. IT LITERALLY WAS NOT EVEN A CRYPTOCURRENCY LMFAO. OneCoin is said to have scammed anywhere from 9-19 BILLION DOLLARS from it’s users in the form of an education package disguised as a cryptocurrency. Their CEO went missing in 2017 and their backup CEO got arrested right after! Yet somehow they managed to pump this coin again in 2018-2019. HOW?!?! My god. This scam should be used as an educational package of DYOR and don't be an idiot.
4. **PinCoin and iFan ICO scam-** what kind of human would I be if I didn't include at least 1 ICO scam. After all, some people say that up to 70% of ICO’s fizzle out and disappear with your funds. But holy shit Pincoin and Ifan are damn near the biggest ICO scam in history. They made away with almost 700 MILLION DOLLARS. PinCoin and Ifan were ICO’s run by the same company Modern Tech. These fucks were masters of marketing and advertised 48% return in 1 month, and 100% after 4 months. They also offered 8% return on referral codes, and ran marketing campaigns all across Asia. Modern Tech seems to be a greasier unfunny version of Bitconnect, but at least some people made money on Bitconnect. NOBODY profited on this scam. SAD
5. **Elon Musk Scam-** Take a look at any Elon Musk tweet and you’ll see some people pretending to be him promising that “if you send X amount of BTC to this address I will send you back 2X Bitcoin in return for your trust.” This scam is all over the place and if my memory is right Elon’s twitter even got hacked and the hackers were able to scam Bitcoin from his verified account. It is estimated that millions of dollars have been scammed by fake Elon Musk alone, not including the other fake celebrity BTC scams. Jesus fuck, this is the new Nigerian prince scam that we all made fun of our boomer parents for getting scammed by. PEOPLE NOBODY WILL EVER GIVE YOU 2X BTC IF YOU SEND THEM X BTC!!!

Let me know if my dumb ass forgot a scam and feel free to call me a dick if you got scammed by these people and I just made fun of you. sorry.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Stop panicking, its going to be ok","First of all, when you think about it, Nasdaq only lost 7% in a month. That means the huge majority of smart money is still holding and doesn't think there's a reason to panic. When smart money panics, you have the covid crash.


Secondly, its important to understand why there is so much red recently. The main reason is the fear due to the rising 10 year old treasury yield. When we woke up this morning, it did spike in a scary way, but now its going back down sharply, we are fine: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX?p=^TNX&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch


Now, even if this stupid 10 year old treasury yield did not go down, most people would agree these fears are irrational. Check this quick interview: https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/video/philadelphia-fed-harker-don-t-011809466.html


Historically, the rates, they go down, not up. The fear of massive interest rates are irrational, and as i said earlier, its only ~7% of people who are pulling out of nasdaq, that's a small number of people who's irrationally fearful. Feds have been under their target of 2% for a LONG time, they aren't concerned about this.


Additionally, Biden agreed to tighten the covid stimulus requirements. This is good news because it means its less likely to over heat the economy beyond control. And when that stimulus does get released, its hard to imagine it won't at least give a small boost to the markets.



I also think we need to look at the bright side. Historically, most crash happens when the market overheat. Corrections like we are having right now help avoid a real full breakdown of the market, and they help buy cheaper dips.



I also think there is a decent chance our buddy JPow props up the market today with his speech ;)",finance

CryptoCurrency,Interest rates and bond yields are causing recent volatility in crypto markets,"While crypto is decentralized, it can still be affected by the US Fed. 

It’s important to understand that the the recent volatility in the stock and crypto markets is due to the recent rise of bond yields. (Yield on the 10 year treasury note and mortgage bonds continue to rise).

If the interest rates and yields continue to rise , it will make bonds more appealing to investors and borrowing money on margin will be more expensive for investors. Much of the current market has been built on the assumption of low interest rates, so the recent rise is spooking investors in both crypto and stock markets.",cryptocurrency

I have come into a sizable amount of money from a legal settlement. While most of it will be going into an investment account for now, I am going to be purchasing a new car, total in the 40-50k range. 

As a result of the medical bills that led to the legal settlement, I have pretty bad credit (high 500s). While it will be going up pretty quickly as I pay off debt and get things in order, I’m considering financing my new car rather than paying for it outright in order to build up my credit even faster. I can easily pay cash for this, but obviously if I finance I’ll have a higher interest rate than someone with better credit, but at what point is it worth it to pay a little more for the trade-off of a much higher FICO after consistent payments?

personalfinance,Rolling over retirement accounts- picking the right place,"Hola mi amigos,

So I have collected a few retirement plans I would like to consolidate and know I have them in the right place, avoiding unnecessary fees.

My old employer rolled my 401K into an IRA as they also merged into a larger entity. I would like to roll this into a current employer 401K or 403B, as I utilize a backdoor Roth IRA  contribution each year and do not want a traditional IRA to be funded at this juncture.

My current employers use Ascensus 401K and Empower 403B.

At Empower I am in the Vanguard Target Retirement Fund, 2050 I think. I believe this, as most Vanguard funds are, is a cost effective investment? I should be happy here?  
At Ascensus I am in a Moderate-Aggressive portfolio, that does not explain its expense ratio. I've pasted what that portfolio contains, along with my other options below.

personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer - Credit Advice,"Hello all.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in the process of looking into houses for my first house (yay!). I've spoken with a real estate agent and a finance person for home loans. I have two people that would be on the loan and one of us has 700+ credit while the other one has 650+. We have been told that if we can get the other to 700+, we could go for a conventional loan and that would drop our interest rate significantly. Now we spoke with both of these advisors knowing full well that we still have about 6-7 months before we need to buy. My question is this: Is it possible to raise the score of someone by \~50 points in 6 months? 

The situation is as follows: The person with the 650+ score has about a great payment history, but they currently have 3 cards that are maxed. We don't have enough to bring those down immediately, but the balance on them isn't too severe (the limits are all below 700). We could eventually get them all down to below 30% utilization before the end of the 7 months. So my question here is: Should we focus on one card at a time, or do all 3 evenly? (Mind you, we are going to continue with at least minimum payments on the others regardless) 

My next thing is that I heard about adding ""authorized users"" on a credit account with higher credit scores can help people with lower scores improve their scores. Is this true? And if so, as long as the lower credit score doesn't use the card and the owner of the card doesn't use it (let's say at all for this case), will that help?

Any other advice is more than welcome! We want to get our scores high enough to reach that low-interest rate as soon as possible. Feel free to ask for more info. I may not be able to give out some details, but we will answer anything that we can within reason!",finance

* There is economic optimism in the market related to the vaccine roll out and the relief bill/stimulus.
* As a result, investors are confident and are selling bonds (causing interest rates to rise) to move into riskier options (such as stocks).

personalfinance,"Quick KY tax question, ""less misc non taxable comp""","I just need some help with whether this sounds right or if I should head to H&amp;R block. Thanks. 

I'm a 34 year old KY resident on long term disability ( 2 years this April) through the Hartford Insurance group, through my employer Amazon. Hartford was my only source of income &amp; direct payments at all in 2020. I got a W2 from them for $18,720 for the year with no withholdings. ( I removed them since I got about a $900 total state and federal last year in the same situation) This year I'm seeing owing federal $600 and KY state $800 on turbo tax after only entering my Hartford disability info. I have no other income or holdings.

I also got a tax form from Amazon for $8580 ""less misc non taxable comp"" and $0 reported W2 wages. What is that? Amazon didn't send me any money. Does this just make my total taxable income basically $ 10k? I didn't see any way to add or walkthrough for non taxable comp on Turbo Tax so I couldn't enter that myself.

Does owing roughly $1400 this year for those figures sound about right or should I head to a tax specialist to help with the non taxable comp for a $100 tax processing fee? Would entering that correctly significantly reduce what I apparently owe? Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,"Unsure of where to go after April, Leaning on moving into parent's house","I posted in this reddit some time ago about losing my job last year from Covid. I (M22) worked as a liftie at a ski area, got laid off, and stuck around all year without moving back home. Now I'm at the end of the second season and I basically have no savings because I've been paying rent and trying to get by since last May basically. I do have some options for work going into April/May so I'm not super worried about finding a job, but I have almost no emergency funds because, well, I had an emergency and spent most of it. It's extremely hard to pay rent and save at the same time and I think I'm getting to the very end of my savings. I've already had to ask my mom to pay my rent once which was very awkward. I currently live in Montana and love where I live. Although, I have no family to lean on here.

I am leaning towards moving back because I need to save. That being said, my situation with my parents is somewhat different than most. My dad makes significantly more money than my mom, owns the house, pays the bills, etc. but the reason I moved away in the first place is because I am the oldest of 4 and our house is just too small for me to have my own space, and our family is pretty much financially dependant on my Dad. I don't know how to explain it without going into too much details, but the reliance on my Dad is very harmful and I'm almost afraid I'll stay for a long time if I go home. I basically don't want to stay longer than 4-6 months. I'm also afraid he will hold this over my head if I do go home. We basically try to get by making what we can and he keeps us financially dependant on him. He also has tried to get me to move back home on many occasions. He lives/works in California and my parents house is in Colorado so he does not live at home.

My biggest resistance to moving home is my significant lack of space, freedom, and I fear I'll be living on my mom's pullout couch for another year. I worked 2 jobs with 60hr work weeks to save so I could move out and away from my parents house. I moved out with about $6k in savings and was able to save to about $7.5 after I had moved out right before the pandemic. I slept on a pullout couch in the middle of the room from Jan 2019-Dec 2019. I had no bedroom, and no privacy, and couch surfed from house to house when I felt like coming home was too much. I cannot function in that environment. I do not have a bedroom at home or space for my new bed, clothes, or my computer. 

Is it worth it to wait, with the intent of moving back home to potentially move back to Montana? Would my plans change if I moved home? 

I could really use some advice from someone smarter than me who's had experience with a similar situation and/or who has moved back home after living on your own and working for a year. Finding an ok job is not a huge problem atm(even if I did move home) but saving money is. I barely have $1k in my account right now.

Thank you so much for any help

EDIT:
I currently have 2 roommates and my rent is $500 a month + $40-70 in utilities usually. It's basically month to month at the moment and I can leave at any time but it's hard to downsize from what I've found now. The cheapest I've seen in my area is just over $400 so I wouldn't realistically be saving a ton if I stayed. I already am basically working 2 jobs and I have options lined up just haven't committed because I'm still heavily toying with the idea of moving home. I can't really find anything that pays more than $13 an hour in my area unless it's construction/landscaping which I also don't want to do because those jobs usually have a high base pay to compensate for the lack of breaks/long days which I don't think I'd be able to handle again. I worked 5 days of 9-11 hours of landscaping just after the pandemic hit (I had to leave because I believe I was getting taken advantage of but the pay was $18 an hour) then started at Starbucks which is where I still currently work but I'm just on call so I can pick up shifts when I can(that way if I do decide to stay I can pick up without missing a beat). 

My parents live is up in the mountains a ways so rent is significantly higher and just generally waaaaayyy less renting options, and living in Denver just isn't really an option because of the commute/rent in Denver is insane compared to Montana.

Edit #2:

I do have some school debt but I've been paying it off slowly and I'm over the halfway point. I make $14 right now but since my job is dependent on the snow it only goes till about April so I know my money is going to run out in May. After the season is over I'm planning on going back to Starbucks because I want to possibly go to school online through ASU(Starbucks pays for classes). Only thing keeping me there is the possibility of school the pay is like $11 and I'd prefer to do different things with my time but I have friends in their school program who are living dirt cheap and debt free through it although, they are staying with their parents. 

Schools another thing too bc I'd like to go back and study but I can't really afford to take out loans and I'd have to work through school regardless. I have residency in Montana so in theory I can go to school here and get cheaper tuition but the thought of outstanding debt more than $10k is terrifying.",finance

investing,The Relationship between Stocks and Interest Rates,"I've seen a lot of misunderstanding across about the effect of rates on equities, so I figure I'd hop off of WSB to give an explainer about the relationship between stocks and interest rates, and show why the current sell off makes sense.

**Where do interest rates come from?**

Money has time value. Money today is usually worth more today than money tomorrow. How do we measure the time value of money? Interest! When we loan money out, we demand a return. What goes into an interest rate? There are 3 primary factors:

1. \*What do I think inflation is going to be?\*Say you estimate inflation to be 3% and rising, you'll demand a far higher interest rate to protect yourself.
2. \*How risky is this loan?\*Your lend to a group of risky businesses, you might jack up interest rates to make sure if one goes under, you'll make your money back from the rest
3. \*How much is everyone else willing to lend for?\*You'll need to compete with other lenders which helps determine the final interest rate.

**US Treasuries: King of Bonds**

So US government debt is considered primo with near 0 risk of default. The rates on US government debt determines whats known as the *risk free rate*.

The US issues debt at several different maturities from weeks, to months, to years. If we line up these interest rates, we get what is known as the [yield curve](https://www.gurufocus.com/yield_curve.php).

To reiterate, these rates are determined by the market and are manipulated by the Federal Reserve, which attempts to intervene in the market to get rates to its targets. When the Fed comes out and says it wants rates to stay near zero, this one of the ways they do it.

And this is exactly what happened during the corona crash, interest rates went to zero across the curve.

**How to Value a Company**

Let's say we have two companies. $BRR and $GRO. Let's say we're certain of their future cash flows.

* BRR is runs a money printer and makes $10M a year.
* GRO is a growth stock that's expected to make $100M a year in a decade.

How do we value these two companies based on cash flow alone? For simplicity, let's only look at the first 10 years. We need to determine the present value of the money the company makes in the future.

What is money from n years from now worth today?  money / (1 + risk\_free\_rate)\^n. So we can represent todays value for 10 years of cash flow like this:

Let $$$ Year X be the money we *know for sure* (i.e. the certainty equivalent) the company will make in year X. Let r be the risk free rate. Then we can model the value of the company roughly as follows:

Value = ($$$ Year 1) / (1 + r) + ... + ($$$ Year 10) / (1 + r)\^10

**How Rates Affect Value**

So which company do you think is worth more? BRR or GRO.

Well that depends on the interest rate! Let's say interest rates are at 0 or near zero. Their valuations taking no other factors into account are nearly the same: $100M.

Now let's start cranking up the interest rate slowly to see what the current valuation is.

&amp;#x200B;

|r|BRR|GRO|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0.0%|100M|100M|
|0.5%|97M|95M|
|1.0%|94M|90M|
|2.0%|90M|82M|
|4.0%|81M|67M|

***As interest rates go up, the company that depends more on future earnings (GRO) is getting whacked. A move 0% to 2% knocks off almost 20% in one shot.***

**So why the fuss all of a sudden?**

Stocks went flying higher under the assumption that the fed would remain dovish, work to keep interest rates low, and would not be able to produce inflation over 2% if it wanted to. For a lot of reasons, people were betting that if that inflation would appear any were it would happen farther out in time near the 30Y. Given they figured the 5Y would stay low, and the 30Y would go high they shorted the 30Y bonds and went long 5Y. However, 5Y and 10Y treasury yields suddenly spiked making everyone ask whether inflation would come sooner and faster. People hoped the fed wold say something to alleviate this, but instead Powell had stated in September that he's fine [with inflation running hot over 2%](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/09/02/what-do-changes-in-the-feds-longer-run-goals-and-monetary-strategy-statement-mean/)  (which no one seems to have believed) , and the fed today reiterated its not going to do anything about it in the short run. Hence, yields are still rising and equities are continuing to fall.  Add to this all the froth and speculation, a 20-30% correction makes a lot of sense in overheated names.

**Caveats about the analysis above**

1. The interest rates in this analysis are made up but the point still stands.
2. BRR is actually a better play since the risk free rate for earlier years will likely be lower than those farther out in time.
3. You shouldn't stop counting after year 10. You in theory can go out to infinity, and if rates are near zero, valuations for a growth company blow up too.
4. In most discount cashflow analysis, you don't use the risk free rate instead you use a discount rate specific to the company that takes risk into account for that company. In this case, it's fine to use the risk free rate since we assume we somehow know exactly how much the company will make (certainty equivalent). In the real world, we predict future cash flows by licking a finger sticking it in the air, and guessing which way the wind will blow.

**Inflation! Waddabout gold?**

If treasury yields stay above inflation, gold prices fall. That's because it's better to own a sheet of paper with a yield than a rock. Gold will only benefit if the Fed works to suppress rates farther out on the curve.  This is why [the price of gold is negatively correlated with real interest rates](https://www.sunshineprofits.com/gold-silver/dictionary/gold-interest-rates/)*.*",finance

stocks,How is the fee for shorting determined vs the shares available..and is the rate important for a squeeze?,"Looking at the data on [iBorrowDesk for GME ](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) and I’ve got two questions. 

1.  Where do the available shares come from? Are these made up from nowhere and naked or is it shorts retiring positions that make them available?

2. Is the interest rate important for the squeeze? 

Ok, three questions. 

3.  Where does the rate come from? Is it correlated to the number of available shares? Would rates increasing indicate a squeeze?

Why were 600k shares available on 2-26 at 12.8% and 800k shares available today at 1.9%?

CryptoCurrency,Most used abbreviations in the cryptospace (newby guide),"As we welcome newcomers everyday to this sub it's nice to have a all you need to know abbreviations guide to get them started.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 4, 2021.","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 4, 2021**

Stocks slumped Thursday once again, continuing the recent sellof. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) led the selloff, falling 1.64%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 erased 2021’s gains. 

The moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. 

* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week. 
* **Continuing claims:** 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week

During a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, “If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.”

As Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. 

In other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation, Democrats will be able to pass the bill without support from the other side of the aisle.

**Highlights**

* The decisions by Britain and the United States to suspend retaliatory tariffs will create space for negotiations on an ongoing dispute between Boeing (BA) and Airbus, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. 
* President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate.
* U.S. mortgage rates extended their recent leg higher to break above 3% for the first time since July 2020, raising concerns that the housing market's breakneck growth last year may sharply lose momentum.
* Square (SQ) announced it took a majority stake in music platform Tidal that is owned by rapper Jay-Z. Jay-Z will be added to the board of directors at Square.

CryptoCurrency,We've done it Y'all! Detailed Data Analysis below,"Hi guys, long time lurker, huge fan. I had some fun with my DA background and made some BTC analysis I think you all will like.

Historic BTC to S&amp;P:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/js5gn19kv2l61.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a70eba78f81d8c7389ff1514150b44bfb2dedf0

As seen above the S&amp;P historically has been a good measure of BTC, following gains relatively well. Using S&amp;P, you can explain 60% of the BTC price variance. Subtracting the last four months of bond related inflation shifts in the market, the link is 84%. The BTC:S&amp;P relationship is no longer a strong trend.

So what happened?

Looking through numerous indicators, one could easily toss out the 10yr bond as a BTC price predictor. In a vacuum this would undoubtedly be the case. However, the financial markets are not built the way they used to be; the market is propped up by federal stimulus and Fed Reserve spending.  The excess money onto a fixed number of stocks have caused a massive valuation bubble. Fears of inflation and a stock market crash due to the Fed pulling out has sent investors scurrying away from tech stocks, seeing the P/E with fresh eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

This exodus has been seen in the recent bearish market. Investors, seeking a safe harbor in a storm have looked to alternative investments. Gold, the historic investment of last resort from a market flight hasn't seen a proportional increase. Savings accounts, once a haven for easy guaranteed returns, have interest rates far below anything that would remotely resemble a realistic inflation number for the USD.

&amp;#x200B;

Past year BTC to 10yr Bond:

https://preview.redd.it/c69jvilbv2l61.png?width=1499&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b507290dd7e0c9de0826d0431a479b3881e4ecb

&amp;#x200B;

So then what did they do with their money?

&amp;#x200B;

The past six months, BTC (and by extension other cryptos) has gained a lot of credibility, rather than a riskier cousin to a S&amp;P ETF, its seen as a legitimate investment. Investors fleeing the doom and gloom of stocks, are investing in BTC and other Cryptos. As seen below, there is a strong correlation between higher interest rates and increased BTC prices. The model below predicts close to 90% of the variance in BTC prices.

Current BTC to 10yr Bond:

https://preview.redd.it/aqwmn8n7v2l61.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b10a1da3aacde3cffe3d0f40c0202181dcb6c6fc

What it all means? (TLDR)

&amp;#x200B;

Folks, this has been a heck of a ride. We're witnessing a once in history moment for BTC. Rather than being considered akin to a stock in the market for investors, rising and falling with the S&amp;P. BTC now is seen as a legitimate investment, one that exists by itself. We're seeing BTC being chosen over historically conservative stocks, moreover, if the trend continues, BTC will gain even more as the 10yr rate rises back to normal ranges.

Bitcoin,"and then the guy said, just because something appreciates in value, doesn’t make it the base value holder for the entire future of world commerce....","so I said-

&amp;#x200B;

You are totally correct, I agree fully. It is not because Bitcoin is appreciating in value that is why it will become the base value holder for the entire future of world commerce. The price appreciation is just the market recognizing over time that Bitcoin is a standalone system outside of the world of central banking and finance capable of final settlement without concern for borders, apolitical and neutral, permissionless and nearly frictionless, open for transactions 24/7/365 and with open markets every second of the day with a bid and an ask in practically every currency pair, free from government manipulation and debasement. (PS did you know that the stock market is open 6.5 hours a day, 5 days a week, or 32.5 hours per week, ie - open only (7x24=168) 32.5/168, just under 20% of the time, not including holidays or circuit breaks. That means every year of Bitcoin trading is actually 5+ years of stock market trading)

The problem with comparing Bitcoin to the massive list of companies/commodities/currencies that have shot way up before coming crashing back down is, how many of those experienced massive drawdowns, were left for dead, and then they rose again to even higher levels than ever thought possible before? Its crashed, and I mean CRASHED, about a dozen times with 80% or more drawdowns -- curiously though, always at higher lows. And here we are somehow, scraping $50k a coin, 900 Billion dollars worth of value created out of uhhh - a bit of ingenious code and a transparent ledger.

The question you must ask yourself is, why? Why does it not die? It has every reason to! No other example comes to mind of anything coming back from the dead once, let alone multiple times.

Bitcoin is a protocol layer on top of which the application layer rests. The only comparable example is TCP/IP - otherwise known as, the internet. The internet digitized and democratized information- it is now in the same power as you and I as someone with access to the world's best minds to find out whatever we want at the absolute cost of ZERO. Bitcoin is the digitization of money, it is the democratization of money. Today only the privileged in first world countries can have access to bank accounts, credit cards, checkbooks... To send a wire internationally you can pay $35 and wait a couple of days, that is if the country you are sending to is a country your country is down with and the amount of money does not raise any eyebrows in compliance departments.

But we are now in the process of seeing the transformation that will allow any person anywhere the ability to send money unfettered, without questions, without unreasonable fees, nearly instantaneously, from Istanbul to Venezuela if that is where their family members live, on a Saturday, at 11PM, and the person receiving it is not charged extortion fees, or bullied, or marked, or followed, or known to have received any value whatever.

How much is something like that worth?

So in the end if price is all you see, there is a reason for it, it is the iceberg under the surface that you are not seeing, this irresistible, unstoppable force that has been released into the world without hope of curtailing it no matter how much those who control the money supply might try.

And that is because Bitcoin, without firing a single round and without spilling a drop of blood, has forever placed beyond the reach of man the ability to manipulate and control the money. It is a voluntary system with clearly defined unchangeable rules (21M BTC, Nodes, Proof of Work, Difficulty adjustment, permissionless, non-sovereign, neutral, Supply schedule set in stone for the next hundreds of years) that if you would like to participate in, you are more than welcome to. If you decide you don't like it, you may sell it and leave. And without a CEO, marketing team, or coercion to transact in it as in FIAT, it has made people believe in it to the point of it being today one of the top 15 companies/ commodities/currencies with the highest of market caps, and it is the only one that looks bent on rising the ranks faster than any of the others. And for the first time in its history the macro external outlook has made it look by comparison, FOR THE FIRST TIME, as a desirable place to park value by those with value to park, accumulating enough liquidity to interest public companies. Validation for the thesis subtly embedded in the first block, ambitious and ridiculous in its scope and imagination, PLAYING OUT IN REAL TIME, earning respect in the eyes of the most serious of capital allocators.

And isn't it interesting that as the price appreciates, it actually becomes more useful and valuable, a better network, more reachable to bigger and bigger entities? It is the world's most fine-tuned positive feedback loop ever witnessed. Created by someone (anonymous of course, how else!) who understood this needed to be a public utility (as in water or electricity) and never cashed in on their deca-Billions! IS YOUR MIND BLOWN YET

Bitcoin is in the envious position of having time on its side. Everything else feels like it is borrowing against the future at ever-steepening costs to attempt to keep the charade going for another day. Short term gain, long term pain. Every decision at a corporate and government level today is made with the short term in mind, without paying a lick of mind to the long term. Bitcoin just mines another block. And another one. Miners keep dedicating to it more hashpower. It gets stronger and more secure. Monetary policy automatically tightens every 210,000 blocks/ approx every 4 years. Price rises. And the loop goes on.

With this scenario as laid before you, in the long term, how does this all play out from here?

Bitcoin in the end, is an unalienable right. Like water. Like electricity. Like the internet, arguably.

because... We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

I've heard about the debt avalanche and snowball methods but I'm not sure which would work best here.

Option 1:  Throw the additional $30,000 at my downpayment.  PMI on my loan is $160 a month and will go down slightly but not disappear due to me still being under the 20% threshold.

Option 2:  Put it in the market.  Retirement is planned for 2055.

Option 3:  Kill off my student loans.  I have $29,000 in student loans.  It is a variable rate that is (incredibly) .5% at the present time.

investing,"Lessons from the December 2018 market correction, when the SP500 and NASDAQ dumped more than -20% (by intraday measures) from all time highs","[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-sp-500-is-on-the-verge-of-tumbling-by-the-most-it-has-ever-fallen-on-christmas-eve-2018-12-24](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-sp-500-is-on-the-verge-of-tumbling-by-the-most-it-has-ever-fallen-on-christmas-eve-2018-12-24)

I wonder if anyone here remembers the market 'crash' in December 2018. Pundits blamed the market plunge on Fed hiking rates, the 'china trade war', and fears of economic slowdown. But recall that 1) the market recovered in a V shape days after December ended, without the Fed deciding to reverse course on the rate hike, 2) that the market was unfazed by trade war headlines nearly all year long, and 3) the economic growth data remained incredibly positive and strong. **The December 2018 drop was irrational.**

This look back at recent history goes to show how irrational markets can be and it is up to us to take advantage.

For today:

1. the Fed is NOT raising rates and have said this repeatedly.

2. the economy is recovering and there is little data suggesting any upcoming slowdown or recession.

3. The fear now is about the fear of inflation/yields rising. Note that we don't have any data suggesting inflation is permanently here to stay. 

I think there are two solid conclusions: 

1) This is not a bear market happening before our eyes. It's a correction and buying the dip is the likely right move. An overall selloff right now, is irrational, **just like in December 2018**, with the exception of growth stocks that are very overvalued especially in the context of rising yields. 

2) No one can predict how deep this correction goes, but it would be prudent to buy the dip on cyclicals, financials, and growth stocks that are already undervalued 

Please also note that the SP500 is now so heavily weighted to the top market cap growth tech stocks like FANG, that a 10% correction in them will require 90% increase in the bottom 100 stocks of the SP500 to avoid a fall. So the best way to increase your portfolio CAGR may not be to simply buy the dip in the SP500 index, but rather choosing the above sectors or stocks that avoid this weighting.",finance

personalfinance,Need help determining if paying off my car prior to buying a home is worth it...,"Hello everyone!

My partner and I are hoping to buy a home in June timeframe. We are trying to decrease our debt prior to starting the process, and I have enough now to pay off my car in full and still save back up before June so we can replenish our down payment.

With lower debt, we are hoping to secure a better interest rate and lower our debt to income ratio.
My only concern is that by paying off my car, my average age of accounts will drop, and could potentially hurt my credit score.

Does anyone know what will have a bigger impact on the home buying process and a possible mortgage loan denial (high debt to income ratio vs low average age of accounts)?

Do the mortgage credit scores calculate closed accounts in their model? Also, not sure if it matters, but I have a ridiculously high interest rate for my car (13%).

So what is ""fair""? How can we:

* determine which companies are overvalued by the market, if some are valued based on their potential future growth and others by their current value?
* know the exact (or approximate) fair value of a company? How much is Tesla *really* worth? How much is BP *really* worth? What metrics and financial data should we look at and how do we reach something that approaches the fair valuation of a company?

personalfinance,I need help deciding between 2 loan offers,"Hey guys, first time posting here. I decided to get my act together and boost my credit. I have perfect payment history and good standing on my accounts. I've paid off several accounts in the past. The one thing dragging my score is my credit utilization. I have a 16k limit on my credit card and I'm at 15,777, I'll round up to 15,800. I made a lot of bad choices when I was younger but have decided to take a 15,500 loan to pay it off at 60 months. I have a loan offer from Best Egg and my credit union where I bank at. 

Best egg

15,500 loan

775.45 origination fee

14,726.55 given to me

APR 11.72%

APR is truely 13.99% after factoring in origination fee

Total cost of finance is 5828.11 and 20,554.66 is the total

Payment is 342

With this loan, I'd still have around 1k left on my credit card.

Credit union

15,500 loan

No fees

15,500 goes directly to my credit card

APR is 15.35%

Payment is 374.39

Will only owe around 200 bucks on the credit card after this.

Seems like a slam dunk take the best egg. Has lower interest and lower payments per month. Doing the math, it's around 1800 dollars difference I'll be paying between the two payments but I'm not sure where to fit the 775.45 fee because I will still owe 1k on the credit card. I'm not sure how to calculate which one actually costs me less.

Also, if the difference is really negligible for total cost, I would take the credit union since it's in my banking app and I can make 2 split payments easy a month.

Thanks guys for helping.

Question really is, is the best egg the better loan still with 30 dollars less in payments, lower interest rate but I still will owe around 1k on the credit car with the 775 fee or is the credit union one better with more convenience, no fee, higher payment, higher apr but credit card is basically paid off.",finance

personalfinance,"This is my plan for eliminating my personal debt (2 credit cards), using the CITI FLEX LOAN. What do you think?","Hello All,

I'm currently in the process of whittling down my personal debt, and I wanted to run my train of thought and plan by you for some constructive feedback.  Many thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

OK, here we go:

I currently have the following balances on my two credit cards:

1. $16,000 CHASE credit card (@15.99% APR)
2. $9,500 CITI credit card (@15.24 APR)
3. (*I also have* ***$13,000 cash*** *that I plan to use to pay down some of my credit card debt.*)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's where it gets interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently received an offer from CITI for their 'Flex Loan', and the terms of the loan are as follows:

***- Up to $18,500 at 8.99% APR.***

I am aware that the CITI Flex Loan is *a loan against my credit card line of credit* (Note: Their loan offer of up to $18,500 reflects on my total line of credit (the difference between my current balance of $9,500 and the total credit line of $28,000.).

I am also aware that should I take this flex loan from CITI, any payments I make ***will first and only be directed toward my initial CITI credit card debt, until that is paid off first and in full***.

This is because CITI prioritizes the **higher APR** when clients make payments beyond the minimum:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Citi prioritizes balances with higher APRs when you make payments in excess of the minimum payment due.** So if purchases you make with your credit card carry [**a higher APR**](https://www.creditcardinsider.com/blog/what-is-a-good-apr-for-a-credit-card/) than that of your Flex Loan, you’ll have to pay down your purchase balance before you can apply any extra payments to the loan (the same goes for balances from [**balance transfers**](https://www.creditcardinsider.com/learn/balance-transfers/) and [**cash advances**](https://www.creditcardinsider.com/blog/can-use-credit-card-atm-cash-advances-work/)).  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.creditcardinsider.com/blog/citi-flex-plan-the-ins-and-outs-of-citis-financing-options/](https://www.creditcardinsider.com/blog/citi-flex-plan-the-ins-and-outs-of-citis-financing-options/)

&amp;#x200B;

It would obviously be a mistake to get myself into a situation where I have a compounded debt with CITI.

&amp;#x200B;

**So my plan is as follows:**

1. Use the $13,000 cash I have at my disposal to totally pay down the CITI Credit Card balance of $9,500, **leaving me $3,500 in savings**.
2. Take out a $16,000 CITI Flex Loan @ 8.99% APR, then pay off the CHASE Credit Card balance of $16,000 in full, in one payment.
3. This leaves me with $16,000 to pay off (to CITI), at a **lower interest rate of 8.99%** \- as opposed to my current CITI regular credit card interest rate of 15.24%.

btc,Learning from Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash history and how not to repeat those mistakes again into the future.,"Someone once said that the Bitcoin (and subsequently Bitcoin Cash) community keeps repeating the same mistakes over and over again because we keep enabling the bad actors or toxic personalities to climb ranks within the community. And if we look back, it is true and undeniable. The question is, can we learn from our mistakes and identify the bad actors and toxic personalities early on before they cause any major problems?

If we look back from the early days of Bitcoin (and later Bitcoin Cash), all the bad actors started out with good intentions. They did great work and contributed towards the community. And almost always, at some point, with enough influence, they start to abuse that power.

Fortunately, if one were to pay close attention, there are early warning signs of these bad actors and toxic personalities. Unfortunately, I understand that most people prefer not to speak up against these bad actors or toxic personalities for fear of retaliation. And based on what happened before, we also know good people simply prefer to leave the community rather than confront these bad actors and toxic personalities. And that’s the kind of harm they can do to the community; it drives away the good people.

In the past, I prefer to tolerate and condone such bad actors and toxic personalities because I have enough problems in my life as it is, no need to have more problems coming my way. Unfortunately, tolerating and condoning bad actors hasn’t work out well at all for us.

And that brings to me George Donnelly. I don’t understand why he regularly bash important Bitcoin Cash projects and contributors. **Here are 3 examples that happened in the last 2-3 weeks alone. Yes, George bashing 3 important BCH projects in just the recent 2-3 weeks alone.**

Today, he has set his tweets to private. Yesterday, it was public. I wonder what he has to hide.

&gt; Oscar, Founder of Venezuela Workers, Bitcoin Cash Project said (to George), ""You can critic it (Venezuela Workers) whatever you want and whenever you want, I just don’t think your opinions on social media are helpful, they are rather harmful... I don't understand (in your case) bashing negatively projects that support BCH on your Twitter... As I said, you have my private contact, but you choose to publicly delegitimize the website...  From you so far, there's only bashing the website publicly several times, not just one but more.""

That’s not all...

&gt; george was defunded by the Dash DAO because he failed multiple times to reach the goals he promised in his proposals. He was very energetic and we gave him multiple chances even though he was very difficult to work with.

&gt; After he was defunded he rage quit over the course of about a week and had an embarrassing meltdown where he blamed everyone else for his failure. He spent over a year telling everyone how great Dash was and then did a 180 as soon as he was defunded.

&gt; **We tried to warn many within bch he was toxic and lied about what happened with his failed Dash proposal. Looks like not much has changed with george.**

&gt; Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/jlsxzw/why_are_people_hating_george_donelly/gauu4lc/

I don’t think many people knew that George Donnelly left Dash on very bad terms and with a bad reputation. On its own, we don’t know if the problem is with Dash or George, but if this guy came to a totally new (Bitcoin Cash) community and starts having conflicts with so many other different people, then I hope you guys can notice a pattern here.

&gt; “I faced down US Marshals, mainstream TV celebrities and the federal government.” - George Donnelly

He brags about this as if having problems with the Dash community, the BCH community, US Marshals, TV celebrities, and the federal government is something to be proud of.

I also remember him having arguments with Jonathan Toomim, im_uname, etc. These are reputable contributors to the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.

In case you think these are one off incidents, here are some other evidence that George Donnelly is extremely aggressive and argumentative. If this one guy has a problem with so many different people, this is a huge warning sign of a toxic personality.

Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/jpqt4q/prove_that_george_donnelly_is_a_fraudster/

Source: https://twitter.com/RTaylor05/status/1188571263133839361

Notice something very subtle but very manipulative going on. When George Donnelly bashed and criticized others, he uses the words “helping” and “constructive criticism” to describe his actions. But when I pointed out his toxic behaviors (with clear evidence), he uses the words “bullying” and “gaslighting” to describe the action. By attaching such emotive words (positive emo when it’s in his favor and negative emo when it’s not in his favor), it is clear to me that George is a highly manipulative person. I have seen this kind of toxic behavior before and the outcome is usually pretty damaging.

I can understand if you don’t want to speak up against bad actors or toxic personalities to avoid retaliation but at the very least, please don’t defend, enable or promote these people (like we had done in the past). That strategy has proven to produce very bad outcomes for us in the past.

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:** Some additional thoughts when I observed that people kept bringing up George's videos and how visible his face is everywhere. And then I saw this video (credits to /u/pyalot) [5 signs you are dealing with a narcissist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hg4ws1QPeNE) and realize how those signs are similar.

In psychology, this is called the [familiarity principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect) and can be used to manipulative people to gain influence.

Many incredibly smart and hardworking folks like Jonathan Toomim and im_uname and Roger Ver and Marc De Mesel and many others (too many to name here, sorry!) are creating lots of value in the background for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. Just because some of their work is less visible and they don't churn out daily videos of their faces (like George Donnelly), it does not mean their contributions are anything less important/valuable.",cryptocurrency

A lot of tech stocks are also massively over valued and seeing a correction. Despite Elon Musk doing the right thing and buying Bitcoin, there is no way Tesla should be valued more than Toyota or Ford. Simply put, they just don't build enough cars to justify the valuation. Electric vehicles may be the future, but they need to prove that and build the infrastructure to provide charging stations before they can justify those valuations, and the market is now correcting for that. 

What does that mean for crypto?

I admit having PTSD from 2018, and thinking that there must be another massive correction coming. It may happen, and I'm not going to pretend to know when, but this isn't it. 

I don't know how long movements in main markets will continue to impact crypto, it is frustrating that it does, but I presume it's human nature and the fact that people taking a risky bet here, may lose their nerve if they see red everywhere. 

For the rest of us, I think it is a good buying opportunity if you didn't take advantage of the earlier dips. And have faith. 

Crypto is risky, Tether isn't out of the water yet, they do have dodgy practices, and regulation will come no matter how much we want decentralisation.

 However new investors are keen to see what's going on and want to get a slice of the pie. Institutional investors will hopefully truly see crypto as a hedge against bonds etc if the crypto market can remove the tie to the main money markets, and there are really good real world projects out there.

stocks,$TTD being over punished by misconceptions about $GOOGL privacy + Tech Sell off?,"I am mainly posting this to see if I'm missing something or perhaps gravely underestimating the power that this Googl privacy change will have on $TTD and internet advertising as a whole.

If you've been following $TTD the last few weeks they recently obliterated through earnings and revenue to the tune of 97% EPS beat and \~10% revenue beat. The dip that followed is actually pretty typical of TTD stock as analysts digest earnings and then the stock usually rallies...which it did until the last two JPow speeches. In part of the broad based NASDAQ sell off $TTD was dragged as expected, however the next day when the NASDAQ was still selling, albeit at a lower pace, $TTD was plummeting on an overall sentiment change in Tech and the GOOGL privacy changes.

What makes this all interesting to me is this - the GOOGL privacy change has been known for over a year (see CEO of $TTD address this over a year ago in January of 2020: [https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/knowledge-center/in-human-terms-episode-9-google-chrome-announcement](https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/knowledge-center/in-human-terms-episode-9-google-chrome-announcement)). The latest revelation about browsing histories really isn't the seismic shift the market is saying it is as of this week - this has been expected for some time. The other argument I hear is that GOOGL added to their privacy press release skepticism over UID 2.0 which $TTD has been spearheading for greater privacy concerns...hmmmmm why would GOOGL knock a competitors approach to something they lagged on and are now trying to jetison as they try and become the ""standard"" for privacy concerns they've violated for the better part of a decade? When the EU started cracking down on Privacy way before the US this was a boon for $TTD...now the market is telling me it's a detriment?

Lastly, I figured that $TTD must rely solely, or heavily, on third party data that is being scrutinized? Although $TTDs platform does integrate with the largest and most robust third party data providers, it is not the pillar of their business that would lead to it's demise. In fact, one of their strongest products is adapting client first party data into useful advertising data. Hence their partnership with $WMT on developing their website advertising platform that will allow for manufacturers to advertise through $WMTs website during the customer experience to drive cross and upsells.

I am most definitely seeking confirmation bias but I am also looking for those to poke holes in what I'm thinking. Were they growing into their valuation? I would say yes, they were probably a bit ahead of their share price when it started decreasing, but given their YoY growth, high margins that are continuing, and positioning in a space that is only growing...I just feel like they are being over punished and that this is a buying opportunity more than it is a retreat from an ATH that will never be sniffed again. I could be wrong - again, confirmation bias is powerful enough for me to write this at 4:57 a.m.",finance

investing,Shoot at me: Long term yields will have to reverse soon,"Fellow r/investing members, please shoot at me any reasons why this is flawed.

It seems to me, with the huge government deficit last year and this year, rising long-term yields reflecting low demand for bonds, the Fed have their hands tied and will need to start buying the long end of the curve.

Now of course Powell is trying it avoid that by reassuring the markets about inflation, and reiterating his dedication to pinning the short-term yield to zero.

I have $16k in credit card debt ($400-ish/month min payments), a $6k car loan ($100 month), and I just bought a $140k condo ($950/month - actually half because I have a roommate). I have about $2500 in savings, I don't want to touch because it's for emergencies. My checking varies from about $0 to $2000 depending on the time of month and how many bills I've paid. 

My cards are between 10-20%. I was playing the 0% transfer game, but the balances are too high to do that now and I have an absurd amount of cards from it (14 cards - Only six have balances. The bulk is $4k each on three cards. I kept the others open because why not? Doesn't hurt my credit. Actually makes my utilization lower and my average age of accounts higher.) 

My credit score is 740. 

I tried to get a debt consolidation loan through Payoff, Best Egg, and Marcus - Two declined me (debt to income too high) and one accepted me, but at an absurd 20% interest rate. I don't understand the logic here. I can pay six credit card bills with that amount, but not just roll them into a lower interest single loan? 

I'm still getting credit card offers all of the time - More 0% transfers. Why are they offering me 0% cards, but declining me for a debt consolidation? Is this my only option to stop paying 20% interest?",finance

**August 19th, 2020:**

We made the video and sent it in. This is in hindsight, a mess up on our part, as he sent the wire from his closed bussiness account, which is now a personal account to him. The assets of the company were sold, but obvisouly the bank account is still his. You don't sell you bank account with a business, that would make no sense since a dollar == a dollar. But this is what we replied with.

&gt;Attached is the video. I'm having trouble with attachment size, as it only allows up to 25mb, so I have to send the bank statement in another email. I had to make the video 720p. I'll also like to add that R\*\*\* Electric Construction Inc was my business but is no longer going since I've retired. Please see next email for the Bank Statement. 

&amp;#x200B;

**August 21st, 2020:**

Didn't hear from them, so we sent another email

&gt;Sorry to reply again. Just trying to think of what it means about the 7 DAYS REFUSED, and the only verification that took a long time was the Advanced Verification, because I only had it half done for a week, I have quite a few emails about it saying failed during that time it wasn’t complete. I eventually finished it and have the email saying it was successful. Then I completed the Fiat Verification as well. I need the reason why it failed and what verification it was, so I know what to do. Does it have anything to do with the wire itself? If I can’t get verified for what ever reason, how do I get my money back? I’d like to just get this done and use your exchange. I’m getting worried, as I have no clue why my account was locked in the first place.

\*\*\*That is right, they asked for the same exact info we already sent them.

This time we sent the same info, but explained how the bank account was his old bussiness.

&gt;My Binance account used my name XXX XXX, and I sent the wire transfer from my now closed companies bank account, R\*\*\* Electric Contruction. I hope that that isn’t a problem.   
&gt;  
&gt;Please get back to me if there is a problem. If I have to prove I own the R\*\*\* Electric bank account, I can do that.

&gt; Hello Mr. XXX XXXX,  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for reaching out to us and if you can please help us with some information so that we can properly get your funds back to you.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Why did you wire the funds from a Business account?  
\- Is R\*\*\* Electric Construction, Inc still in business? If so why was that account closed and do you have a new account opened?  
\- Can you provide us with documents showing that you are the owner of R\*\*\* Electric Construction, Inc?  
\- Written explanation of the various locations that you logged into Binance.US from?  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Best Regards,

&gt;Binance.US- Support Team 

&amp;#x200B;

We replied saying: 

 

&gt;1. My grandson is helping me with buying Bitcoin. He helped me signup, then left it to me to make the wire deposit. I didn't know it would be a problem send the wire from the R\*\*\* Electric bank account.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;2. R\*\*\* Electric is no longer in business. I sold R\*\*\* Electric Construction to a company called XXX XXXX over a year ago. They bought the assets of the company, not the bank account, or my building. They don't use the R\*\*\* Electric name. I have the settlement statement attached. The bank account is still opened, and is the same account that I used when the business was in operation.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;3.  There is the Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) and the Settlement Statement attached from when I sold the company. I hope this is sufficient.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;4. I think there would be two locations. First one would be \*\*\*, which is where my shop is from when I had ran R\*\*\* Electric. Then the second location would be at my grandsons house in \*\*\*. We signed up for Binance and did the verifications from my shop, then the day the wire deposit was transferred, my grandson tried to login from his house to help me out with buying Bitcoin. Since then the account has been locked.

Patient we we're for almost a month with no response

&amp;#x200B;

**November 22nd:**

 

&gt;It has now been a whole month since I have sent you all my information proving that I own the R\*\*\* Electric bank account. It has been exactly 3 months now trying to get my money back. What is the problem here? I am losing my patience, how would you like it if a company locked your account and wouldn’t give you your $100,000 back? Why did you accept the wire transfer only to close my account a minute later and make me fight for my money? If within the minutes of you accepting the wire transfer and locking the account, that means you knew that you shouldn’t have accepted it. You guys are playing with me. It doesn’t take a month to review 5 pages of info and send a wire transfer. Do I need to buy a plane ticket and pay you a visit? Email doesn’t seem to be working too well. I have a cousin in California who is a judge as well and will take legal action. I didn’t want to play this card but I have no choice left, if this goes for another week. I want my money back. And where is the harm in sending back money exactly where it came from? I really don’t see why you have dragged this on for so long. Am I being targeted being over 80 years old? Are you waiting for me to die to keep the money?   
&gt;  
&gt;Don’t give me a one sentence response. I want full detail of the matter and an estimation of when that money will be back in the Ryan Electric bank account. For all I know, I am getting bullshitted by you guys, and you may not even be doing anything to fix this. Just keep dragging it on for another year, maybe I’ll be dead by then.

&amp;#x200B;

Well well well, you send them a nasty letter and they are right on top of it.

&gt; Hi-  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm really sorry about the delay here, somehow this ticket was pushed back in our queue. We are definitely handling this and I reminded the team as well. They did ask for one more thing, can you get a note from your bank stating that the R\*\*\* Electric corporate account was closed? We will need that to proceed. I will be handling this going forward, don't hesitate in asking questions and I'll make sure I answer them in a timely manner. Thank you and again, apologies on the delay here.

&gt; Thanks Biggs. Sorry for my rant, I appreciate the response. The R\*\*\* Electric Corporate bank account is still open as I am still chasing invoices from when I was in business. The business itself is closed.

From here, we have nothing but problems trying to do a wire withdrawal. Sent him an email.

&gt; When I go to the wire withdraw page, it has my name locked in and I can't change it to R\*\*\* Electric. Should I just wire it to my Greenwood Credit Union account instead, or do you think the wire will work with my name? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Greenwood Credit Union sounds like your best bet then.

&amp;#x200B;

So we try it, and it's not working, we sent an email to him again.

&gt; I started the wire, but I haven't received the confirmation email from Prime Trust. It's been around 20 minutes, checked my spam and everything. I added [info@primetrust.com](mailto:info@primetrust.com) to my contacts, not sure if that is the email to whitelist or not. Should I try to do another wire withdrawal? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I just asked the team if they sent one out or not, I will let you know what I hear.

**November 25th:**

Wire isn't working, tried a bunch of things but the confirmation email never gets sent to confirm and start the withdrawal. 

&gt; Hey, I went to the account and under withdrawals it said failed, but like I mentioned I never got the email to confirm it. I tried again, and the same thing is happening. I attached some screenshots. 

&amp;#x200B;

**November 27th:** 

&gt;Hey Biggs, I’m not sure what to do about the wire transfer. I triple checked all the information and I know it’s correct. It knows the bank name automatically once I enter the information, which means to me the routing number is correct. It says failed under the status for each try I did. Even right after I put the info in, I never seen it say pending, or open, just failed. I’m not getting the email to confirm that I want to withdraw, so I don’t think your team will ever get it. I tried to use the checking account number instead of my savings and that didn’t work either. I can’t change the name of the wire to try to send it to the R\*\*\* Electric account, so I’m not sure what I should do. If you would let me buy DAI then get off your exchange, that would work, but don’t know the legality of that. Let me know, it’s been over that 72hr limit and I’m not sure what to do here.    
&gt;

 Still doesn't work, sent him a reply

&gt;The same thing is happening. Is it normal for it to say failed under the status on the withdraw page, as soon as you submit it?  


&amp;#x200B;

Stuck in limbo, I tried to so a wire withdrawal 6 times, different banks, and even different account numbers for each bank. Never worked.

 

&gt;Hello Biggs, I have tried to withdraw to another bank account, this time with Washington Trust, and the same is happening as the other bank. What can we do here? Doesn't seem like wire withdrawals are going to work.

**December 6th:**

**THIS IS THE REAL KICKER OF THE WHOLE STORY, GET A LOAD OF THIS SCHEME.**

A little background here. I didn't try to do ACH originally because my grandparents are scared of online banking. I sent this email asking about doing ACH and if it is alright, and in the mean time, convicted my grandparents to sign up for online banking with Washington Trust, since that was the only bank that they have that was on Biances ACH list.

Mind you the account has been active now for a couple months, with withdrawals only enabled.

**December 6th:**

&gt;Hey Biggs, my money is still on the exchange and wire withdrawals don't work it seems. Is there a way to maybe go straight to Prime Trust to withdraw it? I see there is ACH, as well, not something I really want to do, but would it work if I setup online banking with Washington Trust? Or would it not work since my account is limited?  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks

**NO RESPONSE AT ALL BUT THEY FUCKING DEACTIVED THE ACCOUNT RIGHT AFTER THAT EMAIL ASKING ABOUT AN ALTERNATE WAY TO GET THE MONEY OFF THE EXCHANGE**

**December 7th:**

&gt;Hey, I am looking to talk to Biggs. I just got my online banking setup with Washington Trust, and now my account is disabled with the $100,000 on there. I was just logged in yesterday. This needs to be fixed, I think I finally found a way to get it off since wire withdrawal were not working, which I have sent numerous emails to you about. I haven't received a response from you in a few emails now about my troubles getting the money off, and now you close my account?

&gt;REQUEST #45390  
  
&gt;  
&gt;That's the request ticket number that goes with the emails, incase I get someone other than Biggs. I need to get my money off the exchange, and I have been trying wire withdrawals at different times, and none of them worked. I never got the confirmation email, on 5 or more tries. I tried different banks, and accounts, nothing. I never heard back about it either. I never done online banking, but I saw ACH on the withdrawals page, and since wire isn't working, I decided to bite the bullet and enable my online banking with Washington Trust.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;My account has been limited from trading for over a month now, and only had it enabled to withdraw, which never worked with the wire method. I never got help form you guys, after sending multiple emails.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A couple days ago, I emailed you guys about trying this ACH transfer, asking if it would work. In the meantime I went ahead and got online banking setup anyway. The very next day my account is locked. Having it limited for months, then me emailing you the day before, asking about me trying ACH, then having the account DISABLED just before I got setup with my bank for online banking, looks like a scam. A lot of actions over the past 5 months have seemed like a scam.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;What happened to Biggs taking this ticket personally until I got settled? Seems after I never got confirmation emails from the wire withdrawals, and adding Prime Trust to my email contracts/whitelist didn't work, he just stopped talking to me.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Last time I was ignored, I had to send a nasty email to you guys, then all of a sudden I started to get help. Then I cooled down, and yet again you guys are ignoring me.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;This has been quite a few emails now without a response.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Get back to me soon, or I will have to take legal action. This is absolutely ridiculous. All my emails and screenshots I have taken, I am ready to go to court.

personalfinance,How/Where to invest home sale proceeds,"Sorry if it’s too long or too much info, but trying to be as detailed as I can.

Hello, hoping someone can help me.  Back in September my wife and I sold our old house and came out with $250k net proceeds (bought $270k and sold for $430k) but but mortgage balance at the time was $180k.

When we bought our new home we purchased it at $270k and put down $54k (20%) down using separate savings and took advantage of the low interest rate of 2.99% / 30 years.

We took around $25k out of the house profit to do some immediate renovations.

The plan all along was to take the home profit and invest it which would theoretically do better than if we used it to buy the home outright.

Problem is it’s all been sitting (~235k) in a high yield account only making roughly $65/month in interest.

What should our plan be with this money?  Invest it (how/where?), pay off the house, etc?

I was going to take $24k and fund my wife and my Roth IRAs for 2020 and 2021 since we didn’t contribute to it last year or this year yet.

We wanted to keep maybe $30k for emergency so that leaves around $180k left to invest.

No major debt beyond one car payment @2.99% ($25k balance / 3 years left) and our mortgage @2.99.  No other debt.

If it helps any, according to mint we have around $708k net worth.

+$253k cash (includes checking/savings)

Minus $5k in CC (paid off each month, just higher from renovations this cycle)

Minus $246k in loans (car and mortgage)

+$334k investments

+$372 in approx property value


TLDR:

Looking to invest around $180k that’s sitting in a high yield account currently.  How should we smartly go about this? Especially with all the chaos in the US market now.

personalfinance,Investment advice for unusual tax situation,"Hello. 

Most investment advice is at least influenced by the need to minimize taxes. However, how would the advice change for an investor who doesn’t pay any [income] taxes?

I’m mid-career. A few years ago I switched industries and, not entirely on accident, chose a very niche one in which all wages are tax-free (local, state, federal, even most sales taxes). Side income is taxed as normal of course, and I make some through real estate rentals, but it’s minimal.

My employer also pays most major expenses including our house, utilities, and all college expenses for the kids (also, natch, tax free...yes I’m serious).

I was quite late in starting to really save but my wife and I are up to 550k in our late 40s. Our contributions are maxed out because we are fortunate enough not to have many expenses. Our cars are frugal and paid off (the “nice” ride is a 2010 Prius). We have no debt at all.

(By the way those who are younger than me which is probably everybody, my credit and debt were a mess 15 years ago and I dug out just by saving diligently and rolling down the high interest debts one by one - you can too).

In a year we will have a full one year emergency fund saved up.

We have invested in several rental properties that are doing well even in the current crisis.

We don’t own our own home because we just sold it. We were renting it out after getting the corporate house, and it was a money pit. End result is there is no mortgage now to pay off.

Questions:

1- by force of habit I’ve maxed out my Roth and traditional 401k contributions, and get all the employer matches...but why contribute more than what’s sufficient to get the matching contribution? I don’t need a Roth to minimize taxes because I don’t pay any. The fees are very low, but other than that: Is there any reason to use a Roth other than the tax benefit that doesn’t apply here?

2- where do I save or invest the rest? There’s several thousand a month left over after all the contributions. Where should somebody mid-career (if I can still call it that at my age) put the rest, in these tax circumstances?

3- I just have basic 5x-income life insurance from my employer. What should it be? 10x? More? Should I be buying some other form of insurance?

Thanks!",finance

investing,Reducing Your Risk By Diversification,"One of the best ways to reduce your risk is by diversification. This can usually be done by holding many stocks in different industries or more simply holding an index. Let me explain why.

There are two kinds of risks. One is systematic risk and the other is non-systematic risk. We can eliminate non-systematic risk through diversification, but not systematic risk. Systematic risk is also called market risk which means it impacts the whole market. For example, this could be due to a hike in interest rates, Treasury Yields rising and etc. This impacts the whole market and cannot be diversified.

However, there is also called non-systematic risk. This is a firm-specific or industry-specific risk. For example, if a company has a product recall, the risk is only for that specific company and not other companies. An industry-specific risk is if the whole industry is shaken by something only impacting that industry. For example, we saw this with oil prices a year ago. Oil companies went down, but other companies weren't specifically down.

Why does this matter and how does it relate to risk. Well, we can eliminate all non-systematic risk by holding a diversified portfolio. The reason for this is because many stocks won't be as correlated with one another, which means that any really bad gains can be offset by any really good gains and vice versa. Theoretically, You won't be exposed to non-systematic risk since you are eliminating it by holding a diversified portfolio. The only risk you have is systematic risk (market risk). Theoretically, we are not compensated by non-systematic risk since it is a risk we can diversify.

Just keep in mind that when you buy industry-specific ETF's or if your portfolio is concentrated in one sector, you are exposing yourself to more risk than necessary.",finance

personalfinance,Thinking of buying a car: should I put money down or save it and take advantage of great interest rates?,"Hey everyone!  Lots of info here. TLDR at the bottom i if you want to skip ahead.

I've been driving the same car for 14 years (2006 chevy HHR with about 93k that has served me waaaaaay better than I ever would have guessed) and always planned on driving it till it no longer works.  I bought it a year old with about 13k miles.  The cosmetic condition is a bit rough as one might expect from a 14 year old car, but it's totally operational. It's worth, maybe, $1200-$1,500. It's due for inspection this month, the check engine light is on, and my willingness to pay for repairs is low, like $500. This may be high given the value of the car.

I've been saving for the purpose of buying a vehicle and have about $10k that I originally planned to use for a cash purchase when the wheels finally fall off this car. Alternatively, I planned to use it for a down payment, then take out a car loan and finance a nicer vehicle.  I've been using Betterment's major purchase account to save this money and have earned about 8% interest in the three years or so that I've been saving (I have other savings/investments besides this).

Given that the savings is doing so well, I'm hesitant to pull the money and give up that interest rate. My credit union auto rates are 2.24% - 2.49% for new cars and pre-owned cars going back to model year 2019. I've got my eye on a mazda CX-30, and they are offering a 0.9% financing offer for new cars (my credit score is +800 and no debt besides my mortgage, so I'm pretty sure I'd qualify). 

I'm thinking the financially wise decision if it's time for a new car is to put down what I have to to make the payment comfortable and leave the savings invested.  I want the payment to be under $300/month.

Is this smart?  Is losing the interest earnings (plus whatever the tax implications are of withdrawing from the account) to put money down a dumb move? On the one hand, this is exactly why i saved the money. On the other, it's out performing the car rates by a lot.

Also, is buying new a sound option if my interest rate is less then 1%? I know generally used cars are considered better buys due to new car value depreciation. Currently the pre-owned market is slim for the CX-30. There's only about a $2500 difference between used 2020 models and new 2021 models. 2020 was the first year. It's silly, but I'm considering new just to get the color I want if I can't find it used. 

Honestly, I'm also struggling because it feels extravagant to give up a working car and take on a car payment.  But in addition to wanting to take advantage of low interest rates, I really want the convenience and comfort of modern tech like bluetooth, back up cameras, heated seats. Most of my driving is short trips for errands, but I often visit my parents who live an hour away, so comfort for those longer trips is important. This is the area where my current car is most deficient.

I'm hoping to keep this car for another 14 years, at least!

Very interested to get some feedback on my options. Thanks for your time!

TL;DR: should I replace a 14 year old car with a used car at 2.24%, a new car at 0.9%, and should I minimize my cash down payment since it's earning about 8%?",finance

personalfinance,Use Savings To Pay Off Debt Or Keep Emergency Fund,"I am a 23 yr old with $105k debt (yes, I know, it's a lot) who graduated with my undergrad in May 20 and will be graduating with my Master's this May. I am currently working full time but I will be starting a new job that pays me $8k more per year in a less-taxable state in June (will go from bringing home $4200 per month to $5k per month). With the help of a nice tax refund and stimulus checks and low rent, I currently have 5.5 months worth of expenses saved. However, I am somebody who is very anxious about my debt and sees right now as a unique opportunity to pay off as much as possible of my private loans while federal payments are paused with no interest (i have 60k private and 45k federal). Would it be dumb of me to use 3.5/5.5 months worth of my savings to pay off a large chunk of one of my biggest loans with the highest debt? Or is this a dumb idea?

CryptoCurrency,Short Tether?,"None of this is financial advice.  I'm just speculating, don't put in more than you can afford to lose.

In 90 days or so, as I understand it, Tether has to reveal the assets that back USDT.  There is some possibility that this is some sort of scam and that this reporting date will be the end of that scam.  I don't know exactly what the possibility is, but even if it's only 5-15% is there any good reason not to do the following:

1. Borrow Tether, nexo (for example) has interest rates at 5.9%-11.9%
2. Cash out the Tether for USD.
3. Sit on the USD for 90 Days until Tether reports it's assets (hard to get much of any risk free interest right now, but that is not the point)
4. If tether is a scam, buy back the tethers for less the a penny on the dollar and pay back the loan.  If tether is not a scam, all you've lost is the interest.  If you're comfortable putting USDC into an interest bearing account, you can even offset that loss substantially.

It seems like a low risk, high reward trade.  Unlike shorting most assets, there is no possibility that Tether can go up substantially.  Am I missing something?

Edit: People keep asking about a source for the 90 Day timeline.  As I understand their settlement with the NYAG, they are required to file reports with the NYAG (and release them publicly) on a quarterly basis.  I can't find an exact deadline, but one quarter is roughly 90 days.  If they can't make the deadline there is some possibility that this alone will mess up the market.

Edit #2: It turns out there is a catch:  If you do this, you actually have to be a little careful.  Most places make you put up collateral to borrow Tether.  You need to put up collateral where you are absolutely sure that 1) The collateral value won't crash with the rest of the market if the Tether report kicks off a crash AND 2) The entity that's holding the collateral won't go kaput if the market crashes completely taking your collateral with you. 

Personally, I think USDC backed by Coinbase solves problem #1, I'm pretty sure that backing is real.  Problem 2, I'm not so sure about:  

1. Is there any place that lets you borrow Tether based on the balance in an FDIC insured bank account?  
2. Is there any place that you can borrow Tether with no collateral?
3. Is there any place where you can use the balance of a non-custodial wallet as collateral.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Telling the story of my IRS saga in the hopes that I might help others,"Hi /r/Personalfinance

Almost a year ago, I filed my 2019 tax return via Turbotax (I qualify for the free version). Both my state and federal returns were marked as accepted, but I never got my federal refund or any stimulus money. 

After several months of waiting and contacting the IRS to no avail, I got in touch with my Congressional representative. They had their constituent services people follow up with the Taxpayer Advocacy service. I was then contacted by a representative from the TAP, who got some information from me and had me mail in documents as well. She told me the main problem was that I had made unnecessary estimated tax payments, which I had made because my dad told me his accountant said I had to make them. Why this created such a delay, no one has been able to say.

Several more months went by, until I received a letter from the IRS stating that my return was due to be processed in February. In February they sent me a letter saying it would be processed in March. 

Today, I filed my 2020 tax return. It was immediately rejected for having a supposedly incorrect AGI number. When I tried to find my return transcript on the IRS website to confirm my AGI number, the page would not load. The IRS website did have a blurb that stated my AGI number as exactly what I had entered, but this turned out to be a red herring.

I was finally able to resolve my issue by calling my local Taxpayer Advocacy Center and asking to make an appointment. After 40 minutes on hold they connected me with a real human being who asked me about what I was dealing with, and said he could get me the information I need without having to make an appointment. He told me my 2019 return had finally been processed a few days ago, and they'd be sending me a check for my 2019 refund shortly. He also said that because the return was processed more than 50 days after it was submitted (or maybe after some other arbitrary date, I'm not sure), their system was unable to pull my 2019 AGI number, and so I needed to mark it as zero in order for the return to go though. I did this, and lo and behold, it was accepted. My 2020 refund will be quite beefy because it includes the stimulus checks I never got. So now I have a couple grand on the way from the IRS.

TL:DR: 

* You'll have issues filing your next years return if your previous years wasn't accepted within a certain amount of time
* If you're having trouble with your AGI number, just mark it as zero
* Find your local IRS TAP office and call the appointment number if you actually want a chance of speaking to a person. It might take a while but it should work. 

Questions: 

* Does anybody know why on Earth those estimated tax payments would cause so much trouble?
* Why isn't the dysfunctionality of the IRS a bigger national issue?
*  Did reaching out to my congress person actually help anything?

personalfinance,Mortgage rate locks in a rising interest rate environment,"Hi all,

We're almost ready to sign a purchase agreement on a home purchase and found the rates jumped by 0.5% in the past 15-20 days or so. That is a bit of a bummer for us but we can still afford the house, so we're going forward with the purchase.

However, we'd like some amount of downside protection here - given interest rates are as volatile as they are now, are there any lenders the community recommends that will adjust rates downwards if they drop? Our current lender said they'd adjust 50% of the drop (e.g., rates go from 3% to 2.75% before closing, they'd meet us halfway and give us 2.875%).

Alternatively, can you just walk away from a lender and start a new application with a different lender if rates do drop? Or will we have to pay some money to the lender to cancel the app?

Appreciate it if mods don't close the thread because we're in a bit of a time crunch and would love to get as much feedback as possible here.

personalfinance,Student Loan Settlement: A shot in the foot or an open door?,"Hello Reddit!

This is officially my first reddit post to try to figure out the secrets of our bullshit credit system that no other country uses and get some non-bias financial advice.

**Background**:

* I have \~40k saved.
* I have a federal student loan in good health
* I have a 2 **PRIVATE** student loans in ""recovery"" in Wells Fargo vernacular (just found out this means collections) at \~$23.5k per loan totaling roughly $47,000 not accruing any interest
* My credit score is 690

I have been chipping away at the private loan for about a year now via ACH payments on the 15th of the month. I went to get pre-approved for a mortgage and that's when I found out ""recovery"" is actually collections and I couldn't get an FHA with over $2k in collections (mine being \~$47k).

I thought showing the note with the agreed upon payments to Wells Fargo on their letterhead would be good for an underwriter - but at that point I also thought the loan was current because of the agreed upon payments - well shit.

**Option 1**: Pay the loan in full in, be cash poor but have immaculate credit.

This will inevitably set me back financially but I will have no outstanding bad debt and I have an $80k base + commissions and should be able to save money quickly.

**Option 2 (what I'm drooling over)**:

\-Take Well's Fargos offer of a settlement at 40% of the remainder of the two loans: \~$18,200

\-Receive a 1099-C in the amount of \~$27.5k reported to IRS

\- Have both loans reported to credit bureaus as ""payed in full for less than the total amount""

\- Have a safety net of cash

**MILLION DOLLAR QUESTIONS:**

1. What will option 2 do to my credit and for how long
2. How much will I owe on the 1099-C of $27k

personalfinance,"While in School, Is it Better to Use Money to Pay Off Existing Loans or Avoid Taking Out New Loans?","After working this summer, I will have about $30k which is enough for me to pay tuition and living expenses for my final year of school. I am trying to figure out whether it would make the most sense to pay off existing federal loans (From 2019, I have a PLUS loan for $25,000 with a 7.08% interest rate and an unsubsidized loan of $20,991 with a 6.08% interest rate. I have other loans too, but these higher interest ones are the ones I'm eyeing for repayment).

This year, the interest rates were lower (5.3% for the PLUS; 4.30% for the unsubsidized) and I expect that next year the interest rates will remain on the lower end. There is also a loan origination fee. The rates this year were 1.057% for unsubsidized loans and 4.236% for PLUS loans. Let's assume for the sake of this analysis that both the interest rates and the loan origination rates will be similar next year to what they were this year.

I'm having a hard time figuring out the right way to think through this analysis. That 7.08% interest rate is super high so it is tempting to knock out that loan and take out a new loan. But the origination fees would eat at the interest savings and I'm having trouble squaring that up.

Could anyone help me think this through? Thank you!!

Note: I know right now interest rates are frozen at 0% but I'm following the politics surrounding student loans very closely and believe that the government will begin collecting interest again this winter. For the purpose of this analysis, let's set aside the prospect that loans will be cancelled (they won't be) and that interest rates will remain at zero (they won't).",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 5, 2021.","After falling steeply in the morning, the major indices reversed to finish firmly in the green as market participants digested the Labor Department February Unemployment report, rising Treasury yields, and developments surrounding stimulus. 

The US added back the most jobs in four months in February, as falling coronavirus cases, an increase in the pace of vaccinations, and easing social distancing guidelines are allowing many businesses to reopen. Non-farm payrolls rose by 379,000 in February, or well above the 200,000 expected. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.2%, unexpectedly improving compared to January's 6.3%. The February jobs report also included a notable upward revision to payroll. January’s payroll gain was revised up to 166,000 from the tepid 49,000 previously reported.

In response to the positive jobs reports, Treasury yields rose once again to hover near its one-year high. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a high of 1.6% today before dipping to 1.557% at the time of writing. As a reminder, high expectations of economic growth causes Treasury yields to rise as the demand for bonds drops in order to make them more attractive. 

Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

During a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, “If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.”

Texas said Tuesday that it was lifting its mask requirement and would allow businesses to fully reopen, the most expansive step by any state to remove coronavirus restrictions as Americans across the country are eager to emerge after a year of isolation in the pandemic. 

Senate Democrats struck a last-minute agreement Friday to set federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week, down from the $400 passed by the House, but extend their duration by more than a month as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, according to a Democratic aide. Democrats hope to pass the bill before the mid-March cliff where enhanced federal unemployment benefits from the previous relief package expire.

personalfinance,Bank personnel said that I can refinance my car loan for a better rate,"Hi PF, 

I am definitely a dummy when it comes to the mental gymnastics when it comes to shuffling loans that have a remaining balance around for new loans and loan types for new principals and/or interest rates.

The title is part of the story. I purchased a car brand new (I already know how you feel about that) about a year and a half ago at an unfortunate 4.19%. Sometime before Covid took hold I happened to be in the bank that financed my car loan when I was sorting out login information for their payment system. The person I was working with to get the account login all set up looked at the details of the loan and told me that if I refinanced directly with the bank that I already had the loan with that they could get me a better interest rate because ""The dealership took some sort of a cut"" for financing the loan for me. 

So... PNC Bank can give me a better rate than PNC Bank? This seems straight forward, sure...

What is escaping me (since I am a bit slow) is how that will benefit me in any way, shape, or form. The loan amount began as $W and the interest rate as X%. If I refinance for Y% interest the initial principal value will still be $W so refinancing helps me how exactly? 

I also understand the way that car loans work is that the interest is paid ""first"" and the principal ""last"" making the loan ""interest forward"". Honestly I feel like I have lost at least some of my ass either way and the interest that I have already paid just benefits the bank and is the price I pay, I'll have to live with that.

There’s been eviction moratoria in various forms in the US for nearly a year now, and the numbers of people delinquent in either are rising.  Yet the market keeps going up even in retail companies.

These articles and more all have the same theme:  people are behind on home payments, even if only partially.

There’s also a persistent expectation of loss of employment income with [this US Census survey](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?mapPeriodSelector=14&amp;barChartPeriodSelector=14&amp;mapAreaSelector=st&amp;barChartAreaSelector=st) with weekly data for 24 weeks (raw data available for download).  There’s a nice map there that breaks things down by state and by metro area.  A common theme here is large non-farm employment hubs like L.A., Miami, New York, Boston, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, San Diego, and Nevada (where I suspect Las Vegas and Reno are getting hit hard since they’re heavy tourism and service sectors).  These expectation percentages are large in leading metro areas.

There’s [this January 2021 survey](https://www.blackknightinc.com/black-knights-first-look-at-january-2021-mortgage-data/) on mortgage data that appears mixed.  Two bullet points demonstrate this:

&gt; The national mortgage delinquency rate fell to 5.9% in January, dropping below 6% for the first time since March 2020

&gt; At the current rate of improvement, 1.8 million mortgages will still be seriously delinquent at the end of June when foreclosure moratoriums on government-backed loans are currently slated to lift

A large concern is the moratorium extension Biden issued on January 21st.  The extension moves the expiration from March 31st to June 31st.  The reason it’s a concern is because it’s only for mortgages, not also rent.

&gt; The White House said the extended protections are in part aimed at prioritizing communities of color hit hardest by the pandemic. Homeowners of color make up a disproportionate share of the home owners with delinquent loans or on forbearance plans. 

&gt; However, Tuesday's actions did not address the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's federal moratorium on evictions for not paying rent. That moratorium is also set to expire March 31. About one-third of all Americans, roughly 107 million people, are renters. [(source)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/16/mortgage-relief-ban-home-foreclosures-extended-joe-biden/6755036002/)

We keep pushing these quarterly moratoria out by one quarter, and I’m not sure what politicians are expecting to happen inside three months that will address this situation to a sufficient degree.  Debt is debt, and people getting their jobs back doesn’t mean that debt goes away instantly.  

The service sector is the largest non-farm sector in the US economy by employment [(source)](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm).  That sector has also gotten kicked square in the balls by the pandemic.  The fact that the service sector pays crap to most of its employees means that they have a really hard time building up emergency funds and are therefore likely to be small.  With an extended period of reduced wages or just plain unemployment means that most of those emergency funds will have likely been drained by now.

That’s a long way of saying there are lots of low-income folks on the edge of eviction with no help whatsoever in sight.  From the Bloomberg article above on February 8, 20201: 

&gt; Some 9.3 million jobs were lost last year and the U.S. suffered the sharpest rise in the poverty rate since the 1960s.

Bash a bear all you want, I don’t see any other interpretation of this data other than politicians refusing to defuse a massive economic time bomb.

That does not mean that there won’t be growth in sectors.  I just don’t like the fact that I just now seriously considered for a few minutes getting into a payday loan ETF (they’ve somewhat flatlined, which I’m actually thankful for, maybe due to various state-level legislation in recent years limiting their collective growth potential).

If [current monetary policy](https://media0.giphy.com/media/l0Ex6kAKAoFRsFh6M/200.gif) was to avoid a crash in March 2020, they succeeded.  I’m no economist, so I can’t critique one way or the other if it was the smart thing to do, but we can’t deny the effects that it’s going to have:  increased inflation.  It’s possible that the intent was to turn a crash into inflation which the Fed can manage better, but it’s not clear if really they just dumped money into the economy only to save the stock market with near complete disregard for the long-term effects.  We’ve heard JPow say their policy has been adjusted inflation targets to *average* 2% per year, but naturally that implies at least one year of &gt; 2% inflation, likely more.  If an economist or two can lend some insight here as to their intent and potential mitigation strategies, it would be extremely helpful.  I worry that the party will be over when they transition to finite QE.

The picture is far more complex than these statistics.  As far as calling this DD, it’s incomplete, but I’m posting it here to get a more in-depth conversation started.  There are gaps to fill, statistics to clarify, and simply just more research that needs to be done to get a better picture.

Bitcoin,How to inform people about crypto to people who don’t understand crypto,"I see people wondering how to start the crypto conversation with people who don’t understand crypto so I thought I’d share my thoughts. 

In my experience, I’ve started with sharing what makes good monetary value. Specifically being able to be divisible (100 million satoshis in one bitcoin), easily transferable (self explanatory), and controlled supply (21 million no more no less). I also bring up how there’s an estimated 4 million+ lost so it’s actually scarcer than most people realize. 

I also bring up how cryptocurrency is kind of a misnomer. Even bitcoins narrative is changing from a currency to a store of value. Most cryptos aren’t meant to be currencies, but so much more. Essentially like investing in different internet companies, not different currencies. 

I then go into what Ethereum is, being a smart contract platform where people can build dApps. How it is attempting to become the world computer. I talk about some of the projects being built on it from Brave Browser to real cloud storage application and then DeFi. 

And then DeFi. I think right now DeFi is the most promising thing to come out of crypto. I talk about lending platforms and decentralized derivatives markets. Going into staking, I talk about the percent yields of staking and how low traditional financial market interest rates are now. Ultimately how decentralized finance could become the standard as it seems inevitable with the lack of trust in traditional financial markets and the devaluation of the dollar through hyperinflation and endless money printing. 

Not everyone will see it right away, but in my experience, seeing people say things like, “wow I had no idea that there was this much to it,” shows that the public still has no idea what this stuff is. Just take your time and understand that it’s not your obligation for other people to understand right away. Just do your part and then let them figure out the rest and help if they have further questions. 

Not everything will need to be decentralized/take advantage of blockchain technology. But if you’re able to find the things that greatly benefit from it🧐

personalfinance,Best way to register monthly installments on budget app,"Hello everyone, I’m looking for some ideas to solve an “issue” I’m facing while trying to order my personal finances.

I am using a classical budget management app to register my expenses and keep control of monthly balance, etc. 

My process is simple: whenever I purchase something or make a payment, I register it on the app. However, I’m not sure what would be the best way to log purchases made in monthly installments or when the payment is not due until a later date. To illustrate:

Example 1:

I but something on Amazon for let’s say $600, but my bank offers me to pay in 6 installments, 0% interest rate ($100 x month for six months).

Should I log a $600 expense today? Or it would be more logical to add a monthly expense of $100 for 6 months?

Example 2:

I make a hotel reservation for a trip that will take place in a few months. The hotel doesn’t actually charge me until the arrival, so at the moment, I haven’t had a withdrawal of money from my account.

Should I log this today? Or waiting until the day the money actually goes out of my account makes more sense?

Basically, the real question is whether to log expenses when they are “made” or when the money actually comes out of my bank account

personalfinance,Credit Score and Mortgage Rate,"Hello,

I’m 25, have a credit score in the 780s, and I have enough saved up for a down payment. I’d like to purchase a property in the next ~6-7 months while interest rates are still low. I’d like to do what I can to get the lowest possible mortgage rate.

I currently have 1 credit card, have had it for a year, and have always paid off the full balance each month and keep my utilization below 10%. I have one other available line of credit from a checking account I’ve had opened for the past ~6 years. 

I know which other credit card I’d like to apply for. I understand if I apply it will drop my score in the short term, although I don’t know by how many points, if that would be enough to affect my mortgage rate, or if my score would bounce back to ~780 in the 6-7 month timeframe(knowing I’d pay off my balance in full every month). I know long term it would help boost my score and (hopefully) get me above 800 by having more credit accounts than I do currently and help with utilization ratio, but I don’t know if that would happen in the 6-7 month timeline to try to get the absolute best mortgage rate. 

Do you think it would be beneficial or would hurt my potential mortgage rate to apply for a new credit card? Or would it have any affect at all? I’m still leaning the process for mortgages and credit score changes. Thank you for your help.",finance

stocks,Is solar overvalued?,"Solar has seen a big run-up, and recently a big correction. Between 2018 and 2021 TAN (a solar ETF) went from \~$20 a share to \~$120 a share, the latter number from just two weeks ago. It has since retreated to \~$87 a share. 

My assumption was that the run up was due to the [rapid decline in solar energy costs](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth) - this is an extremely bullish signal for solar to be highly competitive on a per kWh basis - solar farms can be cheaper than natural gas, and even residential solar can be cheaper than nuclear. Furthermore, because a solar cell is similar to a semiconductor, it is behaving in a way similar to Moores Law (known as Swanson's Law in the industry).

personalfinance,Buying a second home,"My wife and I currently own a home in the suburbs of Denver, CO and are considering buying a second home in Breckenridge or Silverthorne (basically in the mountains). We love that area and would really enjoy spending a weekend up there every month. The plan is to rent the second home out on airbnb to cover the mortgage. I was hoping to get some advice regarding how risky/viable this idea is.

# Current Finances

By most standards, we're quite wealthy. We own a home valued around 600k, our mortgage is around 440k at a comfortable 3% interest rate

We have a number of investment accounts, a ROTH IRA with 320k, a traditional IRA with 130k, a brokerage account with 265k, a traditional 401k with 30k, and about 50k in our checking account. Our investment accounts are invested pretty much exclusively across various index funds.

My wife takes care of the family at home (we have a young child), and my total comp is 200k a year.

Both of us have credit scores in the high 700s last time we looked (basically no negative marks).

We have no other debt obligations besides the mortgage described above.

By and large, we live quite conservatively, saving several thousand dollars every month.

# Proposed Purchase

We're looking at homes between 550k - 750k. The plan is to put down a 20% down payment on whatever we purchase; my guess is that we could get a similar interest rate to what we have now (correct me if that's not going to be true given our current mortgage).

We would then immediately start renting the home out online. My expectation is that our monthly expenses for the new home would total a little over 3k. I suspect it would take a fair bit before we could recoup a large portion of these costs in rental income, and I know we'd be paying the mortgage out of pocket for a while. I suppose my biggest fear is that we never establish rental income above a couple hundred or maybe 1000 dollars a month. This would not be sustainable for us. But the home would be in a highly desirable vacation/ski location, so I'm trying to grapple with the likelihood of this scenario.

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do. I've by and large invested very conservatively my whole life. My wife and I are young, and I recognize that we could retire extremely comfortably if we just keep doing what we're doing. On the other hand, I'm attempting to calculate the maximum loss we could incur if we bought the home, didn't get any renters, and found ourselves selling it a year later. I suppose we'd be down around 100k, which feels like an acceptable though uncomfortable loss.

Does anyone have experience renting out a second home. How likely is it that we could do this sustainably? How long might it take to get a rental income that covers 75% of our expenses (this feels sustainable)?  Would a bank even give us a mortgage? If so, are we going to have some crazy interest rate given my income won't cover both mortgages alone? Any thoughts on how much we could lose if it all falls through?

stocks,PSA: Why Treasury Rates matter for your Fundamental Equity Valuations,"*FYI This is going to cover some very fundamental stuff that I'm sure a lot of you already know, however since there's plenty of casuals and new joiners, I figured it might be worthwhile to give a primer on.*

Here's a simple question: **What is a stock worth right now and why?**

There's lots of ways to answer this question, many (revenue multiples, earnings multiples, etc) are short hand or simplified ways of describing the same thing.

The foundation of modern finance answers this with: **The Present Value of all Future Cash Flows**

Regardless of whether you're talking about equity in a growth tech company, a value oriented utilities operator, or even a distressed oil company, the answer can be broken down further into two components or sets of assumptions:

1. What are those future cash flows this company will produce for this equity share I'm buying?
2. What discount do I give them to calculate their value today?

# Future Cash Flows:

The first component I imagine everyone is conceptually super familiar with. Everyone see's headlines about revenue growth or earnings growth and some kind of % figure that gets them excited. So when it comes to the value of equity, which do we care about?

The answer here is less commonly thrown around. The cash flows we calculate into for an equity valuation are the **Free Cash Flow to Equity**, or **FCFE.**

In short, **FCFE** is how much cash is available to all shareholders **AFTER** all expenses, reinvestment, and debts have been paid. A comparison for personal income would be, this is like calculating how much you have left each month from your paycheck after you take out taxes, pay for groceries, pay that student loan bill, pay rent, and pay for that oil change on your car.

So how do you calculate a company's **FCFE**? Thankfully lots of companies do this already in their non-GAAP calculations, but if they don't it's relatively simple on your own.

`FCFE = CFO - Capital Expenditures + Net Debt`

Thankfully CFO is a standard GAAP accounting figure you'll always have. Capital expenditures are generally straight forward but can be disguised. And net debt is the net change in debt balances, if you issue more debt, more cash is coming in the door, that's considered that higher cash flow to the shareholders.

So this gives you an idea of excess cash that theoretically is coming back into your pocket as an owner of the equity. But you can't do this for infinite years right? At some point you have to just create a final value at some point in the future. This is called our ""Terminal Value"" and it represents some generic assumptions about growth and costs of capital to give you an idea of what all the years beyond that are worth. The formula is pretty straight forward. If I want build a 5 year model, I will include my terminal value in year 5. The formula for figuring this out is as follows:

`Terminal CF = yr 5 FCFE * (1+g) / (WACC - g)`

Now there's a couple ways to think about this, but the easiest way is to simply view it as the value of all cash flows AFTER year 5 at an **assumed growth rate (g)** and assumed **cost of capital (WACC)**. This value is calculated as if you existed in year 5 already and assumed long run growth rate is also the same as the long run rate of growth in the economy. If you subscribe to Damodan's school of valuation (widely viewed as the authority on equity valuation modeling), there is an argument for g being the nominal gdp growth rate.

Now that we've put together the string of cash flows, what is the actual value of what you're receiving?

# Discount Rates:

This is the second component of the answer fewer people on here seem to incorporate when thinking about stocks. The idea here is that there is some inherent discount you need to apply to something you're going to receive in the future. It's a little bit longer but stick with me.

Let's take a step back and think about what that means. If I say I'm going to give you $100 tomorrow, generally you're pretty safe in assuming that's the same as having $100 today right? Cool that's fairly easy. Now what if I tell you I'll give you $50 in 10 years and $50 in 20 years. Are you going to value that the same as scenario 1? No right? Because if you get $100 tomorrow there's still 10+ years of time to do more productive things with that money than you would have in scenario 2 (i.e. invest it etc).

So how does this apply to valuations? Think of all those cash flows we talked about before. The value of ""buying the thing that gives you those cash flows"" is basically all of them summed up right? **Wrong**. Remember those cash flows are in the future... And things in the future are intrinsically worth less than they are today.

So how do we figure out what they worth today? Well that brings us to one of the most fundamental formulas in all of finance:

`FV = PV (1+r)^t`

That is, for a **given rate of growth (r)** and a **given amount of time (t)**, we can figure out what the future value of any amount will be.  If we know our future values, but not our present, then we can just flip this around and solve it the other way:

`PV = FV / (1+r)^t`

We already know FV is just the cash flows we talked about above already. So what is the 1/(1+r)\^t? That's what we call our discount factor and this is where we are finally getting to the topic of this post's title. t is super easy, years are years unless you're some sort of time traveler. The real question here is **""HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT RATE TO USE?""**. The answer in finance to discount your cash flows by the company's **Weighted Average Cost of Capital** or **WACC**. The concept here is that cost of capital comes in two broad components, cost of debt, and cost of equity. Cost of debt is sort of self explanatory. You have some debt, you owe interest on it each year, there's some marginal tax benefit by interest payments lowering your tax obligations, etc. But let's ignore this for a second and pretend we're looking at a company with zero debt.

What the fuck is ""**cost of equity**"" and what does it mean? It's far less tangible of a concept because there are no explicit interest payments that you can point to as ""costs"" like there are for debt. Instead some nobel prize winning financial economists (Jack Treynor \[mentor of Fischer Black\], William Sharpe \[known for the Sharpe Ratio\], and Merton Miller \[known for Modigliani-Miller Theory\]) captured essence of determining an equity share's ""cost"" through a theory called the **Capital Asset Pricing Model** or **CAPM** for short. This was a formula designed to determine what ""cost"" should be assigned to an asset based on a risk free rate of return, a market rate of return, and the inherent correlation of your asset with that market. You can see where I'm going with this. The formula is as follows:

`R(E) = Rrfr + B*(ERP)`

R(E) here represents the expected return of an asset. This can also be called your expected return on an equity or to the company issuing this equity it is the ""cost"" to them that's expected in return for the investor buying their equity.

Rrfr is just shorthand for the expected return on a risk free asset. You wouldn't ever buy into an equity share with the expectation that it gives you less than what the most risk free asset is right? Cool. So in the broad scheme of things there's a couple of things you could use for this, but one of the most common is the 10 year US Treasury yield (or some other duration US Treasury note/bill/bond). The US Government is widely believed to be the most risk free counterparty in the world. It's the nature of being a reserve currency.

B is your assets beta to the market. There's a lot we can unpack with this but for an oversimplification, let's think of it as for every 1% the broad market changes, how much does your equity change by?

And finally, ERP. This is the Equity Risk Premium. There's several ways to approach this but the simplest is to think of it as the general expectation of investors as to how much the broad market should outperform risk free assets. People purchase equity shares with the expectation of higher returns than safer assets? Seems reasonable.

Let's try this out with the broad market. Let's assume beta (B) is 1.0, the risk free rate is 1.0% and the ERP (expected spread between risk free and market) is 8%.

`R(E) = 1.5% + 1.0*(8%) = 9.5%`

That's a fairly reasonable rate. The sanity check here is comparing it to cost of debt. Because equities are lower in the capital structure, their cost should explicitly always be higher than the cost of debt. In the broad market companies are borrowing at less than 9.5% so that rough eyeball test checks out. If you invest in the broad equity market, your expectation is for companies to deliver 9.5% in value to you each year.

This finally brings us back to the topic of this post. You can see, wayyyy down in the granular details of a valuation, the equity markets fundamental valuation are inherently baselined on risk free rates. Now let's combine this with what we talked about above and see why such small changes in that tiny rate can have such large outcomes in valuations.

# Case Study: QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE: $QS)

I'll be honest, the reason I chose this is largely because it's one of the extreme examples that demonstrates how such small changes can make disproportionate impact. Also it seems to be a fan favorite whenever I see it mentioned.

For a case study I want to do a super rudimentary valuation. For disclosure, this is not a robust valuation or financial advice. I'm going to eliminate as many factors as possible and try to keep it just to what we talked about and help illustrate things. I'm not putting this here as DD or an opinion on this stock.

First things first, lets get some cash flows. For this we're not going to do anything fancy. When they were acquired by the \[insert s word thing that shall not be named\] they gave management forecasts and we're just going to take them at face value and extrapolate. Their projected first revenues will come in 2024 but it's nothing really material (14m FY24, 39m FY25, 260m FY26) until we get to FY27 (3.2bn). But remember, we don't care about revenues because as equity holders that's not what we receive. Looking at management's forecast, their Free Cash Flow doesn't turn positive until FY28 when it makes up \~8.5% of revenues. So lets use this and use some really wild assumptions. I'm going to say revenues go up by 75% each year after that and FCF margins stay the same at 10% (pretty insane growth assumptions given such a capital intensive manufacturing company).

&amp;#x200B;

||2028|2029|2030|2031|2032|2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenues ($m)|6500|11,375|19,906|34,836|60,963|106,685|
|Free Cash Flow ($m)|565|1,138|1,991|3,484|6,096|10,669|

Now we need to find our terminal value as if it is at the end of 2033 looking forward. Let's assume a relatively high steady state growth of 5% (3% real growth and 2% inflation). So our figure in year 5 is 106\*(1.05)/(.19-.05) = $133.3 billion

At first glance impressions are easy to be ""holy fuck, they're going to have $100 billion in revenue? they're generating cash flows of $150 billion?!? they're only at $15 billion market cap?? sign me the fuck up! buy buy buy!"". But let's take this all the way with step 2 of answering our ""What is this worth today?"" question.

So for this part we need to make a lot of assumptions. And this is important because equity analysts express their views often the most through not assumptions on how a company's cash flows look, but how to think about those cash flow value in present dollars.

Continuing our simplification, let's keep assuming no debt involvement here (mainly bc this post is fucking long) and let's jump back to using CAPM. Let's use the below values:

Rrfr: 1.0%

Beta: 2.0

ERP: 10%

Using these we can see this stock's cost of equity is \~21.0%. It seems high, but this is expected from something with such fantastic growth being priced in to have such a high beta. TSLA for example has a beta of 2.0 and realistically a stock growing at 75% yoy in an economy growing at 3% nominally would likely have a beta much higher than that.

So using our formula's above we can now now solve for our discount factors (the 1/(1+r)\^t numbers to multiply our cash flows by).

&amp;#x200B;

|PV CF ($m)|141|205|296|428|619|10,686|

The sum of all the PV CF should give us what we think this stock is worth today (since no debt, this would be same as market cap, ignoring any cash balances they currently have). So we get $12.4bn. Compared to a current $15 billion market cap that's another 20% drop WITH some pretty damn rosy assumptions (and low yields). Fuck.

But that's not all.

Now let's dial in new more realistic assumptions. Let's think of pre-covid life and what the norms back then were. 10 year interest rates were between 2-3% in 2018/2019 and inflation was tipping on the hot side of 2% going into end of year 2019, so a 10 year treasury at 2.5% seems a realistic norm and with a higher vol/growth stock like this we can be more realistically at a beta of 2.25. And finally let's keep our ERP and g (macro assumptions) the same.

Our cost of equity is now 25% which makes our discount table look like this:

|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|
|WACC|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|
|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.25)^(8)|= 1 / (1.25)^(9)|= 1 / (1.25)^(10)|= 1 / (1.25)^(11)|= 1 / (1.25)^(12)|= 1 / (1.25)^(13)|
|(DF)|0.17|0.13|0.11|0.09|0.07|0.05|
|PV CF ($m)|109|153|214|299|419|5,718|

With just a slight change in treasury yields and a slightly more realistic shift in beta, we're now talking about a market cap of $6.9bn or a 55% FURTHER DROP from current prices. Start shifting those 75%/yoy growth assumptions towards something that decelerates (a more complicated n-stage DCF that's too much to get into here) and you drop even further. A 10% deceleration yoy would bring this present value more in the $4 billion range.

I'm sorry for being so long winded here, but I felt it was important to explain. In a nutshell that folks, is the power of compounding and why small shifts in a seemingly benign rate can shift massive changes in values for these growth stocks that are primarily basing their value on cash flows happening 10-15 years from now.",finance
personalfinance,My bank account and email were hacked. Most of my money was stolen. Looking for advice.,"Not sure if this is the best sub for this, but here goes:

I logged into my online bank account last week to see that all but $200 had been transferred from my account to a bank in another state (which appears to be headquartered in Nepal?). I'm in a poverty situation already (partially disabled due to kidney disease) and this has really screwed me.

I could see that this person had somehow hacked into my email to verify linking this outside account with mine. Emails from my bank and the other bank were filtered to go straight to trash (though I could easily find them still in there.) According to the bank, they were able to verify this using my phone number as well, which I am assuming was spoofed somehow because I use a basic phone and received no verification code on it.

Today, I received a debit card from the other bank with my name on it. Obviously, I am not touching it. This worries me though, because they are using my name and address.

Here is what I have done:

- Contacted the police and filed a report
- Contacted my bank in person and opened an investigation with their fraud dept.
- Closed my account and moved everything to a new one which I am not accessing on my computer until I 100% know it is safe to do so. Using a different email for everything.
- Ran malware scans with several different programs (nothing found)
- Increased security on my firewall
- Scanned my network for unknown devices (none found)
- Changed all passwords

I use lengthy keyboard-mash passwords for everything and I use different ones for anything that involves sensitive info, so I don't know how they managed to pull this off. I don't click any suspicious emails or anything.

My question is this: is there anything else I can do aside from waiting for the investigation to go through? And are there any other precautions I can take to ensure this doesn't happen again?",finance

personalfinance,Best strategy for existing large equity position in publicly-traded employer?,"My employer went through a liquidity event in the last few months and that means my equity in the company is now worth about $1 million. This represents about 60% my wife's and my wealth.

At the moment about 30% of it is in common stock acquired less than 1 year ago by exercising incentive stock options and the rest is in unexercised, vested ISOs. My cost basis/strike price is so low it's almost entirely capital gains.

This is too much money to have in one position. My question is how to exit?

If I just exit it all at once I'm going to have a huge tax bill. In particular, a quick exit means exercising my stock options all at once and will trigger a lot of AMT. I'd owe a lot more than I ""should"" given my normal annual compensation. Even though AMT can be taken as a credit against future taxes, it will take me years to recoup against my normal taxes and this represents a huge interest-free loan to the federal government, resulting in a huge loss in the time value of the money.

My instinct is to sell the common stock immediately as soon as it's eligible for long-term capital gains tax and to exercise the options slowly over several years. But this obviously means extending the period over which I'm exposed to this undiversified position.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my car loan?,"In September 2017 I purchased a 2016 Chevy Cruze for $13796. The loan was furnished by BBVA through the dealer. At the time, my credit score wasn’t good, and the best I could do was 6 years at 10.67%. I think my score was teetering at 605. 

 I currently owe $7955 on the car and have a little over 2.5 years left. 

As my credit score has much improved since I bought the car - it’s now in the low 740s - I’m receiving offers from other banks such as Capital One who have sent out offers to refinance at 5.5%, then 4.9%, then 4%. Sounds good... however I feel the following issues may be a problem. 

The BBVA loan started Sept 2017. I missed a payment Jan 2018, Feb 2018, March 2018, but since then I have been current and on time. 

I currently have 3 hard inquires: 1 for a lease application and 2 for a line of credit. The next one to drop off will be Jan 2022.  I feel another one will do more damage to my score. 

The last line of credit I took out was from Care Credit for some dental work.

My question is, is it worth refinancing? And if it is, under what terms? Am I looking for a better interest rate loan over a fixed period to end around the time my current loan would? Or will it more than likely mean my loan term will be longer than it is now? 

Also, is there anything I should do at my current bank? If I call them and tell them I have these offers from other banks, will they want to keep me by offering me incentives? 

Any help will be appreciated!",finance
cardano,Native token concern?,"I’ve reading through the IOHK blog posts and came across this one:

https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/12/08/native-tokens-on-cardano/

About half was through the article it states that “native tokens can be created and destroyed, unlike ADA”. Does this mean that people can increase/decrease the supply of the tokens they mint after they are minted onto the blockchain, regardless of what the initial monetary policy says? Or, does this mean that once someone mints a native token onto the blockchain, they can destroy it at a later date? 

Also, who would be the one to decide what changes to Native Token will take place?

Last saturday we noticed he was peeing blood on the floor,  naturally i took him to the emergency vet immidiately because i was worried about him. after returning from the vet he is put on amoxicillin antibiotics and gabapentin for painkiller, but he is still peeing everywhere around the house, he never had this kind of issue because when we brought him home he naturally used the litter box. we had to close him inside the guest bathroom where the litter box is and let him out for 5-10 min sessions. but when he is outside he'd still pee everywhere he goes, it's been about a week now, we definitely noticed the blood in his pee is significantly lower then before, but he is still peeing everywhere everytime he gets to come out. i know stress could be one of the cause of UTI and i know locking him in that bathroom is not helping with the stress, but i just can't think of a way that i can help him. i gave him medicine whenever it's due and i tried putting diaper on him but he would just kick it off in a couple minutes and he would find him peeing around the house again, i also got one of those diffuser that suppose to help calm the cats and nothing worked. what should i do?

personalfinance,Are my parents making a terrible mistake extending their mortgage to leverage investments when they are in their 60s?,"Parents are in their 60s, with original mortgage due to be payed off in 7 years. They would be 68 at the time of paying off the original mortgage. I think their interest rate is somewhere around 2.8%? not sure

They had a Thrivant Financial advisor recommend doing a 15 or 30 year extended mortgage to further reduce interest rate. 

They decided to extend their mortgage to now be another 15 years. so instead of paying off in 7, it would be in 15, so they would be 76 years old?

The father assumes he will work until 70, and the mother assumes they will work part time with social security until 70. They want to use the extra money via extending mortage to do investments. They currently have little money extra income to play with besides their ""emergency fund"" only taking vacations every 5 years or so. 

In my opinion, this is a terrible move, adding huge risk for little reward. I see that the market will downturn sometime in the coming decade, possibly during their attempt to retire. I also worry they will have health problems or not be able to work, the father is very forgetful. I also don't see the point in leveraging debt for investing at such a late stage in life where there is so much uncertainty. They already have a sizable retirement savings which they could subsist on and still have a little fun. Selling the house to live into a smaller place would allow even more retirement money to play with.

They have around 30k in cash they just sit on, and have no plans to do anything with it besides as an emergency fund. (I see no point of having such a size emergency fund when they have insurance for everything. I feel it would be more useful to use some of that to either invest NOW or to pay off some mortgage NOW to save on interest payments. now kinda pointless with new 15 year extended mortgage) 

Am I crazy or is it very stupid to take such risks via leveraging debt this way when you are at a late stage in life? I could agree with it if they were younger.. but when they are beginning to have health problems from old age ect...?",finance

With a global workforce casting downward wage pressure, and no wage agreements tied to dynamic inflation increases, I don’t see how wage inflation is even possible 

Yes housing prices and cost of food but that has already been going on for over a decade.

stocks,What is your opinion about the supply flood of new stocks?,"There is currently an exponentially growing number of new SPACs and IPOs rushing to the stock market. Especially in popular hot stock sectors such as technology or cannabis.

Every venture capitalist is starting to offload as many stocks as possible to the public market. Celebrities start SPACs. Companys losing money since 20 years launch their IPOs.

Thanks to TINA, easy FED policies and BTFD the IPO window is currently open as wide as it can be.

The problem IMHO: this becomes a self re-inforcing tsumani of new equities: the higher the market goes the faster it accelerates, like a nuclear chain reaction.

If you can create a company for USD 1B and sell it to the market for USD 5B this is a great business. Then you take e.g. USD 2B off the table and create two new companies for USD 1B each, rinse and repeat.

Reminds me of the dotcom, housing, energy and some smaller bubbles: companies are created just to sell shares to the public market, not because there is a real demand for their products.

stocks,"Cathie Wood: ""i dont think the market has ever priced in the low interest rates of 0.5% of the treasury bonds.."" what does she mean??",[removed],finance
stocks,“We are not in a bubble” – Cathie Wood,"The following is my summary of Cathie Wood’s thoughts on recent market volatility, as presented in her latest video on the Ark Invest YouTube channel (\~42 min) – I strongly recommend you check it out.

The minimum expected rate of return for a stock to enter an ark portfolio is 15% CAGR. Cathie contends that she sees the recent volatility as a gift to gain alpha over the intended 15% return in many of her high conviction names.

She mentions that at Ark, they have a five year time horizon, and it is counter productive to compare its performance with a benchmark (like the s&amp;p) over a shorter period. She further adds that many stocks in traditional indices today are a potential value trap, and that ark etfs “are a good hedge against broad based benchmarks.”

She reiterates that “we are not in a bubble” – and that the seeds of their 5 innovation platforms were planted in the dot com bubble, and are now ready for prime time, in a period of reality. Fear of a bubble likely stems from benchmark sensitivity and backward looking institutional investors. Furthermore, intuitions should be worried about their own strategies as “creative disruption will impact nearly 50% of the s&amp;p500”.

To Cathie, interest rates going up suggest that ‘real growth is going to pick up’ – and that she understands the concern over her own stock picks potentially underperforming as a result. However, she believes that that the market has assumed that interest rates will stabilize at a 4 to 5% range - which inversed (1/4 or 1/5) gives a normalized p/e of 20 or 25; so markets didn’t actually misprice assets to begin with. She thinks that nominal growth however, will not be at 4 to 5%, but instead around 2-3%, which can lead to greater valuation support for companies that can grow more rapidly.

Rotation from growth to value was also expected on her part. She repeats that value will face massive headwinds going forward. Energy and financial stocks have done amazing in the past month - which is a good thing as the bull market is broadening out unlike the dot com bubble, where ‘too much capital chased too few opportunities, too soon’. Energy and financial sectors booming will likely be short lived as they are both ripe for massive disruption.",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 8th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 8th, 2021.

# **Stocks face the crosscurrents of higher interest rates and fiscal stimulus in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/stocks-face-the-crosscurrents-of-higher-interest-rates-and-fiscal-stimulus-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The Covid-19 aid package is on track for final congressional approval in the week ahead — and it could be a double-edged sword for markets.
*****
&gt; The legislation should be greeted by optimism around the powerful lift it could give the stock market and the economy, but it could also be met with concern about what a historically large stimulus package could do to inflation and interest rates.
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 higher, but the Nasdaq was dragged lower by interest rate-sensitive tech names. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has continued to press higher, revisiting its recent high of 1.61% on Friday, before trading at 1.54% in late trading. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; One wild card for stocks could be how interest rates behave around upcoming Treasury auctions.
*****
&gt; There is a $38 billion 10-year auction on Wednesday and a $24 billion 30-year bond auction on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Traders are watching these closely, after a historically weak 7-year Treasury note auction in February sent rates higher, even for the 10-year.
*****
&gt; “We’re a little more cautious on them, just given what we saw in the 7-year and some Japanese selling pressure,” said Ben Jeffery, strategist on the U.S. rates strategy team at BMO Capital Markets.
*****
&gt; He said Japanese institutions could be less interested in participating before the end of their fiscal year on March 31.
*****
&gt; # Stimulus coming
The Senate was expected to approve its version of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package and send it to the House for a vote during the week. Otherwise, the market is watching key inflation reports with the consumer price index expected Wednesday and the producer price index, scheduled for Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think the markets will be watching closely the progress on the stimulus package,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “I think they’ll continue to watch the 10-year Treasury move and we’re going to get CPI data. That’s going to inform on those moves.”
*****
&gt; He expects stimulus to remain a factor that could sway markets.
*****
&gt; Inflation has been a worry for markets, since rising inflation could crush margins and corrode earnings power. For bond investors, it would erode value and make interest payments worth less.
*****
&gt; “As long as the rise in Treasury yields matches the pick-up in inflation, I think the market will be able to handle that. I think the challenge is when yields get notably above inflation...I like to see them closely matched,” said Arone.
*****
&gt; He said the market is concerned that the next stimulus package could overheat the economy and create inflation, particularly as it comes on the heels of the package approved in December.
*****
&gt; “I think it lends to the conversation, ‘do you really need another $1.9 trillion?’ Arone said. “We’re going to pour more gas on the fire, and with this $1.9 trillion that’s what the market is concerned about.”
*****
&gt; Consumer inflation is expected to remain somewhat muted for February, after the 1.4% rise year-over-year in core CPI in January. But the pace of inflation is likely to pick up notably in March and April, since the comparisons to last year, when the economy was shut down, will likely look extreme.
*****
&gt; # Choppy to continue
&gt; Strategists expect the push-pull between interest rates and stocks to continue.
*****
&gt; On Friday, rates were higher after a strong February jobs report and stocks were also higher. The economy added 379,000 jobs in February, about 160,000 more than expected.
*****
&gt; “I don’t think 1.5%, 1.6% on the 10-year is terribly troublesome for the market,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. She said the speed of the move was troubling.
*****
&gt; The rotation out of tech and growth into more cyclical names in the financial, energy and industrial sectors continued in the past week.
*****
&gt; Energy was up more than 10% with oil prices, which were at a near two-year high. Financials saw the next strongest move, gaining 4.3% for the week.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re in a choppy consolidation phase,” said Sonders.
*****
&gt; “You’re seeing some extreme historical spreads between what energy and financials are doing recently versus tech and consumer discretionary,” she said.
*****
&gt; Sonders added that even if the consolidation phase is close to ending, that suggests there could be more downside for some frothy names. “The good news here is I think it’s becoming a better environment for active stock pickers,” she said.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite was down more than 10%, as of Thursday from its Feb. 12 high. But on Friday, the index turned around, gaining about 1.6%. That’s a positive sign for the market, particularly since it happened as rates moved higher.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.8% for the week, and the Dow was up 1.8%. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, was down 2%.
*****
&gt; “I think ultimately the higher quality segments that got hit in tech and communications probably did need to see a valuation reweighting,” Sonders said. “Arguably, we had some micro bubbles in the market, and they may need to suffer more downside.”
*****
&gt; She said investors may want to adjust the allocation of their holdings regularly instead of waiting to adjustments around the calendar
*****
&gt; “If you get a two three week, four five day surge in a particular sector, pare some back,” Sonders said, nothing that’s the opposite of what most people do.

&gt; # Jobs Market Gets Reopening Boost

&gt; US payrolls grew at a solid clip month over month in February, as progress in the vaccine distribution process appeared to boost growth by enabling more of the economy to reopen. Our opinion has always been that until we have achieved widespread vaccine distribution, the in-person segments of the labor market will be slow to recover losses from a year ago. We are becoming increasingly bullish on the prospect for a 2021 economic reacceleration, and we are heartened that the hardest hit segments of the jobs market may be beginning to reflect that view.

&gt; The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added 379,000 jobs in February, exceeding Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ forecasts for a 200,000 gain. Large seasonal adjustments to the data did serve to boost the overall number by roughly 140,000, while January’s jobs gain was revised significantly higher from 49,000 to 166,000. Colder weather than normal may have also played some role, though the worst of the freeze experienced by middle America occurred just after the report’s observation window closed. The unemployment rate fell to 6.2% from 6.3%, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate of 61.4%.

&gt; “Last month on jobs day, we noted our optimism around an improving trajectory for vaccinations and the implications that may have for future jobs reports,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “This has played out so far, and we expect continued vaccination progress to become more evident in the jobs numbers as the recovery reaccelerates.”

&gt; Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% month over month and 5.3% year over year, continuing to signal that lower-wage workers have endured the worst of the pandemic’s job losses. Inflation expectations have been in particular focus for the market lately, however inflation risks from a tightening labor market are not of major concern for now in our opinion. We expect overall average hourly earnings to remain steady or even reverse as lower wage workers are rehired in service sector jobs, and we still have lots of slack in the labor market as we hover well below 2020’s peak employment.

&gt; The composition of February’s report importantly signals a reversal of COVID-19-driven trends seen in recent months. Retail trade gained 41,100 jobs while the leisure and hospitably industry gained 355,000—two segments that have been hardest hit throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, professional and business services added 63,000 jobs and government jobs fell by 86,000.

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the jobs recovery in the leisure and hospitality sector has generally plateaued following an initial bounce. This segment of the labor market is highly dependent on in-person interaction, and has understandably suffered in a work-from-home environment. Unsurprisingly, service sector jobs have strongly correlated with broader trends in COVID-19 cases. The leisure and hospitality sector alone still accounts for about 3.5 million of the 9.5 million jobs lost compared to the February 2020 peak. And while we do caution against reading too far into one month’s numbers, we are excited to see this decimated sector tick notably higher in February.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We have not had to look hard to find evidence that vaccines are having an impact. Nationally, seven-day averages for new cases have fallen to below early 2020 peaks, significantly below the highs of late 2020. Perhaps most crucially, the portion of the population most vulnerable to severe symptoms has largely already received at least one dose of the vaccination. A third vaccine was granted emergency use authorization in March, and this week President Biden estimated we would have enough supply of vaccinations to cover every adult by the end of May 2021. Once people can become comfortable with the virus trends, we expect widespread hiring in in-person industries to snowball quickly. February may have signaled a start to this trend.

&gt; # Anatomy of a Bond Market Sell-off

&gt; Coming into 2021, one of our higher-conviction ideas was that we would see rising long-term interest rates in the United States; it’s one of the reasons we recommended suitable investors consider an underweight to interest rate sensitive fixed income. However, we didn’t expect interest rates to move this high, this fast. The 10-Year Treasury yield started the year at 0.91% and ended the month of February at 1.41%, down from an intraday high of 1.61%. As such, core fixed income assets are off to one of their worst starts ever (remember that as yields go up, prices go down).

&gt; “Core fixed income assets aren’t off to a very good start this year, but we don’t think investors should abandon high-quality fixed income assets as they play an important role in a diversified portfolio” says LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; **So what is driving interest rates higher? Changing expectations**

&gt; Inflation and growth expectations are important factors into the fundamental outlook for interest rates. Broadly speaking, what we’ve seen in the bond market this year is a re-pricing of both higher inflation and higher growth expectations. Inflation expectations have steadily moved higher, and market-based gauges of inflation expectations are the highest they’ve been since 2011. We don’t expect much higher inflation expectations from here, but we are watching how additional fiscal stimulus flows into the economy. Additionally, it seems increasing economic growth expectations have picked up recently as well. An increase in growth expectations may put pressure on the Federal Reserve (Fed) to move away from its low interest rate policy sooner than expected, which has put upward pressure on longer-dated Treasury yields.

&gt; An unfortunate byproduct of those higher expectations is that we’ve seen an increase in the volatility of the 10-Year Treasury. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, daily percentage changes for the 10-Year Treasury yield are above historical norms (each vertical line on the chart represents the one day percentage change in the 10-Year Treasury yield). As shown, over the past several months, yields have regularly moved 10-20% in either direction on any given day. We think this is due to the changing interest rate dynamic and believe that interest rate volatility will subside the further we get into this new interest rate regime.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Seasonal Pattern Suggests Weakness Likely Ending Soon

&gt; In the above chart we have plotted five different S&amp;P 500 seasonal patterns along side 2021 through today’s close. “All Years 1949-2020” and “All Years 1988-2020” represent longer-term and mid-term baseline patterns. “All Post-Election Years” includes every year that was a post-presidential-election year regardless of outcome. “1St Year Democratic President” applies to this post-election year and so does “Post-Election Year After Incumbent Party Loss.”

&gt; When comparing 2021 to these various past seasonal patterns, this year’s performance is above average, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently experiencing some of the weakness present in the other five patterns. Historical weakness (shaded in light blue) is most visible in the three post-election year patterns in February lasting until early to mid-March depending on the post-election year pattern. All three historical post-election year patterns suggest that current weakness could be ending soon.

&gt; # Historic Surge for the Energy Sector

&gt; The energy sector has certainly been on a wild ride over the course of the past year, perhaps the wildest of all of the S&amp;P 500 sectors. The outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 caused such a demand shock that oil futures traded for a negative value for the first time in history, implying that someone would pay you to take delivery of their oil!

&gt; Well, that’s in the rear-view mirror for the energy market now. Year to date, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector is up over 29% as of March 2, according to data from FactSet, more than double the return of the financial sector, the second strongest sector thus far in 2021. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 energy sector is trading at a blistering 30% above its 200-day moving average, the most ever using data back to 1990. While this might seem bearish on the surface, previous surges above 20% have historically bought above average returns over the next year rather than below average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The case can be made that energy could be a bit stretched in the near-term, but momentum often breeds more momentum,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Energy has been unloved for quite some time, but we may be in the early innings of a larger rally for the energy sector as the global economy continues to improve.”

&gt; A confluence of events may be spurring the boom in the energy sector. An expanding global economy, a historic winter storm that shut down major oil producing states like Texas and Oklahoma, and an output agreement from members of OPEC+ have sent oil prices soaring to their highest level since early 2019. It’s not just oil, either. Copper and lumber have surged past their 2019 highs as well. It’s no secret that inflation expectations have been on the rise, and the surge in commodity prices are likely adding further credence to the market’s view of higher inflation.

&gt; We have continued to warm up to the energy sector, including upgrading our view on oil in January and then our upgrade from negative to neutral in our February Global Portfolio Strategy publication.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week and month ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Final check for detailed budget: Move from NY to TX.,"Hey guys, thanks for being so helpful. Don’t really have anyone to run this by and help out besides my wife and we need another set of eyes. 

We are having a lot of internal conflict. At first we 100% thought this was the right move for OUR family and finances and future goals. Having a lot of push back from (in laws) making me really double check to make sure I’m right. 

Previous post:  

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lwesbu/contemplating_a_move_from_ny_to_texas_with_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Currently 2 income household in NY making 185k combined, saving my wife’s entire salary of 3700/ month. Moving to TX to become more family oriented, have my wife stay home, and I get to keep my remote job and salary in NY. 

Current salary: 106,575 (made 125k in 2020, and 108k this year due to overtime).

I understand I’ll be paying NY tax, so my take home would stay the same it is now. 

Take home after health insurance, some life insurance, long term disability, and 6% to 401k (they match 7.5%) is: 2845.43 

5,690.86 a month take home. 

Expected budget:

Current expenses I don’t expect to change (for the sake of shooting high to minimize error)

Cell: 43.92

Car insurance: 178.04 (going down to one car)

Pet insurance: 37.93

Dog budget (food and monthly meds): 205

Student Loans: 368.82 @ 4.9%

Student loans: 119 (federal)

Life insurance: 98.44 (million dollar 20 year term policies). 

Electric: 233

Gas: 120

Cable: 90

Water: 100 

Gym: 160 (Brazilian jiu jitsu, could put on hold for a while)

Netflix: 13.99

Groceries: 700

Bank maintenance: 24

Baby stuff: 83

Jeweler insurance: 55.22

Total expenses: 2,729.31 without mortgage. 

After sale of our home and savings we will have 145,000. 

Mortgage will be between 1700-2000. Let’s say 2000 on the high side with taxes and insurance. 

We expect 15k in moving expenses.

We will have an emergency fund left over of 35-60k depending on how much we put down on home. 

Monthly expenses: 4,729.31

After all monthly expenses: 

961.37

I am estimating low, that a cost of living difference would be around 250 dollars a month. Moving from 2 cars to 1, insurance from NY to TX, some utilities and food is cheaper according to the online calculator. 

Now left: 1,211.37

We will put 250 a month into 529.

961.37 left.

500 to a savings account or Max out Roth IRA.

Left with 461.37 a month, on 1 income, saving for retirement, college, saving, and an emergency fund of 35-60k. 

We are 29 years old with a 1.5year old. Live in NY in a 1300sq foot house saving around 3700-4000 a month here but can’t have another baby due to house size and child care issues. Trying to find our happy, and having a tough time. 

We have 2 paid off cars. I would sell my 2006 Camry and we would keep the 2019 vw tiguan that is paid off, so a new car would not be needed for at least 7-10 years, hopefully. This is probably the toughest decision we’ve ever had to make and quite frankly, it’s very scary. I want to do right for the family and our finances and future. 

Stay in NY with the hustle and bustle, both work, make great money, have a hard time ever upgrading in house (current 1300sq ft house is worth 525k). To stay around family, who we don’t see that often anyway. 

Or move, get the bigger house, able to have another baby, wife stays home, family life is better, change of weather and life, but save less. Most of our savings in Ny would be geared for a new house eventually. 

Moving would decrease our overall debt about 100-120k. 

My wife is a teacher and is expected to make another 30k within the next 10 years so our income here would go up a lot more too. Could be missing out on a lot of money, but is money everything ?

Please let me know what you think.",finance
stocks,Question for people invested in ARK funds. Specifically ARKK.,"As everyone knows, tech/growth/speculative stocks are currently seeing correction from the insane run up we've had this past year. What slightly bothers me about this run up is the past performance of the ARK fund prior to this run up. The growth was so slow and steady, absolutely nothing like the returns we'd seen in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question to you guys.. how much of this growth do you think came in the form of actual growth from the companies themselves rather than cheap interest rates/deep discounted cashflows/cheap borrowing? 

&amp;#x200B;

Between 2015 - 2020, ARKK grew around 100%. Between 2020-2021, its grown 300%, so to me that doesn't feel very sustainable and in some ways i'm trying to use this as a proxy to 'predict the bottom' (I know I know, nobody can predict the bottom), but surely based on this fact alone it allows us to at least guess a bit more accurately?",finance
stocks,Market Theory for back half of the year,"Hey folks, for those that didn’t read the first post a couple of days ago 

[first theory ](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lwyzf7/theory_for_market_outlook_in_back_half_of_2021/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

I had another prediction in r/stocks a little over a week ago that a market correction was still to continue.

I’m hardly the only person that had identified these possibilities, but I do want to continue updating yall with my plan going forward.

Prediction through year end:
The selling from this correction is likely over now. May get a couple of dry heaves next week but the heavy selling (-3+% in a given day is likely done). I am waiting to see at least two days of stability in the next week or two. For example, a Green Day like Friday is not stable. Yes it was up which is good, but far from showing footing.

I believe that as the market digests this quick uptick in yields we will settle in and stocks will grind higher towards retesting highs in some names. Many of the momentum names that had eye popping speculative valuations likely won’t be back to highs this year as folks are spooked.

Highs on solid names will be retested by mid May / early June timing as optimism around economy heating up (double edged sword here) and vaccine rollout continues to build. As things reopen I believe the economy is going to run way too hot and inflation will pick up more than expected. I don’t think the fed will have to do anything drastic but the realization that the economy is overheating will cause additional pressure on certain equity valuations yet again. To me, if we retest highs in May I think there is substantially more risk to the downside (10-15% correction again) than to the upside (4-5%)

Once we get within 1-2% of highs in May I will be building back to roughly 1/3-1/5 cash in my trading portfolio. 

Hope all of you have some dry powder around and are able to pick up some really solid companies that went on sale in the last week or two! 

Happy hunting.",finance

stocks,Why the hell are people so afraid of a little inflation?,"Yes inflation will probably go up, it was 0.62% last year even with the feds injecting a shit ton of money into the economy to stave off deflation. But it's probably going to return to the normal 2 percent target rate, meanwhile people are acting like we are going to become super-venezuela.

I have a mortgage and I have invested a lot of money to make sure the mortgage payment is low and I have a built a decent amount of home equity. I want to make sure that if I die or something happens to me, the house/mortgage stays with my GF and son. I could refinance my loan and add my GF to the loan but this seems to be expensive as I will have to pay for a new mortgage application, fees, etc. and could increase the Interest Rate since my GF doesn't have a good credit score.

I've been posting my family's net worth updates annually on this subreddit for many years (see [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/308xtv/on_track_to_re_by_50/), [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4a6oww/one_year_update/), [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5ynkqi/two_year_update/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/838e92/three_year_update/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b44qvp/four_year_update/), and [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/fevzeg/five_year_update/) updates); I find sharing my plans and progress to be helpful for giving myself a heading check, and hope this community finds my inputs to be helpful.  Last year, my post happened right as the the apocalypse was kicking off, and our portfolio was suffering heavy losses.  Let's see how that turned out over the past year.

**Current ages: 35 and 34**. We have two kids who are now entering public school age.  We still have to pay for after school care, but in general our childcare costs have been trending down over the past couple of years.

**Combined pre-tax income**: About $206k (\~5.1% increase).  About a month after my last post, my wife took a 10% pay *cut* because of COVID.  It wasn't a huge deal because of our large savings rate (also not like there was much to spend money on during early lockdown anyways). We still made some budget cuts, and then her pay was restored about 6 months later, and we got raises on top of that - all of which is to say, our cash flow has increased dramatically lately.

**Assets:**

Cash/emergency fund: \~$80k (81.8% increase).  Big increase in cash over the past year, for a few reasons.  We did a cash out refi about a year ago to do a bunch of home repairs (furnace repair, backup generator, replacement windows, new water heaters, removing dead trees).  Because lockdown reduced our spending, we were able to accomplish all that and still grow cash, which made us more comfortable considering there seemed to be an actual apocalypse going on.  The next home upgrade we want to do is a new roof+solar project within the next year, which will bring our cash back down to normal.

Tax advantaged Retirement/HSA accounts: \~$721k (49% increase). So uh, that happened.  We're now maxing out both her 401k and my TSP, both Roth IRAs, and an HSA.  Nobody could have predicted that the pandemic stock market lows would have happened as early as they did, or that the stock recovery would have happened so fast.  I certainly didn't predict that - but I did continue to buy and hold index funds, as always, and was rewarded for it.

529 accounts: \~$46k (27.8% increase). We live in Florida, which has one of the few pre-paid tuition plans that actually make a lot of sense.  So we've been moving over 529 money into the prepaid plans.  Once those are fully paid off in a couple years, we'll go back to putting money into the 529s again (to pay for housing expenses, or if they want to go private or out of state or grad school).  Our goal has long been to cover about \~75% of the total in state public college expenses, but now it looks like we might get closer to 100% just because of good fortune.

Taxable investments: \~$20.5k (128% increase). This increased pretty dramatically because of efforts on two fronts.  First, since we've now maxed out tax shelters, I've set up a new payroll deduction to send money directly to the taxable brokerage, and will move most future raises towards that.  Second, since travel has been off the table for the past year, I've been running an Amex Gold + Platinum Schwab [churning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/) setup for most of our spending over the past year, which has made us several thousand dollars going straight to a taxable brokerage account.

Vehicles: $31k KBB value of three cars (2% decrease). Same cars as last year, just depreciation. And not much of it this year, which weirds me out.  Maybe because they barely got any miles?  Maybe the used car market is being weird right now?  I dunno, I'm just reporting the numbers.

Home: Using Federal Reserve MSA home index, our home value is now \~$603k (4.5% increase), using Zillow estimate is currently $691k (5.8% increase).  We use a range to estimate our home's value.  It's kinda crazy to look back and realize the home appreciation over time; we got \*very\* lucky with being able to buy our house in 2012.

**Debts:**

Mortgage: $359k at 2.875% for 30 years (32% increase). We refinanced our mortgage, and used it to pay off our home equity loan, car loan, and to start building up cash.  The interest rate is so low here that we don't see much point to even trying to pay it off early, and will be focused on building up assets instead.

Home Equity Loan: $0 at 4.75% (100% decrease). Gone!

Car Loan: $0 at 3.1% (100% decrease). Gone!

**Net Worth Estimate:** $1.14M using MSA Home Index (\~34.8% increase), $1.23M using Zillow (\~33.4% increase). There it is.  We became millionaires right in the middle of the ""worst year ever.""  Without using crypto or Tesla or meme stonks.  Just boring old index funds,  mostly held in tax advantaged retirement accounts.

**Current plans going forward:** We hit a lot of goals over the past year.  It feels like we're approaching the end of the ""boring middle"", and are now racing to quickly build up significant assets and achieve financial independence.  Our goal is to be able to FIRE if we want to by \~2030 with \~$100k income.",finance

I figured someone on here would have more knowledge since I couldn’t really find any info online and the automated phone service/get my refund status keeps telling me there’s an error or they can’t find my acct .
    As I said before I got a partial refund of 600 dollars deposited in my bank account with this IRS TREAS 310 REF PPD. That came about a week after I E-filed . I do know sometimes it comes in two payments with the federal/ state separately coming but I checked my fiancé’s acct and he got his amount deposited but only has IRS TREAS 310 . Does this mean I got only a partial payment ? All I can think off is that I owe is an SSI overpayment from 4 years ago. Any help would be great",finance

stocks,DD - Village Farms International (VFF) - A Sleeping Giant in a Burgeoning Industry,"This is not financial advice. I am just a stoned ape who likes to bang my head on the keyboard and see what comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

This DD is about VFF – Village Farms International, a company in the Cannabis industry based in Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

Credit where credit is due (u/mfairview), I was originally introduced to this company by a DD on r/WallStreetBets (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld6zoc/village\_farms\_international\_vff/). I know I know – WSB is a casino! However, you can certainly find diamonds in there outside of those associated with hands. This isn’t a moon shot, this is a long term play, and thanks u/mfairview for the introduction.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, before we get started, a little about this stoned ape to give my background and better portray the perspective I am approaching this from: I have years of broad experience across various Operational/Supply Chain functions (Warehousing, Procurement, Demand and Supply Planning, Transportation/Distribution, Last Mile Delivery \[direct-to-consumer\], Logistics, Manufacturing, etc.) in multiple industries, mainly CPG. With that background and an education in Supply Chain Management, I consider myself a decent evaluator of the basics of a company – operational capabilities and basic financials. That is the main view from which I will be approaching this DD.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to more technical investing considerations and context regarding the overall stock market, I am lacking in the same depth of knowledge. I have been lightly investing for years, and only heavily got into it last March/April. Since then I have had some wins and learned some hard lessons, but am not knowledgeable enough to speak to these types of considerations. Hopefully someone else may be able to provide a follow-up to this initial analysis that goes further into this area.

&amp;#x200B;

I look forward to feedback and learning from the comments, I would greatly appreciate constructive criticism and to see other perspectives.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, you came here for the DD. Here it is.

&amp;#x200B;

\*All $ amounts are in USD, unless shown as C$, in which case it represents Canadian dollars.\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Company overview:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Village Farms International

* Year of Origin: 1987
* Country of Origin: Canada
* Industry: Cannabis / Produce

&amp;#x200B;

Village Farms International has been operating for 34 years, during which time they have become a roughly $200M revenue per year company (last 5 years) that has become a leader in North American greenhouse cultivation footprint (access to 23.7M square ft. of grow space) and expertise. This started with a focus on produce products (namely tomatoes), and led to a core competency built around large scale greenhouse management. Over the last few years beginning in 2018, Village Farms has seized the initiative to take advantage of their vast knowledge in greenhouse operations and enter the budding cannabis industry.

&amp;#x200B;

They initially entered the industry in a joint venture with Emerald Health Therapeutics called Pure Sunfarms. They have since bought the ownership stake from Emerald (in the last 2 months) and now have full ownership and control over Pure Sunfarms, with Pure Sunfarms CEO Mandesh Dosanjh reporting to Village Farms CEO Michael DeGiglio.

&amp;#x200B;

Cannabis operations timeline:

* May 2018: Began commercial production
* Sept 2018: Began Wholesale sales
* Sept 2019: Began Retail sales in Ontario
* Oct 2019: Began Retail sales in British Columbia
* Feb 2020: Began Retail sales in Alberta
* July 2020: Began Retail sales in Manitoba and Saskatchewan

&amp;#x200B;

By 2019, the company’s annual revenue of $206.9M had was made up of $62.3M from Pure Sunfarms cannabis sales. Cannabis has already become 30% of their business and that will only continue to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Unique competitive advantages:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Steady, experienced, and consistent leadership

* Their founder and CEO Michael DeGiglio has been leading the company since its inception in 1987, and their CFO Stephen Ruffini has been with them since 2009
* This executive team has been together for a long time and they intimately know their company, talent, and resources
* I consider this a temporary competitive advantage as many cannabis companies are currently developing and growing with new executives and employees from various backgrounds and experiences who may not have worked together before. This is not necessarily a slight and some companies will thrive from that environment, but generally it will take time for those organizations to develop the same level of operational synergies, expertise, and mission-focused cultures that Village Farms has had decades to cultivate

&amp;#x200B;

2. Decades of greenhouse grow experience

* Wealth of data / experience in collecting/tracking and applying plant yield data, which is a critical aspect of improving supply availability and quality for Cannabis companies (and any agricultural business)
* Head start on clean energy initiatives – most competitors are just trying to get plants in the ground and get revenue streams growing, their ability to fully embrace more advanced initiatives such as clean energy are likely years away
* This is not only socially and environmentally responsible, but can save on costs, and improve public opinion while opening doors to new partnerships with commercial customers who have stringent vendor requirements around energy consumption
* Already NA leader in grow space available with preexisting infrastructure, significant head start vs. competitors

&amp;#x200B;

3. Somewhat more protected from regulation/industry specific fears than their peers

* Revenue stream from original produce lines provides a safety floor of revenue
* While this provides a floor, when we look at their potential revenue growth soon, it will show that this floor is only really a good safety net now, and their growth will soon make revenue driven by legacy produce products a very small portion of their business
* Decades of experiencing navigating international trade, regulatory laws around food for multiple countries, etc. This experience will benefit them greatly compared to their peers in the cannabis industry who are brand new to this part of the game

&amp;#x200B;

4. Existing Retail relationships

* While they are building their own stores as well, their history suggests they will mainly position themselves to sell goods wholesale to other Retailers
* Existing partnerships with Walmart, Kroger, Publix, Costco, Albertsons, and more
* I’m not necessarily suggesting to expect Cannabis to be sold in those specific chains when Cannabis becomes legal in the US, but in years to come as federal legalization occurs in the US and the industry evolves to where you can buy Cannabis outside of specialized dispensaries, it may become more like alcohol (with varying laws by state, existence of dispensaries, product in Retail chains, and brewery-type experiences available as well)
* That existing experience and capability in developing, establishing, and maintaining relationships with major partners like those listed will benefit them even if the chains they have preexisting relationships with aren’t the major players in this category

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential obstacles/pitfalls:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. Transitioning identity of the company

* It can be a major, disruptive challenge to revolutionize the operational strategy and revenue drivers of a business
* Legacy employees may not be cut out as well for the new environment, or there can be frontline cultural resistance from employees in the field against the suits in the offices who are making these decisions
* You run the risk of alienating your legacy customers
* This can be worse if your main customers are not consumers but instead other companies, as is the case with Village Farms
* In that scenario, it is more likely that a small portion of your customers make up a significant portion of your revenue (the Pareto Principle), and disruption to some key customers would be a massive impact to revenue
* The best CEOs would position this as something along the lines of: “We have always had the objective of utilizing state of the art agriculture operations to deliver value to people’s lives through fresh and healthy organic products, and whether that is tomatoes, cucumbers, or cannabis, that is what we will continue to do.”

&amp;#x200B;

2. Competition in the industry

* 507+ federal license holders for Cannabis operations in Canada alone
* US MSOs (Multi State Operators) are not going to roll over and give up market share without a fight
* Behind on overall public awareness to companies like Trulieve, Tilray, and others

&amp;#x200B;

3. Overextending expansion efforts and compromising position in legacy markets

&amp;#x200B;

4. Not enough senior leadership with significant Cannabis experience/expertise

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My rebuttals to the listed pitfalls, in respective order:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. We are three years into the transition of this company, and if this obstacle was going to be a show stopper, I believe it would already have had its negative impact

* The recent play to purchase out Emerald and get a 100% stake in Pure Sunfarms was the last domino to fall on this concern for me as I researched the company. Their industry leading cost positions, aggressive expansion plans, and rapid rise in cannabis related revenue has displayed that they have not only pivoted their product portfolio successfully, but done so without disrupting the core capabilities of the company

&amp;#x200B;

2. This is a concern and there are Cannabis players who will not make it to the finish line, but there is a lot of room for specialization in this industry just like any other. 

* The global revenue growth potential for the industry is extreme and there is plenty of room for those who now how to position themselves well
* While this risk/concern may impact Village Farm more in some markets than others, especially as they aim to expand and increase the amount of competitors they are exposed to, their core business in Canada alone is already sufficiently impressive to be worth an investment opportunity by itself. More on that to come

&amp;#x200B;

3. This is a real risk that cannot just be explained away easily

* This is a company that can handle scale and complexity based on its 34 year track record and industry leading position in North America Cultivation space. There are still significant risks and capital investments required to expand in this industry, especially given the current regulatory state around the world
* As one example, expanding into Texas alone will require standing up a vertically integrated end-to-end business within that state alone, with uncertainty as to the timeline of exactly when and how the medical program will expand and eventually go fully adult use legal
* If the expansion of the Texas medical program expected later this year is not as wide ranging as anticipated, and/or the introduction of fully legal adult use legislation in the market takes many years to come, that will make the high operating expenses and fixed costs of this market a weight on the company’s overall P&amp;L until revenues and the ROI break even within the state
* Furthermore, there’s no guarantee their business competes as successfully as they’ve operated in Canada regardless of legislative impact
* And that was all just conjecture about Texas, not even mentioning Europe and Asia Pacific expansion plans
* This potential pitfall is the risk that concerns me the most

&amp;#x200B;

4. This does not concern me, as experienced business leaders can apply the same principles that drive success in one industry to another. Subject matter expertise certainly is important, but it isn’t the end all be all, there are different styles. Some senior executives are experts of their industry/product/service and lean on that expertise to be great leaders, others are experts in general business principles and good at listening to the industry/product/service experts who work for them, among other types of leadership philosophies. This leadership team makes up for what they lack in prior Cannabis expertise with agricultural expertise which is critical to this industry. I do understand if this is a larger concern for some, though I want to address a bit further why it is not for me, at the risk of redundancy:

* Consumer packaged goods are consumer packaged goods and commodities are commodities. Knowing your product, your target customers and demographics, your industry, and a myriad of other marketing/commercial considerations I could additionally mention are obviously critically important to success
* Even so, the most important aspects of leading a large modern business revolve around universal concepts that apply to all products/services and industries: fiscal responsibility, operational discipline, and clear value positioning/commercial strategy. Some companies do okay without those attributes as core competencies. I’m sure some even flourish – revolutionary products and visions can overcome many hurdles. But no company can rely on that for long term stability – guaranteeing continued revolutionary advances is by definition not possible, and revolutionary vision is generally derived from specific individuals. People leave companies. People die. Relying on revolutionary products or visions is not a successful strategy for true long term stability
* If you can create a fiscally responsible and operationally disciplined environment /organizational infrastructure within your business and partner it with revolutionary products or vision - you have an Amazon or an Apple. Village Farms International WILL NOT BE an Amazon or an Apple. Cannabis is a commodity (granted, a commodity that is benefiting from extreme growth due to emerging from essentially global prohibition) and if they had revolutionary vision, I’d imagine there would be more articles about Michael DeGiglio as an individual that I would have come across in my research (no disrespect intended - I’m sure he’s a swell guy and very intelligent given his resume and achievements)
* Based on my research, I believe this company has a clear understanding of its value positioning and commercial strategy, as well as the aforementioned and critical capabilities of fiscal responsibility and operational discipline. I will support these claims in the next section

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Outlook:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The main objective of publicly traded companies is to provide/increase shareholder value. The main way that is achieved is by increasing profit, although for companies in the growth category, increasing revenue can be more important in the growth phase to institutions and investors (see: Amazon for many years). To put it more simply, the three areas a company must focus on to provide/increase shareholder value are as follows, with a summary of my perspective on Village Farm International’s outlook for each area, with context:

&amp;#x200B;

**Grow Revenue - Domestic**

* Most important metric for stock price over next couple years given growth industry status
* Stated goal from 1/21 investor presentation (link in references): “Goal to capture 20% market share in dried cannabis category and have #1 or #2 brand market share in each product category”
* “Dried cannabis”, or flower category, is the largest product category in the industry and made up \~33% of all US Cannabis sales in 2020 (as one example benchmark), so between that and their also ambitious targets for other categories, will use 20% market share target as a representative goal of theirs for the overall Canadian market

  

|**Year**|**Canadian Market Revenue (C$)**|**Pure Sunfarms Actual Revenue (C$)**|**Pure Sunfarms Target Revenue (C$) (20% MS)**|**Notes**|

| 2019A|C$1,190,156,000|C$83,000,000|C$238,031,200|7% market share in 2nd year of operations|
| 2020A|C$2,623,942,000|?|C$524,788,400|Actual market revenues for 2019 and 2020 (not projections)|

|2025P|C$6,500,000,000|n/a|C$1,300,000,000|Market projection from BDS Analytics|

\*Made up market forecast based on growing (with diminishing annual growth) from 2020 actuals to the 2025 market projection from BDS Analytics

&amp;#x200B;

* VFF market share from 2019 in Canada around 7%
* Based on the 7% actual and the 20% target, as well as BDS Analytics Canadian cannabis market projection for 2025, estimated 2025 revenues for Pure Sunfarms would be a range between $360M if market share remains flat to $1B if 20% market share is achieved
* That alone represents a range of 74% to 383% revenue growth versus total company 2019 revenue (growth measured from 2019 to 2025)
* Keep in mind that’s in Canada alone, ignoring expansion activity, AND ignoring revenue from their legacy produce business!
* Yes that’s a lot of growth potential, and this is a company that has the demonstrated experience and capability to handle that scale profitably (more on that in next section)

&amp;#x200B;

**Grow Revenue - International expansion**

US

* Texas presence already established
* Not going to go into speculation here, but this is a massive potential market that is likely to expand its medical program significantly by the end of 2021
* Some articles in reference list below for those interested

Europe

* Ownership stake in DutchCanGrow in the Netherlands

Asia-Pacific

* Already operating in Hong Kong
* Targeting further expansion in China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, and more
* Targeting expansion into at least 3 more countries in the region by end of 2021

&amp;#x200B;

**Grow Revenue - Define value position and execute**

The core principles of the cannabis arm of the business are listed by the company as follows:

* The leading supplier of greenhouse grown produce in North America
* A producer of the highest quality product, which adheres to the highest food safety standards
* A low cost producer
* A daily supplier to customers
* A provider of excellence in customer service and logistics
* A business with a solid balance sheet
* Enhancing investor value through continual improvements in execution
* An employer with a dynamic environment in which employees can grow and prosper

&amp;#x200B;

They directly speak to building their value proposition on the main competencies we’ve already discussed: “low cost provider”, “continual improvements in execution”, “solid balance sheet”, “excellence in customer service and logistics”

* These are not sexy principles compared to a lot of the flash in a new industry like this, but they are proven winning principles
* Village Farms aims to be closer to a Walmart than a Nordstrom, and its own self awareness of how to best leverage and position its experience and resources is a sign of solid leadership and direction
* Village Farms will win on volume, scale, and efficiency, not marketing and pricing

&amp;#x200B;

**Increase Operational Productivity/Scalability (for various ops processes: decrease lead times, increase outputs, decrease labor requirements, etc)**

* Take advantage of historical competencies and economies of scale
* Greenhouse grow is their bread and butter, they are already at the cutting edge of cost management and productivity/efficiency for this industry. It may not be a permanent competitive advantage and competitors can catch up, but it provides a great head start and attracts partners

&amp;#x200B;

**Minimize Costs (procurement/purchasing pricing, inventory costs, labor costs, etc.)**

* Supporting above revenue growth will take significantly less new capital investment compared to competitors due to existing infrastructure
* Already have industry leading gross margin, per 1/21 investor deck (40%), as well as industry leading profitability
* Already lowest cost producer of flower among Canadian greenhouse/indoor growers
* Currently riding 7 consecutive quarters of positive net income and 8 consecutive quarters of positive EBITDA

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Takeaways:**

I’m not going to speculate on stock value targets, I’m not a financial analyst and this isn’t financial advice. I like the company, and to quote DFV, I like the stock. I believe the company has strong fundamentals from an operational perspective. I want to invest in the success I believe this company will have, and I believe it will provide a significant ROI. I do not believe that all the growth the cannabis industry can and will experience is priced in to current valuations (although I would love to see other thoughts on that).

&amp;#x200B;

The stock price could go up in the short, middle, or long term. It could go down. Heck, it could even stay flat.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know, Jon Snow knows nothing, this isn’t financial advice, and I’m just a stoned monkey. I plan on holding for the foreseeable future (most likely years, while buying the dips) barring any unlikely circumstances (any of the discussed obstacles/pitfalls manifest in a critically damaging way, the company exits the industry and returns to focusing on its roots in produce, Michael DeGiglio besmirches Harrison Ford in any way, or something of the like).

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t a get rich quick target, this isn’t a moonshot, and this isn’t without risk. There will be ups and downs over the years, as this is still an industry that is very vulnerable to market fears and herd mentality impacting stock values significantly, regardless of underlying fundamentals. This is an investment play, a long term hold, a “trust the process” play. This industry has amazing global growth potential, it will stabilize eventually, but on the path there, the Greenfield expansion/Brownfield acquisition&amp;merger growth phase of this industry will shake out many of its less fundamentally sound players. As players shake out, as regulatory fears continue to be stoked, and other similar phenomena occur, there will be value fluctuations and there will be investors who get spooked and lose money. Don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose. Don’t invest what you may need access to in an emergency. And don’t put your mental health at risk.

&amp;#x200B;

In an emerging industry that is rampant with companies tangled up in financial mismanagement, short term cash grabs at the cost of sound long term decision making, regulatory hurdles, and lack of defined strategic direction, Village Farms looks to be a potential sleeping giant. As the chips fall globally over the next 5-10 years within the Cannabis industry, companies will emerge that will become titans. While Village Farms may not ever be the most popular or well known consumer-facing cannabis business, it looks well positioned to carve out a valuable niche in the industry and create a lot of value.

&amp;#x200B;

I like the industry long term, I like the company long term, and I like the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: This DD and the assumptions involved are derived from high level information obtainable on the internet. I have never done business with this company, I have never been to Canada, and I don’t particularly like tomatoes (my apologies to the many tomato lovers I am sure I have disappointed, though I do like ketchup). The realities of the underlying assumptions may be very off base. Customer experience and product quality could be lacking, my assumptions regarding the more technical/market-based considerations may be incredibly naïve (or even flat out stupid), and I may truly be a stoned ape just banging his head against the keyboard.

CryptoCurrency,"Why deflationary assets are attractive, lessons from 1923's Hyperinflation","The announcement of EIP 1559 this week means that ETH is set to become a deflationary asset. I believe this will be a hugely attractive selling point for new investors who enter crypto (inevitably through BTC). 

&amp;#x200B;

What's more, this comes at a time that the federal reserve is printing money like hotcakes. I had a little read into previous events that have occurred and came across the 'Hyperinflation of 1923'. 

In short, the German government increased print runs of banknotes in order to continue to pay workers who were striking. This printing went on and on, leading to devaluation of the currency and hyperinflation. At one point, over 30 paper factories were in operation. 

As printing continued, the buying power of each note decreased, causing sellers to raise prices drastically. For example, in 1918 a loaf of bread cost 0.25 Reichsmark, by November 1923, it cost ***80 billion*** Reichsmark!

&amp;#x200B;

I know that this is not directly relatable to the US situation, but it is a simple (yet extreme) example to illustrate the differences between assets that are continuously produced and those which are deflationary. Hope you found this a little interesting, here is a photo of some kids flying a kite made of almost worthless bank notes to end on!

personalfinance,Should I refinance my house and take a Cash out to buy my wife a new car?,"My wife and I bought our house two years ago. I paid $179,000. Bought the house from inlaws so they gave us a pretty good deal on it. It's a nice house. Built in 1903. 3,742 sq/ft. 7 bed 4 bath 2 kitchen(both remodeled 5 years ago). It's in amazing condition for its age.

 
 Here's the thing.. its so big and in 2 years my oldest goes to college and 2 years after that the other one.

 We live in SE Idaho and people from CA are moving here en masse. Our housing market has skyrocketed. Haven't had my house appraised since I bought it, but a house down the street that is half the size and not in as good of condition just sold for 350k. 

 I suspect that I could sell this house for around 500k today? 

I keep getting letters to refinance.  Called, and they want to give me a 50k cash and refinance.

 Basically, it boils down to my interest rate going from 3.9 to 4.1%, my mortgage goes up $100 and I get 50k in the bank. (Life kicked us in the junk right after we bought and my credit score suffered.. I just paid off 90% of my debt 2 days ago)


 So.. My wife and I have never had new cars. We've both always drove reliable beaters from the 90s that we bought outright. We are both good with this.. but I want to get her a new car. We both work hard. I feel like my wife deserves it.. its embarrassing that she drives around in an old toyota corolla. 


 Is it responsible to do the cash out and just buy her a new(er) car outright?

We plan to sell the house and move in two years so we can be closer to where the kids are going to goto school.

 Is it smart to do this two years before moving?",finance

personalfinance,Questions about DAF and Tax Benefits,"Hello everyone,

I really love the idea of DAFs and the benefits that come with it. If anyone of you has already done this or planning to do it's a great way to donate to your favorite charity and consume the tax benefits. This post is for me to find out points I might miss while considering donating money and not just for personal gains.

I have a Fidelity Brokerage Account and a DAF from Fidelity charitable(0.6% management fees)

Considering my case let's take an example of an individual who is earning about $80k in a year.Case 1: I would have to pay about $25k in taxes(Federal + State and other taxes included). Now let's say I had $1k of stock in Fidelity in January that appreciated to $10k by August (Hypothetical Eg.) I decide to move this investment from the brokerage account to the Fidelity Charitable account. That means I could write off $10k from the taxes I owe at the end-of-year reducing my Capital Gains Tax + my income tax which means I only have to pay $15k tax end-of-year.

Case 2: Let's say I had 10 stocks of mixed values. Some appreciated in value and I decide to donate those. Eg: 5 stocks of BA which appreciated in value from $50 to $250 by the end-of-year. I decide to move just these 5 stocks to the Fidelity Charity account for DAF. $1250 is what I can reduce from my income tax I assume.

Is there a limit to how much I can write off from the donations I make to the DAF and any other details I might miss other than the 0.6% management fee which is way too less considering the tax return benefit?",finance

My question is if I put all my self employed income (assuming I make &lt;=19,500 annually) into my 401k, what am I taxed at end of year from that side job income?

The way I currently understand it, medicaid and social security get pulled no matter what--I should set that aside each month so I'm prepared to pay. But if I put the remainder all into the pre-tax 401k vehicle, my federal income tax is now 0% of the total self employed income I made. Yes? No?

TL;DR - How much of my self employed income is taxed if I put all my earnings straight into a 401k (excluding medicaid &amp; social security)",finance

personalfinance,What Blockfi just taught me about being smart with money.,"Blockfi is a custody company that will pay you a very generous APY on the crypto you hold with them.

They also have a collateralized loan program that allows you to borrow agains those funds.

What m finally in a position where my debt to income ratio is extremely low.  Paired with the current state of inflation and interest rates,  I have finally decided to pull the trigger on my dream of owning a boat.  (Yeah, I know,  but whatever,  I have dreamt of it forever and I love them) 
I toyed with the idea of pulling a loan from my Blockfi account which sounded great.  I don’t have to sell my position and if the crypto market keeps going up, even better.  But when doing the math, I realized that 6%apy would go away on a sizable chunk of money, so the loan would end up costing me not just the agreed interest rate but an additional 6% apy on that money.. sheeesh.  It’s totally legal and to me it is not predatory as it’s pretty transparent.   It, however, that a quite possibly the best lesson I have learned about borrowing money in a smart way.",finance

MachineLearning,[D] Possible misinterpretation on Federated Learning paper,"I've recently started evaluating network parameters and their impact on federated learning models, specifically to their accuracy and communication requirements. Doing so, I'm revising any papers with similar evaluations and one of them is ""[Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629)"", by McMahan et al.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a well referenced paper which is attributed to ""officially"" introducing federating learning, so I'm worried that I may be wrong about some assumptions. The two main problems are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The authors use the well known MNIST dataset for one of their evaluations and they divide the tests into two scenarios: IID and non-IID. On the non-IID scenario they ""\[...\] first sort the data by digit label, divide it into 200 shards of size 300, and assign each of 100 clients 2 shards. This is a pathological non-IID partition of the data, as most clients will only have examples of two digits."". But separating the dataset into digits that were probably written by different users is not sufficient to claim non-IID data, since one user may (and probably) will end up with examples from multiple authors (the people who wrote down the digits). Is that correct or is this separation enough to reflect the usual data distribution in federated learning scenarios?

2. While describing the experiments, there is a passage that reads ""We report the number of communication rounds necessary to achieve a target test-set accuracy. To compute this, we construct a learning curve for each combination of parameter settings, optimizing η as described above and then making each curve monotonically improving by taking the best value of test-set accuracy achieved over all prior rounds."" So the authors use  the same test set to optimize the learning rate (η) and to present their experiments. Is this considered data leakage and can this be used to challenge the results?

&amp;#x200B;

While reading other papers on this subject, all of them cite McMahan et al., but this critic is not found. So I'm questioning if I made a mistake in reasoning.

investing,“We are not in a bubble” – Cathie Wood,"The following is my summary of Cathie Wood’s thoughts on recent market volatility, as presented in her latest video on the Ark Invest YouTube channel (~42 min) – I strongly recommend you check it out.

The minimum expected rate of return for a stock to enter an ark portfolio is 15% CAGR. Cathie contends that she sees the recent volatility as a gift to gain alpha over the intended 15% return in many of her high conviction names.

She mentions that at Ark, they have a five year time horizon, and it is counter productive to compare its performance with a benchmark (like the s&amp;p) over a shorter period. She further adds that many stocks in traditional indices today are a potential value trap, and that ark etfs “are a good hedge against broad based benchmarks.”

She reiterates that “we are not in a bubble” – and that the seeds of their 5 innovation platforms were planted in the dot com bubble, and are now ready for prime time, in a period of reality. Fear of a bubble likely stems from benchmark sensitivity and backward looking institutional investors. Furthermore, intuitions should be worried about their own strategies as “creative disruption will impact nearly 50% of the s&amp;p500”.

To Cathie, interest rates going up suggest that ‘real growth is going to pick up’ – and that she understands the concern over her own stock picks potentially underperforming as a result. However, she believes that that the market has assumed that interest rates will stabilize at a 4 to 5% range - which inversed (1/4 or 1/5) gives a normalized p/e of 20 or 25; so markets didn’t actually misprice assets to begin with. She thinks that nominal growth however, will not be at 4 to 5%, but instead around 2-3%, which can lead to greater valuation support for companies that can grow more rapidly.

Rotation from growth to value was also expected on her part. She repeats that value will face massive headwinds going forward. Energy and financial stocks have done amazing in the past month - which is a good thing as the bull market is broadening out unlike the dot com bubble, where ‘too much capital chased too few opportunities, too soon’. Energy and financial sectors booming will likely be short lived as they are both ripe for massive disruption.

stocks,Bulls vrs Bears. What is your call for the next year? What is your rational?,"I feel like the world's economic outlook as a whole is on a knife's edge. 

On one side, we are reopening and as retail and restaurant jobs return the unemployment situation will hopefully trend back to normalcy. The economy looks fundamentally stable despite the ravages of the pandemic.

The market has decided standard fundamentals based valuation aren't as important as they once were, and after a bull back we are getting a huge stimulus much of that likely heading in some form into the market. 

Energy and tech is changing rapidly, and like many other tech stock's in recent history, fundamentals take a while to catch up to valuations.  Fundamental based valuation likely do not apply to those companies that will win the ultimate battle to be the next Amazon, Apple and Google. 

However, on the other side selling 1,9 trillion in New debt to buyers not looking to take cover in a pandemic, might not be such an easy task.  How high will yield rates go, and what tools does the fed have if there simply isn't the appetite to buy at reasonable rates. 

If interest rates are forced up in the middle of an artificial housing bubble, during the worst unemployment crisis since the Great depression, to a country drowning in debt, and with limited financial ammunition left to fix the problem, how bad could things realistically get?

CryptoCurrency,Due to the stimulus package I will kick stablecoins out of my portfolio. Even a shitcoin is not as bad as fiat. Change my mind.,"Given that the USD money supply was blown up by 20% last year and now there will be a few trillion more around due to the 'stimulus package' (I personally would rather call it 'fixing your meth addiction by introducing you to heroin package'), I have decided to kick stablecoins out of my portfolio.

In March 2020 I went all in on btc in anticipation of the halving and in January I diversified into 6 different cryptos and earn interest through lending. My portfolio is fluctuating around $1M at the moment, the highest being about 1.15 million. When my lock-up period is up I have created a list of CCs and tokens to buy in equal dollar amounts and then rebalance with interest payments twice a year. Until today usdc was part of that plan, but given the stimulus package and general inflation of money supply I have decided to kick it off the list. Through lending I could make 11-14% APY currently, but even that crazy high interest can't keep up with the inflation of the dollars in (virtual) existence. I'm very aware of the risk and volatility of the crypto space. I bought my first coins and mining contracts in January 2018 with some change before going in big last year and I've been in the stock market for 6 years throughout Brexit etc, so I'm very comfortable with extreme volatility and crashes.

My previous logic was to keep 20% of my funds in usdc to buy during crashes in cryptos, but with the insane monetary policy I would put the USD on a similar level as bitconnect. Even the worst shitcoin &gt; fiat. Change my mind.",cryptocurrency

Let’s say you have 10 bonds on the market they’re trading 100 dollars each if you buy it the government will give you a dollar in interest every year for ten years that’s 1% return on your money. Now no one wants to get one percent return when they can go to the market and get way more. 

No one buys the bonds, so they lower price to say 50 dollars (keep in mind it’s a private holder of the bond that sells it to you not government) so now the yield your getting is 2% because your getting a dollar for spending 50. 

Other lenders see this and say well if I can get 2% from the government with almost 0 risk why would I loan money to ex. ABC Inc a company that has a lot of debt (with little to no profits) and might not be able to pay my money back, so they increase the interest rate on loans. (Increasing reward for taking on higher risk)

There is also a fear of inflation because uncle JPOW has to go to print more money that is approved by the senate and congress the people need so that they don’t stop spending money and the GDP shrinks durning a pandemic.

He then has to buy government bonds from the market to balance the feds balance sheet, increasing cash supply.
There’s another concept that is very important when you add more money to an economy without extra productivity it loses purchasing power, look at Venezuela as an example. I’m not saying the US is gonna turn into Venezuela, and JPOW has said that he’s not gonna let inflation get out of hand, but Greenspan said the housing market is rock solid before 2008. 

So people are even more scared to buy bonds at are example of 2% because inflation is part of that calculation. So if inflation right now is 0.5% you’re getting 2% that’s fine your making 1.5% (called real rate of return), but if inflation goes to 4% your losing money because you’ll still be getting the same 2% of initial investment. (Simple way to put it is the dollar they give you used to buy a coke, but now you need two dollars for a coke, things get expensive)

Banks, funds other institutions really like they’re cokes so they put they’re money in hard assets, commodities, gold, even bitcoins, and real estate because when inflation goes up those increase in price therefore they have less cash to buy the bonds from the government and that decreases the demand drop the price again, increasing the rate again. And you can see it’s like a hell loop. (This is only a small nugget of it btw)

My attempt at trying to put things in simpler terms so that everyone can understand it, if you have any questions let me know. If you see anything that’s wrong or missing I’ll try to add it in or fix it.",finance

personalfinance,[IRS] Asking about an error we already tried to fix,"In 2019 my wife and I realized we had incorrectly filed federal taxes with our electric vehicles. We learned this because we were informed that when we filed taxes in 2017, our Plug-In credit wasn't actually applicable because it was a used car. Unfortunately, we learned this only a couple of weeks after we filed our 2019 where we had just claimed our second vehicle--a used Leaf--for the credit as well. 

We immediately looked into this, realized our mistake and filed an amended return for 2019. (We also got the 2017 situation squared away) so we thought we were good. 

However, we just received in the mail a letter from the IRS where they're saying that in the examination of our taxes they need more information about the Plug-In credit we claimed. It seems like a very similar letter to what we received for the 2017 car. 

In our response to them, I assume we just include the amended return and a letter explaining our attempt to fix the situation, but is there anything else we should be aware of/know?",finance
personalfinance,Series EE Savings Bonds Cash Out,"I have Series EE Federal Savings Bonds that were bought by my parents and issued in both my father’s and my name. These bonds are coming to 30 year maturity and automatically being converted into Zero-Percent Certificates of Indebtedness (C of I) by the Treasury. This will continue to occur monthly for roughly the next 17-18 years. Obviously, any investment is better than 0% interest so I’d like to cash out the bonds.

I was hopeful that, to avoid taxes, I could cash the bonds as direct contributions to my children’s 529 accounts. Unfortunately, it seems that the rules preclude this type of “multi-generational wealth” scenario. There are several stipulations to qualify the bonds for tax-exempt statutes, but I believe the clause that excludes this approach is from the Treasury Direct Savings Bonds for Education program, stating - “To exclude interest [...] a taxpayer must be at least 24 years old before the bond’s issue date.”

Additionally, IRS Form 8815, Exclusion of Interest From Series EE and I U.S. Savings Bonds Issued After 1989, goes on to state specifically - “A bond bought by a parent and issued in the name of his or her child under age 24 does not qualify for the exclusion by the parent or child.”

I was a child under the age of 18 for all of the bonds issued in my name. What could possibly be the rationale for this rule?

I’d be interested to know if I am reading / interpreting all of this correctly.

If indeed I am correct that I am ineligible for the bonds to be tax-exempt, are there any other ways to avoid the Tax Man when cashing these bonds?

If not, what is the most appropriate way to invest these bonds after they are cashed?

I currently contribute $100 each paycheck to each of my children’s 529 accounts. I’m thinking about ceasing those contributions directly from my paycheck and instead investing the savings bonds proceeds into those accounts as they mature.

I was also thinking that I could kick the money into Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) through an IRA.

I have no debt other than my mortgage which I am currently paying an extra $500 per month towards the principle. I maximize my contributions to my 401k to receive my employer’s contribution match. I am in my mid-30’s and plenty of years away from retirement.

The locking in of the money for 12 months before it can be touched is a little unnerving with an emergency fund as the whole point is for it to be liquid and ready whenever you need it.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Gives Hope To Those Living in Developing Nations,"At the start of February this year, a friend of mine mentioned how I could earn $6-7 per day using my GPU. I knew mining is profitable, but I didn't know it would be as simple as just downloading a client and pressing a button.

I started mining but I didn't really know how I would cash out the BTC I was getting from NH since Crypto isn't really supported in Pakistan; thus, you can't even verify your account on exchanges (At least not Tier 2 verification that allows you to convert).

So I began doing a little research on the basic concept of Crypto so I could understand the jargon Youtubers spewed in their videos. My interest towards the concept of Crypto grew as I studied the history, looked at the graphs from the past few years, saw the recent projects being undertaken by major companies like VISA.

I did end up finding out how to turn my Spot into Fiat (Using the proper terminology to sound cool), which entailed using Binance and its P2P trade. However, I didn't actually withdraw myself, just bought a $20 steam card using BTC. Instead I forwarded my findings to my friends who did indeed withdraw and use their cash up already. 

I ended up converting my BTC into ETH (Reasoning: I can hodl a higher share of ETH compared to BTC) and I bought $10 worth of ADA using my own money.

I realized that withdrawing $50-60 worth of BTC per month isn't going to change much in my life, but maybe holding it for a few years will maybe bring some changes. 

I do get how you can also invest in the Stock market, but that (at least here) requires you to go to a Stock broker to get setup and then deal with their antics and such. Crypto offers anonymity, which to some is a deal breaker while taking a lunge.  

Now I've moved on from NH and I'm mining ETH directly into my wallet. I have also decided on putting $20 aside from my $200 salary each month on a coin of my choosing (It is currently ADA, but I am researching other projects as well).

stocks,"Inflation and the S&amp;P 500, which way is up?","Historically stocks have been considered a partial hedge against inflation. So with inflation on the horizon I thought it would be interesting to discuss the effects of inflation on the price of the S&amp;P 500.


1. Can we actually expect to see inflation rise?

The argument for inflation is pretty straight forward. Over the last few months we have seen an increase in government stimulus, with another $1.9 trillion added today. Meanwhile the pandemic has decreased spending. With the end to the pandemic coming into view this means that we could be looking at a near future where a population newly flush with cash all run out to buy things they have been putting off buying. In this scenario demand outpaces supply driving demand-pull inflation. This sentiment has been endorsed by the fed who generally believed to be a good sign for the economy.

So it does seem likely that we will see an increase in inflation. Though it's just a prediction, and we all know how those usually turn out.


2. What effect will rising inflation have on the price of the S&amp;P 500?

With rising inflation, buying power decreases. This means companies pay more to produce goods while consumer purchasing decreases due to lost buying power. Meanwhile bond yields tend to increase pulling money away from stocks. 

On the surface this seems like an open and shut case for inflation driving lower market returns. So then why are stocks traditionally considered a hedge against inflation?

The usual answer for this seems to be that companies balance sheets typically increase in proportion to inflation. Moreover the whole driving force for demand-pull inflation is increased demand resulting in companies raising prices and ultimately resulting in increased profits. 

So inflation is good for stock prices then? Didn't we all just agree it's bad?

The truth, like so many things in the market, seems to be that the effect of inflation on the market is inconsistent and depends on a great many more factors than just inflation itself. 

So reddit, what's your take? What factors do you think will influence the current pro-inflation market and what do you see as the outcome?

personalfinance,Car Loan Calculators Discrepancy,"Hi there,

Today, out of curiosity, I was plugging the numbers from our ""truth-in-lending"" forms for several of our vehicles just to play with numbers and see different possibilities. In doing so, I noticed that in every calculator I used, and even by hand, the number that I got for the estimated monthly payment for each loan was always off by a small amount, usually anywhere from 20 cents to a dollar. That wouldn't be such a big deal but whenever using that number to figure out the total cost of something it can add up quickly!

I've come here to ask you guys why you think it might be? Would the systems that the banks use round differently somewhere? Is there some fee that I'm unaware of snuck in? I have no idea. Tell me what you guys think.

1. Grandfather sends huge amount funds from a business bank account to a personal Binance US trading account despite Binance US making it clear they dont accept any third party transfers.


2. Grandfather did not test a small transfer, but sent such a large sum right away to a newly opened account?


3. Grandfather supposedly sold the business but is still using the bank account of the business he sold?! 

4. The posters went 8 months without contacting a lawyer for such a large amount? Wire transfer issues = top hits on google include get a lawyer. 

5. Grandfather is supposedly scared of online banking, but is comfortable using protonmail.. Protonmail itself raises flags and combined with operating a bank account of a business he supposedly sold is not a good look. Privacy is great but using such emails for a fiat exchange (which is almost like a bank) is just asking for trouble. 

Decentralised finance is great, but when dealing with crypto fiat exchanges, they are more or less similar to banks and have to abide by all the AML laws and regulations, some of which even require the exchange to inform Law Enforcement Agencies when any AML red flags are triggered. And if LE is involved, and if there are investigations underway and/or unsealed indictments with any of the parties involved, the exchanges cant communicate with the OP about what is going on and can even be asked to shut down the account without any warning or further information. 

There are numerous incidents where banks have closed users accounts without any warning or reason. Sometimes the banks are even accused of closing customer accounts with funds stuck in them and there is no apparent way for the customer to get the funds back. Its not the case that these banks are stealing customer funds. A large bank like Bank of America has no reason to steal funds. But all financial institutions have to comply with federal and international money transmitter laws which include lots of AML checks and if there are flags, freezes on funds and locks on accounts. Binance, Coinbase etc all have to follow the same laws too.

I think what you are seeing right now is massive denial of what's going on with our economy.

The economy has been battered. Small businesses are failing. Americans now have ""huge savings"" after receiving thousands of dollars of stimulus and no bars/movie theaters/restaurants to spend it on. Mall bankruptcies are epic.

The federal reserve is pretending inflation doesn't exist, but if it does exist, they have ways to deal with it. Sure they do.

We are going to see the middle class nearly disappear in the next 10 years. Are you ready for what that looks like? But before then, are you ready for the ""growth"" aka stimulus fueled inflation. Are you ready for real inflation with suppressed interest rates? How about the infrastructure bill of $2 trill.

financialindependence,I don't understand how the 4% safe withdrawal rate (Bengen 1993) which had 40% in bonds could be relevant today when bond yields are close to 0?,"e.g. The only reason the 4% rate survived the great depression was because of the 40% bonds. If the portfolio was 80-100% stocks which many people today seem to go for, it would have been utterly destroyed with a 4% withdrawal

Bond yields were very high historically, 2-4% REAL returns even with Government bonds, this is why the 4% rule worked so well. But if you have 40% in bonds yielding a measly 1-1.5% today (nominal!) with the additional risk that future rate rises will totally crush their value, I don't see how the 4% rule is relevant today. A 40% bond portfolio (with high quality gov and IG corporate bonds) would have wayy expected lower return these days, with well under inflation interest rates. Am I missing something? Did the 4% rule study actually test time periods where bond/interest rates were near 0 and stocks were at near record valuations like today? Even in the 2000 and 2008 crashes yields were way higher and could be dropped, now they have no room to drop.

I basically paid off the last of my debt around 15 years ago.  Eventually, over time, my credit score went away.  Afterwards, I wasn't checking my credit reports yearly like they advise you too.  And, sometime later, it caught up to me.

Moving very soon, and when I applied to the apartments I wanted to go to, they actually found something negative on my credit history (it should have been blank for quite some time).  After some digging, found out someone used my ss number to open themselves a credit card from a bank I'd never heard of, and it got sent to an address I'd never heard of, must less lived at.  This happened 4 years ago.  After maxing out the 500 dollar limit, of course it got abandoned.  Eventually the bank sent it to a collection agency, where it sat until I found out about it.

I have called the collection agency and spoke with them about it.  They said they would mark all the credit agencies listing with a ""disputed"" tag, and requested I send them 1 item from a list so that they could confirm it.  I filed a police report with the local authorities and mailed them that this past week.  I also filed a report with the federal trade commission and included that as well.  Now, for my actual questions.

I haven't even started actually the credit agencies about it. Is clearing this up with them something that the collection agency is required to do, or is it something that I should be pursuing on my own?  If so, should I wait for the collection agency to drop the collection against me first, or start now?

I'm planning on doing a security freeze with all the credit agencies.  I have read up on it, so I sort of understand what is involved and what it will do.  But, do I need to wait until after this is off my history?   Just curious if it would interfere with me getting this taken off my history, that is, if the collection agency is the ones that would get it removed.  If it's basically between me and the agencies to get it removed, then I don't see a reason it would interfere, I guess.",finance
stocks,"Inflation, yields, and the stock market","The market is freaking out because it's afraid that higher inflation means the Fed will raise interest rates, which will hurt companies - especially growth companies - by imposing more expensive long term financing. Also bonds with higher yields are more attractive, so some people reallocate money towards those. Thus stock prices drop.

But what I don't get it, if you're truly afraid that higher inflation is coming, wouldn't you want to hold assets more than cash or bonds? The rout in some sectors seems irrationally savage. Green energy stocks are down 50% or more, even though most valuations are well under $10 billion, and we all know there are trillions of dollars in global, not just US, spending happening over the next decade to transition the world's energy system. 

It just seems to make no sense to me; even if I were convinced that inflation is going to be at 4-5% for the next few years, shouldn't that just mean that all these companies will be gradually increasing their prices and that their market caps will adjust upwards to reflect the constant of their inherent value in the face of a declining nominal value of the dollar?

CryptoCurrency,[Learning] MIT Open Course: Blockchain and Money,"Since there are a lot of new users in this sub, and many people seem to be enjoying using weekends to learn about crypto, I figured to share one of my favorite learning resources: 

**Blockchain and Money** is a free MIT course that offers an excellent introduction to crypto technology and crypto currency. It covers everything from the basics of how blockchain technology works, all the way to how larger financial systems interpret and work with these innovative systems. 

The course is taught by Professor [Gary Gensler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gensler), who has worked under the Obama Administration as the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and is currently appointed as the head of the Federal Reserve, Banking and Securities Regulators agency review team under the Biden Administration. 

(There are people who believe his appointment will challenge the development of blockchain from the federal government, while others are glad to see him in this position because of his extensive knowledge on the topic.)

Politics aside, the lectures are an enjoyable listen whether you are just getting started in crypto or are more advanced in your understanding.    

Here are some links for the course website, and below I made a chart for each session with a video link and description. Hope this will be a useful resource for anyone new and everyone else interested to learn more.

CryptoCurrency,Just a reminder that the US Governement doesn’t actually have 1.9 Trillion to hand out.,"This money will be completely printed out of thin air via the non-governmental agency that is the federal reserve. It does nothing other then create inflation in the economy. The trick will be to figure out where the inflation will show up. Normal quantitative easing usually shows up in equities and expensive shit like art  and yachts because it’s sent to large banks and distributed to the already wealthy. This time the people get the cash... I think equities will still do fine but crypto is bound to pop up. It isn’t that anything is more valuable it’s that the dollar is worth less in terms of those assets.

Full disclosure: I’m Canadian and will 100% be riding the financial asset inflation wave 🏄

personalfinance,Use emergency fund to pay off mortgage or hold off?,"This year I'm 14 years into my first mortgage, I currently owe 29k and will be down to 26k come June 2021 when I can make an anniversary payment, mortgage is not open so I can't do extra payments whenever.   

I make weekly payments of $290 (excluding property tax) at interest rate of 2.25%.  The remaining interest on this mortgage if I do nothing more is currently $930 but down to $716 in June.  I'm still saving but should have nearly enough to clear the mortgage in June but will take everything I've got, including 10k that is typically set aside as emergency fund.  Given that the interest saved is not really significant at this point, I'm unsure if I should go all in and just pay off OR hang onto my money and keep my accounts in decent shape.

I have no other debt and have been with the same employer since 2004, as far as I know my job is secure but its IT and we are always at risk of being outsourced.  Our collective agreement expires end of year so we could be on strike next year early 2022.  

I still have up until June to make a decision but I've been going back and forth on what to do and it's kind driving me nuts.  I took on this mortgage when I was 21 and I absolutely hate debt, I plan to never borrow again after this if I can help it.  I guess I'm worried draining my accounts, but then I enter into debt free so I can start building savings again.  I have been putting an extra 10-15k onto this mortgage for the past 5 years, which hasn't been easy and without sacrifices + the 15k mortgage payments.  Clearing this mortgage will free up 25-30k per year that I can start putting into proper savings and investments.  

So... should I go all in and hope that no emergency comes up?",finance
personalfinance,What can we afford? Las Vegas Housing Edition,"Hey Folks,  


I know these posts are done to death, but I am a first time homebuyer and want to make sure I am doing this correctly. I (29) and my wife (30) have a pretax income of about $100k. We have $70k in savings and plan to do 5% down on a conventional loan. We both work government jobs with a great pension (also, do not have to pay into Social Security). In addition I save about $100 into a 403(b) each check. We plan to ramp that up to 15% of my income and do the same for my wife once we close on a house. We have a trivial amount of student loan debt (less than $5k) that I think we are just going to pay off once forbearance is done. Credit scores are excellent (780 for me, about 800 for her) and have no other debt other than maybe $1k on a CC we pay off each month.   


Sites like nerd wallet put our comfortable purchasing power in the $550k range, and we have been flirting with homes between $450k and $500k. Part of me feels like that seems right, but I can't get over these alarm bells saying that I am making a grave mistake. We originally planned to buy closer to $350k in a starter home, but at $450k - $500k we are finding homes we imagine we will literally never have to move out of (at the very least we would be comfortable for 15+ years). Monthly payment at $450k would be about 30% of our pretax income.   


All of this lines up right? We are thrifty elsewhere (namely vehicles which I pride myself on buying beaters and maintaining myself). I also teach and have Summers off, and plan to pick up a Summer job of some sort, which might maybe pull in an extra $5 - 10k or so, if that.   


Are we doing this right? Or am I missing something big? We really want to take advantage of the low interest rates now before they start to get driven back up.",finance

Bitcoin,I cant talk about Bitcoin with the family.,"as you can read above, something really gets on my nerves.

I'm someone who didn't learn about finance before Bitcoin. I wasted a lot of money and never really thought about how to manage money properly.

&amp;#x200B;

A while back I tried to talk to a family member about Bitcoins and why I think it's a good thing.

I got super stupid answers and this person had no interest in listening to me even once.

I gave facts why Bitcoin is the future and they still don't want to listen to me, make me out to be an idiot who doesn't know anything about anything and is going to fall flat on his face anyway because I wasn't really good with money in the past.

Since one would like to help one and is then looked at so stupidly.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I started another topic. I'm currently looking at a lot of things about our financial system and have decided for myself to have as little cash as possible and rather put it into real estate, bitcoins or other useful investments. That's why I spoke to this family member again, to get another person's opinion on what I'm trying to do.

There I was once again left wondering if I have any idea about these things and they think it won't work anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I have made many mistakes in the past. Now I'm trying to work on it and use my money wisely, because I think that the system is slowly collapsing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting so fed up with it. I don't think I will share a single word about my finances with my family anymore as I don't feel like discussing it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still quite ""young"", have done many things wrong, disappointed many and yet learned from those mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest I hope she will stay so stubborn and will be really angry in the future for not listening to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I think Bitcoin is still going to be a very big thing and believe that we are still in the beginning with just $50,000.

personalfinance,"Nurse in Doctoral Program, need advice on paying loans and saving for retirement","Hello PF! 

I’ve been reading through the search bars and older posts for help, but thought I would post my current financial picture to get some feedback. I’m a 31/M working in the medical field in California with a base salary of $107k, not including any OT.

Ally Savings: $35,000

Retirement: $37,000 (403B/Roth IRA/Pension)

Average Monthly Expenses per Mint: $2600 

Total Debt: $48,000 (All from federal student loans, 0% interest until Sep?) 

I work FT, while concurrently pursuing a part-time DNP/MBA program. This degree will cost another $36,000-$40,000 over the span of 3 years after factoring in my grants. I’m hoping to obtain a leadership position after getting this degree, but I’m looking at how to best maximize retirement and personal savings with my current situation. Does it make more sense to pay off my current student loans with savings, then supplement paying out of pocket with a little bit more loans to cover the rest of the program?

I also feel I am behind in my retirement accounts. My new position is at a large teaching hospital that offers a pension, so I will be contributing 7% of my pre-tax income, as well as another 15% into an optional 403B with no match, then figure I can max out my Roth IRA. This means I will be contributing \~30% of my income into retirement. I read somewhere that if a company doesn’t offer a 401K/403B match, then it makes sense to first max your Roth IRA. However, the more I contribute to my 403B, I’ll be able to reduce my taxable income. I’ve heard of the 50/30/20 rule, but when I crunch the numbers it looks more like 50/20/30?

cardano,"Alright, so I have an idea that I've been thinking about for my entire life that I think can finally be implemented with NFT blockchain... please read if you're developing for NFT gaming ideas.","So, ever since I was a kid, I thought it would be great if you could get real-world PHYSICAL prizes for completing games. I think NFT blockchain makes this possible now.

Imagine an api system that game developers could attach to their games that would allow a user's universal NFT blockchain wallet to be attached to the gamers game purchase, and would be rewarded a real world prize when they finish the game. The prizes would be something game related that could only be purchased using the NFT they won when they beat the game for the first time, or whatever the end game goal would be. It wouldn't be available in any other store(besides being resold on things like eBay).

Now, the developers would have to have some sort of stake in this token as well, such as when the token is sent to the player, the developer would be charged for the token, or something to that affect. This would stop the developers from just making and easy prize dump for players.

I would imagine the prizes being things like patches, stuffed toys, exclusive statues or figures, and they would need to be official. Something related to the games to the games that were beaten. Maybe physical coins?

I know I would be much more apt to play a game to the end of there was a real-world prize that was exclusive.

CryptoCurrency,DD: Proton Chain (XPR),"Hi guys!

So I was researching XPR (PROTON) project and I figured, that I will write some short DD about it. I think it's quite interesting and possibly might have some nice integrations and applications in the upcoming months.

Short description:

Proton Chain was founded by creators of EOS Lynx and launched in may 2020. It's focused on merging EOS Lynx and Metal Pay and as a result provide scalable, easy to use payment system.

In February 2021, Metal Pay has filed to become a national bank in the U.S. Also, it was announced back then, that Metal Pay will also file applications with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Franciso.

They already created:

1. an Open Source Wallet SDK, which is easy to use and has great integrations,
2. Web SDK, that allows users to authenticate and accept payments using Proton Signing Request (PSR),
3. ERC-20 Wrapping,
4. Onchain Verified Identity,
5. Long Staking mechanism (allows users to lock in their funds to a smart contract guaranteed to beat the market performance of Bitcoin by 50%)
6. Protonswap allowing for easy asset exchange (updates are coming), no fees (!),
7. Demo apps, which are constantly being built up,

What is coming next in this year?

1. Fiat Transaction Integration,
2. ProtonSwap update,
3. Crypto Deposits,
4. Proton-wrapped coins (X coins) will have the ability to generate regular, recurring interest when held in Proton Wallet (next generation saving account).

Some technical info, about the chain itself:

1. Every business and individual account on Proton has a unique human readable name. Need to send $20 to fred? It’s as easy as you would expect.
2. Verified Identity
3. 4,000 Transactions per second
4. Users never pay gas
5. In-wallet payment requests, which eliminates the need for chrome plugins, ""dapp-stores"" or other devices.

Why bother reading about this project?

Well... I think it might be interesting, because they have a clear agenda - Create a decentralized banking institution with XPR as currency. It must be easy to use for everyone involved. Wallet in my opinion is very intuitive and works flawlessly. All apps are easy to understand for anyone.

Possibility to exchange your FIAT easily (in this year) will provide huge mobility to users, who are not ""crypto creeps"" + MetalPay generates easy payment system (only in US for now). ProtonSwap works great. You just need to connect your XPR wallet to ProtonSwap and then transfer ETH, USDT, USDC and few others to your address (converts to X coin automatically). Then you can swap it to XPR or something else with NO GAS at all.

Long staking seems like a cool idea, that can be very useful in next few years and I am very interested to see how will it evolve. What you do is basically locking your XPR into a contract that is tied to the performance of Bitcoin. There is a calculator, that you can use: [https://proton.bloks.io/wallet/longstaking/calculator](https://proton.bloks.io/wallet/longstaking/calculator)

I think this project has a lot of growing to do, but... It's brand new (half a year) . I hope this post will make few people interested in PROTON and will research it themselves.

Have a nice day everyone and thanks for reading :)

personalfinance,Should I prepay student debt (2.5% rate) or should I invest?,"My student debt is about 142k, which I refinanced with Earnest and have at a fixed 2.5% rate. 

Right now I have that debt on a 5-year plan, paying about $2700 a month. I’m also already maxing out my pre-tax 401(k) (no employer match), my Roth IRA and my HSA every year. Every month, I am lucky to have additional cash left over and above those amounts to either (1) prepay the loans or (2) invest. 

Thoughts?  It feels silly to prepay the debt when it’s at such a low interest rate.  It also feels insane to be making taxable investments when I have so much debt.

personalfinance,"New Home loan, issues with builder.","I am trying to use my credit union to finance the building of my new home. I was waiting on my preapproval letter ( I new it would be no issue to get approved) and told the builder that. They had one house left in the area that I could live in (real-estate has been crazy in my area) that was the model I liked so I signed a buyers contract and gave my deposit. The sales manager tried pushing hard for me to use their lender but he admitted the interest rate I would get through my credit union would be much better. 

A couple days later I supplied them with my pre-approval letter and a week after that I got a phone call from the sales manger wanting to know all the contact info for the credit union even though it's a well known credit union and the info was on the pre-approval letter. At this time he also again tried to push their lending company and tried some scare tactics etc but after I wouldn't fall for it he assured me he would contact the lender and all would be fine. Late last week I get a phone call in the middle of the work day from the sales manager that I had 14 days to supply them with some sort of documents that were needed from my bank and I have not done that and I will be in breachof the contract and the contract will be canceled. He wouldn't tell me what documents would be needed but that the fastest way to insure I don't loose the house is to go through his lender. 

My contract reads:

""Loan application/Credit reports:
If a buyer obtaining financing, Buyer aggress to make its loan application within four (4) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement and fully cooperate with Buyer's lender to obtain approval for a loan sufficient to finance the purchase of the Property (""Financing Approval"") . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein , if the Buyer fails to make appropriate application or fails to fully cooperate with lender in all respects, then Seller may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, terminate this Agreement and retain the Deposit as liquidated damages which is a reasonable estimate of Seller's damages, not a penalty.

If buyer is unable to obtain Financing approval, Buyer may give written notice (""Buyers Termination Notice"")  to Seller within fourteen (14) days after the Effective Date of this Agreement that Buyer wishes to terminate the Agreement due to Buyer's inability to obtain Financing Approval. In such event, Seller will refund the the Deposit. If Buyer does not give the Buyer's Termination Notice within the time required, this Agreement will no longer be contingent upon Financing Approval and will be fully binding on Buyer. Time is of the essence for this paragraph and strict compliance with the time for performance is required. 

Buyer herby authorizes its lender to disclose to Seller any and all credit, employment, income and other financial information concerning Buyer, such disclosure being  a waiver of any claim or cause of action of or concerning privacy rights, confidential information or otherwise.""

This is my first time building house so I am fully aware that it's very possible there is something along the way in this journey or building a new home that I am missing. Also if it matters this is not a custom home that I am building. The home is one that the builder owns the lot and was already in permitting to be built. Any suggestions of how to handle this situation would be very helpful.",finance

How is this possible? Do you lock into a contract or can the APR change if they want it to change? I read that the APR can fluctuate, but can that happen even after you buy in? 

I’ve never seen anything higher than 41%

82% must be a mistake, that would turn 5k into a million in 8 years

Edit - I mean 82%. My rounding error is more interest than any bank gives

Edit 2 - got an answer thanks u/StatisticalMan - 

All crypto rates are variable rates only otherwise specified. So it is 82% right now this second, an hour from now it can be a different rate, a day from now another rate.
It is simply supply and demand. Right now for whatever reason huge demand for AAVE v1 and not much supply = ultra high interest rates. Either supply will increase or demand will fall and so will the interest rate.

stocks,"Which stocks will be most sensitive to a rising bond market? Something like ""Rho"", but for stocks","As explained in [this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2021/03/04/rising-rates-are-great-for-the-stock-market-except-for-these-stocks/) (and many other places) as Treasury yields rise, stocks become less attractive (the ""equity risk premium"" decreases). However, since rising Treasury yields generally coincide with a growing economy, the lower equity risk premium is often offset by consumer demand etc driving up earnings and therefore share prices. But that boost isn't equally distributed throughout the market, so the rising bond market will affect some stocks more than others.

So there are two variables to consider: sensitivity to a rising bond market and gains from near term economic growth.

As I understand it, companies with valuations that are more heavily dependent on far future earnings will be most sensitive to interest rate hikes. That's because future cash flows have to be discounted more aggressively in an environment of rising Fed rates since it becomes more expensive to borrow money to make it to the horizon of profitability. So investors might be enticed away from growth stocks and into value stocks and increasingly profitable ""risk-free"" Treasuries.

So the big question is which stocks will be most sensitive to a rising bond market? Are there technical indicators you can use to determine a stock's sensitivity to a rising bond market? High P/E would seem suspect, for example...

The options greek ""Rho"" measures the price change for an option relative to the risk-free rate of interest... Is there something similar for stocks? That would be a freebie.

And of those sensitive-to-rising-bond-market stocks, which ones stand to benefit the least from a booming economy? That gives us our trim list.

I know I'm probably making this too simplistic. Would love to hear if anyone else is concerned about the prospect of a rising bond market and what you're doing about it.",finance

stocks,Sharp rise in yield driven by short tedemand-supply imbalance.,"The sharp rise in yield is due to significant expansion in scale of treasury auction while the market has not been able to adjust and keep pace. It’s a classic issue of short term surge in supply while demand is not able to expand at such quick pace. But there is a simple solution that has proven to work. 

The Fed can relax the calculation on bank’s required capital holding  (last utilized in April last year). The issue with the swing in yield is also largely driven by the fact that the scale of the auction has skyrocketed while the trading market itself has not kept pace. But the banks who buys these treasuries must hold them on the book, thus add to their required capital holding. In order for the bank to comply, they either have to increase capital holding or must unload these holdings from the books. This causes the banks to be forced to sell these bonds by increasing yield to avoid having to raise capital holding. So an easy fix would be for banks to be allowed to exclude these treasuries when calculating required capital. I mean, comparing to any other assets, these treasury holdings are about as safe as it gets. This way the bank does not have the pressure to unload these treasuries quickly thus helping to ease the pressure from the short term supply surge. 

I do think that if the yield continues to rise due to poor auction result, the fed will not act directly to intervene and will instead just reenact the temporary rule change on capital holding requirement. I think the fed has incentive to actually keep the yield in check, because it directly affects two things, stock market and housing which are both the largest wealth generator, retirement funding and household expense for most Americans.",finance

personalfinance,"Should I refinance my $29,000 student loans now when the rates may be better?","Hi everyone!

28 and trying to take a good look at my finances.

I currently have around $29,000 in student loan debt at 6.8% interest.

Option A: Refinance the full $29,000 at 3.33% fixed APR. $535/month for five years (which is a payment I'm comfortable making). Will pay $2600 total in interest (in contrast, without refinancing I will be paying $1980 a year on a tradition ten year payment plan in interest alone!)

Option B: Refinance $19,000. Keep $10,000 worth of student loans if Biden ever passes the $10,000 federal loan forgiveness.

Obviously federal student loans are at 0% until September. I can't figure out if this refinance rate is a steal I should just be thankful for and run with? Or should I leave $10,000 of loans?

I also am fully aware I'll lose all federal loan benefits with refinancing to a private bank and am fine with that.

personalfinance,Father passed away. Not sure how to make the best of his life insurance windfall.,"Hello, my mother, sister, and I (son) are looking for some advice on what to do with a windfall of $400,000 from the passing of my father on December 31, 2021. The money is not taxed.

We were left with a $290,000 mortgage on our home which is valued at around $600,000.

My father did not have any savings and did have debt which we have not paid at all since it was all in his name. My mother has about $4,000 of debt which we do plan on paying off. I have about $20,000 in student loan debt and my sister has about $20,000 in student loan debt that we do not plan on paying off for quite a while as due to COVID, there are delays in place and the interest rate is not high.

**Our current income:**

**Myself**: $40,000 / year job (First job ever, expecting a $5,000 / year raise in 2 months and the average salary for my role is $70,000 in the US which should come to fruition 6 months - 1 year from now. Job security is very comfortable, family friend is employer.)

**Sister**: $200 / week (Still in college for another year. Had a job that laid her off when COVID started. On unemployment now.)

**Rent**: $1650 / month (2 family home, we rent the upstairs.)

**Expenses:**

Our expenses used to be about $5,500 / month when my father was here. We have significantly reduced our monthly expenses to about $4,000 / month and are still actively reducing where we can. Property taxes are a significant portion ($1,200 / month) from where we live.

**Goal:**

Our current goal or plan is to use the windfall to generate income or growth for the future (10+ years from now).

An idea that we have is:

$60,000 Emergency Fund Savings Account

$340,000 Bond/Stock/Mutual Fund Portfolio (not sure what would be best for us here, we do not expect to need the money for at minimum 5 years. We wish to put it somewhere and forget about it for a long time while in the future also adding to it when we earn more income.)

All of my job's income + my sister's unemployment (and future job) to pay the monthly expenses such as groceries, mortgage, utilities, etc. I already have $25,000 in my checking account which I got from selling items online in video games I saved from over the years.

This really hit us by surprise as my father was a really great guy who was not sick/in bad health at all and was always enthusiastic and cheerful to everyone, even strangers. We miss him very much. Even in his death he took care of us to make sure we were going to be okay by having life insurance. We do not want to squander all he did for us and waste the money. We want to make sure we do it right and use this money as a great head start in life, even if it has to be without him.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, we were never rich financially, but my father made us feel rich with his upbeat personality. We are just kind of lost on how to make sure we don't squander this.",finance
stocks,Options Trading Part V (Delta Hedging Your Portfolio For Market Corrections) - 3/7/2021,"Hello investors,

As we await for another tumultuous week ahead, I wanted to share a strategy with the group to help mitigate some of the risks embedded in our portfolios.

Quick reminder, my goal is to share the things I was taught in hopes to not only help educate others but also to remind myself of those key lessons because I often forget them myself.

I understand many people have started trading this past year and that is exactly why I started this forum. I'd hate to see people lose their hard-earned money but more importantly, give up on the game without learning anything.

Two parts to this memo: market thoughts and hedging strategy.

**1) My view on the markets right now.**

Like I mentioned in this memo, this correction is more concerning than the ones we've experienced recently, specifically the September 2020 selloff. It's because of the inflation expectations, rising yields, and Fed's complacency on letting the long-end rates soar, all of which together triggered MOVE index to tick higher. (MOVE index is the interest rate volatility index, similar to the VIX index for stocks)

📷

Not only higher volatility but also a steeper yield curve.

📷

What I also talked about in the memo is that I am not as worried about this correction because of the following reasons.

\- Liquidity in the markets is strong.

\- Fed has been constantly emphasizing its continued support to the proper functioning of the markets.

\- Fiscal spending is not going away.

\- Expected economic recovery

Given the limited data resources, this is the best of what I could find from CapIQ to assess the short-term lending conditions.

📷

Also from what I found on other sources, it seems that the short-term borrowing rates are holding steady, most likely because of the expected cash dump by the Treasury (see the memo for what I'm referring to) and Fed's short-term Treasury purchases.

Not only the liquidity but the Fed and fiscal spending have been the primary drivers of the markets in the past few months, neither of which is going away anytime soon.

Lastly, the expected economic recovery given the vaccine rollout and pent-up demand will likely support the markets for an upward bounce.

Below chart shows the market sentiment as to how bearish the market participants are. It seems to me it's getting more attractive to buy into the markets because the higher the ratio, more bearish the sentiment is.

📷

Ideally, I would want to get charts for FRA-OIS 3 month spread (up to date, most are available as of 2/26), commercial paper spread, and S&amp;P 500 put-call ratio. But what I have right now seems to be sufficient enough to know that we are not headed for a severe market malfunctioning.

C**ombining all of those, I think it's more likely that we are going to see a deeper correction given the technical indicators but I have a very low conviction on this call and we can never time the bottom so my guess is just as good as yours. I do, however, have a higher conviction that we'll see a market recovery and it's wise to slowly buy into dip.** The best way to behave in a correction is to continue to monitor individual names and determine if they're cheap enough to buy or not.

**2) How to hedge yourself**

I should probably have posted this way before to prepare people for a correction like this and my apologies for it.

I will tell you how I try to hedge myself and this is something that works for me but it may not work for others because everyone's risk tolerance is different. Please keep that in mind when you are reading this.

Here's what I typically do. Please realize that this is a rough outline of what I do and by no means everyone should follow these steps.

📷

After a correction of more than 10%, I start buying into the selloff more aggressively. I may be trying to catch a falling knife but I'm willing to risk losing that money for the potential reward in a market recovery.

When the market breaks the previous high and rises a bit more, I start slowly hedging myself by buying short-term debit put spreads.

Here are instances where I bought the hedges.

📷

As you can see, my timing is terrible. I began buying the hedges more than 2 months before the actual corrections happened. As a result, I lost a substantial amount of money through hedges.

Specifically, this is the type of put spread I buy.

Long leg

Expiration: 2 months

Strike price: 5-10% lower than the current underlying

Short leg:

Expiration: 2 months

Strike price: 10-15% lower than the current underlying

The idea you are trying to express through the combo of these two legs is that I expect the markets to correct anywhere between 10-15% in the next two months.

If the market corrects more than 10%, I gain on the long. If the market corrects less than 15%, I gain on the short.

The reason why I like this spread more than outright naked puts, straddles, or covered calls is that it requires low capital, you can express your view on the markets better, and it is simpler than other strategies.

**I am no expert in options and I would like to keep things as simple and as easy to understand as possible.**

If you were to execute the said hedging strategy today, here's what I would buy. In fact, I bought this spread on 3/1 when QQQ was $320 and I still have it. I only bought it for no other reason than simply following the 5 steps outlined above.

📷

Long leg: 5/21/2021P $280 $7.67 ask price

Short leg: 5/21/2021P $260 $4.33 bid price

The net premium that I have to put up is $3.26.

It's cheaper than paying $7.67 to buy put option but still protects me just as much when QQQ drops.

This is the performance profile showing what happens today if QQQ moves +/- 10% today or by the expiration date (May 21st), from Interactive Brokers platform.

📷

You can see that if QQQ drops 5% today, I get $184.20 in gains and 10% drop gives me $420.24.

If QQQ is down by 10% by 4/7/2021 instead, a month later, then you gain $385.37 on this spread.

📷

Lastly, we gain $1666 if QQQ is down to $260 by the expiration date 5/21/2021 or lose the entire premium ($334, different from the above mentioned net premium because of mid-price convention) if QQQ is above $280.

📷

The scenarios sound pretty attractive to me. If I expected QQQ to drop from $300 today to $260 today (more than 10% correction), then this spread does a good job hedging. If QQQ closes above $280 (7% drawdown), I only lose $334.

**Now we know which spread to buy but how much should we buy?** The answer depends on how much of the portfolio you want to hedge.

There is a concept called a delta-neutral portfolio. This simply means that if you have a $100k in stocks, you have just as much in options that will offset any gains or losses, thus delta-neutralizing the portfolio.

For instance, look at the long leg we talked about before. 5/21/2021P $280.

📷

We can easily calculate what the ""Delta Dollar"" is for this put option.

You have a delta of -0.238, or -23.8%, and the underlying (QQQ) is $309.

$309 x -23.8% x 100 = -$7,354

Underlying price x delta x multiplier = delta dollar

In plain English, this means that buying the put option is equivalent to shorting $7,354 of QQQ.

So if you have $7,354 in QQQ, this put will make your portfolio delta-neutral. $7,354 in QQQ - $7,354 in put option = 0.

A 1% decline in QQQ will increase your put value by $73.5 (1% of the delta dollar) but will decrease your QQQ shares by $73.5 so it evens out.

As you can see, you gain $82.6 on your put option if QQQ declines by 1%, slightly different than the $73.5 we calculated because delta actually changes as the price of the underlying moves, which is a result of gamma but we won't get into that here and I will cover it in the later series.

📷

**The point is that buy as many spreads as you would like to delta neutralize your portfolio.**

If you are more bullish and only want to delta hedge only 50% of your portfolio, then you would buy enough number of spreads so that the total delta dollar equals 50% of your portfolio.

The good thing is that in most brokerages, there is a column called ""Delta Dollar"" that will calculate it for you, like the one below.

📷

This is not the longer one but the shorter QQQ put spread that I have and as you can see, it hedges $105,575 in dollar terms.

Please note the delta dollar changes every day based on the underlying price moves so if you are buying this spread, you have to frequently monitor the movements to make sure you are properly hedged.

**Summary**

Which leads me to my last point about hedging yourself.

I am a proponent of spending as little time as possible monitoring the markets because I would rather spend time understanding new companies, doing research, or learning some new trading strategy.

If you are buying short-term spreads, by definition you have to spend more time on trading so please keep that in mind.

The point of today's memo was to reiterate my thoughts on the markets and how to hedge yourself in tumultuous times like this.

personalfinance,(WA) simple Tax question,"Hello everyone!

Just getting around to filing my taxes and I have what I believe to be a quick/simple question.

I earned roughly $35,000 in 2020 and paid around $5,600 in federal income taxes. I usually earn about $2000/wk but unfortunately I only worked about 18/19 weeks in the year 2020 (I am backto working now fortunately) 

Because of this I was due back $3,000.

While I was off work I obviously collected unemployment.

My unemployment income was $36,623 and I had my federal income tax withheld (10%), which equaled about $3,666 being withheld.

When I entered this unemployment information into turbo tax, it immediately took that $3,000 I was due back and turned it into $300.

My question is, how come since I am withholding 10% of my unemployment income for federal tax, it wants me to pay an additional 13%?

This same exact thing happend last year, but since I was only collecting unemployment for a few weeks I didnt think twice about them withdrawing an additional $300",finance
MachineLearning,[D] Practical implementation of federated learning - example Google keyboard,"Hello,

From my understanding, new training data is generated typically during the day, and a subset of the devices is selected by the server, which then train and communicate with the server during the night.

Open points in my understanding which I would like to discuss with you are now as follows:

1. When my phone trains the network, does it only train with today's data (day n)? Or also with data from day n-1, n-2, ...? If so, until when? Even with data from day 1? I would assume it only trains with data from day n, otherwise, data instances from early dates have had a far higher influence on the ML model than recent data. Am I correct?
2. The phones train several epochs locally, then send their model updates to the server, which aggregates the model updates and sends the aggregated model back to the phones. Is this process repeated multiple times during a night, or only one time? Initially I thought it would be repeated only one time, however, [this paper talking about synchronous learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02849.pdf) made me think that it could be repeated multiple times. In the practical example, how many rounds does a phone typically participate in during a night? 1, 2, 3, more?
3. Once my phone received the aggregated model, does it personalize the model? Meaning does it train again a couple of epochs with my local data? In the practical use case, I use certain words (e.g., my name) frequently and the keyboard indeed suggests my name when appropriate

Normally -3% is the floor but things became worse very quickly. With Repo frozen it will limit banks from lending crushing the economy and you know the Fed’s answer, money printer go brrrrr.

personalfinance,How to calculate the interest rate from a car lease contract,"https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/boardacts/1997/19970327/forms.pdf  

The above is a standard car lease agreement form. When you lease a car, this is the form you will sign. Unfortunately, the form itself doesn't disclose the interest rate/APR/money factor. But I'll show you how to calculate the interest rate and compare against money factor/APR using the example from https://www.edmunds.com/car-leasing/calculate-your-own-lease-payment.html

If we fill out the above contract form using edmunds example, here are the values for page 1 middle section (the key part):  
Gross capitalized cost = $22,200   
Capitalized cost reduction = 2,200   
Adjusted Capitalized Cost = $22,200 - $2,200 = **$20,000**  
Residual Value = **$13,110**  
Depreciation and any Amortized Amounts = $20,000 - $13,110 = $6,890    
Rent Charge = $1,490.04  
Total of Base Monthly Payments = $6,890 + $1,490.04 = $8,380.04  
Lease Payments = **36** months  
Base Monthly Payment = **$232.78**  
Monthly Sales/Use Tax = $23.86  
Total Monthly Payment = $232.78 + $23.86 = $256.64    

This means you are borrowing $20k today to purchase the car. For 36 months, you will pay $232.78/month in advance. After 36 months, your loan balance is $13,110. If you pay this balance, the car will be yours, Instead, if you return the car, the lease will expire. To calculate the interest rate, we can use =RATE() in Excel using the 4 bold numbers.

      = RATE(36, -232.78, 20000, -13110, 1) * 12 = 3.015%  

Note that this interest rate is slightly different from APR implied by the money factor. Edmunds used 0.00125 money factor, multiplied by 2400, we get 3.000% APR (slightly smaller than 3.015%). 

The money factor nor APR is not disclosed in the contract, either. From the contract, you can infer the money factor by ($1,490.04/36 pmts) / ($20,000 + $13,110)  = 0.00125. And APR = money factor * 2400 = 3.000%.",finance
personalfinance,Calculating current effective tax rate and swagging future income needs/rates.,"Been thinking about what my current rate is versus retirement rates, since everyone says ""Oh invest in a 401k and you'll get to pay taxes on the lower tax bracket when you retire"".   Well, I'd like to start getting an idea of what that tax rate actually would be to help drive decision making. 

My income is from wages, but my reportable income include RSUs for which my company sells shared to hold 30% taxes.  Stocks a real climber, so those shares sold for tax have cost me real opportunity.  Unfortunately the brokerage said that's set by company policy and I can't pay that tax in cash : (   My EOY stubs reflect those RSUS.   I also have some unintended cap gains and dividends from my funds in my cash accounts. 

When I looked at my 2019 Fed, and divided my total tax owed into my AGI it comes out around .17. 
For my State and Local it's another .07 for a combined effective rate of .24.   Does this seem about right for a high earner ? 

To determine what my future taxes may be (of course legislation can change any of this) I realize I need to know what I'm currently spending. In the past I tried using budgets, Mint etc for this and it was like chasing mice through a barn.   For the last several years I've been saving aggressively pre-take-home via ESOP and a 401k, and we live entirely on the take home to include all of our debt servicing (just a mortgage that's pretty small for my area), operational expensive, vacation, topping off the tax payments and any additional saving.   We've been living this way for a couple of years now just fine, even with some advanced out of pocket medical (the big C and *all* the associated long term costs), but at the same time without extreme amounts of left overs.  This is in stark contrast to the past where I had significantly more take-home, but was doing more saving from the take-home.  I feel like now my actual post-tax, post-everything take-home is a pretty good representation of what we spend.   For clarity, I'm saving over 35 a year in the ESOP plus a maxed 401, so I am genuinely saving hard.

So to calculate this, instead of using my pay stubs I was thinking of using my actual EOY direct deposit slip, since that's our take home and our actual expenditures.  This would not include the RSUs or the 401k for example, neither of which I would have in retirement.  I WILL have plenty of medical insurance expenses though, so I would take that number from my EOY pay stuff, and add it into (at 2x) my EOY take home.   This should give me what we're spending now (with older and expensive kids in the house, mind you, so like definitely the highest cost of groceries, eating out, fuel consumption vehicle insurance, vacation etc) plus what I'll need for med insurance in the future.   

I can do this for say 2-3 years worth to get a decent average, and then just run them through the published brackets to get an idea of what my post-retirement effective tax rate would be.  

Does this seem logical ?  Anyone seen any better models for this ? I'm sure they are out there.  Thank you !",finance

personalfinance,I don't know how to make my money grow,"Hello,

I need help making a plan. I've gotten so much varying and (and some bad) advice and I'm hoping that somebody can help me come up with plan to handle my money better. I earn a decent salary but can't seem to save much or make my money grow. Here are my details:

\-27 years old  
\-annual salary $72,000, about $3200/pay period  
\-$15,000 in bank account  
\-5% employer-matched into 401k, recently upped to 11%  


Major expenses:  
$1300 rent for studio apartment (I live in an expensive city)  
$500 per month for student loans (tempoarily on hold) on $50,000 worth of federal student loans  
\~$500 for food/utilities/etc. 

Here are my questions:

\-Am I saving enough? I got the studio apartment mainly out of covid concerns, and am open to a roommate or two in the future  
\-What should I be saving for? Is an apartment/house (in the distant future) the best investment, or should I be putting money into stocks? Or something else? I have no guidance here and don't know where to start.  
\-My main concern right now is handling my student loan debt. I currently have a 7% interest rate and am on year 2 of the PSLF. Should I stick with that or refinance?

stocks,The reasons I believe that’s causing the recent market corrections,"While the media has drew a clear linkage between recent yield spikes (particularly on the 10 yr) and inflationary worries to the corrections in growth stocks - I believe the true reason that the market has been spooked is because the perceived transition from a Fed-based market (back into) an economy-based market.

As market participants are betting on the end of Covid pandemic is near, one realization is that the Fed will gradually decelerate QE and eventually stop “babysitting” the market. Recent yield 10 Yr spikes and comments made by JPowell could have been seen as evidence to back up this expectation. 

In short, since the start of the pandemic, the Fed has encouraged cheap lending and borrowing via purchasing long term securities such as the 10yr vía open market which artificially increased bond prices thus suppressing yield; the unprofitability of long term assets has then led a big influx into more liquid assets such as cash (known commonly as “liquidity traps” to increase money supply). 

Given the subsequent abundance of liquidity, risky assets, especially those of more speculative nature such as growth stocks then saw very strong momentum during these cheap money environments
since participants are now fully “risk-on”.

However, with vaccines becoming widely available and an economic re-opening appears to be imminent, market participants are sensing that perhaps soon, QE will decelerate as Fed let go of the leash. Evidently, recently bonds sell offs which led yields to spike at a worrisome pace led participants to further believe Fed is ready to “let go” and eventually preparing for transition back into an economy-based market. 

Given the above, I think the above will at least partly justify why some of the richly valued growth stocks have been selling off; while re-opening stocks outperformed. I think at this points, perhaps hints of YCC can quickly stop the tech hemorrhage; otherwise the market will continue to remain volatile until an equilibrium is found. 

Please let me know your thoughts! 

TLDR: 1) the recent correction of growth stocks is likely due to the uncertainties faced by participants caught in midst of a transition from a Fed-based market back into an economy-based market. 
2) The perceived ending of “liquidity traps” (rather than purely inflationary worries) is the true culprit behind the market sell offs IMO.",finance
ethereum,Ethereum to become a deflationary asset? EIP-1559,"Can anybody provide more insight on this being potentially true? Trying to get a better understanding of EIP-1559. 

Link here for GitHub page: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md

The page called this out at the end that got me thinking about the potential for ETH to be deflationary in the long run:

ETH Burn Precludes Fixed Supply

By burning the base fee, we can no longer guarantee a fixed token supply. This could result in economic instability as the long term supply of ETH will no longer be constant over time. While a valid concern, it is difficult to quantify how much of an impact this will have. If more is burned on base fee than is generated in mining rewards then ETH will be deflationary and if more is generated in mining rewards than is burned then ETH will be inflationary. Since we cannot control user demand for block space, we cannot assert at the moment whether ETH will end up inflationary or deflationary, so this change causes the core developers to lose some control over Ethereum's long term monetary policy.

stocks,Why I’m long on Hyliion $HYLN,"We’ve all heard the news. 

“Amazon orders more than 1000 natural gas powered engines...” What’s their play here? Why natural gas when it doesn’t meet zero emissions? 

Simply put, the answer is renewable natural gas (RNG). If you read the news from major fleet operators the past two years, they are ALL relying on RNG and making major commitments to RNG, at least for the next decade. Amazon, for one, is well aware that the nat gas engines can utilize RNG. This strategically puts them in a position to meet zero emission standards. UPS has made HUGE commitments to RNG going as far as purchasing large supplies of RNG with commitments up to 2026. FedEx as well. Anheuser-Busch with Agility... list goes on. Theme here for major fleet operators is RNG. Existing natural gas infrastructure is there unlike electric infrastructure. The only question in the future is can supply meet increased demand? 

What is the advantage of Hyliion’s primary product Hypertruck ERX set to debut this year? Electrification powered by RNG! This means more miles than conventional nat gas RNG trucks AND less demand on RNG = cost savings aka the perfect solution. I think with this understanding of current environment, we can expect to hear some major announcements and deals in the future with ERX.

Basically, the ERX is the logical next step for Amazon and UPS. As they are already heavily investing in RNG, the Hyper truck ERX is a no brainer (once it’s out).",finance
personalfinance,Getting out of an insane interest rate on a car loan.,"I am currently paying out the ass in interest on my SUV.

There’s a few reasons for this that I could get in to but ultimately they’re not important when I’m paying so fucking much extra.

1. What are my options for lowering the interest rate?

2. If I sold the car and got into something smaller and cheaper temporarily, what would be the best way to do that? I know even if I sell the car I still have the loan but would this mean selling it privately and dumping the cash I get on the loan directly? Or trading it in at a dealership?

\-------------------

Sorry, this started out as one thing and I just had fun with it. Ownership has always been subjective reality, NFT's are simply a digital analog of that and proofed on a blockchain. Just because you're able to access the content they represent \*now\*, doesn't mean you will be in the future and doesn't make NFT's valueless. Digital rights systems are -absolutely- down the pipe (and are frankly a more honest implementation of Digital Rights Management Systems that have tried to be implemented in the past). So instead of ""men in uniforms with guns"" to enforce these access/rights, we'll simply have federated protocols and buy-in from the ""friends of friends"" to enforce them because this subjective thing we call ownership provides value back to them with our current model.

**tl;dr - If you're having a hard time understanding NFT's, it's because ownership is just another strange, subjective human construct ... that's not really real... until the lack of access to a thing objectively is.**",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Can you use refunded money from one student loan to pay off an earlier student loan?,"Hi everybody,

I have some extra money left over in my college billing account this year because of reduced room and board/meal plan fees and I was wondering:

I have loans from this year that I ended up not needing. I was considering refunding these loans, but then I realized that my loan from last year has a higher interest rate than my loans from this year. Is it unethical/illegal to use the refund from my newer loans to pay off the earlier loan? Or should I just refund the newer loans and worry about the earlier loan normally?

If it's not illegal, it would make more sense for me to pay off the earlier loan because of the higher interest rate + it has a slightly larger principal amount, but I imagine it's a bit sketchy territory.

&gt; # 1. Nasdaq set for sharp drop after Friday’s comeback

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Monday, with a sharp drop in the Nasdaq and tech names indicated to start the new week after Friday’s big turnaround. Tesla shed another 2% in the premarket after closing Friday below $600 per share for the first time since early December. The stock has lost a third of its value since its all-time intraday high in late January.

&gt; * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday all broke three-session losing streaks, with strong advances. For the week, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 gained 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. However, the Nasdaq dropped 2% last week. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were up nearly 3% and 2.3%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. The Nasdaq was just above breakeven ahead of Monday’s open.

&gt; # 2. Treasury yields rise after Senate Covid relief bill passage

&gt; * Senate passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill Saturday wasn’t enough to put stocks in the green Monday as more economic stimulus on top of an already recovering economy continued to stoke inflation concerns. That’s pushing bond yields higher Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yield trading around 1.6%, shy of Friday’s one-year high. The 10-year yield has risen rapidly since the end of January, adding more than 0.5% in a little over a month.

&gt; # 3. Biden says direct payments of up to $1,400 going out soon

&gt; * The Democratic-held House aims to pass the Senate-approved Covid stimulus package on Tuesday and then send it President Joe Biden for his signature. The bill approved in the Senate on Saturday comes with a smaller, compromise federal unemployment benefits boost and without a federal minimum wage increase. The legislation includes direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans, which Biden said Saturday could start going out within two weeks.

&gt; # 4. Stocks to watch: Disney, Comcast, GameStop, GE

&gt; * Shares of Disney rose more than 1% in Monday’s premarket trading after California officials on Friday cleared theme parks to open at reduced capacity on April 1. They closed nearly a year ago due to the pandemic. The order includes Disneyland in the southern part of the state, Comcast’s Universal Studios Hollywood and others. Disney World in Florida and Universal Studios Orlando opened with capacity limits over the summer. Shares of Comcast, parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC, fell in the premarket.

&gt; * Shares of GameStop surged about 12% in Monday’s premarket after Bloomberg reported that the company tapped board member Ryan Cohen to guide the video game retailer’s transition to an e-commerce business. Cohen, a major GameStop investor and founder of online pet retailer Chewy, will lead a board task force on digital changes.

&gt; * General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland’s AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world’s biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about 2.5% in Monday’s premarket.

&gt; # 5. Oil prices rise after Saudi Arabia facilities attacked

&gt; * Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose above $70 per barrel Monday for the first time in more than a year. The surge came after Saudi Arabia said Sunday that its Saudi Aramco facilities were targeted by missiles and drones. Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement claimed responsibility for the attack. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, also moved higher, trading above $66 at nearly a two-year high.

Separately, Disney’s “Raya and the Last Dragon” topped the weekend box office with $8.6 million in ticket sales, though that opening was muted after movie theater chain Cinemark (CNK) declined to show the film. Disney rose 1.5% premarket.

personalfinance,Derogatory Accounts vs Student Loans,"Hi r/personalfinance! I looked for these topics in the wiki but couldn't find answers, so apologies if its redundant.

I'm 27. I just paid off all my active credit card debt and my credit score improved from 486 to 561. My remaining debts are derogatory (old credit cards and medical debt) and federal student loans. I'm in a fully funded PhD program, so those are deferred until 2025-ish. However, I owe about $70k in student loans--all federal, no private.

I know derogatory accounts drop off after 7 years, but internet info on how to handle them is confusing. I believe they are not collecting interest. Here are the debts:

7 months old: $181, collection/chargeoff

9 months old: $528, collection/chargeoff

16 months old: $1002 collection/chargeoff

4 years old: $0 (fully paid down but not dropped from account yet)

I make about $31k a year. So does my partner but she's got a lot of debt herself. However, her credit score is in the high 600s. In about 5 years, we're hoping to start a family, so we want to improve our credit by then.

Thank you! I hope this post is appropriate.

edit: realized I forgot to include my rough expenses. I'll just include mine since my partner and I split finances evenly:

Rent: $700, utilities included, food: $200-ish, Books for school and research: $50ish, leisure/takeout/etc: $75ish but will likely increase after pandemic. After pandemic, about $150 a month for commute",finance

Bitcoin,HODLing funds with BlockFi during a bull market results in overpaying on taxes? (UK Tax-payer),"To anyone who understands this better than I do, please tell me if I'm wrong here, I really want to be.

I was looking at transferring part of my stack to BlockFi for the nice interest rates so I could stack more SATs, I don't plan to sell Bitcoin at all in this bull market, altcoins yes. My overall plan was to just let it sit there compounding until the next Bull market in 5-6 years from now.

Here's the part I'm having trouble with, why would I do that now, in a bull market? The tax I would need to pay on the interest would be ruinous. BlockFi use an example of how taxes work on the interest they pay you saying something like: 'Michael gets 0.05 BTC paid in interest valued at £200', that counts as a gain of £200 that you would have to pay income taxes on, stating that because the 0.05 BTC was worth £200 at the time of receipt you owe taxes on that £200.

That's all well and fine, but in a bull market like this one, where lets imagine top is £300k, the interest accrued could be as high as £1500 per month. Very nice, and assuming it takes 6-7 months to get to that valuation and you could have \~£2000+ profit from the interest that you must pay tax on, at 20% that's £400 in taxes you must pay.

Now lets say, history repeats itself like it has done 3 times in the past and bitcoin crashes to £50k, that 0.05 BTC you earned is no longer worth £15,000 but £2500. And because the taxes you pay are calculated on the fair market price of when you received that BTC, it seems to me you overpay on the worth of your BTC after the crash by 6-fold.

Please can someone tell me how wrong I am and that its still a good idea to put my BTC in BlockFi? Thanks.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"did a deep dive into family spending, thoughts, concerns..","Doing a deep dive into my family's spending habits.

We're a suburban family of 4, married, in our 40's, two pre-teen kids and two dogs.. total take home pay after taxes is $135k.

No debt other than the mortgage, both vehicles we own outright and still have several years of life left, so we are definitely keeping more than we make and saving, which is great, but I feel like not as aggressive as we could or should be.  So I categorized what I'll call ""discretionary"" expense for the year 2020.  Everything from random kids stuff, auto maintenance, home/garden, restaurants, pets, hair/beauty, pharmacy, groceries, clothes, booze, ""misc. household stuff"", travel, gifts and subscription services.

I was shocked to learn this comprised nearly 58% of our total take home pay. Even more shocked to see that of that,  ""grocery stores and warehouse clubs (i.e. Costco)"" was 26% of that!  \~$20k a year for groceries and all the misc. household stuff one gets at those big box club stores.  Is this normal for your average middle-class suburban family of 4? The bar on my graph for this category was nearly 3x bigger than anything else. 

The ""non discretionary"" (fixed) expenses (i.e. mortgage, taxes, insurance (auto/home/life/disability), utilities, gas, comprises 19% of our take home pay which means we're saving \~23% of our take-home pay (on top of pre-tax qualified contributions)

So while I'm glad it seems we're ""doing fine"" it seems crazy to me that we can spend so much on just managing a household..",finance
personalfinance,Don't discount car insurance quotes for long-term savings.,"I was having a discussion with a coworker and this led me to dig around in my Mint budgeting app to see what I was paying with my previous car insurance company..  

Details: Car in reference is a 2015 VW GTI that is fully paid, no tickets for 7+ years minimum and no at fault accidents ever in my 25+yrs of driving.  Not married, not a home owner.. 

I was previously with Progressive and had performed the snapshot program to the tune of a 17% discount and if memory serves me correctly these were with $2,000 deductibles for full coverage.  My records only go back to 2016 but with all discounts I could obtain these were my 6 month payment amounts.

$377

$419

$461

$497

By the last one I had caught on that something was amiss and I called Progressive asking them why my car continues to age and lower in value, my record is clean yet my rates continue to go up.  They fed me some lines about market pricing etc which I couldn't be bothered to buy into and immediately went insurance shopping.  

Switching to Geico I actually dropped my deductibles to $1k for collission and $250 for other bc the fee differences were nominal and these are the results I have on record.

$344

$291

$288

$275

$235 (Covid discount)

$275 (my upcoming payment)

A lot of people tend to forget about this as another option to tighten their budget or just don't believe it to be worth the effort but to me this is a fairly serious price difference that is 100% worth the effort to shop around and buy what actually works for you.",finance
personalfinance,Best Choice for Saving Money,"Hi All,
I have a question about deciding what to do in regards to saving money and hoping to get some different perspective. 

I currently have a little over $900 in a high yield savings account, the pandemic wiped my savings (not much to start with, like $3000) and I’ve just built this back up. I’m just recently able to save again monthly, I put $150 away each month, a little more here and there when I can. 

I also currently pay on a personal loan from PNC that has a remaining balance of $1600 and an interest rate of 11.74%. With this next stimulus check (assuming we’ll get it and get the $1400) since I’m financially stable now, I was planning to put the whole thing into my savings but now I’m considering if it would be better to put the $1400 towards the personal loan, pay the remaining $200, and then start putting the $155 I pay each month towards the loan into my savings instead. 

Using 10 months as a benchmark (because I have to move in 10 months so I need savings for that), I would have $1550 vs the $1400. So it is more and is technically “growing” because I’ll be adding to it each month. But I am so incredibly terrified of not having the liquid cash of the $1400 off the bat, especially after this year where I had to rely on savings to deal with unemployment, rising costs of living, my car getting totaled, etc. 

I feel like paying the loan off is the better choice but I am just so scared, so any other perspective or advice would be highly appreciated. 

Thank you!!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Most used abbreviations in the cryptospace (newby guide version 1.1),"*This is version 1.1 wich included the top 25 coins explained in two sentences. If you want anything added to this list comment and i will update it! :)* 

As we welcome newcomers everyday to this sub it's nice to have a all you need to know abbreviations guide to get them started. When i first started reading up things (because **DYOR**) i came across terms i've never heard of. So here are some of the most common abbreviations you will come across while doing research about cryptos. In this list you can also find the top 25 crypto as of **8 march 2021** wich are explained in mostly 2 - 3 sentences. 

I hope this list can help new people coming in and maybe help some people that are just lost in all the jargon people use.  I've put sections in the list to also help make the list easier to read. Maybe i missed some, so if anyone want anything added, comment and i will update it! 

**Top 25 cryptocurrencies explained in 2 senctences:**

 

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain trying to improve scalability, interoperability, and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
7. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
8. **Uniswap (UNI):** Another DeFi like Aave, but this time it’s an exchange like Binance, just decentralized.

DISCLAIMER: i’m new to this channel and neither a financial advisor nor an expert. 

the following is just intended to explain my intuition about what has been happening in markets over the past weeks and why many people are seeing red. 

—

# 1 : the value of companies

whoever values a company professionally, usually applies a discounted cash flow (DCF) calculation. it's not the only method to find the actual value, but by far the most common one used by analysts. the idea here is that a company has the value of the sum of all its future cash flows. this is a solid assumption, because in the end cash flows are what determines whether the company is successful in the long-term and how much money it can distribute to its investors. so the two basic questions are: how high will these cash flows be and what value do they have currently?

# 2 : the time value of money

now let's say a company will make 1bn in cash next year. that amount is not actually its current value. if i had the money now, i can invest it and gain interest in that one year. an important tool joins the party now: the risk-free rate. this is, usually, the interest rate on certain short-term government bills or bonds. they are risk-less, because in theory states cannot default. now, if i had the 1bn right now, i could make 1.5% return with it during the year, without any real risk. therefore, in one year from now, this 1bn only amounts to 985 million in todays money (you just divide by 1 + interest rate to the power of years). basically money loses value if you have to wait for it, because you have to miss out on the opportunities of doing something profitable with that money until then. 

# 3 : discounting

the process of deriving the current (usually lower) value of future cash flows is called discounting. you discount the future cash flows to their present value. this is where the DCF got its name. many applications use the risk-free rate as discounting rate, in stock valuations however, a common rate is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). the WACC is a weighted combination of a companies financing costs from the two main sources: debt and equity. debt financing are things like bonds and credit and their main cost is the interest they carry. equity financing is usually the emission of stocks and the cost of equity is whatever yield investors may demand, given the risk of the investment. the WACC incorporates both debt and equity costs based on the firms capital structure. 

# 4 : forecasting cash flows 

let's get back to our DCF from the first point. you would generally model the specific cash flows of a company for about 5 years and then add in something called ""terminal value"" for everything that comes after that. it is unrealistic that any forecast after 5 years is still accurate, so you just assume a company's last cash flow will grow with a certain rate (e.g. 2% like the global economy - at least long-term) and then calculate the total final value of said company, assuming it will exist forever. let's stick with the 1bn example: assuming this is the last year modeled and we assume 2% growth and a WACC of 1.5%. then, all future cash flows amount to 51 billion. this is called gordon-growth-model: just calculate the next cash flow after the last one with your growth rate and then divide it by the discount rate minus the growth rate: (1bn * 1.02) / (0.04 - 0.02). usually most of the companies value comes from this ""infinite horizon cash flow"" and the value is highly sensitive to both the discounting rate and the assumed growth rate. these future growth and interest rates are precisely what commentators mean when they say ""expectations are already priced in"" and it is one of the reasons why it is hard to beat the pros at their game. 

# 5 : inflation

of course, an interest rate of 1.5% is not getting you any real return if inflation is just as high: the money is being devalued per unit at the same speed as the units of money grow. this is why real interest rates must incorporate for inflation. the fisher equation shows this relationship: real interest rates are equal to the nominal interest rate minus inflation. if we stick with 1.5% interest and have an inflation of 0.5%, then the real interest rate is 1%. 

# 6 : what is happening right now?

central banks all over the world are pouring money into the markets and governments are using the chance of low interest rates to finance large fiscal stimuli in order to stabilise covid-hit economies. this new money supply creates inflation and the interest rates on bonds must compensate for it. higher expectations of inflation are therefore priced into the yields of such bonds. these higher interest rates however mean that all current valuations must be adapted for the new discount rate: we must now discount all future earnings with a higher rate and will end up with a lower present value of the firm. 

# 7 : where will it end ?

nobody knows - honestly. but valuations have gotten pretty excessive. i dont want to blame SPACs or robinhood, but they are definitely part of it. there are just too many companies with sky-high valuations that have not even made revenue or generated real income. these growth stocks have all of their value stuck in those projected future cash flows and they are not only getting discounted. investors are probably (and hopefully) also reevaluating whether growth expectations are somehow realistic or whether the valuation is not justified. lastly, debt financing costs of these companies (which often have no cash to pay for projects) also increase and lead to a higher WACC. if you are looking for a hedge against higher interest rates, financials are the place to be: their business model is to lend money at a rate higher than they borrow it for.

Trading,USD AND BOND YIELD RALLY WEAKENS THE APPEAL FOR GOLD,"Another week of losses for the (not so) precious metal, which is on course to post a 2% drop at the time of writing. The move is largely in line with the seasonally weak pattern for Gold. Alongside this, as we highlighted last week, the relentless rise in global bond yields and the recent surge in the USD has reduced the appeal for holding gold. Reminder, real yields have been the main determinant for the moves in gold, therefore as real yields continue to rise with the Fed showing little concerns regarding the rise, risks remain tilted to the downside.",finance
personalfinance,Roll closing costs into home loan?,"So we're having a house built that will be ready in about 2 months. Our closing costs will be around $10,000 and as of right now we are being quoted an APR of 2.2% (VA loan, 50% VA disabled, average of 803 credit score).

Here is the thing, it would be REALLY nice if we could use that $10,000 towards other stuff we would like. I'm thinking about rolling the closing costs into the cost of the loan, it would increase the total cost from $310k to $320k and would be an extra $4.5k interest over the course of the 30 year loan. Just hearing those facts alone, I think I'm crazy even thinking about... almost 50% interest.

Here is where I'm confused. The Fed tries to keep inflation at 2% each year, so each year I'd be paying the loan with money that is worth more and more. That $4.5k interest would be a lot less in todays numbers and might actually worth doing. I also have the thought that people have been rolling closing costs into their home loan for decades at much higher interest rates... so if there was \*ever\* a time to roll costs, it would be now with the lower rate.

personalfinance,Investing Cash for Kids and HSA Investment,"I know there's a ton of information on investing, but my question is a bit different than investing for retirement.  We have two very young children (2 and under) and have decided to start saving for them for when they reach adulthood.  We will contribute half to a higher education savings plan, and half that we can give in cash.  The hope being that we will have options if one or both kids don't decide to pursue higher education, or would prefer/need cash for other goals.  SO...what's the best way we can invest 10k now, that won't be needed for another 16-18 years?  We plan to do more than that as we can, to total around $20k, but around $10k is what we can do now.  The CD interest rate seems really low, especially for that amount and that time frame (the ones we saw only went up to 6 years, I think).  We need something that we can set up and then forget about for several years.  Is a CD really the best way to go, or something else?

&amp;#x200B;

And I know this question has been asked 1000 times, but we're just starting to use our HSA for retirement purposes instead of current medical expenses so we're looking to invest what's in the account now.  Is that type of investment still better through Vanguard, or is Fidelity ok?  Employer has it easily set up for Fidelity but I have a Vanguard account so could make that work, but would rather take the easy route if all things are equal.

My Analysis:

&amp;#x200B;

Historic S&amp;P to BTE:

[Data from St. Luis FED](https://preview.redd.it/fuy3himt1ul61.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0fb6b52347b14db5774548b8844630858d728f1)

As you can see below, for most of the recovery (March through November), the historic tie between S&amp;P and BTC held at 84% of variance explained with a high degree of significance.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vdztzqab4ul61.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a6bc79a81a27e31fc9db94c5fa9ddd369187e17

Diving Deeper, when we analyze the full YTD trend line we see a strange phenomenon, that historic \~84% variance model shifts dramatically in its explained variance. Doubling standard error, and reducing the R2 from 84% to 59%. The vast majority of this happens from November to March.

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC Price to S&amp;P Index](https://preview.redd.it/1pmluaci2ul61.png?width=1529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3af0e1fe5f048d8f5696a2295fb1cf4fda4d349)

https://preview.redd.it/go6v4uob2ul61.png?width=527&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b044dd81e28a42389c7da6f371e70ed90e939ad

Given the historic tie between BTC and S&amp;P, per Coinbase and Forbes, this needs to have a causality. Finding the causality, one needs to look for larger changes in the overall state of the economy and what Bitcoin means as an asset.

The macroeconomic theory Quantity of Money's equation: MV = PY, where M is money supply, V is money velocity (how often a dollar changes hands), P is average price per good, and Y is output (or real GDP) can be rewritten as M= PY/V or money supply equals  PY(Nominal GDP) / Velocity of money.

&amp;#x200B;

Historically, in the short term, prices are sticky; meaning it takes time for average price of goods to reflect a change in the overall money supply. Compounding this, the money supply only affects inflation when velocity increases.

So going back to the quantity of money equation that the Fed uses, MV=PY, the Velocity of money has been depressed by the pandemic (people have been spending less). So we're waiting for post-Corona Inflation, where velocity returns to normal rates, putting all that money back into the economy. Prices in the short term are sticky, meaning that they are resistant to change, and that's where we're headed. Dollars are, in real terms, going to be worth less than previously, and by a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

So how much is a lot?

&amp;#x200B;

That's where you need to take into account what a dollar really is, which is a (mostly) non physical unit of account that, due to our system of fractional banking, can be in many places at once. This idea of a dollar existing in multiple place has a name, and its called the money multiplier. The money multiplier is how much ""digital"" money is out there in proportion to the monetary base (the amount of physical dollars). You get this by dividing the amount of money held in accounts and in reserves (money that banks are required to hold as collateral)

&amp;#x200B;

So for every dollar printed, as of January 2021, 3.45 dollars are added to the money supply. Not that big of a deal if your printing a few dollars. So lets put it in perspective. How much money was printed?

Lets go back to the Fed to find out: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANMM101USA189S#0](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANMM101USA189S#0)

&amp;#x200B;

[&amp;#37; Change in Money Printed by Year\*\*](https://preview.redd.it/4odyxiwpoul61.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b68517abc585b5e212e66a4a9852f2e4652f36a)

OECD, ""Main Economic Indicators - complete database"", Main Economic Indicators (database),[http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/data-00052-en](http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/data-00052-en) (Accessed on 3/8/2021)

&amp;#x200B;

Digging into the data, from 2019 to 2020 you see a 34% jump in the money supply. To state that again, 34% of all money in circulation was printed within the past 12 months.

&amp;#x200B;

To put a number on it, as of January 1st, that was  $1,307,858,333,333.33 that's 1.3 trillion physical dollars, but that's not it. To find the amount of non-physical dollars in the money supply, take that 1.3 trillion and multiply it by the money multiplier. As of January, every physical dollar introduced resulted in a sum of 3.45 physical and non physical dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

So why isnt everything 34% more expensive? The purchasing power of the dollar should be reduced because there's less of it, right? The answer is yes, and no. This is where ""sticky"" short term prices come in. So long as the velocity of money stays below average due to the pandemic, inflation is at bay.

&amp;#x200B;

\- BUT -

&amp;#x200B;

That's temporary at best, macroeconomics show that in the long term, equilibrium will be met. A shift in the Monetary Supply, driven by the FED reducing interest rates for banks (allowing them to borrow for almost free), and purchasing Government bonds (with newly printed money), drives Aggregate demand up.

&amp;#x200B;

[Money Supply and Aggregate Demand](https://preview.redd.it/i46kalijsul61.png?width=418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9497aeac5429d9403dba4a19a75d4310d5bd069)

&amp;#x200B;

Aggregate demand pushes prices up (in the long term), and increased prices (inflation, again long term). Resulting in the rebalance of prices and output to the new equilibrium. 

So here we stand, the Fed has pumped money into the economy through purchasing bonds - increasing the money supply, but rather than spend the money, the average American is saving it. The Money supply = Nominal GDP/ Velocity hasn't caught up to the Fed's influx of cash. When it does, prices will shoot up to match the change in real purchasing power.

&amp;#x200B;

So what does that have to do with Crypto?

&amp;#x200B;

Capped cryptocurrency, unlike the USD, isn't subject to a regulating body that needs to fund itself. There is no loss to road maintenance, no loss to paying civilian employees, no loss to purchasing land, buildings, or warships; its a much more efficient unit of account. More importantly, unlike the USD, creating more crypto costs a exponentially greater amount of resources over time. Its more akin to Gold than it is to the USD.

&amp;#x200B;

People are not willing to buy US bonds due to fears of inflation, driving the bond market to increase the yield to entice people. The former bond holders, out of fear of increased inflation are flocking to alternative assets. Crypto has benefited from this phenomenon and is set to continue to benefit.

Seen here:

We have a bumpy ride ahead, HODL.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR -

The quantity theory states that the rate of money growth is directly proportionate to the rate of inflation. The Fisher Effect states that the rate of inflation is directly proportionate to the nominal interest rate (a .71 R value).  The nominal interest rate is key because historically, bond prices have a negative correlation to nominal interest rates, meaning the higher the interest rate, the lower the bond sales, the lower the bond sales the higher the yield they need to offer.

The bond market is starting to move with Inflation, and rather than keep cash in bonds or USD, a currency that potentially lost 33% of its real value as more was printed, they flocked towards BTC and ETH; rather than slowing down, this pattern may speed up as we see the fed slow to react to inflation by reversing its stimulus policy.

The inflation that everyone is worried about is already happening, institutional investors have already begun switching to BTC over bonds. The real fun will happen when retail switches over en-mass and purchases smaller coins.

CryptoCurrency,How to start the crypto conversation with people who don’t understand crypto,"I see people wondering how to start the crypto conversation with people who don’t understand crypto so I thought I’d share my thoughts. 

In my experience, I’ve started with sharing what makes good monetary value. Specifically being able to be divisible (100 million satoshis in one bitcoin), easily transferable (self explanatory), and controlled supply (21 million no more no less). I also bring up how there’s an estimated 4 million+ lost so it’s actually scarcer than most people realize. 

I also bring up how cryptocurrency is kind of a misnomer. Even bitcoins narrative is changing from a currency to a store of value. Most cryptos aren’t meant to be currencies, but so much more. Essentially like investing in different internet companies, not different currencies. 

I then go into what Ethereum is, being a smart contract platform where people can build dApps. How it is attempting to become the world computer. I talk about some of the projects being built on it from Brave Browser to real cloud storage application and then DeFi. 

And then DeFi. I think right now DeFi is the most promising thing to come out of crypto. I talk about lending platforms and decentralized derivatives markets. Going into staking, I talk about the percent yields of staking and how low traditional financial market interest rates are now. Ultimately how decentralized finance could become the standard as it seems inevitable with the lack of trust in traditional financial markets and the devaluation of the dollar through hyperinflation and endless money printing. 

Not everyone will see it right away, but in my experience, seeing people say things like, “wow I had no idea that there was this much to it,” shows that the public still has no idea what this stuff is. Just take your time and understand that it’s not your obligation for other people to understand right away. Just do your part and then let them figure out the rest and help if they have further questions. 

Not everything will need to be decentralized/take advantage of blockchain technology. But if you’re able to find the things that actually do benefit from it🤔

personalfinance,Book deal but already in debt,"Hi, thanks in advance for anything anyone can offer. I have $22k in federal student loan (currently payments on this are pushed till November), $25k in private student loans with a 7% interest rate that I have been paying for 5 years, $15k in car loan, and then rent, utilities, insurance, etc. I only make around $25k a year, $12 an hour, full time. I just wrote a children's book on the side and a hybrid publisher is willing to pick it up. The deal seems good, pay in the beginning and then I make 85% of what is sold in stores and 100% of what I sell in person (book signing, events, etc). To get my book going (purchase the books, edit, illustrate, and market) it would be around $8k. I would be getting around 1000 books to start and they would sell around $17. I don't currently have the disposable income, obviously, to pay $8k to get this going, so my question is, would it be worth it to try to get a loan to pay to get this off the ground? Does it seem smart to go further in debt for this? (Also I have tried to refinance my student loans, but even though I make enough to skate by and always pay my bills, they won't let me refinance without a cosigner, which I think is ridiculous at the age of 25, so I'm not sure if a loan of this size would require a cosigner or not, just thought I would give a little background).",finance

personalfinance,Looking to buy a house that has renters in it.,"I'm trying to buy this property that has tenants living in it.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 8, 2021.","Stocks were mixed on Monday as Treasury yields rose amid stimulus optimism. The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs. 

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire. 

The prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today’s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. 

Highlights

The ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.

Shares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.

7.  In the past months I have met many new peo­ple. One of them was Jack Mallers at Strike. He’s al­most forty years younger than me. Ex­pe­rienc­ing his en­er­gy and en­thu­si­asm was spe­cial . I felt old in his com­pa­ny, but also very em­bold­ened:

personalfinance,"Wire transfer on hold with intermediary bank, now requesting (odd) info?","Hi all! Long time lurker here - unfortunately I have a weird situation that warrants a post &gt;.&lt;

I'm under contract to buy a house (woohoo!) and recently needed to wire money to the title company to cover earnest money. Cool, put it in the first night I was under contract, and my bank (an investment bank) sent it out the next day. We called and confirmed the wire information with the title company during this, adding the escrow agent's name, address of property, correct routing/account numbers etc. Three days later when the earnest money was due, the wire was marked as sent/completed with my bank, but the title company still hadn't received it. Cue me driving like a maniac to hand deliver checks to the title company, and confirming with my escrow agent that he would reject the wire when it came in.

So, I call my bank, asking what the heck is going on. After some back and forth over a few calls they confirmed that the funds had left their possession and were with the intermediary bank they use. I request they trace the wire and I get a callback a few hours later. The funds are on hold with the intermediary bank for compliance as per federal requirements(?), and are requesting additional information that I included on the wire. Namely, the information for our escrow agent with the title company I listed on the wire, including DOB, full name, and his address. My smooth brain thinks its a scam, but the security questions my bank uses and the phone number they called on were legitimate.

I've already contacted the escrow agent with the title company about this but they haven't gotten back to me. I'm having trouble finding any information about this online, or any similar examples. At this point the earnest money has been paid for via check, and we really need those wired funds back for closing.

Any and all help is appreciated :D

EDIT 3/16 - EDIT: after lots of back and forth with my bank's wiring division, they agreed to have a conference call with me and my escrow agent so he could provide the info on my behalf, and then have it forwarded to the intermediary bank. My officer couldn't provide it to the bank on his own to the bank since he wasn't on the account. Makes sense, but still a headache that took a few weeks to resolve. I ain't wiring money ever again after this :P

Hopefully folks in the future can use this post and Erudite1in407's awesome comment to hammer out any other wierd wiring issues they may encounter!",finance
personalfinance,Stuck in a toxic job while expecting a baby,"Hello, using a throwaway account since my other account has a bunch of followers and is known within several communities. 

The good news is, my husband and I are expecting our first child later this summer. We're thrilled and can't wait to be parents. We're lucky to have super supportive families, and both of our jobs will give us about 3 months off for paid new parent leave. 

However, my current job, aside from the upcoming paid leave, is kind of a nightmare. My team and I are woefully overworked and understaffed. I'm averaging 50-60 hour weeks at a marketing agency, in what's essentially an associate position. I'm not entry level, but I'm not a manager. I sometimes feel like I'm too good at what I do because lots of teams and projects are tapping into me for support, and I routinely get high marks from performance reviews. 

My mangers know about my over-utilization, and have assured me they're looking to provide me with additional support by brining in a new hire to work parallel to me. I've been hearing this since October though, and we still haven't so much as interviewed someone else. 

Having that person would help a ton, not to mention how important they'll be once I leave for 3 months later this year. But if it weren't for our upcoming kid, I'd have left this place by now. My colleagues and supervisors are nice and mean well, but resource management sucks. Everyone is underwater and one new hire isn't going to pave the way for a better work life balance - which is all I really want, especially considering my growing family. 

Alas, we work in the United States where many employers won't offer paid leave to someone who's worked less than a year. I'm trying to assess my options, for my mental health any my future as a new parent, but I'm nervous that all I can do is wait till I'm on new parent leave, and then start looking for a new position after that. 

Maybe it's as ""simple"" as that, but thought I'd seek additional advice in case I have options that I'm not considering. Any advice or insight would be welcome. Thanks for reading :)",finance

personalfinance,20 years old...what to do with 20k in the bank?,"I'm a junior in college. I have a full tuition scholarship from my school, and between work and money from Covid stiumulus and grants I had saved up about $28,000 by the end of 2020. I opened a Roth IRA and maxed it out at 6k. I plan on doing the same thing for 2021. Most of the IRA is in a basic S&amp;P500 index fund. 

After last year's Roth IRA contributions, I'm left with about 22k. I make enough during the school year to breakeven on month-to-month expenses. During the summer I work long hours and I expect to add another 10k on to my savings, so I'll have 32k by the end of this year. 

By the time I graduate I will have taken out 20k in federal subsidized loans. These have no interest until six months after I graduate (May 2022), so I don't think its wise to pay them off now. No other debt. 

I currently live near public transit so I don't *need* a car, but I've been thinking about buying a used one in the &lt; $12,000 range for a while. If I bought a car now I can see myself using it for at least the next five years -- and it's very likely I would need a car to commute when I graduate next year. 

I'm really not sure what to do with the money. I'd keep a minimum of 4k for emergencies in a high yield savings account, but that leaves me with about $18k, which will be $28k after this summer. Should I make all my 2021 Roth IRA contributions early? I know I'm missing out on interest if its just in the bank, so where should I keep the money otherwise? 

Once I settle down (within the next \~5 years) I can also see myself putting a down payment on a home, rather than paying into rent, but that's just an idea I'm toying with.",finance
personalfinance,Always check to make sure your Medical provider is in network.,"Just a reminder to always check with your medical provider if they are in network.  I had a recent experience with a Dentists office in which I did not specifically ask them but just assumed so.  The office changed owners and therefore switched up what insurance they accepted.  When I called to ask which they recommended they mentioned Metlife FEDVIP High option.  I choose the standard option since it was cheaper and did not think my teeth required the higher coverage and did not question why they insisted on the High Option plan.  Well it turns out the reason they recommended the High is option is because they are out of network with Metlife.  That never came up when I was discussing my options with the medical worker.  While I should have asked that the fact that they failed to mentioned this pissed me off since I had been going to this office for over a decade and enjoy the relationships I had built there.  Because of that I owe $800 out of pocket vs. $139 had I been in network.  

TLDR:  Dentists office recommended high option plan.  I went with standard.  Turns out they are not in network and now I owe them $600+ more had I gone to an in network office.",finance

personalfinance,Should I confront my boss about switching me from 1099-NEC to W-2?,"Hello great people!

I will try to keep this short. Since May 2020 I have worked for a small, family owned bicycle shop. They hired me and my boyfriend as 1099 workers. This of course resulted in me having to pay over 10% of income in self-employment taxes. This was a lot considering I didn't even make enough to have to pay federal income taxes.

To note, in the decade they have been in business, they supposedly have never hired any actual employees besides themselves (two family members). They have pretty much only hired contracted mechanics and short-term laborers. I believe this is why we were hired as 1099. I don't think my boss knew how long we were going to work. He certainly did not expect an insane surge in sales due to covid requiring us to work through the Fall, and I also don't think he expected our dedication and work ethic.

It's about time for us to come back to work after our winter hiatus. I would really like to avoid paying self-employment tax again because, well *I'm clearly not self employed.* I show up to a set workplace on a set schedule, I am paid by the hour, and I use employer-provided tools, etc (I believe this is sufficient enough evidence yeah?), so I'm hoping I can talk to my boss soon about switching us to W-2 employees. This is worth it right? 

It's a super small business, so I don't believe any benefits will be offered. I'm turning 26 this year so I will have to get my own health insurance. I read that you can get reimbursed for your health insurance as a 1099 worker, that's why I'm bringing it up. 

A final note; we have created a really great relationship with the two owners. I really feel like I'm family. They closed the shop down for a week last year owing to a covid scare, and they still paid us for the week. They also gave us a $200 year-end bonus (which of course doesn't sound like a lot but it made me feel so valued and appreciated), and they paid my boyfriend time and a half for overtime throughout the year (I never worked enough to qualify). They definitely treat us well. They really really wanted us to come back to work this year, so I know they value us as employees, and I absolutely adore working there. I am excited to go to work every day for real. I want to keep working there, I just want things to be fair, and I don't want to set the wrong tone by confronting my boss about this issue.

Thanks for any advice. 

**TL;DR- I was hired as a 1099 worker last year, but am hoping to confront my boss about switching to W-2 this year. Worth it?**

My account was in good standing. On 2/28/2021 at 4:29PM I deposited $1400.00 (Seventy $20 Bills) into Bank of Americas ATM. Which malfunctioned and was unable to fund my account or return my deposit. It asked me the amount and also gave me a receipt of the machine malfunction. I stayed at the bank and within 15 minutes I filed a claim via the Electronic Claims number provided. The claims representative informed me I would receive a temporary credit within 2 days pending an investigation and notice via mail. 

I attempted to use my ATM/Debit card to make a purchase the next day and it was declined. I contacted Bank of America and was informed my account was in the process of closure pending the result of the previously opened claim. They never contacted me informing my account was in closure. On 3/8/2021 I contacted Bank of America for an update due to not having access to online banking message center. I did not receive any mail notice. 

Bank of America informed me the claim was denied as they were unable to retrieve any cash from the ATM and stated they had video footage which showed I did not make a cash deposit which is impossible. I asked for proof of the video footage and Bank of America informed me I can file a police report and subpoena the footage. Later another representative said the reason on the letter was that they didnt find cash, nothing about video footage? Why should I be put through more emotional anguish by opening a legal process to rectify a malfunction with Bank of Americas faulty ATM machine.  I asked the representative when my remaining account balance would be sent to me and she informed me the estimated account closure date was April 12th, 2021. How is this possible when I was informed if my claim was accepted I would be sent a check including my account balance that week. Meanwhile I lose $1400 and my remaining funds will be held for more than month by Bank of America.

I attached the ATM malfunction receipt and proof of my ability to provide the funds I received and deposited. The funds I deposited were Federal Unemployment Compensation due to unemployment because of Covid-19. I am a US Military Veteran and this has severely impacted my already handicapped ability to provide for myself and fulfill my obligation to my rent. I cannot easily replace $1400 at this time due to unemployment. I think it is unacceptable Bank of America is allowed to operate claims and accounts in this way. I have also filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, however I still hope I can resolve this with Bank of America.",finance
stocks,Things are looking up,"First, I would like to start this off by saying I don't care about the short term outcome of the markets I just like to talk about it and try to predict it for fun in my boring ass life. Anyways, I truly believe that at least for tomorrow we're going to have a true bounce based on what people think are good deals and not just a dead cat one. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first reason, one pattern I was noticing among a lot of stocks like TSLA, AMD, APPL, and a bunch more were that there were a lot of the little spikes in the ah chart. I think that means it's when institutional investors buy big portions and usually when this would happen I wouldn't bat a second eye but today it seemed like it was happening with so many stocks and not just once but multiple times across nearly all of tech.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, although futures aren't an accurate prediction of what's going to happen tomorrow, they're all up big, and for the first time in a few weeks were back to normal where the Nasdaq is leading and although I know it's because it fell much more it's still a promising sight to see as other times futures were up the dow and SMP still led. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third, although I could be completely wrong about this and it's juts a hunch, the Nasdaq is down around 10% on the dot, the correction I have been comparing this the most to is mainly the one in October, where much like this one tech was heavily beat down although for slightly different reasons. Anyway, in October when the Nasdaq was down around 10.6% that is when a true recovery had begun to happen, and although this could be something completely different, I believe that is another promising sign.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, it's that nothing can repeat forever. The thing I'm trying to say here is that every single morning we wake up, see the Nasdaq up, met by rapid selling. But can this really continue? I understand it technically could but then wouldn't everyone just short it in the morning for easy money, and because I personally believe there is no such thing as ""easy money"" there had to be a point where the Nasdaq holds strong and the suits simply decide to just buy back into tech. 

Additionally, are we not gonna talk about how fucking extended these recovery plays are. Just a heads up I own BA and JPM which in my mind no way BA is overvalued while JPM could be but I believe with how this recovery is going and with Powell promising interest rates to stay low they're probably safe but what the fuck is going on with UAL, DAL, and all the other airlines. Some of these airlines are close to break even when we all know the travel industry especially along business is going to change forever and their revenues are still down big with the prospects that in 2-3 years they would be back to where they started. Also, don't even get me started on hotels and oil. Anyway, what I'm saying is that at what point to people start taking a profit of the recovery plays and actually start rotating back again to tech.

personalfinance,Pay off debt or put it in high yield savings,I currently have 2 credit cards both with 7k on them. One card has zero interest for 18 months and plan to pay that off before interest kicks in. The other card has a 9.95% interest. I have 8k in savings right now. We plan to eventually(within a year) put our house on the market and have about 100k in equity to buy a single family home. Would you use that savings to just pay off the credit card with the 9.95% interest rate or pay down both cards (putting about 1k a month into each card) and stash the 8k in savings to help contribute to a down payment to buying a single family home?,finance
defi,Brief introduction to some of the top DeFi protocols,"Hi all,

I've put together a list of some of the top DeFi projects along with a brief explanation of each:

**Maker DAO** - Lending/Borrowing

MakerDAO is a decentralized system for collateralized loans that people can lock up their ETH in to receive the DAOs stablecoin, DAI. When someone locks up ETH, they are able to take out a loan of a smaller amount in DAI, which is pegged to the US dollar. A deposit of $1000 ETH would allow the user to take out a loan of roughly $650. When the person wants to get their ETH back, they simply pay back their loan along with any fees.
The native token of this protocol, MKR is used in a twofold manner. It primarily acts as a form of support for the loan system as the price of ETH drops. When too many loans are liquidated at once, MKR is created and sold to pay off the loans, as well as bought back from proceeds from liquidation fees. It also serves an additional role as a governance token allowing holders to vote on how high fees should be and which types of collateral should be accepted by the system’s smart contracts.
Maker has become one of the flagship protocols in the DeFi boom but as we saw with markets crash caused by Coronavirus, there remains significant risk investing/pooling money in these protocols which can suddenly become destabilized due to unpredictable events. Though Covid isn’t the first existential crisis Maker has faced, having dealt with hacks in the past, the community has continued to persist and has shown impressive resilience to move past these troubles, often coming out stronger and with a more guided roadmap. It is the largest DeFi protocol by locked value at $6.57 billion.

**Aave** - Lending/Borrowing

Aave is a decentralized network of collateralized lending pools run by smart contracts that allow people to freely lend or borrow crypto. In December 2020, they rolled out version 2 of their protocol. Previously when holders provided crypto for collateral on loans, it was locked in to that collateral. The new update allows users to easily transfer their collateral from one coin to another without having to repay their loan or pull it out of Aave. This increases people’s ability to manage liquidation risk by being able to swap their collateral if the original asset began falling in price.
The governance token, AAVE, is used by holders to determine various changes to the rules and policies of the protocol. Holding the token also provides the user various bonuses such as reduced fees/rates, higher borrowing limits, and advance access to certain pools. Aave has also innovated “flash loans”, uncollateralized short term loans that are issued and settled within the same block of transactions.
Aave’s version 2 is far from the end for this project. CEO Stani Kulechov has mentioned that upcoming changes will improve and add additional nuance to both governance and its flash loans, while also working to reduce gas fees across the board.

**Yearn Finance** - Asset Management

Yearn Finance is a DeFi protocol that gives users yTokens in exchange for crypto deposits that are then lent out via various other services such as Aave or Compound for the highest rate of return. Yearn.finance was created by Andre Cronje who promptly gave up the protocol and transferred governance to a smart contract that requires a supermajority to institute changes. There is a fixed supply of 30,000 YFI tokens.
Yearn.finance automatically reallocates investors’ funds and finds them the highest yield across various DeFi products. In other words, it gives the average crypto investor access to more advanced strategies through a user friendly user interface. It’s name recognition and ease of use will ensure that as the space continues to grow, it will remain as many investors’ first introductions to field farming strategies.
Though in itself not high risk, Yearn searches a number of high yield bearing products that can oftentimes lead to investors’ funds being put into instruments they may not personally be comfortable with. Though these may not be entirely “unsafe”, It’s fair to ask whether many of the new investors being introduced to DeFi via Yearn would feel comfortable if they knew some of the riskier strategies their funds were subject to. Additionally, the nature of crypto’s rapidly changing market conditions can lead to volatile price swings across the market and the value of yield farming assets are always at risk of becoming worthless.

**Uniswap** - Decentralized Exchange

Uniswap is the most popular and most used decentralized exchange (dex) built on Ethereum. It made headlines last summer when it surprised early users by airdropping 400 UNI tokens (roughly $1,200 at the time) to anyone who had used the platform. The UNI token is used to govern the Uniswap exchange and holders can vote on various proposals and will eventually be the sole decision makers of Uniswap. People can use Uniswap to trade any token built on Ethereum and can also provide Eth and other tokens to supply liquidity, earning fees and sometimes other rewards.
At one point Uniswap held 20% of all funds locked in DeFi protocols and had nearly 50,000 daily users and it still remains hugely popular. Due to the surprise airdrop, the token is widely distributed among the crypto community. It’s also one of the most popular platforms users are introduced to deeper DeFi concepts such as liquidity pools and yield farming.
Many Uniswap users not only use the exchange for swapping their tokens, but also to earn rewards by providing liquidity. Many of these rewards provide outstanding returns which is incredibly enticing. However there’s an underlying risk to it that many people don’t understand well. It’s called Impermanent (or Divergence) Loss and it occurs when the price of the pooled token moves far from the price the user initially provided it for.When the Automated Market Maker sells tokens to maintain the desired ratio, the underlying amounts provided are sightly affected. This risk is often offset by the fees and rewards earned, but could present a significant risk in a volatile market.

**Synthetix** - Derivatives

Synthetix allows holders to stake their SNX tokens to create on-chain synthetic versions of real world assets such as gold, foreign currencies, and recently oil. It also allows holders to create shorting products such as iBTC or iETH. Synthetix was founded by Kain Warwick, having raised nearly $4 million in private funding from Framework Ventures. Governance was originally handled by a foundation which has since been dissolved and replaced by three decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that SNX holders can vote on decisions for the future of the protocol.
Synthetix had over $800 million in total locked value at its height and continues to hold above $700 million staked with over $125 million in circulating synthetic assets. Their success shows the strong demand for the ability to trade censorship free real world assets on-chain and they continue to research, develop, and release new products. Their inverse products (iEth, iBTC, iOIL etc..) are a unique way to introduce shorting strategies to DeFi newcomers as each iSynth token has an entry point, an upper limit, and a lower limit at which point the price is frozen and the inverse asset’s holder is liquidated into a USD pegged stablecoin to help manage risk. Sythentix’s strategy of bridging traditional legacy assets and new digital assets through these innovative products presents a strong case for SNX as the space develops and matures.
One of the downsides to Synthetix is its unusually high collateralization ratio, requiring 750% of staked SNX to the value of the Synth asset. Additionally SNX is more volatile than other assets such as ETH which can lead to higher risk when it comes to keeping your ratio intact. Though staking ETH is available, it offers none of the reward incentives that SNX does.

**Compound** - Lending/Borrowing

Compound is a decentralized crypto lending and borrowing protocol run by algorithms and smart contracts. Anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet such as MetaMask can supply their crypto or borrow assets at interest rates set by real time supply and demand. This allows people to lend and borrow without having to negotiate terms through a middle man such as a bank. When people deposit their crypto funds into Compound, they are provided c-tokens (cETH, cDAI etc) which represent a claim to their portion of the asset pool. Similar to other DeFi protocols, loans are overcollateralized. That is, you must provide more value in crypto as collateral than you can borrow a loan for.
Compound was initially started as a company by Robert Leshner and funded by VC, but since the release of the COMP token has been gradually decentralized handing control and governance to the community. Votes have been held to add coins, adjust interest rates, and various other improvement proposals.
One of the inherent risks in Compound’s model is the risk taken on by borrowers who use the funds to buy more of their collateral. If an investor deposits ETH, then uses their loan to buy more ETH, a sharp drop in the price could lead to not only a call on their loan, but also complete liquidation of their collateralized ETH. Overall, Compound is fairly simple to use and understand which will continue to allow it to be a major player in the DeFi community as more people and institutions join the space.

**RenVM** - Assets and Derivatives

A major problem with the current DeFi system (and really, the overall crypto space) is interoperability. That is, roughly 75% of the total crypto market cap is outside of the Ethereum blockchain and thus not able to participate and interact with the current major DeFi protocols. RenVM is trying to solve this by wrapping outside assets, acting as a decentralized version of BitGo’s WBTC. Someone who holds bitcoin can send their BTC to RenVM which acts as a decentralized custodian, and then issues them the Ethereum token renBTC which is backed, and has the same value as BTC. Not limited to just Ethereum, RenVM can provide this service for just about any digital asset and smart contracting platform.
RenVM’s token, REN is used as a bond to act as a validator “darknode” on the network. It requires 100,000 REN to register and run a node which is locked into a smart contract and not returned until the person deregisters their node. This encourages good behavior from participants. Every time an asset is transferred across chains, a fee is taken which is paid out to the darknode operators.

**Kyber Network** - Decentralized Exchange

Kyber Network is a decentralized exchange and payments tool that allows people to instantly swap their tokens for other tokens without having to deal with a centralized order book. It makes use of pools of crypto funds called “reserves” that allow for several routes to convert the tokens, ultimately finding the best price. Though similar to Loopring, the Kyber Network has a main exchange interface and swaps the token instantly, while Loopring is the underlying protocol and network of many exchanges, and functions as an orderbook.
When converting ETH into another token, the Kyber smart contract first asks various reserves to get the best exchange price. Then, you’ll see the exchange rate and decide whether or not to go through with a swap. If you proceed, you will send 1 ETH to a Kyber smart contract. Once received, the reserve will do an on-chain exchange and your account will be credited with your token of choice. When converting one ERC20 token to another, Kyber uses ETH as the intermediary. That is Token A -&gt; ETH -&gt; Token B.
KNC is the native token of Kyber and reserve holders must pay for their right to manage the reserves with KNC. Holders can also stake their KNC to the KyberDAO which gives them governance rights as well as returning a staking reward. Additionally, it allows vendors who accept cryptocurrency to accept a wide variety, but still get paid in their preferred currency. The Kyber Network works as a service in these types of transactions.

**Loopring** - Decentralized Exchange and Layer 2

Loopring, though similar to Kyber, is unique in this list as it is a decentralized exchange protocol, not a dex itself. What this means is that Loopring allows anybody to build a custodial order-book based exchange on Ethereum (or any other smart-contract platform) and Loopring then combines the pools on those into one massive pool and matches orders across these separate exchanges built using Loopring’s structure and participating in the network. Additionally, when you place your order, your coins remain yours until the order is executed. Your coins aren’t locked into the order book and you can cancel or adjust your order as you please.
Those responsible for matching these orders, miners, are compensated for their work in LRC, and they are incentivized with higher rewards for finding better exchange rates. Loopring is also unique in that it is a Layer Two solution. That is, all transactions and trades take place *off chain* and thus the fees for trading are astronomically lower than Ethereum's during busy times, the downside being that it takes a bit of extra knowledge, and the desire to actually move your crypto there.

**Balancer** - Decentralized Exchange

Balancer is an automated market maker similar to Uniswap in that people can provide their crypto to liquidity pools to earn rewards, but differentiated by the concept that Balancer allows people to create their own Liquidity Pools with up to eight assets pooled instead of just two. The creator of the pool arbitrarily sets the weights of the underlying assets which are automatically rebalanced as the prices fluctuate to maintain the weight. This basically allows anyone to create their own self balancing index fund or invest in someone else’s. A downside to this is increased divergent loss as the prices of the various assets can fluctuate more broadly than is possible with just two assets provided at 1:1. It also leaves open big arbitrage opportunities as there is no oracle integration to bring in outside prices, thus the prices in the pools only change when someone makes a trade.
BAL is the governance token for this protocol and as the protocol develops, BAL holders will be able to “help guide the protocol to its fullest potential.” Balancer specifically names some goals such as deploying the protocol on blockchains other than Ethereum, implementing layer two solutions, introducing fees at the protocol level to generate revenue, and more as examples of actions BAL holders can make.

personalfinance,Loan Officer trying to change our interest rate after we signed off on the 'locked in' rate,"Hello all-

We are about two weeks into closing. We signed off on everything including our rate of 3.25 (no points). Today she called me and told me that underwriting found out the underestimated our income and we don't qualify for the program she had us under that gave us 3.25, and our rate would not be 3.5, unless we wanted to to pay for points. She said it was 'her mistake' and 'my bad' multiple times. I told her she needed to match what she originally told us and what we signed off for at 3.25. She said she would ask but at the most they MIGHT do is 3.375, and told us 'its just the cost of going out to dinner a month, it doesn't make much of a difference'. If she messed up, can't her company eat the cost? She made a mistake, admitted to it, and now I'm paying more? I spoke with my real estate agent and she said we can switch lenders, I'm going to talk with my credit union tomorrow. Are we screwed, or can we hold her to the 3.25 that was on the paperwork we signed?

Eta:

-Our income did not change, the loan officer apparently messed up her numbers somewhere along the line and underwriting caught it.

-This if for a conventional loan

-We are planning on talking to some other banks to see if they can do better then the new rate she is offering us.

-The changes she talked to me about were all over phone, nothing documented as of yet. 

-This is the second time she has changed the rate, it was originally 2.875 when we were looking at houses, two weeks later it was 3.25 because rates were going up which sucked but I understood. She asked if we wanted to float or lock in 3.25, we locked it in and signed everything, and it was sent to underwriting.

-I am all for just accepting it is how it is if that is the case. I feel like this is kinda scummy that less then two weeks from closing this changes, and how she brushed it off as no big deal, and when I mentioned taking a look at our options with other banks she said she might be able to lower it from 3.5 to  3.375, and that other banks were going to make this take longer and we would have to start over everything and she didn't want us to lose the house, trying to sway me to just stay with her. She also told us to just lower our home insurance to make up for the cost difference.",finance
personalfinance,Credit Karma Spend Account issues?,"So I’m reaching out with this community because I was wondering if anyone had similar issues to the credit Karma Spend account. 

I was looking to change banks from a smaller and out dated bank to credit Karma’s new account. Their checking and especially savings accounts looked promising with no hidden fees and a nice interest rate. 

Anyways an issue I’ve been running into is that because credit Karma technically isn’t a bank even though they have a routing number and account number I can’t set up direct deposit or connect apps such as RobinHood and Acorns. Does anybody perhaps have a fix or does anybody know a specific reason why this could be occurring? Credit Karma does explicitly say direct deposit works but my employer told me it doesn’t exist? 

Or is it simply that it’s still a quite new feature that doesn’t have optimal support yet. If that is the case I may just transfer back my money into my crap bank until it gets better.",finance

personalfinance,I need help with my debt to buy a home,"Hello all,
I want help running through my financial situation regarding my debt and my hopes to buy a home soon. 

Little backstory. Right now I’m engaged to my GF and we have two kids together (3 year old and 6 month old). She only works part time and doesn’t make much money but that means we don’t pay for child care. I work full time as a truck driver. Home every day though which is nice. They pay me $300 a day not matter how long or short the day is and I work 5 days a week. I take home a little more that 1k after taxes weekly. 78k a year.

We live at my fiancé’s parents house in a separate home on the property. They charge me $700 in rent which is great for where we live (Portland Or) 

Last few years I went to a trade school and actively trying to break into that work here regionally but it’s harder than I though (power lineman). During that that I got myself into debt trying to provide a good life for my family and keep up with everything. 

Right now my portfolio looks like this

Wells Fargo: 
CC is $6843 at 11.15% with a minimum payment of $134 and limit is $9500

LOC is $2033 at 19.25% with a minimum payment of $60 and limit is $3000

PL $3585 at 17.49% with a minimum payment of $146

OnPoint CU: 
CC $11,699 with a minimum payment of $234 and a limit of 13,650. It’s at 12.9% but $6892 is at 1.99% till January 2022.

I also have a car loan with a balance of $1800 at 3.9% and min payment of $126 and a god damn 30k sallie Mae student loan at god knows what interest rate and I pay about $450 a month on that.

Really want to buy a home soon because we are really outgrowing this small home we are in. I am pretty frugal and always pay more than the minimum.

I have no missed payments or derogatory marks but the credit utilization is holding my credit score back at like 690 according to credit Karma

I have 5k saved up just sitting in savings that I really don’t want to touch until it helps put me into a home.

Talked to a mortgage specialist at my local credit union about their first time home buyer program that allows no money down and you can wrap closing costs into your loan but they also won’t charge you mortgage insurance.

What do you think my best plan of action is? I’ve been trying to snowball it. Still pay more than minimum on all payments but all extra is going to the Wells Fargo line of credit. Unfortunately my two most maxed out cards have the lowest interest rate so I’m avoiding paying those off and but I know that’s hurting my credit.

Thought about throwing all that in one loan that says pre approved. Higher interest rates than some of my debt but lower than others. Can still pay more than that minimum payment and will help credit utilization. My concern is if I pay that Down and go for a home in 6 months I may hurt my approval amount. The debt balance will be down but the monthly payment will still be high compared to if I was just paying each account individually and my minimums would be lower because the balances are going down. I suppose I could refinance that loan but it
Would be another credit hit.

personalfinance,Thinking of getting a personal loan to pay off credit cards. Thoughts?,"I'd like to buy a house soon(ish), but am trying to increase my credit score first. My main problem (I think) is simply the amount of debt that I have. I make my payments on time, pay more than the minimum, and have some variety of debt - I have one installment loan (a car payment). Other than that, I have student loans (which I'm current on, and working towards public service loan forgiveness, fingers crossed) and way too much credit card debt.

I'm thinking of getting a personal loan to pay off my credit cards in order to improve my debt to credit ratio. I'd want to make sure the interest rate is not too high, but before contacting any lenders I'm trying to figure out if it's even a good idea.

It seems to me that if I pay off my credit cards my score should increase and make it easier to get better rates for a mortgage - I'd have the same amount of debt, but have more credit available (understanding that I wouldn't be using my cards and stacking up more debt). But I'm not sure the impact of taking on a second installment loan - either on my credit score, or on how mortgage lenders would see that. Any insights would be great!

personalfinance,Did I screw up my solo 401k contributions?,"I'm new to being a full time sole proprietor (1099 employee) this year. I was doing some part time 1099 work last year and had a SEP IRA but was then recommended to set up the solo 401k for its higher contribution limits. 

I'm fairly certain I will have enough annual income to max the Employee portion by the end of this year. I'm estimating my net annual income to be around $80,000 to $100,000. Initially and without much research I thought I had the brilliant idea that it would be a good idea to front load my solo 401k. I got sucked into the whole notion of ""time in the market&gt;timing the market""... 

Error #1 (I think?). I withdrew $29,500 from a taxable account and transferred it to my solo 401k. I'm maxing out the $19,500 Employee portion and arbitrarily put $10,000 in as the Employer contribution. Going back and doing the math on the federal worksheet, I think I'll be OK at the end of the year (if I make my planned amount) since I won't have over contributed. Based on $80k net income, I think I have an extra \~$4,800 I could contribute as the Employer. 

My questions are:

Can I do what I just did? I technically haven't earned $29,500 yet but will later. 

Do I have to pay **Hawaii state** estimated taxes if my Q1 income is $0 since I'm saying 100% of my salary is going to my solo 401k? 

Do I have to pay Federal estimated tax for Q1?

CryptoCurrency,My Grandpa is finally getting exposure to crypto!!!,"My grandfather has always been very conservative. He always liked to have money sitting in a bank account, where 30 years ago the rate of return of savings account was like 7/8%.

He went every month to the bank to make sure he was getting the best return he could get, and wouldn't mind changing bank if they were not offering him the best deal.

As we all know, bank rates are extremely low. To the point where the bank sent my grandfather a letter saying that his interest rate was going to be decreased to 0,001%!!!!!!!

The banking system where I live is a joke, and that was the tipping point for my grandfather.

I have some background on investing, and he came to me asking where he would get the best return. But he was mostly looking for a bank to let his money sit. But I told him that I could very conservatively tell him where to invest his money (legally, not investment advice hahaha), and get a minimum of 10% ROI, and if he didn't I would give him the money he had ""lost"" (just for him to not worry about losing money). He was skeptical, and said that 10% is a lot, and he didn't believe it.

I told him my investment strategy overall, and what I would recommend to him (of course, saying ""not investment advice"" at the end of each sentence), and he accepted to invest a part of his savings (we are starting with a small portion, so don't worry, he is not going to go bankrupt).

We talked about having a little bit of exposure to crypto, and he was super enthusiastic when I was explaining the technology behind it, and he was happy to allocate a little bit of his new portfolio to BTC and ETH. I was super happy to see him so open minded.

US homebuilding has historically been a leading economic indicator; softening Purchase Applications in the face of the rise in 10y US Treasury yields in recent weeks is worth paying attention to.

Another leading indicator has historically been US corporate capital spending; there appears to be a chunk of US corporate debt that will likely need to be refinanced in the next three years.

At some level, rising rates may begin to cut into US capital spending as interest bills rise, offering the Fed more motivation to prevent yields from rising “too far.”

How far is “too far” for rates as it relates to mortgages and corporation refinancings? At the recent pace of increase in 10y UST yields, we may not have to wait too long to find out.",finance

Bitcoin,Goldman Sachs says high BTC returns in 2021 will destroy everything on Wall Street,"It was not until the end of January that Goldman Sachs compared BTC with global assets. Nevertheless, since 2021, the rate of return of BTC has been twice that of the energy industry.

&amp;#x200B;

In January, Goldman Sachs, a well-known Wall Street investment company, began to include Bitcoin in its weekly global asset class return rankings. That month, BTC quietly climbed to the top of the rankings.

&amp;#x200B;

But since then, BTC's advantages have expanded relative to assets such as stocks, bonds, oil, gold, bank stocks, technology stocks, and the euro.

&amp;#x200B;

In its latest U.S. Weekly Kickstart report, Goldman Sachs Group showed that as of March 4, the return rate of BTC was about 70%, followed by the energy industry with a return rate of 35%.

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. stock market has recently sold off, and the return of the S&amp;P 500 index is currently close to zero. In contrast, the advantage of BTC is even more obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

1. For cyclical industries such as energy and finance, the rebound in oil prices and the increase in real interest rates have pushed up the current rate of return, but the performance is still inferior to BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

2. At present, the risk-adjusted capital return rate of crude oil and energy is higher than that of BTC.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Gold is the worst-performing asset class so far this year, because traditional defensive industries such as consumer daily necessities and public utilities have been affected due to rising real interest rates.

&amp;#x200B;

4. According to previous CoinDesk reports, in cryptocurrency and traditional markets, many investors believe that BTC is a potential inflation hedging tool, especially now that central banks around the world have issued a large number of additional issuances to boost the economy affected by the new crown virus. Even so, from the beginning of the year to now, the price of gold has fallen by about 10%, so some market observers believe that BTC is eating away at the gold market share.

&amp;#x200B;

5. According to a survey, approximately 40% of Goldman Sachs customers have invested in cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Even so, in May 2020, Goldman Sachs' asset management department stated in a statement that for customers, cryptocurrency is not a suitable investment, driven by speculation behind it, and is more famous than the notorious Dutch tulip in the 17th century. The bubble is even crazier.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,TL:DR at the bottom,"I see a lot of misconceptions floating around regarding the valuations of the market. i trust you all know firstly that the Us dollar is the international standard so i'm solely focusing on that currency. basically the us fed sees the threat as a negative cash balance so since they are the fed they can simply print that balance back to ""par""  quarter after quarter, notice they also lowered rates

So what does this mean? it means that the supposed 'loses',  that are perceived to be a threat to the republic, will be printed into balance.  nothing more said. The low rates on the other hand are just fun coupons for the safety net party. 

Its a joke, but it works because of the demand there still is for the dollar.

 introduce bitcoin, the quoted flight to safety. if the dollar can simply be safety-netted at the end of all ends then either a. its incredibly useful and invincible or b. its being misused, or prone to misuse and will fail  or c. they know its prone to misuse, but know they can hold the bluff since no other nation can compete.

in troubling times, poorer nations don't have the privilege of printing their loses and expecting the demand to be there.  no shit, The US is the only nation that can risk that kind of printing so they do it. 

The price of basically all assets dilutes, its written. and now institutions have begun flocking to bitcoin, out of necessity. most know that you need some form of insurance on your capital and in this era that insurance can be bitcoin. its funny because in a way its similar to BNPL and APT:ASX, you are paying for the equity now at a higher premium since the demand and exposure is far greater,


Now, I see a lot of uncertainty about the pricing of equities and some rare commodities and the higher p/e and gdp/mcap etc etc.  

i say this, quiet simply and its very simple. how many years ago was a billionaire an unknown thing?

or how long ago was 50k bitcoin an unknown thing?

if rates persist for the next couple of years yes inflation will happen and pricing will be a lot higher. so i don't personally see any of this current volatility as so to speak a problem. its accumulation time, and most think its the top. Think about every single time a country doubles its gdp or it doubles the cost of general goods in stores. at each of those times people thought that we were at a peak and that prices couldn't be more, they were wrong, and this time the fed ultimately guarantees it.

the history of our race we've never seen near 0% interest, you've never been more inclined to invest and spend. 15years ago you saw 15% rates for secured home loans and a smidge more on general secured loans. The yield in retail buying never peaked until now and now we are enduring a crisis. equity is being put into hibernation and for the time being being a holder of assets is far more productive then actual productivity. 

so to put it all together, yes we're seeing higher p/e ratios making some believe we are peaking out, but the chart on p/e rations is less then a century old, hypothetically what's not to say that eventually the price on equity will be so secure that its valued at such  higher premiums, because the barriers to entry are higher. you know warren buffett and charlie munger themselves say they were fortunate enough to come into a time where the barriers to entry were relatively low, and beaten and demoralised general investor confidence in public equity. they'd just gone through a great depression and 2 world wars in 50 years for god sake how stable is a public institution or company. 



TL:DR i think companies will be worth a lot more in the future, i think equities will follow inflation.

vet,Prader-Willi syndrome in dogs?,"We have a pug who's coming up 2 years old now. He's been overweight almost his entire life, but he's also generally a large dog. When he was about 9 months old, he reached 'average' pug size and he's just continued growing since then. He weighs roughly 11kg currently. He gets fed twice a day, just a small cup full of weight-management biscuits each time, which is what our vet recommended. However, he's always hungry. He never settles and is always searching the floor for food, he eats cat poop and dog sick, leaves and stones, even twigs from the garden. We can't let him off the leash in public places where people are having picnics or there's things like children with ice cream, because he makes a beeline for them. Whenever he eats at home, he gobbles it up in about 30 seconds, and then he's pushing the bowl around for more. We have to separate him from our other dog so he won't go for her food when he's done with his. He'll fight our cats for their food too. When I cut my husband's hair, if the dog's in the room, he'll even go so far as to eat the hair off the floor if I don't sweep it up quick enough. The vet says that his weight must be something to do with us, but he doesn't have any treats, isn't fed from the table, gets regular exercise and we don't even give him chews anymore because of it. Is it possible that he could be suffering from some kind of disorder or condition that means he's always hungry?",cryptocurrency

I work in capital project management, there has been a huge uptick in projects, and we are definitely understaffed for the work. I also don't like the work culture in general, a lot of stress is built in the system by design due to different departments having conflicting ""goals"" with others.

Overall I have been thinking about quitting for about 6 months. I have applied passively to other position, but I am not sure if maybe I should just stick it out. I'm not vested in retirement until 4.5 years in. My own contributions are 4% roth 401k and maxing out Roth IRA so I do have something I would keep. I also just bought a condo in August (work paid for closing costs though), and I really do not want to relocate.

Anyways just looking for some advice as I am a little lost. I have been going in circles with this in my head for a while.

Bitcoin,"If you use a custodian to store your Bitcoin, read the history of Executive Order 6102","A few quotes from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102:

- Executive Order 6102 is an executive order signed on April 5, 1933, by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States.""
- The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused ""hoarding"" of gold, stalling economic growth and worsened the depression.
- The main rationale behind the order was actually to remove the constraint on the Federal Reserve preventing it from increasing the money supply during the depression. 
- The circumstances of the case were that a New York attorney named Frederick Barber Campbell had one deposit at Chase National Bank of over 5,000 troy ounces (160 kg) of gold. When Campbell attempted to withdraw the gold, Chase refused, and Campbell sued Chase. A federal prosecutor then indicted Campbell on the following day (September 27, 1933) for failing to surrender his gold.[12] Ultimately, the prosecution of Campbell failed, but the authority of the federal government to seize gold was upheld, and Campbell's gold was confiscated.",cryptocurrency

Is there a place where she can complain about the companies unethical behavior?

She is contemplating on taking this to Social Media. Make a video testimonial. Most probably she will never get her low rates again, but at least she can make other customers aware of the companies behavior? Is this fine?

My current auto loan balance is $19k with an interest rate of 3.59% and I pay $451 a month. I've had this for about 3 years and have already paid off about $10k worth since. I've refinanced once a few years ago to get that rate; I think I have 3 or 4 years left on it, I honestly don't remember. I've since gotten a better job and have better cash flow, so I was recently thinking of making a large $10k payment on it just to get the balance down.

With all of that in mind, would it make sense to refinance my auto loan after making the $10k payment with the same provider to get a lower monthly payment? Or does it make more sense to just stick out the remainder, paying extra as I'm able? 

I'm not totally strapped for money, but having a lower monthly payment on top of my other obligations would definitely be nice. I really doubt the rate would change, but my credit is much better since the start (hovers around 799). Any input/thoughts are appreciated.

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 2: Money, Ledgers &amp; Bitcoin**

* Money is a social consensus mechanism
* The ""inherent value"" debate of fiat vs. non-fiat is still ongoing, not black and white
* Fiat value shifts with adoption
* BTC adds to a long history of ledger technology
* **Characteristics of money:** divisibility, scarcity, adoption
* Fixing exchange rates could work well for short temporal periods, but not for decades
* **Ledger:** a way to record economic activity, social relationships, and financial relationships
* There is research pointing to the first methods of writing having to do with numbers and ledgers, rather than words and communication. It is fundamental to society to record economic transactions and financial relationships
* No state or federal statutes that put a monopoly on any form of currency
* Bitcoin shows that its legal to create your own form of money, but you have to comply with all the **other** laws...guards against illicit activity, anti-money laundering, terrorism financing, paying taxes, investor and consumer protection
* U.S. government won't accept taxes in BTC
* Arizona legislator wanted them to be the first state to accept BTC for taxes
* **Non-metal money:** for example salt bars in Ethiopia...scarcity and practical uses
* Did money come from a history of barter? Or a history of ledgers and credit?
* Metal money followed by minted money
* **Minted money:** around 2,500 years ago, an official emblem placed on a scarce resource
* **Paper money:** tries to address issues around not enough gold, has ease of use, the first kinds in China were warehouse receipts
* Some of the first bankers in London were goldsmiths exchanging gold for paper
* Gensler predicted cryptocurrency lending and finance ""18 to 36 months"" from 2018
* Is it scalable to lend against a finite currency?
* **Private bank notes:** liability of that bank, the history of these is ""good until its really bad""
* **Ledgers:** principal recordings of accounts, record economic activity (transactions) and financial relationships (debt)
* Bitcoin is a mechanism to store **transactions** (transaction ledger)
* Others like Ethereum store **balances** (balance ledger)
* Also **general ledgers** vs. **supporting/sub-ledgers**, hierarchical ledger structure is at the heart of our systems of banking and financial markets
* Also **single entry** (list) vs. **double entry** (credit/debit)
* **Central banks:** like a general ledger for money (Federal Reserve)
* **Commercial banks:** like a sub-ledger for money
* **Assets - Liabilities = Capital**: the heart of capitalism is double entry bookkeeping, it helped Europe come out of the Dark Ages and into a commercial renaissance
* **Characteristics of good ledgers:** immutable, consistent, timestamped, show counterparties to transaction, show who owes balance, accurate, give description of transaction, comprehensive...these are similar to the characteristics of good money
* **Payment systems:** method to amend and record changes in ledgers for money
* **Deposits and negotiable orders:** signature, payee (ledger to send to), amount, what it was for, account #, routing # (what ledger is this coming from)
* **Fiat currency:** social and economic consensus, represented by central bank liabilities and commercial bank deposits, relies on system of ledgers integrated into fractional banking system
* When paper money started it was not backed by gold. It's a false narrative to say we were on gold standard for our first 140 years
* Governments are technically separate from their banks
* The social construct of acceptance of currency relies in part on the government saying they'll accept it for taxes
* U.S. has about 9,000 commercial banks
* Central bank liability is a **social** liability as well, insure for stability of social construct of money
* **Fiat:** notes and coins are legal tender for all debts public and private, tender required when debt is **established**, unique tax treatment
* Central bank intervention is the way for two separate banks to transact
* **Moving between two currencies:** how do you make two closed ledger systems operable?
* The amount of cash in circulation is growing faster than the economy in most developed nations
* **Credit cards:** an 1887 sci-fi writer conceived of them in a book imagining the year 2000, merchant credit cards in the late 1920's to 2000's, charge plates and credit coins in the late 1880's to 1960's, Charge-It was the first bank card (from First National Bank in Brooklyn, 1946), Diners' Club was the first general merchant card in 1949, American Express was the first plastic card in 1959, Bank of America was the first general purpose credit card in 1966 (credit boom took off from here)
* Major credit regulations didn't come until the 1970's in the U.S., Fair Credit Reporting Act and other big laws in the 1970's, it took 15 to 20 years after the introduction of credit cards to come up with regulations
* **Credit card processing:** slide card imprinter (1950's), Visa imprinter (1979), payment terminals (2018)
* **Characteristics of money:** durable, portable (lighter), divisible, uniform/fungible (Crawfurd v. Royal Bank, 1749), acceptable, stable, limited supply, hard to counterfeit
* **Design of money:** token (physical) vs. account based, physical vs. digital, private sector vs. central bank, widely accessible vs. wholesale (for example, central banks' reserves are only available to the commercial banking system)
* **The Money Flower:** illustration from the Bank of International Settlement, shows how different types of money are classified
* **Reasons for early digital cash failures:** centralization, lack of adoption, couldn't solve the double spend problem, consensus
* **Digital and mobile payments:** PayPal (1998), Ericsson and Telenor had first mobile app to get movies on your mobile phone (1999), Alipay (2003), M Pesa (2007, mobile minutes being used as money in Kenya, now 20 million users and regulations), Starbucks mobile app (2011), Google Wallet (2011), WeChat Pay (2013), Apple Pay (2014)
* **Mobile money:** where is the stored value, are they storing the value or are they just a payment services provider (using computer code to move the ledger somewhere else)
* **Cryptographic hash functions:** digitally notorize, Surety company was created in 1995

You add up the annual electricity production of all 107 of these countries and you get: 195,496 gigawatt hours. Just under our gamers, clocking in at an annual consumption of 197,100 gigawatt hours.

Some people might argue ""But video games *are* useful, they teach lessons, promulgate culture, etc!"" But I will just use the salty nocoiner argument against you and say ""But couldn't we teach lessons and promulgate culture much more efficiently? We could use books instead!"" I mean it's the same argument as saying ""We could use Visa to send money instead, it's more efficient!""

What's the lesson? You don't get to decide what is a ""wasteful"" use of energy or not, because it turns out, value is subjective. Some people who think video games have no real value and are a waste of time might think that they are a disaster for the environment.

Some people who think that Bitcoin has no real value and is a waste of time might think it's a disaster for the environment.

I don't even need to talk about the fact that using *excess* energy to mine crypto is *good* for the environment because otherwise it would just be dissipated as heat for no gain, I'm sure you all already know about this.

personalfinance,Should I take the mortgate loan with the higher interest rate?,"Hi everyone,  

I'm under contract for a house and I need to make my final decision for which loan I am going to go with by today. 

I have two loan options available, both of them have down payment assistance, but one loan has forgivable down payment assistance while the other is not forgivable. The loan which has loan forgiveness on the down payment has a higher interest rate, but it's a conventional loan instead of an FHA, which means I won't have to refinance to avoid paying mortgage insurance once I have reached the required equity of 20%. As you may know, the FHA loans have PMI which does not ever go away for the life of the loan unless you refinance the loan. I do plan on selling/refinancing around the 5-10 year mark. It is because of this, that I am leaning with a conventional loan even though it has a higher interest rate. Here's my reasoning below, and I'm hoping someone can spot check my sanity and make sure it sounds good.  
[Here are both of the loans for your viewing.](https://imgur.com/gallery/PhYxUbx) As you can see, the FHA loan has a cheaper monthly cost, but I'm paying much more for PMI when compared to the conventional loan. Once the conventional loan has an equity of 20%, I automatically get the mortgage insurance dropped off and it will have a cheaper monthly than the FHA loan. The FHA loan, you can't drop PMI ever unless you refinance the loan. I am estimating that this will cost ~ $4000 to close a new loan for refinance. 
On the conventional loan, even though I'm paying a higher interest rate, there's a big win in it due to the loan forgiveness. After 36 months of consecutive payments, my down payment assistance loan ($12,804) is automatically forgiven and I don't have to repay it. In the meantime, the loan requires no repayment and has 0% interest. So 5 years down the road, the FHA loan looks about $12,095 dollars cheaper, but it doesn't come with that sweet loan forgiveness. At that 5 year point, regardless of FHA or conventional loan, I will probably start looking at either selling or refinancing. Which means maybe I get that conventional loan down to under 4% interest rate. Or maybe, I refinance the FHA loan to avoid PMI, and then end up with a higher interest rate that cancels out savings on PMI. This is my worry with the FHA and the low interest rate.   
What would you guys choose? Is it smart to go with the conventional loan even though it has a higher interest rate? Let me know!",finance
personalfinance,"Parents have a ton of equity in their home, but terrible credit. Already denied for a refinance they're looking at a reverse mortgage. Any other options?","Hi All, thank you for taking the time, I'm at my wits end with these people... 

My parents got themselves into a terrible financial situation and they're trying to do everything they can to keep their house. 

They overspent and didn't budget for the last 5 years and got themselves into $165k of debt. This is split across a dozen credit cards and their car. 

I suggested a cash out refinance, because they have over $300k equity in their $600k home. They applied but were denied because they JUST, by 15 days, let 2 separate payments go overdue. Now their credit is awful and they can't get approved anywhere. 

Next option, reverse mortgage, they're working on it now, but it's taken months and I don't think they'll be approved. The debt mountain is too large, there's no excuse except financial mismanagement. 

Now, looking at their finances, if everything were peachy keen (which it's obviously not) they can BARELY afford their house in the first place. I've begged them to sell the place and get something smaller. They've refused for a few reasons, mostly emotional, but also because the house is worth less than they paid for it in 2007. Now, that's not a great reason to drown in an ocean of debt, but what do I know? I'm just some idiot who sticks to a monthly budget and lives in a small house I can afford. 

I am, of course, pushing for ""sell your house, you effed up and you're out of options,"" but am I overlooking anything?

Debt: $165k
Principal on Mortgage: $280k
House Should Appraise: $650k - $750k
Monthly Income: $10k
They are both retired and are 65 and 67 respectively.

stocks,"Some DD on Avangrid, Inc. (AVG) and the Good News On its Offshore Wind Farm","Hi all. I have seen some great posts here and I wanted to share some due diligence I have done over the last 24 hours on Avangrid, Inc. (AVG), which I think is poised for a move upward. This is just my personal musing and should not be interpreted, taken, or inferred as financial advice. Full disclosure: I own two March 19, 2021 50 calls and I am considering purchasing shares and more calls.

TL;DR - AGR is one of the larger energy companies in the US, recently received a long awaited environmental impact statement from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (""BOEM"") as to its massive offshore wind farm, and appears to have support of the Biden administration. The company and its stock could be poised for growth and upward movement.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I first learned of this company yesterday while researching the Biden administration's timeline for green energy projects. While doing said research, I came across press releases and news on AGR. The BOEM has finally released the environmental impact statements as to the Vineyard Wind 1 project. It seems that it was being held up by the Trump administration for political reasons. Here is some information from [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005701/en/AVANGRID-Offshore-Wind-Joint-Venture-Vineyard-Wind-1-Achieves-Key-Regulatory-Milestone):

&gt; ""AVANGRID, Inc. (NYSE: AGR) confirmed today that the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has issued the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for Vineyard Wind 1. The issuance of the FEIS is the final step before a Record of Decision (ROD) from BOEM, the last approval required for construction on the project to begin. The project is under development by Vineyard Wind, a joint venture between Avangrid Renewables, a subsidiary of AVANGRID, Inc., and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP).""  
&gt;  
&gt;""With the issuance of the FEIS, Vineyard Wind confirmed that the project remains on track to reach financial close in the second half of 2021 and begin delivering clean energy to Massachusetts in 2023.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Located 15 miles off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, Vineyard Wind 1 is slated to become the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the United States. With a generating capacity of 800 megawatts (MW), the project will provide enough electricity to power more than 400,000 homes and businesses in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts...""

It seems like AGR has plans to build other offshore wind farms:

&gt;""In addition to Vineyard Wind 1, Avangrid Renewables is a partner on Park City Wind, an 800 MW project to serve the state of Connecticut, as well as on additional lease areas off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island to deliver up to 3,500 MW. Avangrid Renewables also is developing Kitty Hawk Offshore Wind that has the potential to deliver 2,500 MW of clean energy into Virginia and North Carolina.""

There is also AGR's acquisition of PNM. AGR has recently been [moving to purchase](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210212005493/en/PNM-Resources-Shareholders-Approve-Proposed-AVANGRID-Merger) a large energy producer in New Mexico. I will not hazard a guess as to how this will affects the share price, but according to the above article:

&gt;""AVANGRID announced the strategic PNM Resources merger combination in October 2020 in an all cash offer for PNM Resources’ shares at $50.30 per share, an $8.3 billion enterprise value transaction. The resulting entity would be one of the major clean energy companies in the US with ten regulated utilities in six states and the third largest renewables company with operations in 24 states.  
&gt;  
&gt;'Approval by PNM’s shareholders is an important step toward realizing this strategic transaction. Our two companies share the same values and we are passionate about our customers, employees, and the communities we serve,' said Dennis V. Arriola, CEO of AVANGRID.""

Some of the financial data I pulled from Nasdaq today:

\*\*P/E Ratio\*\*25.7

\*\*Forward P/E 1 Yr.\*\*21.33

\*\*Earnings Per Share(EPS)\*\*$1.88

\*\*Annualized Dividend\*\*$1.76

Thus, unlike a lot of typical green energy growth stock, AGR is already profitable and pays a dividend.

According the head of the National Ocean Industries Association President quoted in this [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/03/08/biden-climate-windfarm/), it seems like offshore wind could end up being a huge area, with the potential for $160 billion worth of investments over the next fifteen years:

&gt;""Monday’s announcement drew praise from industry. National Ocean Industries Association President Erik Milito said it was “critical for the project developers and for the offshore wind industry as a whole.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Milito called on the administration to move even faster, noting that it has been two years since the last federal offshore wind lease sale. He noted that a recent analysis suggested near-term lease opportunities could generate more than $160 billion in new investment over the next 15 years, but that Interior’s Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management “must first open the door to new leasing.”

I like the dividend, the potential for growth, and the alignment with the current political climate. I am mulling whether to buy shares in addition to trading the options. The one concern for me as a long-term investment, however, is that the P/E ratio is still a little high for my taste. I generally avoid ""growth stocks"" in my investment portfolio. I am on the fence.

Anyways, hope this is helpful!",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 9, 2021. Please enjoy!","After a steep pullback in the last couple of weeks, stocks roared back Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq recording its best day since April 2020. The move marked a stark reversal after the index sank into a correction by the close of Monday's session, plunging a total of more than 10% from a recent record closing high. Goes to show how volatile the market can be. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.42% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.10% up.

The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant’s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. 

The Treasury yield pulled back a little but remains at elevated levels, which was pressuring equity markets, particularly tech stocks, in recent weeks. . Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Courtney Dominguez, Payne Capital Management Senior Wealth Advisor said, “This is a trend that tends to happen as we get out of a recession: You tend to see stocks move towards cyclical. So things like value companies or small caps, things like energy, tend to do really well when you’re coming out of a recession. And what happened last year is, those tech companies were really doing so well that their prices were getting extremely high. I don’t think these companies are going away. I think a lot of these are going to be things that we continue to have in our workplaces going forward. But the question is, are these companies so expensive, is all the optimism already priced in?”

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire.

personalfinance,Question about refinancing,"Hi guys, this is my first time refinancing so I will admit I do not have a super clear understanding on the terms but I have a question maybe someone more knowledgeable can help me. 

I am refinancing with the same company I originally got my loan with in New York. I own a condo and have made payments on it for a year but the rates now are much better. 

Current loan is 297,000 on 3.99 interest fixed 30 years. 

New loan would be 305,000 on a 2.5 interested fixed 15 years. 

Now my question is this. When looking at the fees breakdown it says

0.33% of loan amount (points)- 996.60. 

And then at the bottom it says 
Lender credits (includes $2560.14 credit for increasing closing costs above legal limit)- $2560.14

I did some research and it seems lender credits negatively impact your interest rate. When I questioned my loan person about he says the credits are for “covering the appraisal, processing,underwriting and other fees” which he says that company offers for using them again. 

He states that it did not impact my interest rate. Is that true? I didn’t ask for lender credits does anyone know more about it? And last question can anyone explain why it says that the credit is for increasing my closing costs above legal limit?

personalfinance,I need some help thinking if a personal loan makes sense for my situation.,"I currently owe 13,483.25 on my car, and I'm wondering if it would make sense to take out a personal loan to stop paying high interest on the car. The car in question is from 2015 and is under 40k miles.

 Currently, I pay 412.76 every month at an interest rate of around 11% or 12%. The personal loan would be from the place I bank with because I got promotional mail from them saying I could get around 5.74% apr on a 10k loan. Currently, I have $6,805(USD) in my bank account and was thinking of using the combined $16,805.53(USD) to pay off the car, leaving me with around 3k in the bank. 

This loan would drop my monthly payments from $412.76 to $304 at the advertised 5.74%. I make around 2k a month with income, and my expenses aren't that big; most of my money goes to rent, car payments, and insurance. I'm also a full-time student who works part-time. (work around 30-35 hours)

What I'm wondering is if I can get the loan at the advertised rate would it make sense for me to go that route, or are there other options for me to take. I really appreciate any help you guys can provide.",finance

Focusing on that $8,000 debt, considering my income is about $40,000, that’s about $769 that is being garnished per month. 

I’m currently considering applying for a personal loan, to pay the creditor who is garnishing my wages, and then paying the personal loan with 25% of my income that will no longer be taken by the creditor. I figured this way, I could use this debt to help build my credit. 

CreditKarma has shown me a list of loans that I am “pre approved” for, but the only issue is, due to my financial history, I’m given very high interest rates (I’ll add loan offer details at the end of the post). 


So here are my questions: 

If I can secure a high interest personal loan, would making ≈$700 monthly payments avoid me paying interest on the loan? 

Would making large payments toward the loan actually improve my credit score?

CryptoCurrency,The Defi lending problem and a potential solution,"Defi lending is already a massive industry. Aave, Compound and Maker (Defi lending protocols) all have multi-billion market caps and this is still just the beginning of what will be an enormous industry potentially changing the financial industry in big ways.

Although, these protocols are a step in the right direction, they all suffer with the same 3 problems:

1. Attracting borrowers
2. Variable/low interest rates for lenders
3. Fixed/limited tokens that can be lent and used as collateral

Compound briefly offered reward farming in a means to attract borrowers and this increased lending activity six-fold. So it is definitely possible to combat these problems and this is what formed the idea behind Yield.credit.

Yield.credit is a new borrowing and lending protocol that aims to offer fixed interest for lenders, incentives for borrowers and listing any token with a chain link feed.

How it works is lenders create offers and borrowers create requests. Any borrower can accept a lender offer and any lender can fulfill a borrower request. These requests and offers let you choose any token with a chain link feed as collateral or to borrow/lend. The borrower also earns YLD token upon successfully paying back his loans and the lender earns a fixed interest rate that they set when they create the lender offer. These interest rates can be anywhere from 2%-12.5% interest on loans from 10-90 days long.

All fees used on the platform are used to buy back yld at the market price and burn it. This is super important as it counteracts the YLD minted to reward borrowers and results in a token with very limited inflation and even deflationary depending on certain factors like how often loans are defaulted.

The borrower incentives, combined with the wide choice of tokens opens up creative strategies such as borrowing Ample before a positive rebase, immediately paying back your loan after the rebase and then claiming your yld reward.

Yld can also be staked within the platform to reduce fees that you pay.

Mainnet has just launched and it will be interesting to see the impact this could have on lending dynamics. 

Right now you can earn more in YLD than you payback in interest on some loans check it out:

**The problem:** Our condo is very affordable ($1300 per month mortgage, escrow, and HOA) and we worked hard to upgrade it (new appliances, new floors, paint) to make it our own. It would have been a perfect starter home for us to live in for 5 years except over the summer crime rose sharply in our neighborhood. We’ve heard gunshots at least 5 times (1 of those on our street) in the past year. Community leaders say there is a new gang/drug war in our neighborhood. Prior to the pandemic this was a quiet area, but we have no idea if things will improve once it is over.

We are a 30 year old married couple in a large city with a combined income  \~ $105k

Purchased condo for $175,000 in April 2020 (3.5% interest rate). We put 5% down, just reached 20% equity this week by paying extra toward principal 

**Options:** 

\-We can rent our place out starting 2 years after purchase (we could rent it for at least a couple hundred higher than the mortgage/taxes/insurance, but we aren’t sure if we want to be landlords)

\-We could try to sell it (places in our building are selling for the same or slightly more than our place) and then rent again, but this feels like a step backward. We could try to buy a new place, but we don’t have a down payment yet beyond our equity and it feels wasteful to buy again so soon.

\-We could try to wait it out and see if the situation improves

**Complicating factors:** We want to start a family in a couple years. I know we shouldn’t try to time the market, but interest rates are so low right now and it’s a seller’s market. Home prices continue to increase.

I appreciate any advice you can give us. We try to be frugal so we are frustrated by how this has worked out; I wish we had waited a little longer to buy. To anyone on the fence--renting is not so bad! Enjoy the flexibility!

Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) is a telecommunications company which provides products and services related Network, Cloud, Security, Voice, and Managed Services to enterprise, SME, and retail customers.
Lumen is aiming to position itself as a key infrastructure partner underpinning public and private cloud, edge computing and fiber connectivity. LUMN is building its services with 4 key areas in mind:

1. Physical assets and infrastructure – These include fiber, hardware and facilities.

2. Software managed networking – This is a network-as-a-service (NaaS) offering that can be leveraged to connect organisations with

3. Hybrid Cloud – These include private cloud and datacentres, colocation services and connections with public cloud service provider partners.

4. Lumen Orchestrator – This is the orchestration solution that allows for the management and control of the various services that are offered.

I am currently bearish about LUMN with no immediate plans to invest (although in the event of the price dropping into the single digits, I would re-evaluate this position). There are a few key reasons for this, but I encourage you to read the full bullish, bearish, and neutral considerations in the rest of the post:

1. LUMN earns a significant portion of its revenues from legacy offerings e.g., traditional telephony. This revenue stream has been decreasing YoY for the last few years and this is likely to continue. 

2. Despite the above, there are significant areas of potential for LUMN – specifically in their Edge Computing and software defined networking offerings (see Organisational Summary below). Edge Computing is only a small % of current revenues and while it is likely to grow, it will take time to significantly grow these streams. I view the Edge Computing growth as a slow burner and small market, but this will grow at a rapid rate in the future.

3. LUMN has a high level of debt, and while they have managed to de-lever and reduce interest rates, the amount of debt is still significant. When accounting for intangibles and goodwill, the level of liabilities is roughly 1.6x the value of assets (although specifically looking at long term debt this is a healthier picture at 70% of non-current assets).

4. Revenues have been consecutively down for the last few years and are unlikely to show a significant turnaround next year. This is somewhat mitigated by improvements in margin which are expected to continue and a healthy level of free cash flow at $2,770 although this has been declining YoY.

# Detailed Analysis

### Bull Considerations

- $LUMN are well positioned to become significant players in high potential markets – specifically fiber and underlying network infrastructure, NaaS and Edge computing.

- $LUMN has several verticals it can offer to customers including Hybrid Cloud, Connected Security and Collaboration. These can be leveraged to grow revenue streams in parallel (i.e., cross selling products and services to customers).

- Successfully managed to de-lever the company from previous debts. While this is a great deleveraging trend and a significant reduction in interest rates by redeeming outstanding 5.375% and 7.00% notes^(1) and replacing them with 4% bonds, the level of debt is still a concern (see bearish consideration item 1).

- The dividend from $LUMN has been consistent and relatively attractive (although on a yield basis this is less so if the price continues to rise). The board are committed to continuing the dividend payment and at the present time it can be safely assumed that $0.25 will be paid per share per quarter for the remainder of FY21. Dividend yield should not be the primary reason for going into $LUMN as yield is ~ 7% (at a stock price of $13.70). In the event of a dip to single digits, the dividend becomes extremely attractive and is worth considering (at a yield of &gt; 9%).

- Despite the overall reduction in EBITDA (see bearish item 4), EBITDA margin has improved and is likely to continue improving into FY21 due to cost cutting measures being pushed by executive leadership.

- Significant number of insider purchases throughout 2020 with one sale.


### Bear Considerations

- Overall, there are likely to be better candidates for returns on investments than LUMN, while LUMN is in a number of attractive areas, it is still growing revenues and these are unlikely to materialise in any significant manner over the next year or two. See competitive advantage section for additional details.

- $LUMN holds significant long-term debt of $31,837 (down from $34,694 in 2019). This debt is primarily due to $LUMN’s all in play to fiber (at the expense of 5g) when they purchased Level 3 Communications for $34,000. It is worth noting that $LUMN has not had an issue with either paying down debt and paying dividends with its current cash flow.

- $LUMN earns a substantial portion of revenues from legacy services. These include voice ($391 in 4Q20) which approximates to 29% of overall revenue. As can probably be guessed, this has regularly declined over the course of FY20. While not all the voice revenue is likely to be a “legacy” product, I am considering it as such as there are likely to be other legacy revenue streams. (N.B. According to $LUMN legacy revenues primarily include voice, private line (including special access), switched access and other ancillary services.)

- $LUMN is facing lengthening sales cycles for its products and services as their customers (and more likely organisations in general) continue to evaluate new infrastructure needs and delay purchasing unless necessary. This is likely to continue until at least 2022 as cost pressure at organisations globally push down purchases.

- Revenues are down both QoQ and YoY with EBITDA down YoY and there is no expectation that they will increase next year with best estimates at stable revenue / EBITDA and worst-case a reduction. YoY revenues have decreased for both FY20, FY19 and FY18, although the rate of decrease has reduced over time.

- Free cash flow while still high is reducing over time and will continue to do so as LUMN are likely to continue to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and paying off its long-term debt.

- Executive compensation (specifically focussing on CEO compensation) is above average for the industry at $17M (compared to an average of $10M for similar sizes). It is worth noting that when comparing against larger companies or those listed as competitors, this level of compensation was not unusual. Compensation did stabilise as performance dropped, however, no decrease in compensation occurred despite the decrease in earnings. While not initially a problem, if the results do not turn around, and there is no decrease in compensation, there is a concern that executive pay is no longer in line with the company’s results.


### Neutral Considerations

- Long term credit rating (Moody’s) – Ba3: Speculative with substantial - high credit risk.

- Speculative Grade Liquidity Ratings – SGL-2: Good liquidity, will be able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months through mostly internal resources but may rely on external sources of committed financing.

- Southeastern Asset Management has increased its position in $LUMN as of Dec 2020. It is worth noting that they have lost (~25%) on the investment to date^(2). Despite this, they remain bullish on the overall prospects as the CEO has tightened controls on costs and margin improves. Additionally, they believe $LUMN can monetise several segments they are in (specifically fiber), and that as a multiple of free cash flow (&lt; 5 at the time of investing) is an attractive valuation. As a final point, they have signed an NDA with $LUMN, and this indicates a higher and more “activist” level of engagement^(3). I have listed this as neutral despite the bullish sentiment of SAM, as their track record for the last year has not been great compared to the overall market.

- $LUMN will be seeing reduced subsidy revenue (from CAF II – A US initiative to improve connectivity) with subsidies declining to $20 by 2022. However, $LUMN believes their investment into providing this connectivity is likely to add to revenue that will make up for the loss in subsidy.


### Organisation Summary

Essentially Lumen Combine underlying infrastructure with platforms (i.e., cloud PaaS) and Applications (SaaS):

1. Adaptive Networking – High performance network connectivity i.e., on premise private lines, Content Delivery Network, fiber internet connectivity, direct cloud connections (where they provide corporate WAN infrastructure a direct link to Cloud) and managed networking services / consulting.
  - Content delivery network market growth is forecast to grow at 14% till 2025^(4).
  - Fiber Internet connectivity in the US grew at 12% from 2019-202022 and will likely continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years. Across the EU growth rates are largely similar for both coverage growth and subscriber growth^(5).
  - Software defined networking offerings (Networking as a service) is an expanding industry and likely to see significant growth of 34% annually till 2026^(6).
  - Growth rates and industry sizes for private lines and direct cloud connections are not easily available. I believe direct cloud connections are a growth area and likely to grow at a reasonable 10-15% annually for the next few years (based on over all cloud growth, increase in colocation and deployment of data centres – see Hybrid Cloud below).

2. Collaboration - VOIP, teleconferencing, collaboration solutions (e.g., file sharing and virtual meeting rooms all hosted by Lumen, but the products can be from vendors like Zoom, Webex Skype etc.), contact centres and calling services (e.g., traditional phone style calling both locally and internationally as well as toll free / business numbers. Also advanced emergency services support).
  - VOIP is relatively mature industry with a CAGR of 12% (at best) till 2025^(7). Personally, I think we can discount any mobile VOIP growth as I do not believe LUMN has offerings in this space and in my view, this would lower the effective CAGR with 8-10% looking a more reasonable target.
  - Call centre growth is forecast to grow at 6% till 2027^(8). The US houses over 60% of call centres globally, and this number is only going to decrease as increased internet penetration and decreased telecom rates drive the outsourcing of call centres^(9).
  - Numbers and growth rates to traditional telephony are limited but I imagine that growth is probably negative. For toll free, business numbers and emergency services support, growth is likely positive but limited.
  - Collaboration solutions are growing at a reasonably high rate of 13% till 2027^(10). However, LUMN is limited to managing, implementing, running, and hosting products from other vendors as they do not sell their own.

3. Connected Security – Threat management (managed threat intelligence), managed SOC services, WAF and DDoS mitigation, managed firewalls, and professional services.
  - The WAF market is expected to grow at 18% annually till 2022^(11).
  - The DDoS mitigation market is set to grow at 15% annually till 2026^(12).
  - The managed security services are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% till 2025^(13). While I think managed firewall growth is likely to be less than other managed security services (e.g., IAM, SOC etc), a growth rate of 4-6% is probable.

4. Edge Computing – Managed services, connections to both public cloud and private data centres, networking, colocation, cloud. Essentially connecting edge locations / end user servers to backbone infrastructure. 
  - Edge computing as an industry is forecast to grow at ~25% annually till 2025^(14). However, it is currently a small market valued at ~ $ 2,000 in 20201. Edge computing as a market can be further subdivided into hardware, platform, and services. Hardware is expected to grow at the fastest rate of the three potentially reaching 40%^(15).

5. Hybrid Cloud – Cloud storage, disaster recovery (data replication and business continuity), hosting services, data centres, private and public cloud alongside consulting for cloud.
  - The private cloud market is expected to grow at 29% annually till 2025. Private cloud growth will primarily be driven by businesses who wish to take advantage of public cloud capability with the addition of potentially more secure and customisable hosting resources. On-premises cloud growth will be significantly lower than provider hosted options (PaaS / IaaS) which are likely to hit 50%^(16).
  - Hosting services are likely to increase in market size by 15% annually^(17).
  - Deployment of data centres are likely to increase slowly over the next few years with a growth rate not likely to exceed 10% (estimated at 6% for 2021^(18)). Similarly, colocation services are likely to see a modest 14% CAGR^(19).
  - Global cloud storage is expected to increase at a rate of 20% till 2025^(20).

### Competitive Advantage

1. Adaptive Networking:
 - Summary: A large revenue earner with solid growth potential. $LUMN is a large player in the infrastructure space and should be able to leverage that to provide organisations with NaaS and global fiber connectivity.
 - From a coverage perspective (compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T as of 2019), $LUMN serves 16% of the population, with Verizon and AT&amp;T serving 17% and 41% respectively. It is worth noting that $LUMN covers more states than either^(21, 22). N.B. this view is for consumers but presumably also can also be applied to corporate coverage.
 - $LUMN is relatively well positioned from a fiber perspective as they have a lot of “unique coverage” (i.e., locations served without significant competition) in the US and have coverage in Europe and Asia. They carry a large portion of internet traffic on their network backbone and have 180,000 locations globally which provide their customers direct access to $LUMN infrastructure. Additionally, they have direct connectivity to several cloud service providers and data centres. Compared to competitors, they appear to have the largest total fiber route^(23).
 - The software defined networking offerings are an exciting growth opportunity and combined with the strong infrastructure position of $LUMN will mean that customers (particularly those that are multinationals and large enterprises) can utilise the network as a service offering to connect their enterprise infrastructure efficiently and effectively across the globe including connections from on-premises to cloud service providers.
 - While competitors do exist, from both a software defined networking perspective (e.g., Fortinet, Cato etc.) and an infrastructure perspective (e.g. Verizon, AT&amp;T etc.) $LUMN has the advantage of being a strong player in both areas with good partnerships with Cisco and VMWare.

2. Collaboration:
 - Summary: Largely a legacy business and revenue generator for $LUMN. This will be a shrinking revenue area for $LUMN as the decline in traditional legacy telephony services is unlikely to be made up for by any growth in VoIP or collaboration solutions. Additionally, this area is a large revenue earner for $LUMN, and significant declines here would result in material impact to value.
 - While implementing and managing VoIP, teleconferencing and collaboration solutions with partnered vendors (e.g., Zoom) are likely to show some little to moderate growth over the coming years, they will likely provide consistent revenue due to the underlying network requirements needed to effectively utilise such solutions.
 - Traditional telephony services including contact / service centres and business telephony service revenues are likely to shrink over the coming few years.

3. Connected Security:
 - Summary: The cybersecurity market is an exciting growth area which holds significant potential for $LUMN. However, it remains a small % of overall revenues and so revenue growth in-line with industry expectation will not materially impact the overall value of $LUMN.
 - If $LUMN can leverage their verticals in the datacentre / cloud space to cross sell their security services this could see some reasonably large growth, but overall due to the small footprint of $LUMN in the cloud space presently, material value growth due to this vertical is likely be several years out.
 - Additionally, $LUMN is not a recognised global player in this industry unlike Akamai or NetScout, and so will be at a disadvantage compared to incumbents with higher profile portfolios.

4. Edge Computing:
 - Summary: This could be a strong growth area for $LUMN. Could be a way to take advantage of the potentially significant growth area of Edge computing. However, it is likely to significantly materialise only 1-2 years out with little revenue growth in this area prior to then as organisations slowly accept this paradigm shift. Additionally, it will be a highly competitive area that will require significant investment to grow and maintain an advantage.
 - As of 23 Feb 2021, $LUMN claims they provide 60% of enterprise locations with &lt;5ms latency to edge nodes. Their goal is 90% by the end of the year and their large fiber network leaves them at an advantage compared to competitors. (See Adaptive Networking).
 - An example from the 4Q20 earnings call was SAP using their Edge infrastructure to bring SaaS applications closer to customers and bypassing unnecessary internet traversal.
 - While $LUMN can leverage its underlying infrastructure and assets to push a solid offering, this is likely to be a highly competitive space with players including typical cloud service providers e.g. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and HPE as well as specialised players e.g. Mutable. Large cloud players will have both the hardware and software required to compete effectively with $LUMN while also being able to leverage their substantial public cloud technologies to gain an advantage.

5. Hybrid Cloud: 
 - Summary: If you are interested in taking advantage of private or public cloud growth then Lumen probably is not the best value even at its current multiple. This is due to low revenues (as a % of total revenues) from Cloud related activities. Additionally, this space is highly competitive and $LUMN does not appear to have the background or experience (it is working on growing its employee expertise) although they can potentially take advantage of their underlying infrastructure from their fiber and physical assets.
 - Personally, I believe Private Cloud is not a significantly growing area with potentially some shorter term increase due to pandemic pushing a more remote working / access focus. However, longer term 3-5 years out, I think hybrid cloud will be the dominant focus as organisations transition from private cloud to increased public cloud usage. Only 3% of enterprises use private cloud exclusively^(24).
 - If you are going to opt for growth within public cloud, there are higher growth options with AMZN, GOOG and MSFT although these are substantially higher in price. Alternatively, Cisco, HPE, or other smaller providers may work. A dedicated cloud provider will likely provide better value than $LUMN due to the low revenue share (see above).

&amp;#x200B;

 (Bloomberg) -- Tucked away among the Ford, Dodge and Chevy sedans, the 12,000-gallon storage container and the inoperable Caterpillar tractor being auctioned off by the U.S. government is an unusual item: 0.7501 of a Bitcoin.

The U.S. General Services Administration typically uses its auctions to sell surplus federal equipment to the general public. With lot 4KQSCI21105001, which goes up for auction in a week, the government is offering an amount of Bitcoin worth about $38,000 at Monday’s price.

The government doesn’t say where its surplus digital currency came from. And while it’s a far cry from the 30,000 Bitcoins auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2014 after they were seized from the Silk Road marketplace, the GSA auction is one more indication of how Bitcoin is becoming more and more mainstream.

On Wall Street, too, there is a newfound openness to the world’s most valuable digital currency: Custody banking giant Bank of New York Mellon Corp. said it will hold, transfer and issue digital currencies, while Mastercard Inc. announced plans to let cardholders transact in certain cryptocurrencies on its network. A Morgan Stanley unit known for picking growth stocks is considering adding Bitcoin to its possible bets and, last week, a person close to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the bank plans to reopen a trading desk for cryptocurrencies.

The Bitcoins auctioned off by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2014 were estimated at the time to be worth about $19 million, though the winning bid -- by venture capitalist Tim Draper -- wasn’t disclosed. Those coins would be worth $1.5 billion today as the cryptocurrency’s price has skyrocketed to almost $51,000.

personalfinance,"Need advice on refinancing. Recently took out personal loan, will this affect anything? I have several questions.","Need to know if it is worth it to refinance. 

Built our house two years ago. 4.375% Conventional loan with 5% down. When we closed, house was appraised at $380,000, original mortgage was $361,000. Current balance ~$349,000. 

We pay $216 per month for PMI. At this point in time, I am fairly certain that our property value has increased in value to the point where we could potentially get rid of the PMI if we refinance. There are houses very similar to ours in terms of size in my neighborhood selling for $420,000-430,000, and they do not have many of the extras that we have. 

Income:
I am salaried ($46,000/annually). Husband earns salary and commission (2020 - $103,000, 2019 - $93,000, 2018 - $96,000)

Debts:
Auto loan 1 - $621/month, Auto loan 2 - $617/month, Credit Card Monthly Minimums - $279, Personal Loan - $800/month

We recently took out the personal loan to pay off credit card debts that we accrued due to buying things for the house, home improvement projects, and medical bills from an emergency surgery I had to have. No recurring expenses, and we now use them sparingly and pay them off weekly. We were not having difficulty paying the credit cards and we paid more than the minimum each month, we just got the personal loan to get it paid off quicker and save money in interest over time. The credit card monthly minimums listed above are for some no-interest financing specials that were offered at certain stores. 

Our credit scores are about the same, and depending on the credit bureau they range from 675-720. No derogatory remarks. 

Not sure if there is any other information I should provide, but I am happy to provide additional info if needed. 


My questions are:

Will the recent personal loan interfere with getting approved to refinance? 

When they calculate DTI, what all do they use to determine that? Will they use our current mortgage? 

Will my husband’s commission be used when determining our income? He has been with the same employer for almost 4 years. I remember having to answer extra questions about his earnings when we got our original loan, but do not recall exactly how they determined our income.

Given our credit, can anyone provide a ballpark estimate of a rate we might qualify for? Zip code is 79416.

Quick background: this is the second year we have been married, but the first year we thought it might be easiest to have our taxes done since we had a lot of location moving, new jobs, marriage, etc. However H&amp;R Block charges us twice the normal amount since we are filing separately (we file this way because of my wife being in the Public Student Loan Forgiveness program), so I decided I wanted to do them this year.  

I was working on my taxes first through TurboTax, and when working through State taxes for Massachusetts, I am asked to enter my wife's Federal Total Income, and her Federal Adjusted Gross Income from her 2020 Tax Returns. This is to ensure that both of us are reporting the same income and financial information (per TurboTax). 

 Federal Total I believe is easy, just the total number from W-2's, but I haven't found a good way on the internet to figure out Adjusted Gross Income with the information I have. TurboTax I believe (I haven't been able to find that screen again) told me that I could find it on line 37 of the 1040 that's filled out upon completing taxes, but if I try to do hers first I'll need the same information from myself, which I also don't have since I haven't been able to finish mine either. 

Just hoping someone knows the right way to either navigate this situation, or calculate AGI correctly. Thanks for any and all help.

solar,Going crazy! Can only find one solar company in my area.,"I really want to get into solar, but it’s proving to be cost-prohibitive. I have looked into solar companies in my area, but internet searches yield mostly defunct companies, scammy looking websites, and “solar companies” that never return my calls.

Sunpro is the only legitimate company I have seen. But the quotes from them seem...high? In fact, I got a quote from them two years ago, and despite all the “solar prices keep going down!” rhetoric, the cost of installation is actually higher than it was 2 years ago, even when accounting for lower federal subsidies.

My latest quote was for a 9.23 kW system, which includes 26 LG 355 Solar Panels and 26 Enphase Microinverters. The cost for this is $43,056 before a $2000 “Clean Energy Rebate” and $10,675 federal tax credits. 

The quoted $30,381 comes out to, if I’m doing my math correctly, $3.29 per watt, which seems high from other quotes I’ve seen.

For reference, I’m in Southwest Louisiana near the border to Texas.

personalfinance,Is buying a new car really a horrible financial decision?,"I’ve up until recently only been able to buy older used cars (1k-3k price range) and have had access to space/tools do the vast majority of the repair and maintenance for these cars myself. 

   Just recently me and my wife have moved into a new place and we are thinking about getting a new (to us) car, as our current car is getting up in miles (160,000). I also no longer have access to an area to do my own repairs and maintenance. 

   My whole life I’ve been told buying a brand new car is a horrible financial decision, but in our current situation, I’m beginning to think that I may need to reevaluate that assumption.

(Also we live in Maui Hawaii, which I think - in general - has kind of a crummy car market, and much more limited options vs. someone living on the mainland (both used and new), which might mean that it’s not such a bad idea here, where on the mainland better deal could be had in the used market) 


The factors that are making me think a new car might not be such a bad idea 

1. Older cheaper car: any car that we could buy with cash upfront is more than likely going to need semi-frequent repairs and maintenance, much more than that of a new car. Being unable to do the work myself and also not knowing a good/reliable/honest/affordable mechanic leaves me feeling like there’s a decent chance I’ll get stuck with repair costs exceeding any money I might save by getting an older cheaper car.

2. Nicer used car: buying a nice newer-ish used car from a used car lot doesn’t seem like a great option either, dealer markup is quite high, and cars from dealerships seem like the only way to get it financed, as banks and credit unions have told us they don’t finance cars from private parties (or that it would be a personal loan at a much higher interest rate) it also seems that the interest rate on used cars is quite a bit higher than a new car (even from a dealer), whereas sometimes the interest rate on a brand new car can be lower than inflation. There’s also no sort of warranty or even expectation that a car in this “newer used” category will not also turn out to need a lot of maintenance or repairs, so there’s still risk involved.
 
We are by no means rich (id guess me and my wife together have a combined gross income of around 80-90k, and monthly expenses of around 4K, my wife has a very good credit score of 750, and I’m low 700s) I’m really worried about making the best decision here to save us the most money in the long term. Am I barking up the wrong tree thinking buying a new car is decent way to go?",finance

investing,Stimulus bill treasury bond sale,"So what I've gathered lately from the market is that US treasury bonds have been selling poorly and thus the yield has been going up on the ten year bond. Something about investors won't buy it unless it has a higher interest rate because fear of inflation. Now that we're on the verge of signing in a 1.9 trillion stimulus bill, I have a some questions about the effect on the bond market.

* When does the US treasury sell the 1.9 trillion in bonds to pay for it?
* Does it do it in one massive sale? What types of bonds does it sell (2 year, 5 year, 10 year)?
* If bonds are already selling poorly, then wouldn't a massive influx of bonds on the market make the yield situation even worse?
* Are investors/banks prepared to buy it all up? Or will the federal reserve step in and buy the remainder?
* Is it therefore possible that the signing of the stimulus will actually hurt stocks in the short term due to bond market/yield fluctuations?
* Can anyone explain what happened with US treasury/bonds during the 2 trillion stimulus last year? Or the 900 billion stimulus earlier this year?

Thanks for any insight guys! New to the bond side of the market",finance

I've had roughly the same pay each year. The only difference is that I have a slightly higher interest income in 2020, total of $3500 (from CD accounts, and now the interest has dropped dramatically so I don't think I'll get the same amount next year). I do not own a brokerage account and do not have other sources of income.

This time, Turbotax automatically calculated 4 payment vouchers of estimated payments of $984 quarterly, which I feel is a lot. Did something go wrong? I've already e-filed federal return.

personalfinance,What to do with extra income after maxing out other options?,"My wife and I are maxing out our 401k's, maxing out IRA contribution, putting a sufficient amount into our son's 529 college savings account, are finally debt free and have a sufficient emergency fund in our savings account. So far I've been putting leftover income into an S&amp;P 500 index fund, but worry it's not the wisest to continue putting everything into that. What is the best place to put the extra money? We're not savings for anything in particular, but would be nice if in a few years we can take out a chunk of money for a big (but reasonable) purchase. We are currently in our mid-30's, and we only really started being able to start seriously savings (contributing to 401k etc) a few years ago, so I do feel like we're playing catch-up. Here's what I've considered, with reasons why I'm not sure:

* Target-date fund: I like this option since it will allocate the money to an appropriate mix of stocks and bonds over time. But I don't know a lot about this outside of it being a 401k option. Am I allowed to purchase target date funds through a broker like Vanguard outside of a 401k? Since it includes bonds, is that money locked up, or can I sell it as easily as I could an index fund?
* CD: The current CD rates seem so low that it doesn't seem like an attractive, even if safe, alternative to mutual/index funds, plus my money would be locked up in the CD.
* High Yield Savings Account: The highest interest rate online savings account I've seen is only 0.5% APY. Again, doesn't seem worth it over mutual/index funds, and don't really want to spread out my money across numerous institutions too much.
* Car purchase: We're looking to buy a new car this spring/summer. We could put down a very large down payment (if not buy it outright), but I've also read that that doesn't make sense unless the interest rate on the car is more than something like 4% (which it wouldn't be); that it would still be better to invest the money elsewhere and make payments on the car. How true is that?
* Other index/mutual funds: Diversify the index or mutual funds I'm putting the money into (beyond just the S&amp;P 500 Index fund). I don't really know where to start though. What would be a good compliment to the S&amp;P 500 Index?
* Just keep on keeping on: Keep building up my S&amp;P 500 Index funds.",finance

When the Fed creates more fiat money, we experience inflation (the values of $1 decreases over time), so wouldn't the same apply to Doge?

personalfinance,Go for cash-out or normal refinancing?,"I bought my house for 320K about four years ago under market value.  I've put probably $20K of improvements into it since then, and by local comparisons, I estimate it's worth around 400K.  I owe 288K on it with a 3.85% interest rate, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, no PMI.  I have excellent credit.  I figure I should refinance no matter what to get a better interest rate.  I don't mind reducing the mortgage period somewhat if it substantially reduces my interest rate, but down to 15 years might be a little tight.

I'm now trying to figure out whether I should do a cash-out refinancing or normal refinancing.  I do want to put in a second bathroom, which I'm estimating will cost about $10K, and make about $5K of other improvements.  I don't have the cash handy to do that.  That seems to suggest cash-out would be better.  But I've also read that interest rates can be significantly higher for cash-out refinancing.  

Basically, there are so many possibilities that I'm a bit overwhelmed.  Thoughts about which option will save money?  Is there any information missing here?

personalfinance,My previous job messed up my 401K contributions and now my W2,"Context: I worked at a small company for a year and a half and the management was a shit show. The CFO was caught embezzling and turns out she wasn't even a CPA as listed. During the transition, we got a new accountant which I thought okay I guess it's time to start contributing to my 401k.

Signed up through Nationwide (5% Roth 401k)  and once I left I thought I transfered my Roth 401k to my Roth IRA with Fidelity. 

Got my W2 last Monday because it never arrived in the mail even though I had followed up in January about making sure my address was correct (it was not correct) and they took a picture of it and emailed it to me. Went to do my taxes this weekend and the filing apps wouldn't let me submit because my Federal wages were less than my State wages. My last paystub had my YTD income and the state income doesn't match that amount either. Additionally, my employer was taking my 401k from pretax dollars and submitted my rollover as pretax to pretax even tho my form was roth to roth. I confirmed with Nationwide that I had selected roth and that it had been overlooked by them (and clearly by my employer). I'm not able to access any nationwide documents anymore and they told me that my employee would have those documents.

I'm kind of lost on what to do to get this rectified. I can pay the taxes on what was transfered to my IRA if it really comes down to it (only got 3 paychecks worth before I quit so the amount is relatively low even with employer match). I just don't know where they're getting these numbers. Also on my paystub it says that my medical insurance is taxable yet its under the deductions from gross wages section. I'm not inclined to believe anything they say because they're incompetent. 

TLDR; my previous employer didn't file my 401k correctly and I can't file my taxes due to the W2.",finance
personalfinance,Do I have to pay taxes on an income of $350 from investments?,"The title is an oversimplification.

For the record, I don't know anything about taxes. I have NEVER been employed, made income or had to file taxes and do not understand how any of this works so please forgive my ignorance.

In 2020 I dipped my toes in stock market for the first time and invested a small amount. According to the 1099 form I made just under $200 total in short term gains, ordinary dividends and qualified dividends across 2 different brokerages. In addition I made another $150 or so in interest from 2 different high yield savings accounts and a 2% interest rate certificate of deposit I made in 2019 back when rates were much higher. So this is $350 or so in total from all of these sources.

On one hand I was told that I don't have to file taxes since I made so little. On the other hand I was told that the fact that I made any money in investments means that I have to file.

1. Do I have to file for taxes?
2. And if so, would I have to speak to a tax professional or would that free software online do the job?

Another reason I am interested in this is because after I applied for the economic impact statement I received a letter in the mail from the IRS saying I would not be getting the money because I have never filed a tax return. It would be ideal to be able to file for the $350 and be able to receive that money.",finance
personalfinance,"Our landlord is offering to sell us the condo we rent for what she paid for it, plus realtor fees. Thoughts and advice?","So we rent a condo in Northern Virginia for currently $1430 a month. We had a three year lease that ends at the end of this upcoming May (2021). We weren't sure whether we could continue renting or if we wanted to try to buy a condo, so we went ahead and got pre-qualified for a mortgage with our credit union. We were qualified for $260k. It is a special deal where teachers who are first time buyers still get a good interest rate (2.5%) and reduced mortgage insurance despite paying no down payment. My parents bought their townhouse with a similar no-down-payment plan before I was born and refinanced down the road when they could. I know it isn't a scam. It is a 30 year adjustable rate mortgage (we know adjustable is risky).

We have about $20k in total savings and a combined monthly take-home income of about $3300. We both have excellent credit (married couple). Our only outstanding debt is a car that will be paid off in a year. We do have a lot of regular medical bills but we have good insurance from a secure job.

Our aging landlord doesn't want to keep the property past our tenancy, and just offered to sell it to us for what she paid for it ($165k) ""plus just enough to cover the cost of the paper work."" I've been putting a very high estimate for what she means by that, at $10k, and been calculating things based on a $175k mortgage. We would deal with her realtor, who we we've met/worked with before and he seems great. We wouldn't hire a realtor but we'd probably be paying for an inspection and some lawyer hours to get a professional eye on the contract. We want someone with a fiduciary responsibility to us involved.

The closing costs would possibly be about $7-8k. The mortgage payment would be about $770 a month, the annual taxes about $2715. The condo association fee is $48 a month (EDIT: My bad, that is only one fee! There are two here. The other fee is $167 a month. I had only see the first one on listings). We don't know yet what we would pay for homeowners insurance. Our utility bills would stay the same.

Recent maintenance: HVAC replaced, washer/dryer replaced, toilet replaced, fridge repaired, dryer vent cleaned, air vents sanitized. Not much maintenance was done prior to our tenancy and most of condo is as it was when it was built in the 80s.

Repairs that would likely need to be done before we sell: Re-tiling shower wall, replace stained laminate flooring from former tenants throughout condo, replace shitty old built-in microwave, replace windows and screens, replace  2 overhead fan lighting fixtures, some other small repairs.

These are repairs we would like to do for our own sake anyway.

Ideally we'd want to sell within 5 years and buy a better place. If we can.

Any thoughts? Things we've overlooked? Things we should consider? We haven't committed to this yet and told our landlord that we'd think about it. Please ask any clarifying questions you need to!

Edited to add: It's now worth somewhere between $230k and $246k.

Another edit: While the mortgage we pre-qualified for is adjustable rate, it is different than the normal ones they offer. It can only change once every 5 years. So if we sell within 5 years, I hope I am right in thinking that the adjustable rate thing shouldn't have a big impact.

Another another edit: It is FHA eligible",finance

CryptoCurrency,"So I've been looking over and weighing up my options with crypto earning platforms. My three choices are between BlockFi, Celcius and Nexo. What are your opinions on them?","They all have some benefits and from what I've seen they're all pretty good. So I'm unable to make a decision. Instead, I'll go over some pros and cons of what I know so far.

Celcius and Nexo both have their own ""rewards"" coin, or so you might call it. I don't totally like the idea but I can see why they do it. I doubt it would moon anytime soon but it's not a bad investment necessarily. BlockFi doesn't have a coin of their own which I like, meaning that I can focus my money on BTC and ETH.

In terms of interest, they all seem similar but BlockFi has some really good interest rates, while Celcius and Nexo need you to buy their coin and have it as a large part of your portfolio to earn the biggest interest rates. Overall, they're all about 5-6%, which is pretty good still, although BlockFi does seem to exceed this. Subject to change though, BlockFi could get such an influx of users that they're forced to reduce interest.

I also know that both Celcius and Nexo are insured, a big selling point, while BlockFi doesn't seem to be, only backed by Gemini's security. Celcius and Nexo also seem to be quite a bit larger, so they're likely more secure and more heavily backed. Another big point for Celcius and Nexo.

In terms of apps, Celcius is mobile-only. I am very inclined against this, especially considering if I lost my phone, or broke it. I would have to use a family members phone and that would be really inconvenient. Nexo does have a desktop app, unlike Celcius, so that's another point in its direction... but I would say that it may improve security in some aspects.

Another thing to consider would be what exactly is the background and reputation of these companies? I haven't looked extensively into all of them, but I'm sure my funds would be safe regardless.

Any points that I missed? Let me know and leave your votes and opinions. My main goal is really just to have a safe-ish place to passively earn good compounding interest on my BTC and ETH.

Forex,Daily Gapper (But be warned!),"&amp;#x200B;

First of all. This pair will be directly affected by this afternoons BoC interest rate decision which COULD be a big deal but here's my thoughts.

Technically, the pair has completed a full BCR of the 15m moving averages.

There is a golden cross underway.

Entry criteria will be sniper crits on side as well as a break through of the 1.50600 level which is the previous highs.

We COULD see a 4h 8EMA gap formed in two hours should price fail to break the 1.50600 level which would put me OFF this trade idea.

Now, BoC are deciding on rates today. I strongly believe the rates will remain unchanged for the cad. My reasons for this are:

The economic reconditioning process in place to counteract the effects from the pandemic has been highly effective with their growth overtaking their prior forecasts. From my findings, the BoC's original trajectory for growth recovery was levels around 4% increase in GDP when in fact, their GDP actually smashed through at a staggering 9.6% increase which is great.

As we touch on other factors, we have seen Oil prices surge and we also have the US currently showings signs of strong economic recovery (at least for now) too which will likely keep CAD relatively afloat.

However, ALL this provides is reasoning behind CAD rates remaining the same. The fact is, rates remaining stable isn't great in itself at 0.25% and the Canadian economy has a really long way to go before it reaches the end of its reconditioning process and therefore, I expect the unchanged rates this afternoon to stagger the CAD and bolster the EC trade idea overall.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, Risk.**

&amp;#x200B;

CAD rates are released this afternoon at 3pm gmt. I expect we could see an entry prior to the release of this news. SHOULD the trade trigger 30 minutes before the release, you are NOT to take it. Should the trade trigger 15 minutes AFTER the release, you are NOT to take it.

&amp;#x200B;

On that basis, anytime before 2:30pm gmt is fine to take the position so long as you have a conservative approach.

&amp;#x200B;

Risk allocation for this idea will be 0.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

If the position is triggered at 3:30pm my risk allocation will double to 1.0% (although I feel this will be highly unlikely).

&amp;#x200B;

So, i think i've given you a good enough breakdown.

MachineLearning,[R] Barlow Twins: Self-Supervised Learning via Redundancy Reduction,"Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.03230v1.pdf

Authors: Jure Zbontar, Li Jing, Ishan Misra, Yann LeCun, Stéphane Deny

Abstract: 
Self-supervised learning (SSL) is rapidly closing the gap with supervised methods on large computer vision benchmarks. A successful approach to SSL is to learn representations which are invariant to distortions of the input sample. However, a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial constant representations. Most current methods avoid such collapsed solutions by careful implementation details. We propose an objective function that naturally avoids such collapse by measuring the cross-correlation matrix between the outputs of two identical networks fed with distorted versions of a sample, and making it as close to the identity matrix as possible. This causes the representation vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar, while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors. The method is called Barlow Twins, owing to neuroscientist H. Barlow's redundancy-reduction principle applied to a pair of identical networks. Barlow Twins does not require large batches nor asymmetry between the network twins such as a predictor network, gradient stopping, or a moving average on the weight updates. It allows the use of very high-dimensional output vectors. Barlow Twins outperforms previous methods on ImageNet for semi-supervised classification in the low-data regime, and is on par with current state of the art for ImageNet classification with a linear classifier head, and for transfer tasks of classification and object detection.

CryptoCurrency,I want to know the worst possible scenario,"Hi guys, Iv'e been deep into crypto for the past three months and before that, I was observing from the distance since 2017. 

So ok, I got it, HODL, DCA, diversify, set your goals, invest only what you can afford to loose, cold wallet, stake it, do your own research... I'd say I'm doing the correct baby steps, and I have to say you guys have been incredibly helpful and awsome.

That being said, I have to go back to the last one, ""do your own research"". As we know we tend to get fed information according to our interests, and that means, most of us (newbies like me above all) end up reading and watching the same articles/videos about how its gonna keep going up  and new protocols and new better and faster technology and big companies starting to back it up or thinking about doing it...

But, like probably everyone here, I want to know what is the worst thing that can happen to crypto. Not the classical bad rap speech, but the thorough analysis by well educated professionals on why crypto and DeFi are not viable for the future and the bubble will explode and everyone will loose all their money. 

So, asyou have done a few times already, will you guys educate me with some links ? 

If there is a post already about this, kindly direct me to it please. If not, I will edit this one adding the links on which you guys seem to have consensus about their validity.

Big thanks!!!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Which Should I Pay In Full First?,"Since mid way through 2020 my wife and I have been using the snowball method and a detailed spreadsheet as we work to pay our debts down to zero.  With the coming stimulus payment my wife and I will be looking to receive a combined $4200 based on the current calculations.  As such we have been debating on how to use that money to resolve some of our debts.

One option is to pay a credit card balance of $4117, which has a interest rate of 24.99%.  Based on the snowball calculation this card would be paid off in 2022 at the current rate (it's next in line for bigger payments).

The second option is that I have two 401k loans I took out in 2020 to try to stay afloat after my wife lost her job for a time.  The first of these loans is currently at $3528.85 with payments per paycheck of $42.65, and the second is at $3552.57 with payments of $55.22.

All of these things are within reach of resolution, but I can only pay one of them in full.  I know that credit cards carry a significant amount of interest to them, but if I pay off one of those 401k loans that would increase my paychecks and I could turn around and use that money to increase our savings or increase the snowball amount we are paying out.

No matter which I pay it will help significantly as we move toward our goal.",finance
personalfinance,Solo 401k vs Employee 403b contributions,"I am planning on maxing my 401k deferred contributions (19.5k) this year. I have a side gig that will gross enough and have a main job with a 403b. I usually prefer handling my money and was originally leaning on contributing to the solo 401k. However, I understand deferring my side gig income will lose the QBI deduction. I am in the 22% federal margin and with the QBI my margin comes down to 17.6%. This means I will lose $850 in tax benefit if I contribute through the solo 401k. Given this difference, I am planning on contributing via the employer 403b.

Trading,Waiting On The Fed's Calvary,"We’ve been writing that any time the Fed does not buy “enough” US Treasuries, we would expect almost everything except for the USD to fall. The Fed seems to recognize that it has a problem, but does not appear ready to act more aggressively yet. With that said, we would point out two critical pieces of information:

1. Given their size, US financial markets are now the leading indicator for the real economy, not the other way around – while the US economy is recovering, the US Treasury market and increasingly the stock market have softened in recent weeks. If stocks and bonds fall too far, it likely will not be long until they begin to drag down the real economy like we saw in 4q18 and into 1q19.

2. Because of the US government’s debt position (and the combination of global sovereign debt positions and the ongoing de-dollarization of global FX reserves more broadly), this is the first economic recovery in decades where the Fed will likely have to respond to rising inflation by INCREASING liquidity (i.e. growing their balance sheet to cap UST yields) rather than by withdrawing liquidity.

We continue to expect near term volatility in these assets, but ultimately, we are investing our own money from the view that the US fiscal situation ultimately cannot abide anything other than increasingly negative real rates for an extended period of time. And so, while Bitcoin, and Stock positions have taken a hit in recent weeks, we have not changed our views because ultimately, rising rates brings forward the date of more easing measures",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto and it's potential to transform certain protest movements, specifically the war tax resistance movement .","During the vietnam war, Alexander Haig, a general in the army and an advisor to the white house said the following about Vietnam war protestors:  
&gt;**""Let them march all they want, as long as they continue to pay their taxes.""**   

That statement basically sums up what war tax resisters do, instead of marching in big protests, they do not pay their taxes.   War tax resistance is the refusal to pay some or all taxes that pay for war, and may be practiced by conscientious objectors, pacifists, or those protesting against a particular war or certain weapons of war (nuclear).   War Tax resisters are distinct from ""tax protesters,"" who deny that the legal obligation to pay taxes exists or applies to them. War Tax resisters may accept that some law commands them to pay taxes but they still choose to resist taxation.   The USA's military budget is bigger than the next 7 or 8 top ten big spenders combined.  It is estimated that about half of federal taxes goes to current and former military spending and its adjacent industries.  USA only spends about 3% of taxes on education.  So their is ample reasoning for these people to not want to pay war taxes.   Some war tax resisters will either pay 50% of their taxes or a symbolic 1$ or no tax at all.  Some will often use the tax money they don't spend, and give it to charity.  In this way, they demonstrate that the intent of their resistance is not selfish and that they want to use a portion of their earnings to contribute to the common good.  For instance, Julia Butterfly Hill resisted about $150,000 in federal taxes, and donated that money to after school programs, arts and cultural programs, community gardens, programs for Native Americans, alternatives to incarceration, and environmental protection programs. She said:
&gt;I actually take the money that the IRS says goes to them and I give it to the places where our taxes should be going. And in my letter to the IRS I said: ""I'm not refusing to pay my taxes. I'm actually paying them but I'm paying them where they belong because you refuse to do so.""

  So what role can crypto play in this ?  Well often war tax resisters openly declare to the IRS that they are protesting paying for war taxes.  They will often be a part of war tax resister groups and will simultaneously attend a protest on tax day, making their decision pubic.  These people are not trying to hide.  For some more high profil war tax resisters the IRS does send stronlgy worded letters with a bill for the tax amount.  Some will have their wages garnished, if they own property the IRS will try to seize it or seize bank accounts.  **Enter crypto.**  War tax resisters can put their net worth in unseizable money.  If you hold private key no one can take your crypto.  No order from the IRS or a judge can create a situation where you can lose possession of your crypto, it's the ultimate tool for war tax resisters.

Hell, one could even just do face to face in person cash transactions and they wouldn't even generate a tax liability.  I believe war tax resistance is going to get more popular as crypto becomes more mainstream.   You might ask ""why doesn't the IRS prosecute people?"".  They have in the past,  but their recent strategy has been to not create a media event surrounding the war tax resisters.  They have said in the past that the media attention of a trial only gives other people the idea to do it, and it's not worth the negative media attention.    
     Personally I have avoided paying taxes because I live a very modest lifestyle, one where I have a near zero tax obligation. It is illegal to not pay your taxes and I would never tell anyone that they should break the law.  However certain laws have been morally wrong in the past (segregation in the US and some might consider prohibition as well).  Some might say, when it comes to laws, that it is up to the sovereign individual to decide if its morally righteous or not to pay war tax or not.  Crypto is about taking control of your finances and becoming the arbiter of your destiny.  
     Up until now,  living modestly has been my way of participating in the war tax resistance movement.  However, I'm very thankful that i've stacked all my sats without kyc, because, should I ever decide to cash out, and have a tax liability, I definitely want the option of acting my conscious and not directly funding the killing of innocent people across the world.

Here's the deal: my husband and I have been in the process of looking for our first home in a tight real estate market. Everything is going for significantly over asking, and in order to be competitive, people are waiving appraisal contingencies. If you want to make a winning offer, it's essentially required. We found a house we loved over the weekend and bid and our offer was accepted. Between ourselves and our parents, using funds they already have, we can make the down payment without a problem. But we're starting to worry about the appraisal differential, which could potentially be substantial. 

On a parallel track, my mother has started collecting one of her two pensions and since she's still working full time at 66, she's about to get bumped into a higher income tax bracket. Within the past month, she was discussing with her accountant how to increase her deductions, because she wants to stay in the bracket she's in. One of the options they discussed was for her to take out a home equity loan...it would both allow her to refinance to a lower interest rate and increase the interest amount she can deduct on her taxes. She was still thinking about it when I called her and was complaining about how hard it is to come up with the appraisal differential, and without me asking, decided to apply for the home equity loan with the intention of giving the money to my husband and I to help with the appraisal differential. 

This would be a true gift, with no expectation or intention of repayment, and her lender would have no interest in the property my husband and I would buy, as the loan would be secured by my mother's  own real estate leaving her with a loan she is more than capable of repaying even if she were to lose her job because of her retirement income.

personalfinance,Am I getting screwed on my mortgage for new construction?,"Hello! I don't really have anyone to ask, so I figured I'd ask here to see if anyone has thoughts.

I'm in the process of having a new home constructed with a large, well-known builder. I decided to go with their mortgage company because they offer about $11k towards closing costs if I do.

Long story short, I was told a few weeks ago, and even signed a preliminary agreement of sale document showing it, that I would be at a 2.875% interest rate. For the past few weeks, I've been reaching out to the loan officer almost daily to get a formal rate lock agreement in place, but he's been dragging his feet and stalling, not getting back to me, etc.

He called me yesterday and said that the best he could do was 130 day lock at 2.875% interest with 1 point down. I said that doesn't work, because their own construction team said the house definitely won't be done by then and I won't be able to close, forcing me to go with whatever market rate is sometime in July.

He called me back today and said that now the best he can do for a lock is 3.375% at 1 point, a $3,400 ish fee just to lock in a higher interest rate than previously discussed. (Edit: This would put the lock until the end of July which should accommodate construction timelines.)

I'm obviously really frustrated, because I tried to lock my rate in as soon as possible but he's been taking his sweet time as rates rise.

**Two questions:**

1. Should I even have to be putting 1% (1 point) down on this mortgage to lock in a sub-par interest rate with an 800+ credit score and 20% down payment or are they screwing me?
2. Is there anything I can do short of walking away to get them to give me a better deal? If I walk away, they will allegedly keep the $9,000 in earnest money I've already put down just to get the construction going.

**Background info:**

* Credit score: 820
* House price: $427,000
* Down payment (20%): $85,400
* Loan amount: $341,600
* The lender and builder are the same company",finance
investing,"With ECB Rates In Holding Pattern, Asset Purchase Levels Become Focus This Week","The European Central Bank Governing Council is expected to continue the hands-off approach to interest rates Thursday following its two-day meeting, but recent gains in sovereign debt yields have analysts wondering if the euro area lender of last resort is ready to up its bond buys in the weeks ahead.

“With Eurozone yields having increased meaningfully, the 11 March meeting is shaping up to be an important one for the ECB,” BNP Paribas said in a note. “The increase in yields poses both a communication problem – markets seem to lack clarity about the ECB’s reaction function – as well as a decision problem – the governing council needs to think about whether, and how, to react to this increase.

Analysts at the French bank spelled out their expectations for how policymakers will deal with the situation in the title of their note: “When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping”, which in this case means stocking up on more assets through the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).

“The ECB will step up its PEPP purchases no later than following its 11 March meeting, we expect, in response to what it considers unwarranted recent yield increases,” the bank predicted. The analysts said specific yield or purchase targets were unlikely, but the council “will send an unambiguous signal to the market about its resolve to maintain accommodative financing conditions.”

Such brashness and clarity from the ECB may be a pipe dream as the organisation often thrives on life in the grey area. A case in point was the slightly hawkish shift at the last meeting in January, when the bank said, “If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.” There was no outline of how the bank defines “favourable”.

personalfinance,JUST received word about my 2019 Refund (1 year 1 month later),"Hello all,

I filed my taxes *electronically* and they were accepted around Feb 16, 2020. My state refund was issued almost immediately, however my federal refund never made its way back to me.

I would check using the Where'sMyRefund IRS website, and they would consistently tell me they had no information available. Unable to reach an IRS employee, I would check this website *at least* once per week.

FINALLY, yesterday, my refund details suddenly appeared on the Where'sMyRefund, and said it would be sent to me in a few days.

Just wanted to post, I personally was looking for other people in the same boat all last year, so if anyone else hasn't received their 2019 refund yet, keep faith! (tough to place faith in the federal government, but what choice do we have)",finance
personalfinance,Does tax software communicate with the IRS if you don't e-file? Can I still send in self-filled forms instead?,"**Edit**: Called the IRS to confirm it’s fine, just gonna submit by hand. Leaving up in case TurboTax tries to lie to someone else...

**Summary:** Used TurboTax Free File. Said ""File by Mail"" so I could look at the forms and think part of my income is reported on the wrong line. Haven't mailed anything, but the software thinks I'm done and won't let me back in to edit things. Figured I could just fill the forms correctly by hand and mail those but TurboTax customer service made me think that the company already communicated what's expected to the IRS. Is this true? 

**Details:** I'm a grad student receiving a [1099-MISC](http://pfforphds.com/what-is-a-1099-misc/). As I understand my stipend is supposed to be reported as a taxable scholarship in line 1 of the 1040. This usually requires some finagling of the tax software. I followed some [instructions](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/taxes/discussion/1099-misc-for-a-scholarship/00/1315466) to report the 1099 and then negate it and then hastily finished everything else and told it I was going to ""File By Mail"" to see if the forms looked right since the situation is not straightforward.
 
Everything is correct in terms of income/withholdings/refund/amount owed for my federal/state returns, but the amount appears in line 8 instead of line 1 on the 1040, despite the Schedule 1 statement, which shows the amount reported then negated for a total of 0 (Schedule 1 statement says total is 0, however schedule 1 line 8 shows total stipend amount, 1040 line 8 corresponds to Schedule 1 line 8 as it should). Honestly rereading, I think I made a mistake in following the instructions...

I wanted to try to fix it, but since I ""printed"" the documents TurboTax won't let me back in to edit the questionnaire (tried and failed to do [this](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/taxes/discussion/i-used-the-file-by-mail-option-but-i-need-to-make-a-change-before-mailing-turbotax-won-t-let-me-go/00/624008)). I figured it's fine, I'll just fill out the forms myself if I can't get back in, but maybe I can call customer service and they can do something for me to let me back in, since I haven't actually mailed anything. When I called though, the rep said that there's nothing I can do and in fact it's already filed minus the actual receipt of the documents. She made it sound like they have already communicated with the IRS even though I didn't e-file. 

**Three questions:**

* Do tax softwares really communicate anything to the IRS if you choose to file by mail rather than e-file? 

* Relatedly, can I just send in forms I fill myself instead of what they gave me even though I completed the process through to the software's end? (Maybe I'm violating some term of service???) 

* Am I worrying too much about which line the income appears in since the amounts are all correct, and should I just let it go and send in the return as is, maybe with an explanatory note? I'm just worried that the Schedule 1 statement is confusing since it adds up to 0 but the actual form has an amount after all, or that they'll think I'm trying to cheat them out of paying the tax amount it would be if it was self-employment, or something...

Thanks in advance for what's probably a stupid question!",finance

personalfinance,Brokerage accounts va paying off car loan?,"Hey everyone. Going to keep it extremely simple here.

Should I invest my money into brokerage accounts or pay down my car loan? It’s my only debt currently besides student loans which are a very low balance and some of my oldest accounts so I don’t want to pay them off.

The reason I ask is because when I purchased my car, I had shit credit (low 600s) and was smacked with a 10.5% interest rate. Unfortunately, I was in a pretty bad accident which tanked the value of my car so a refinance is out of the picture.

Remaining bal is $11K, monthly payment is $400. I am considering just paying double monthly until it’s paid off instead of beginning to invest because the way I see it is that I am getting a 10.5% ROI by paying this down quicker which is better than I would typically see with longterm investing.

dogecoin,Misconceptions Regarding Dogecoin FAQ V1.3,"This is a revised version of my previous article. I am going to try to update frequently. 

Version 1.3 has the following changes
- Shortened some questions, removed others and added others based on feedback from the community 
- Updated some of the spelling errors and minor typos. 

This information below is important. I ask that you please take the time to read this entire post before making judgment or commenting. My discord group helped me create this FAQ on the majority of the most asked questioned and misunderstandings regarding Dogecoin, into the following key points. Even if you know the answers to some of these please read the entire post. The information builds upon each other to explain some of the more questions near the end. 

1. Question: What is Dogecoin?

Answer: Dogecoin (/ˈdoʊdʒkɔɪn/ DOHJ-koyn, code: DOGE, symbol: Ð) is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system that is instant, fun, and free from traditional banking fees. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the popular ""Doge"" meme as its logo and namesake. It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community reaching a market capitalization of US $5,382,875,000 on January 28, 2021. [Wikipedia, 20210203]

2.  Question: Why Dogecoin?

Answer: For the Lolz. Well, not quite. Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!
		
1/2 - second perspective) Question: What Is Dogecoin? And why Dogecoin?

Answer: Back a few years ago, some crazy people banded together in support of a cryptocurrency known as Dogecoin. Similar to other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin, the people's crypto, finds itself with the support of hundreds if not thousands of individuals pushing for this currency to succeed. But why is that? Unless you have been absent from every social bubble, you may have heard of Bitcoin. For the purpose of this explanation, you will find that Bitcoin is not exactly an easy thing to equate to Dogecoin, but lets think about the criteria of a Cryptocurrency.Bitcoin did not find its foothold overnight. In fact, it took several years. A lot of people fought tooth and nail for their belief in the coin. Crypto, in a nutshell, is a decentralized form of currency that finds its value in a combination of individual asset involvement, ease or difficulty in security of an exchange, creating a method of reliable, secure, trustworthy exchange, and other reasons. 

Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me.Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, instead of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down. In essence, in 50 years, Dogecoin will still be around, still be mined, still be traded. Bitcoin will cease to be created, hoarded, and become the digital currency of the affluent.

3. Question: Places to buy dogecoin places where you can spend Dogecoin? 

Answer: Refer to r/dogecoin posts by the moderators for a list of businesses that accept doge as payment. 

4. Question: Cryptocurrencies vs stocks. The main differences between them. 
		
Answer:  
A stock is a type of investment that represents an ownership share in a company. Investors buy stocks that they think will go up in value over time. ... A stock is an investment. When you purchase a company's stock, you're purchasing a small piece of that company, called a share. 

A cryptocurrency:  (crypto for short) is a digital a sset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.

When comparing crypto to stocks, the main thing to keep in mind is that cryptocurrencies have few if any regulations applied to them. It is still the ""wild west"" of trading. You can be scammed, skimmed, pumped-dumped, as so forth, much more often and more easily than with stocks. Terminology is similar to exact between the two, but both require a certain mindset. Crypto is almost always a long-haul game, where stocks can be short play or long haul. Cryptocurrency is literally money. Cryptocurrencies intended purpose is to use it to exchange goods and services. The way paper money is. 

5. Question: Difference between cold storage, internet wallets and Robinhood/exchanges

Answer: 
Coldstorage - in the cryptocurrency world cold storage refers to physical objects/devices that contain your cryptocurrency. 

Wallets are an electronic program of service that stores your cryptocurrency. There a number of different wallets - but I personally use Dogecoin.info

Exchanges - an exchange is a company that holds a large sum of cryptocurrency - this case Dogecoin. They exchange fiat currency (paper money) for cryptocurrency. When you have your money on an exchange it is in the custody of the exchanges wallet until you transfer it to your personal wallet. Through legally binding user agreements you do technically own the coins, however in order to use your cryptocurrency you need to have it in your personal wallet. The same way you can’t use money in the bank - you have to cash out by withdrawing your money. Certain exchanges allow withdraw - others do not. Robhinhood currently doesn’t allow withdraws, but they are working on making this happen. 

If you would like to help increase the speed at which Robhinhood adds their withdraw feature read my article here:

6. Question: Is Dogecoin a meme or should it be taken seriously? 

Answer: We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of “widespread information”. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying “Dogecoin is the people’s coin” comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn’t matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald’s makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald’s make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald’s have “value” in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald’s do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

7. Question: Does Dogecoin have value? How does Dogecoin increase in price or decrease in price? 

Answer: Yes. Dogecoin has value. If didn’t have value then it wouldn’t be bought or sold at all. Anything can have value as long as enough people assign it value and agree to it. The value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market.  That’s why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin, so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn’t just one person. It’s the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers “value” Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .49. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that’s only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of the currency in the long run is by eventually by exchanging your coins for goods, services, or just by tipping and trading with other Dogecoin holders. This gives Dogecoin utility. Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying Dogecoin at .05 and selling it .06. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. If legitimatize Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services. 

8. Question: Circulation of currencies. The importance of buying, selling, and holding - and the differences between them. 
		
Answer: To briefly explain this, a lot of people have been saying “buy and hold” or “I’m never selling!” - which in itself is great start. But there remains a lot of misinformation around the topic, for example that simply ""buying and holding Doge"" will drive up the price indefinitely. Unfortunately, that is just not true. Buying, holding, and selling are all intricately connected with each other. ALL of those three states are essential for a (digital) currency to flourish. Holding does neither hurt or raise the value of the asset, but rather it helps to establish a baseline, which is also called ""setting a floor"". Those who have diligently kept on holding their coins, have allowed Dogecoin to stabilize at its current price point. Remember, this remains a huge gain from where Dogecoin has been just months ago. An active circulation of a currency is critical to establishing it as an effective means of exchanging goods and setting it up for long term growth.

9. Question: Why is Dogecoin always hovering between a certain value (example between .05 and .06) explaining floors and ceilings. How large owners/whales impact market conditions. 

Answer: The day to day trends of Dogecoin may appear strange at first sight, but those who continue holding onto their Doge are affecting or rather creating the floor. The floor is essentially the lowest value Dogecoin will drop to at current market conditions. A common floor that’s been set for about a month is .05. Why is this value the floor at current market conditions? Because when the majority (around 1 million new people came into Dogecoin in February) bought Dogecoin at .05. This means that there is a large amount of people own Dogecoin and purchased it at this amount. To protect their investment and keep from losing money they are holding their Dogecoin and refuse to sell it at a lower price. This keeps the price relatively stable - called a floor. However a person with a large supply of Dogecoin (what they call a whale) can impact this because they own so much, they can effectively sell off so much that the price goes below the floor. The price will tend to rise back up to floor because people are buying in at the lower price to dollar cost average (lower the average per they paid per Dogecoin) which is known as “buying the dip”. Now to address ceilings. A ceiling is a price - that once Dogecoin hits that value - a majority of people begin to sell. The most common ceiling is .06. Now, why is the the ceiling and not something like .1? Well because there’s a subsection of this community who day trade - which is basically trying to play the day to day prices by buying in low and selling high and taking the profits. The most common values to use are whole cents. I.E. .05, .06, .07. If someone bought at .05 and sold at .06 they made a 12.5% profit on their investment. As Dogecoin steadily gains momentum through increased demand and utility Dogecoin will start to bypass the ceilings and replacing the ceiling with a new floor. 

10 Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. It there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is 40,000 dollars and the price per Dogecoin is .07 with a realistic possibility of only reaching $288.60 at current market conditions. That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different.

11. Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. What does having a cap mean, why do some cryptocurrency have a cap and other don’t? How does it affect the price? Will adding a cap increase the price per Dogecoin. Comparing bitcoin (capped) Dogecoin (no hard cap) 


Answer: - 
When people say they want a supply cap - what they are saying is that they want to place a limit on the total possible supply of Dogecoin. They point to bitcoin as having a cap, and since bitcoin has a cap, that must be why it is valued so high. Through scarcity. That is partially true, but it’s not because of the cap. The scarcity doesn’t come from having a cap, it comes from having a low supply and mining amount which reduces over time. Known as a bitcoin halving. 

Bitcoin and Dogecoin are two completely different cryptocurrency. Their supplies are different. Their utility is different. Having a cap does nothing in terms of the actual value of Dogecoin or bitcoin at the current moment. The cap only matters once that limit has been reached. The cap for bitcoin doesn’t happen until 2140. The price of bitcoin is due to the limited supply (18 million) relative to the global population, the bitcoin mining rate and bitcoin halving. All things that Dogecoin does differently. That doesn’t mean Dogecoin doesn’t have value. It doesn’t mean Dogecoin is infinite. It just means that they’re different. Dogecoin has a current supply of 128 billion, which is why the price is lower and harder to change in value. It is easier for bitcoin to rise $1 in price because the supply of bitcoin is so low and the supply of Dogecoin is so high. It doesn’t mean that Dogecoin can’t rise in price - just that it’s harder. 

Adding a cap won’t automatically increase the price because the cap isn’t the problem. You can’t reduce the 128 billion supply (unless you burn them or lose them). They already exist. People get confused because they don’t understand inflation and continual growth and why they are necessary for Dogecoin to a successful cryptocurrency based on the core parameters made when Dogecoin was created. They also don’t understand infinity. Dogecoin is not infinite. It can never reach infinity because infinity isn’t a number. As long as Dogecoin exists and is being mined it is not infinite. 

To further this point the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they’re just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: “A, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure. Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins. The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.”
You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here: https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1674

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. 

Here’s some Basic economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or “worth” as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.

Common follow up question:
What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin?

Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets What gets misunderstood is which one is “better” or rather ""the lesser evil"". Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. Bitcoin will continue to skyrocket in price because less and less are being mined. Bitcoin is like gold. Dogecoin is like the dollar. Bitcoin and Dogecoin have their pros and cons. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. Dogecoin is different. Dogecoin has a set amount of coins entering the market by the minute. There are plenty of spreadsheets out there showcasing exactly how much many Dogecoin will be in circulation at any given moment of time. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.
Currencies have inflation - commodities don’t. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold.

12. Question: Is a Dogecoin increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Could and will it potentially happen? What would change if it does happen? How high could Dogecoin realistically rise in price? | Market cap explanation, and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. 

Answer: Despite not having a fixed or capped supply, yes, the value of dogecoin can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market in the future. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.

Mathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply
MC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply)

MC (Market Cap) = P (Price) x S (Supply)
Market cap just means how much the total supply is “valued/worth” at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply.

I see people saying how Dogecoin has a current market cap of $6 billion market cap and what the market cap needs to be for Dogecoin to be $1 is $128 billion. Then they say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.

THAT’S NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.

Simply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap. The only two variables that change the market cap are price. And supply nothing else can change the market cap.

Market caps REAL use is a comparison tool. It’s used to compare how succulent a market is compared to other markets. 

* NOTE MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there’s 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is “worth” 6 billion at the current price. When I originally wrote this people got confused so I wanted to clarify that.*  

The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is $6,077,915,837 ($6 billion). If Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of about 128 billion dollars ($1 x 128,495,957,919 circulating supply). Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency) currently has a market cap of approximately $898,761,019,333 (~ $900 billion). This means that at $1, the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is about $2,000,000,000 (2 trillion), thus the market cap of the US currency is $2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach the equivalent market cap ($2tn / $128bn), the price per Dogecoin would have to be $15.60, thus matching the entire short-term US currency (M0 money supply in economics).

This is definitely not impossible, but it is highly highly improbable to reach such value any time soon. If that were to ever happen, it would take years. Now, the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (short-term liquidity / paper) currency is $37 trillion. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value of Dogecoin would have to be $288.60. If it was valued any higher than that amount, Dogecoin would be ""worth"" more than the entire world’s short-term liquidity currencies combined. It could technically go past this point, but what that would mean is that the economy behind Dogecoin would be stronger than the entire global economy of today. At that value you wouldn’t even compare it to the dollar anymore because it already surpassed all fiat currency. It’s not impossible- but is is highly unrealistic to pass that point. It is important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change.

13  Question: Pump and dump vs long term growth and the difference between them.

Answer: ""Pump and dump"" is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Pump and dumps are illegal. While a subset of people are trying to pump and dump Dogecoin, the legitimate community is focused its long term growth and stability which is achieved through the rest of the topics addressed here

Essentially many people are just coming onto DOGE because it has low barrier to entry, and enticed by the idea of coming in low, selling what they have and running with the profits short term. This has lead to pumps and dips, and a lot of misinformation being thrown around. I should clarify some points for those who are coming in, instead of repeating the HODL and 
diamond hands rhetoric.
Planned pumps are not what Doge needs.
Pumps of this nature usually have an attached implication, which is that people will plan on selling, capitalising on the hype and then buying low to wait for the next pump. This leads to money being taken out of the coin, resulting in the lower price we now see. This means that planned pumps are essentially feeding sellers. We are not doing this in secret. This is a public forum and people with the intention have the information needed to drain us dry if we let them.
Essentially, if we want Doge to grow, planned pumps need to stop being openly advertised, or they need to die altogether. Of the two, the latter is the easiest, and it is what this post will be focusing on.

Sustainable Growth is now the way.
Pumps are fine when they're unpredicted - Elon Musk is living proof of that. However, planned pumps will result in our good boy coin shooting down to the dips, where sellers can reinvest and wait to harvest our money again at the next pump.
If however, we grow the price slowly, the floor will increase in a much more stable fashion, resulting in smaller dips. This will mean that the insane dips where sellers truly farm their coin at become very inhospitable to them, as they'd need to put more and more money to receive less and less profit. Essentially, by slowly growing the coin with organic 'food' instead of steroids, we can slowly choke out those parasites who are ruining the growth of the coin by making every dip a horrible investment for their time and efforts.
Sure, buy at the dips. Sure, hold the coin. But don't plan any more pumps. The less room you give to the sellers, the doubters and the paper hands, the more coin you can collect and the more profit that awaits you in the future.

Conclusion
If we come together as a community, Doge will truly live up to the hype - the people's currency. If we choose to continue listening to planned pumps, we have a very difficult, long and risky road ahead of us. Sustainable growth will beat large planned spikes any day.

14. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: Elon Musk, Mark Cuban
As many may know, Elon is highly involved when it comes to “meme culture.” we can see Elon has tweeted several times concerning “doge,” reposting memes found from Reddit, as well as concerning himself with the ripples of the recent stock news. Mark Cuban, another notable wealthy, down-to-earth, community-involved individual, has recently mentioned “#dogecoin” specifically and actually began allowing his NBA basketball team to accept Dogecoin for payment. Regardless of whether these people have positive intentions towards $DOGE or not, their mention carries weight and public opinion and is a good assumption that new eyes are looking at us as a result. It should be noted that they have tweeted neutrally to positively towards $DOGE, not indicating a full-send support but they clearly are not talking down the possibilities.

Big business allowing Dogecoin to be supported as means of exchanging goods, and people like Elon musk supporting and backing this cryptocurrency are important to proving its value and legitimacy. 

However, it is important to remember that this is not the sole determining factor in the price. The price is determined through supply and demand and utility. Elon musk and other major high profile individuals doesn’t control that, but they do help 

15. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?

Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let’s do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

16. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. Two Dogecoin developers are very active in the community. You can see their posts and reach out directly. However, remember they are extremely busy working on their personal lives and adding upgrades to the underlying technology behind Dogecoin. Their usernames are u/patricklodder and u/rnicoll. 

17. Question: if all of the above information is true why are so many people such as r/cryptocurrency and others are trying to discredit Dogecoin as legitimate cryptocurrency.  

Answer: The r/cryptocurrency and the majority of people are horribly misinformed. They find out about Dogecoin and take their biases and apply them Dogecoin before researching. R/cryptocurrency is a specific subset of society who has an extremely knowledgeable background in computer science and computer coding.  They may have a solid understanding of the technology aspect of cryptocurrency but the reason why Dogecoin will be successful is based on economics, mathematics, social theory and statistics as WELL as the underlying technology. Each of these topics is extremely intricate and each field requires years to fully master. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won’t be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It’s been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. A large majority of r/cryptocurrency are gatekeepers who horde their knowledge while the Dogecoin community is focused on explaining and educating new people. R/cryptocurrency is notorious for being extremely serious and a lot of them feel threatened that something that started at as a joke/meme has the potential to be better at cryptocurrencies intended purpose - exchanging goods and services - than Bitcoin or any other popular cryptocurrency which is deflationary in nature. Others will try to discredit it because Dogecoin because it is novel and has gained popularity. There’s a lot of people who will discredit Dogecoin/cryptocurrency in general just because it’s new(ish) technology or because they don’t understand how it can be used. 

18.  Question: Will cryptocurrency replace fiat currency. Will cryptocurrency be the next world currency. Will the next world currency be Dogecoin?

Answer: 
People don’t realize the worldwide paradigm that is taking place right in front of our eyes. People are starting to see that traditional fiat (paper) currency back by centralized governments and debt are flawed and can be improved upon. Cryptocurrency is the future whether the people who can’t see it or try to disagree believe it or not. It’s inevitable. I knew it was inevitable in 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency will replace fiat currency in the future. Will it be Bitcoin? ETH? Dogecoin? Some other cryptocurrency that doesn’t exist yet? I don’t know. What I do know is that the only cryptocurrency that has inflationary tendencies that line up with traditional fiat currency very, very well, allowing for an ease in the transition, a community dedicated to its success regardless of the cost, a mascot that allows for ease for spread of information to the masses thereby assisting with mass adoption is Dogecoin.

personalfinance,What can I do if my mortgage refinance seems stalled?,"Hi all,

I am currently in the middle of refinancing my mortgage. I first submitted all my refinancing paperwork at the end of September, and I'm going through my current lender (Suntrust) since since I didn't have to have an appraisal and the only fee I paid was for them to get my condo documents (about $400). However, it's now been almost SIX MONTHS and it's still not done. I know all mortgage lenders are swamped due to the rates, but surely six months is crazy, right? Early on my mortgage broker passed me to his assistant who is completely useless. Weeks and weeks would go by where I'd hear nothing, so I'd email her and and she'd be like ""Oh, you need to send us more paystubs, and then it'll be a couple more weeks."" Three weeks go by and I contact her again, ""Oh it's taking a while, I have to send it back to underwriting....""

Then three weeks ago, I asked AGAIN where things stood and they told me my credit report expired and they would have to pull another one again (my score is 810 so I don't care but it's really shitty of them to do that, right?). At the time she also told me it would just be another couple weeks.

Now, three weeks later, and almost six months since I began this process, I am FED UP. Is there any easy solution here? Can I go to another broker at the same institution and tell them I'm being messed with and see if they can help instead? My rate is locked in at 3.0% for a 30-year mortgage, so it's like I could get much of a better deal anywhere else. ARGH!

My refinance is only $195K which is very small since I live in a high COL city, so I know I'm not a huge priority, but still???

CryptoCurrency,"Cryptocurrency, International Economic Sanctions, and Power","In the future, if countries use cryptocurrency to avoid economic sanctions will we see an increase in military conflicts as this becomes one of the few remaining ways for countries to exert their power? Or does it become more of a diplomacy game and about offering more incentives to avoid future sanctions?

**Edit**

Recently the [US froze 1 billion in assets of Myanmar](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-usa-fed-exclusive-idUSKCN2AW2MD) held at the Federal Reserve Bank. This is an example of an economic sanction.

My questions above are focused on the future and are not bitcoin specific. Think 10\~20\~30 years down the road with the following assumptions:

* cryptocurrency use is widespread and used by businesses and countries to conduct business (i.e. continued exponential growth of corporate investment in cryptocurrencies)
* some countries choose to hold their wealth in decentralized crypto, limiting the ability of third parties to freeze those assets
* businesses are less likely to comply with international economic sanctions and embargoes because nation-states are unable to freeze their accounts as well

Cryptocurrency at a massive scale, and at some point in the future, does have the potential to change power structures. Does this lead to one country to rely more on physical interdiction of resources and set us up for more standoffs that lead to war or do we get our collective s\*\*t together and figure out diplomatic solutions.

I'm hopeful, but also realize that nationalism/tribalism around the world has been growing and does not favor diplomacy.

This is more of a thought game than anything else. Playing what if. I realize nobody has a crystal ball that can predict the future, but history has shown that new technologies have the ability to greatly change their world. More often than not the big changes are not those planned by the visionaries and creators, but are unintended consequences or uses that build upon the original purpose.

What if Myanmar had been holding 1 billion in cryptocurrency instead of parking it with the Federal Reserve Bank?

When the market was getting slapped for the past 2 weeks, the financial sector was unscathed. On the rise actually.

Since November the financial sector has been on the up and up; vaccines rolling out, recovering economy, makes sense.

Well if all this money flew out of growth stocks because of the inc in yields and interest, and back into finance, why wouldn’t this continue to happen with the recovery of the economy.

If the economy getting better means yields and interest rates are bound to increase, due to the reversal of implementations put in back and March 2020, why wouldn’t financials continue their run?

Are growth stocks bound to descend from their highs like we saw the last 2 weeks because of this, and is the stimulus and Powell’s comments just barring of the inevitable tanking of Growth stocks?

I think yes, I think recovering economy means increased yields, it means increased interest, it means increased inflation, which are all bad for growth stocks and futures. So this must be a temporary rebound for them, and financials will see the best year yet.

**Session 3: Blockchain Basics &amp; Cryptography**



* BTC is first use case of blockchain technology
* **Cryptographic primitive:** anything that protects a communication in the presence of adversaries, protection and verification of communications and computations, AKA cryptographic algorithms, 2 main ones are hash functions and digital signatures (relates to asymmetric cryptography), another primitive is zero knowledge proofs, these all help make blockchain verifiable and immutable
* **Design features of BTC:** cryptography, append-only timestamped blocks, distributed consensus algorithms, networking
* **Double spend:** a piece of information (e.g. money) used twice
* **Fiat instabilities:** weak monetary policy (debasing/mass issuance of a currency), unstable fiscal policies
* Central banks often have been set up when sovereigns are debasing a currency by spending too much
* BTC was 550,000 blocks in 2018, blocks added on average every 10 minutes
* ETH adds blocks about every 7 seconds, ALGO (MIT project) is even less than 7 seconds
* The debate over databases is ""who gets to change the data?""...usually centralized
* **Consensus agreement:** who gets to add the next block?
* **BTC technical features:** hash function, private/public keys (asymmetric cryptography), addresses, timestamp server, consensus/proof of work, full/lightweight nodes (how much info needs to be stored?), network, Merkle tree structure (compress data and sort through it), nonce (random number that is used once, ""n once""), peer to peer, block headers, native currency (part of economic incentive system), transaction inputs and outputs
* 10,000 nodes on BTC network in 2018. Probably in 180 different countries
* Mining --&gt; proof of work --&gt; get BTC native currency
* Finite limit of 21 million BTC, will get there around 2040, there were about 17 million BTC in 2018
* Mining was initially 50 BTC every 10 minutes, keeps halving
* UTXO = Unspent Transaction Output
* **3 main elements:** cryptography, consensus, ledger
* Most nodes and miners have entered into mining pools to improve odds
* Need electricity around 3 cents per kw/hr to be successful mining, can't get this in most parts of the world, mining rigs go where you can get low cost electricity, 2 largest mining pools are in China and 3rd largest in Russia
* **Cryptographic hash functions:** digital fingerprints for data, one CPU can do a couple of terrahashes per second
* **General properties of hash functions:** maps input x of any size to an output of fixed size (called a ""hash""), deterministic (always same hash for same x), efficiently computed
* Hashing started in 1950's to 1960's
* **Cryptographic properties of hash functions:** preimage resistant (one way, infeasible to determine x from Hash(x), not mathematically impossible though), SHA 256, collision resistant (infeasible to find x and y where Hash(x) = Hash(y), avalanche effect (change x slightly and Hash(x) changes significantly, makes it more secure), puzzle friendliness (knowing Hash(x) and part of x it is still very hard to find rest of x)
* Nakamoto felt BTC could transition to a new hash function if needed
* At some point in time, current hash functions will not be collision resistant because of quantum computing or something similar
* 1/10^40 chance of being mutable
* **Cryptographic hash function uses:** names, references, pointers (one block to another), commitments
* **BTC hash functions:** headers, Merkle trees, SHA 256 (256 bits long), addresses are SHA 256 and RIPEMD160 (hash twice = more secure)
* **Anatomy of a block:** header, hash (previous block header), timestamp, nonce, Merkle root hash, hash (current block header), transaction list (might be 1,000 to 2,000)
* **Block header:** version, previous block hash, Merkle root hash (way to get all transactions), timestamp, difficulty target, nonce
* **Light nodes/wallets:** probably don't download entire transactional history, but probably do have all the headers
* All of BTC info in 2018 was less than 200 gigs, headers only were about 60 MB, this is very important with data/computation-heavy ETH
* It's harder to mine a block the more miners there are
* There is a check in the scripting function if a timestamp is off by more than a couple hours
* Difficulty adjustment happens every 2 weeks
* The BTC ""puzzle"" is to get a hash with a certain number of leading 0's (started with 9 or 10, was in the 20's in 2018, more 0's = more difficult)
* **Merkle tree:** binary data tree with hashes, transactions hashed and concatenated up each level of the tree to get to a root
* One of the transactions is the payment to the miner
* **Mem pool:** network of all free floating transactions
* **Asymmetric cryptography and digital signatures:** encrypt with recipient's public key, decrypt with recipient's private key, opposed to symmetric cryptography where both people have the key, 1976 birth of asymmetric cryptography, two keys with some mathematical relationship
* **Digital signature algorithms:** generate key pair (public key (PK) and private key (sk) from random number, generated at same time), signature (creates digital signature (sig) from message (m) and private key (sk)), verification (verifies if a signature (sig) is valid for a message (m) and a public key (PK), yes/no)
* Bad random number generation can lead to some wallets being hacked, the generation needs to be secure
* BTC uses elliptic curve cryptography, private key based on random number
* **Properties of digital signature algorithms:** infeasible to find private key (sk) from public key (PK), all valid signatures verify, signatures infeasible to forge
* **BTC's digital signature function:** elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)
* Wallet applications contain random number generation software, you want maximum entropy and no ""clumps"" in random number generation
* **BTC addresses:** public keys and addresses are not the same, public key is about 512 bits, can hash this to compress into shorter address (SHA 256 x2 + Base 58)
* **Transaction format:** input (previous transaction ID, index, signature) and output (value in satoshis (10^8 = 1 BTC), public key/BTC address) and lock_time
* Decentralization causes governance challenges (e.g. software updates), nodes need to collectively adopt...is this a bug or a feature?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 10, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 10, 2021**

Stocks were mostly higher on Wednesday after new data showed muted levels of inflation in consumer goods, helping quell fears of a rapid jump in prices during the economic recovery. Treasury yields retreated following the report. The 10-year Treasury yield is at 1.521% at the time of writing. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.46% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.59% up. After recordings its best day since April 2020, the Nasdaq fell 0.29%.

The [Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) on Tuesday showed core consumer prices increased less than expected in February.{prices paid by consumers rose only 1.3% in February over last year, coming in below the 1.4% increase expected and slowing from the prior month. While it may not seem like a lot, the report helps quell fears that as economic activity increased and more stimulus was unleashed into the economy, inflationary pressures would begin to materialize. This also suggests the Federal Reserve can maintain its accommodative monetary policy and avoid rising interest rates for the foreseeable future. 

Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco said of inflationary jitters: “ “There’s the irony that in year one of a market recovery everybody doubts it and says how can this be happening if the economy isn’t good, and then in year two everybody struggles to assess whether \[the economy has\] just gotten too good too fast and it’s too hot. And so the last few days have been the latter story: Markets being disrupted by concerns of inflation and higher rates and premature Fed tightening. And today’s a little bit of a reprieve on that story as rates come down a bit and investors can start thinking about longer duration assets again.”

Today, in Washington DC, the House of Representatives is set to vote on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed by the Senate over the weekend. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify, is expected to easily pass and be signed into law by President Biden in the coming days.

personalfinance,Hi there. Got a question on the best way to pay down my credit card bills.,"This debt all came from Covid related issues, but I've gotten all the help through the companies as I can, so there's no way around paying them. 

I'm going to get $2800 from the stimulus package and I'm getting a $500 bonus from work around the same time as well. 

I've got $2k on Carecredit card
I've got $2k on Discover
I've got $500 on BofA

I had planed on paying the BofA card off immediately and then doing $600 each to Carecredit and Discover, since their interest rates are about the same. 

My air-conditioner in my house is also broken and I'm setting aside money to get that fixed. 

What is the best thing I can do to avoid paying as much interest as possible? 

I also can't put too much forward for monthly payments. As it is right now I'm making the minimum payments per month on all of them. 

Any advice is super appreciated. Thank you.",finance

defi,Mindblown - Borrowing/Lending - Yield/burning tokens/etc,Don’t know about you guys but I watched a good 5 or 6 videos on lending/borrowing platforms today including how to do it and trying to grasp the practicality of it and what’s even going on made me feel like someone took my brain and squeezed it till it ‘bout popped and then put it back inside my head and now my brain is thoroughly exhausted. What am I missing? Are you trying to borrow tokens to make more tokens? How am I earning yield by lending tokens (perhaps because others are borrowing tokens at an interest rate and I’m earning interest based on what they’re borrowing?)? What is even going on in this space lol? For example I looked at AAVE today and saw USDC pool was at like 95%+ utilization and yield is at like 25% for lenders... but what risk is it to the lender if any being so close to 100% utilization? Sounds like easy money but I’m probably missing something here...... sorry for such an all over the place question(s). Hard to know where to start!,cryptocurrency

stocks,"$$$ FDX DELIVERING YOU RETURNS...massive upside going into ER, DD inside","TLDR: Fedex earnings is approaching March 18th, stock is down over 10% from its last ER when it reported its best quarter ever. This quarter will blowout expectations, the stock has completely flown under the radar on low volume, options are dirt cheap and average price target is $327 representing over 25% upside, 500%+ for March options assuming the price moves back to where it was right before last earnings.

EDIT: One day after my post Goldman Sachs upgrades FDX to $356 price target with buy rating [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&amp;utm\_source=GeneralSocialMedia&amp;utm\_medium=Social&amp;utm\_campaign=SocialMedia](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/FDX/?RegistrationCode=SocialMedia-direct&amp;utm_source=GeneralSocialMedia&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=SocialMedia)

Below are bulletpoints for DD on FDX, which should run into ER next week. My last DD was buying puts on $snow that was trading near $400 and now $230 today, resulting in 200%+ put profits ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow\_massive\_dilution\_incoming\_easy\_put/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kina26/snow_massive_dilution_incoming_easy_put/)).

* Fedex reports earnings next Thursday, this quarter includes:
   * Record Black Friday shipping
   * Record Cyber Monday shipping
   * Vaccine shipping and just inked deal to deliver J&amp;J vaccine
   * Record Holiday season shipping
      * This was extended from normally  Jan 1st to Jan 19th, almost 3 more weeks of extended excessive shipping
   * Huge 5% surcharge on all packages that started on January 4th that will be permanent, this will help offset increased costs ([https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/most-recent-fedex-pricing-surcharges-feel-permanent))
      * Many retailers complaining during earnings that they saw a significant uptick in shipping costs
   * Increased global footprint and TNT efficiency gains with workforce reduction, FDX should be handling most global vaccine deliveries too
   * Inked a massive deal with Walmart to handle their returns, this bodes well for future revenue steams ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-wmt-unveils-returns-called-151303675.html))
* FDX is INSANELY CHEAP. Forward P/E of 13.79, that is roughly HALF of the SP500 with a very low P/S of .9 and attractive PEG of .99
* Yes it is a bit of a boomer stock, the benefit is that there is low volume that is keeping options cheap and stock price low. A blowout earnings should move the stock up very quickly like we saw in q2 and q3 last year.
* Current stock price target is $326 representing over 25% upside in the stock and easily 200%+ for options depending on expiration and strike.
* The above sets up Fedex for a MASSIVE beat on earnings next week and analyst estimates are VERY low. On the last ER call, the CEO noted it was their best quarter ever, first time surpassing $20B and this upcoming quarter will be even better.
   * Here is the kicker, with this massive amount of good news I just mentioned, the stock has gone DOWN over 13% since the last ER.
   * More so, the average Q3 estimate was $4.01 and FDX beat at an incredible $4.83 with massive surprise. Q4 average estimate is lowered by almost 20% to $3.33 when this is expected to be their best quarter ever from yahoo finance. This lowered analyst estimate is due to expectation of costs rising but the amount of added revenue should offset the cost which means the earnings surprise this quarter should be even bigger
      * Why did FDX sell off since last blowout ER? This was because they offered no guidance and the market punished FDX unnecessarily for it.
* Ecommerce shipping volume is up significantly, isn't stopping anytime soon and many analysts underestimate the double-ship benefit FDX gets from online retailers standardizing free return shipping.
* I suspect this will run up into earnings next week, March 19th $270 are only $6, that represents a bit more than a 5% move from now to after earnings. This should run to that right before ER if not more, then if ER is a blowout you should see the stock gap back up to $300 where it was in Q4. If so, that would be almost a 500% profit. My positions are below, I gave it a bit more time to play out.

My closing date for the house is May 27, but I need to have the mortgage commitment to the sellers by April 14.

What I don't understand is, my lender told me that the mortgage interest rate doesn't lock until 30 days before closing, which is after our mortgage commitment is due to the sellers. What is to stop the lender from raising our rates significantly after we present the mortgage commitment to the seller?

personalfinance,Need some advice on where to save the unused down payment fund (~20k) and future funds,"Hello everyone, I have read the Wiki but I am hoping someone can shed some light in my situation.

A little background about myself. I'm 30, single, working in Washington metropolitan area, and making $90,000/year gross. I was considering buying a property as my permanent residency because my lease is ending in a couple of months. However, after talking to a realtor, I realized that it is not a great time for buyer in this housing market. My plan is changed to continue saving while renting for another 2-3 years then look into potentially buying again.

My question is where should I put this down payment (~20k) that I have saved up so far and my future additions. I have matched the employer sponsored retirement account but I don't have an IRA. I was thinking about opening an IRA brokerage account and put the down payment funds in it but it looks like there are some limitations ($6,000/year and require some time for the fund to stay in there before withdrawal). One of my friend suggested me to open a brokerage account and buy some ETFs for better growth than just let the money sit in saving account and collect pennies. My other friend disagreed and argued that the stock market right now is too volatile and risky to put potential down payment in it so, I should go with the route of max out an IRA brokerage account then put away the remaining in high yield saving account. I am not sure which one is better. Or, if there are better ways to manage the funds other than the aforementioned.

My only debt is student loan from the Feds ~$11,000 with 3.5% interest rate about 3 years left. I have 3 months of emergency and travel funds saved and I have a newish car (econ box) paid off already so I don't have any other big expenses. No planning for further education as my line of work valued experience more than another degree.

Buying a property is appealing to me if the monthly mortgage related expenses are comparable to renting (projected to be $1,500 monthly for a studio apartment in 2 years). Are there other things I should also consider?

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. I miss items. So, feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Let me know if you like it or if it’s super ultra lame.

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. SingularityNet collaboration with Cardano going down. How else is Skynet gonna pay the Terminators?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ) [https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos)
2. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
3. Epoch 252 closes today!  Let’s get those staking duckets!!!!
4. What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?

5. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh. 
6. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)
7. Charles claimed Elon was trolling Cardano with “meta for k” on twitter. Can anyone argue one way or another on this? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1364350825271685122](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1364350825271685122)

9. Possible Soulja Boy Cardano collab on NFT. Maybe Soulja Boy could be best brohs with Charles and Stephen Wolfram broh? [https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907](https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907)
10. Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?
11. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark. Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
12. In the Protocol Parameters vid today, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
13. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
14. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
15. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
16. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
17. Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?
18. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
19. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
20. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
21. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
22. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
23. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
24. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

I know you won't respond but hey, that's just HitBTC isn't it?

You are the worst exchange for KYC I've ever encountered in 6 years of crypto. You are dealing with people's most intimate and private information, and you have absolutely no right to request more than you need to verify a person's identity.

You can state AML/KYC all you like but your demands on this are extremely unreasonable and is effectively funds hostage and/or stealing as well as identify theft.

No doubt people have been suicidal dealing with your exchange. I guess even with blood on your hands you have the ability to count that a a cost of doing business. You should be ashamed, and I’m sure you are if you stop and reflect for even one moment.

No other exchange demands this excessive information. The ""law"" you state does NOT require this plethora of information. Eventually the crypto community will turn on you.

It offers a 3% rate of return payed quarterly and the price does not fluctuate. I just can not figure out the advantages or disadvantages, and would like some easy explanation of the goal of this.

stocks,Why does REGN Trade at 15 P/E?,"Can someone explain to me why REGN continues to go down or in general their market cap seems uncorrelated with their revenues/profits?

Their revenues have grown 16% on average over the last 5 years and have monotonically grown over the last 10 years (I.e. their revenues grow every year). Their EBT is 27-40% which on either end of the interval is quite good. They only trade at 15 P/E where plenty of drug manufactures like JNJ trade at 30.  They have not been diluting shares, their forward looking projections are optimistic, and they are well below analyst price projections (although I don't care too much for that).

They have 9 approved drugs and 8 in phase 3. I assume most won't make it from phase III to being FDA Approved but they appear as through they will be able to get something.  Are all bio stocks just hype machines?  


Overall, I am miffed by the evaluation here but I think it's because I don't know much about pharmaceuticals.

personalfinance,Why is a 24-26% credit card interest rate an emergency?,"Sorry if this is a silly question. I'm not new to the cc game, but it's taken me a while to actually understand it. I have 3 cards that were all opened when I was in college with 0 credit card history. All 3 have interest rates between 24-26%. Only one has a balance but utilization on the one is almost 60% which I am working on paying off in full.

I've seen other threads with people looking for advice that have high interest rates like me, and some with even more debt. I see a lot of comments saying things like ""that amount of interest is an emergency."" 

I've read the wiki so I know ideally interest should not be over 4% so a 24% interest rate obviously sucks, but I'm wondering why it's an ""emergency?"" 

And also, once I finally get my balance to $0, what is the best way to negotiate low interest rates moving forward? I never want another credit card again, but I also don't want my credit history to only reflect high interest rates. 

Side note - I do have some small student loans with 3% interest so it's not only high interest debt on my report.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance Variable to Fixed,"I have a set of private student loans, with an aggregate balance of $59K. Each one accrues variable interest, currently ranging between 2.99% and 3.5% at this time. The weighted average rate is about 3.21%. The term is set at 15 years.

I am trying to decide whether to consolidate my loans into a single fixed-rate loan. I understand we have been and will continue to be in a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future, but I also want to protect myself from any future increase by locking in a relatively low fixed rate now. Granted, I have not shopped around too much in depth, but generally, I qualify for a fixed rate of about 5.9% (15-year term). This would only increase my monthly minimum by $10. In my current situation, I am able to pay an additional, significant amount of principal each month, but that will not last for too much longer.

Would it be unwise to consolidate now and accrue the additional interest? If so, when would be the right time to consolidate?",finance

I have $5200 in my savings thanks to the stimulus checks and donating plasma. My ultimate goal is to buy a house before I am 30. I have been renting since I was 18 and I want the freedoms a house provides.

It has had a few minor issues mechanically here and there, but is in otherwise good working condition. I have heard many bad things about this year for Chevy vehicles and I am anxious to pay it off. I also struggle with anxiety and depression, and I know it would make me happy to pay the vehicle off. Let's call it loan A.

I have a credit consolidation loan with my credit union for $8900. It is $9.74% interest. It started off as almost a $13k loan stemming from bad financial decisions in my early 20s. Call it loan B.

I also have student loan debt of about $41k currently in deferral thanks to government pause, as well as a lawsuit currently pending against the educational institution. This is loan C. I am not paying anything towards this loan.

My question is, with my savings almost reaching the total amount of the car payment, what do you recommend I do? I understand that the credit consolidation loan is higher interest, but my brain is telling me to wipe out the car loan in case the car decides to break down/have a major issue. My other thought is to keep the savings and just ramp up the monthly payment amounts on Loan A or B, or a little bit on both loans.

vet,Help! 2 Y/O Golden Retriever Won’t Eat,"March 8th 2021: Odin (our 2 year old golden retriever) didn’t eat breakfast since we ran out of his food and weren’t able to get more until later afternoon. We got his food and were ready for feed him around 5:30pm, however right before we fed him he started vomiting. Vomited 3 times in the house and several more times outside, we found brown fabric in his puke. Afterwards he looked fine and ate his food, was a bit picky (left maybe 20% of his food in his bowl and the ground when he usually eats it all)

March 9th 2021 at 3am: Starts throwing up A TON, threw up 3 times inside again and a bunch of other times outside. We found some brown fabric again in his first puke.

March 9th 2021 at 5am: threw up again, this time just bile.

March 9th 2021 7am: threw up just bile again, this time I called the vet. They suspect possible obstruction so they book me for an emergency appointment.

March 9th 2021 11:30am: at the vet, they checked his heartbeat, temperature and touched his tummy. Everything was normal except he was a bit sensitive when they touched his stomach. They then took X-Rays where they found a thin straight and bright white line in his intestines (looks like a needle but we’re not sure what it is). They said they suspect it to be bone or metal since how bright white the item is on the X-ray. They decide to give him this liquid that is visible on x-rays but had to keep him for 3 hours so it passes.

March 9th 2021 3pm: they called me saying the liquid seems to pass through fine but will keep him for an extra hour and take X-rays again for peace of mind.

March 9th 2021 4pm: called me said that the liquid passed through fine but is moving slowly. Said they’ll prescribe him metonia 10mg to give him every day for 10 days aswell as this anti nauseous injection that lasts 24 hours. However it doesn’t look like that white thing moved. We then went to go pick him up. They told us to feed him plain chicken and rice for a few days.

March 9th 2021 6pm: we fed him chicken and rice, he ate it with no problems and continued to eat throughout the night.

March 10th 2021: he ate fine all day, took his medication. But did look super tired and also hasn’t defecated at all yet.

March 11th 2021: hasn’t been wanting to eat at all today, been sleepy. Hasn’t thrown up and hasn’t defecated. We tried feeding him chicken with rice, his regular food, treats. He isn’t having anything.

Thoughts? I’m really not sure what to do at this point, I feel like I’ll need to get X-rays again and then possibly surgery. I was fine with surgery if he needed it before yesterday but now if I have to go in again, pay x rays as well as an emergency fee again-this is getting very absurdly pricey. My dog is only 2 years old, we have brought him to the vet numerous times already and we are not wealthy people. However we love him so very much.

Should we wait an extra day or two to see if things change, or should we still go in? Please give your thoughts.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Eating Federal Tax late payment penalty in order to meet 4/15 IRA contribution deadline?,"Am I an idiot for considering the following:  


* My ability to contribute to my Roth IRA will be limited by the amount of money I owe to the Federal Government for taxes (short about $1500)
* I will probably be able to make up the difference by my 4/30 paycheck, and definitely be able to make up the difference by my 5/15 paycheck
* The late payment penalty seems to be .5%, but there's also an interest calculation to consider? Anyway, the penalty for paying $1500 a month late even with a 3% APR is $1500\*(.005+.03/12)=$11.25
* Mentally, I consider this penalty to be the cost of being able to contribute the max to my 2020 Roth IRA, which for various reasons is definitely worth $11.25 for me, including satisfying my ""OCD"" of always contributing the max

CryptoCurrency,"AnchorUSD is a scam, or at the very least extremely shady","TL;DR at the bottom

For those that don’t know, AnchorUSD is a smaller exchange that promises great interest rates for just having your money with them (7% for your USD in their savings account) and zero fees. This seems fantastic, right? On the surface, yeah, it does. But it is anything but that.

I found AnchorUSD because I saw more than a few people recommending it in the Dogecoin subreddit (I know I know, it’s what got me into crypto and I quickly jumped ship) and I also saw it mentioned in here. It had great reviews on the App Store and didn’t see anything negative on Google. Fantastic, I decided I’d try it out. They approved me instantly while it took Binance.us 2 weeks more to approve me. That should have been a red flag.

Things started out great, I did a test deposit and it went through with ease seemingly so I put more money in it and bought a decent amount of coins to start out and then held with the plan to withdraw these coins to a wallet when the rest of the deposits cleared. 

I had noticed when doing this that my buys/sells never seemed to match the reported market price. So they don’t have no fees, they have hidden fees. They take a cut of your buy and a cut of your sell and pocket it themselves all while under the guise of “no fees”.

A week passed and my deposit hadn’t cleared, in fact, I never even saw an attempt to withdraw money from my bank account. Nothing was reported at all that there was any attempt. I start to get nervous, the gains I had (most of my ADA in fact) were stuck in limbo, I couldn’t withdraw. I did some more googling, turns out AnchorUSD is run by 2 people and they were very clearly swamped with how much they’ve blown up. I figured their servers were overloaded and that was fine.

Another week passes, I get an email that 2 of my initial deposits cleared. Minutes later I get an email saying that my deposit was rejected due to insufficient balance in my bank account. This was a complete lie, I had put only a small amount into this exchange/crypto to try to be responsible since I was new to the game. A couple hours later and the rest of my deposits are all rejected for the same reason. I chalk it up to it being an issue with my bank account so I try the deposits again, it fails immediately instead of waiting 2 weeks like the first time. I figure it might be an issue with it being my savings account paired with my bank being a local credit union, so I try with my checking account instead. This was on February 10, those deposits are still initiating.

During this time, and this is the most egregious thing, I also noticed something else. My coins disappeared. Well, most of them at least. Something like 500 ADA disappeared from my wallet, though I’m left with a smaller chunk in the exchange. I lost so much XLM, that I have -50 XLM. I have -0.5 AAVE (which is about -$203 right now), which I didn’t even have when the deposits failed. I had sold that a week prior. [Here’s proof of the -50 XLM](https://i.imgur.com/N4x1bOJ.jpg). 

I have no idea where these coins went. None. Did AnchorUSD just claim my deposit failed and decided they’d take my coins for themselves for a profit? I have no idea. 

Now starting to get really worried but I’m also somewhat hopeful that it’s just a fuckup on their part and it’ll be put back in my account. I look them up on Twitter. I sent their support an email around February 10 about this issue. I see they’re accepting DMs. I DM them thinking it’d be quick to respond and resolve the issue and I can move on and get my coins off AnchorUSD. I don’t get a response for a day, so I start looking through Twitter. Tons of people are tweeting at them for help with similar issues and none are getting responses. They are responding to some people (with one caveat, these people have 5 followers and are brand new accounts it seems), even *after* my DMs saying that they DMed this person to get the issue resolved, meaning they looked in their own inbox to DM this person. Some more reputable seemingly real accounts were getting responses later on, but all were responses after I DMed them. They picked and chose who to DM and their responses were all copy and paste responses. I’m starting to get very annoyed at the lack of response. If they’re swamped, why don’t they put out a tweet saying they are and that they’ll get to you as soon as they can?

On February 21, I finally got a response from support in my emails. I further explained the lost coins issue and they essentially said that they couldn’t do anything about the issue themselves but that they would escalate it to the manager to resolve the issue quickly. Great! I might finally be closing in on fixing this mess.

A week goes by, no update on my issue. I email them, and get a response on March 3 that they’ll check with the manager and get back to me on the status. I have yet to hear back and my deposits still haven’t gone through

TL;DR: They have hidden fees, rejected my deposits, took the coins I bought to the point that I have negative coins, and have almost zero support

————-

A few other things, I think they did end up hiring a few people in the mayhem to work support for them, hence why they seemed to only be 2 people but support is claiming to escalate to his manager. They’re on the west coast in California supposedly but responding to my emails at like 1 AM their time, why not during normal business hours?

They are just being extremely shady about the whole thing. Why is it taking 3 weeks to hear back on getting a status update from the manager? 

Even if they’re a legitimate exchange and just swamped, which I’m really hoping they are, why don’t they put out an email to their users and a tweet saying that they’re overwhelmed and working as hard as they can? Just give us *something*, the silence really makes it feel like they don’t give a crap and are just a scam. Communication is key.",cryptocurrency

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 4: Blockchain Basics &amp; Consensus**

* **Byzantine Generals Problem:** how to coordinate when someone isn't acting in good faith (malicious actor), or in other non-malicious faults
* Solve puzzle --&gt; propagate to network --&gt; validate
* Hard to solve, easy to verify (asymmetric)
* 1,600 native currencies in 2018
* **Decentralized network consensus:** proof of work, native currency, network
* **Transaction script and UTXO:** transaction inputs and outputs, unspent transaction output (UTXO) set, scripting language
* Digital signatures with and without hashes
* Private key --&gt; elliptic curve multiplication --&gt; public key --&gt; double hash (SHA256 and RIPEMD160) --&gt; public key hash --&gt; Base58Check Encode --&gt; BTC address
* Max security would involve constantly creating new public/private key pairs
* **Byzantine Generals Problem:** permissionless (no central authority) blockchains mean unknown participants
* Security based on consensus protocol and native currency, key innovation of Nakamoto
* **Hashcash proof of work, Adam Back, 1997:** wanted to address spam and denial of service attacks, requires computational work (a few seconds) to find a hash within predetermined range, difficulty defined by hash outputs' number of leading zeros, efficiently verified
* **Blockchain proof of work:** the innovation was **chained** proof of work for distributed network consensus and timestamping
* SHA256(known hash of previous block + known transactions hash + known timestamp + unknown nonce) --&gt; hash with correct number of leading zeros
* Consensus supports longest chain, only one that miners will build upon, not written into the code though
* **Orphan/stale blocks:** created but nobody added on them, info in them is not needed, hadn't happened in over a year as of 2018, longest stale chain is 2 or 3 blocks
* Reward is new native currency of that blockchain
* **Hard fork:** social consensus continues to maintain, separate currency can arise
* Transactions in stale/orphan blocks will still be in main chain's mempool
* **BTC proof of work difficulty factor:** leading zeros in hash, targets 10 minute average block generation time, adjusts every 2,016 blocks (about every 2 weeks), every blockchain can be different, was 18 leading zeros (out of 64 hexadecimal characters) in 2018, genesis block in January 2009 had 10 leading zeros (but only 8 required), currently 7 trillion times harder to find hash than it was in 2009, hash rate around 50 hexahashes per second (1,000 trillion)
* **BTC mining evolution:** CPUs 2009-2010 (2 to 20 million hashes/second), GPUs 2010-2013 (20-300 million hashes/second), Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASICs) 2013-2018 (4-16 trillion hashes/second, only thing it does is create hashes), modern mining factories (thousands of ASICs, water cooling, electricity less than 3 cents/kw, arrangements with government officials), aggregate electricity use now comparable to all of Ireland or Denmark (in 2018)
* All strong monies for centuries have had something to limit the supply, is proof of work the best way though?
* Mining pools started around 2010 to smooth out revenue, mining pool operators will handle some extra ""heavy lifting"" and take an extra percentage accordingly, standard fees from 1-3%
* **Proof of stake:** alternative consensus mechanism
* Most BTC miners sell their coins
* **Native currency:** incentive system, peer to peer way to create new money, ""monetary policies"" vary widely (limits on supply), not every blockchain limits supply but vast majority do, BTC created through Coinbase Transaction in each block, originally 50 BTC per block, reward halves every 210,000 blocks
* ""Inflation rate"" for BTC in 2018 was 4.1%, this rate will keep halving though, supply cap around 2140
* Market based transaction fee mechanism also in Bitcoin Core
* **Ethereum:** 3 ETH per block in 2018 (7.4% ""inflation""), proposal to decline to 2 ETH per block in November 2018, fees paid in Gas (10^9 Gas per ETH) for computation are credited to miners
* Gas and satoshis very similar
* BTC is a rule-based monetary policy hard-coded, should we have more human involvement in monetary policy? (like in times of war, economic peril, financial crisis)
* Cryptocurrencies or cryptoassets?
* Gensler believes you can have digital currency that does not have a central authority
* **Network:** full nodes (store full blockchains and able to validate all transactions), pruning nodes (prune transactions after validation and aging, 5/6 of transactions have been pruned), lightweight nodes (simplified payment verification (SPV) nodes, store blockchain headers only, wallets, rely on full nodes for verification), miners (perform proof of work and create new blocks, don't need to be a full node, mining pool operators can perform verification), mining pool operators, wallets (store, view, send, receive transactions and create key pairs), mempool (pool of unconfirmed but validated transactions)
* **Alternative consensus protocols:** generally randomized or delegated selection of nodes to validate next block, may have added mechanism to confirm block validators' work, proof of stake (stake in native currency), proof of activity (hybrid of proof of work and proof of stake), proof of burn (validation comes with burning of coins), proof of capacity (storage or space, based on hardware space), delegated selection may be based upon tiered system of nodes
* Major permissionless blockchain applications still use proof of work
* **DASH:** hybrid of proof of work with a tiered system of ""Masternodes""
* **NEO:** delegated protocol of ""Professional Nodes""
* Some view the limited number of mining pool operators as an Achilles heel to decentralization

Mine is 600 on ck but 730 in my banking app, ck was 730 but I didn't authorize a payment though I had the money and bam. I havent asked hers in a while.  We have been told that it isn't enough for our bank (BofA) to give us a house loan, but maybe enough to trade one of our cars in at a low interest rate, w/ down payment aswell. Not sure what we should do from here. I know getting a rope on unnecessary spending is a big deal, but I want to feel like I'm saving for a purpose.

stocks,Taseko mines possible 5-6 bagger by EOY . Copper surge,"Taseko Mining Company $TGB is a rather undervalued mining company that is due for a nice bit of news soon. They’ve been attempting to open a large copper mine in Florence, AZ and all opposition to it is mostly gone and they simply await the Federal permit before opening it.

They completed an offering to wipe out their debt and enable them to open the mine mostly by themselves, had a great earnings report and have stayed strong in the mid 1$ range. Because of the value of copper and the potency of this mine, it seems this is extremely undervalued and when the permit news comes she should rocket a bit. I’m personally holding this one for the long haul but the news in the short term makes it a nice short term play as well. This mid 1$ range is a nice snag. It has great support in the 1.30s though.

This is my first time really posting here but I thought I’d share this one I’ve been watching a while.",finance
personalfinance,Coronavirus Megathread Update: American Rescue Plan overview and other resources,"# Overview

Last March, there was a [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fhrfqo/coronavirus_megathread_resources_discussion_and/) with tons of information about Coronavirus-related issues, in September a [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) was posted with additional information on updates to payroll tax deferrals, student loan interest waiver, and unemployment, and in January a [third megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/kq1a25/coronavirus_megathread_update_january_2021/) was posted with information from the December 2020 stimulus bill. This is a fourth installment of this megathread with updates from the recent American Rescue Plan. **Please keep in mind that politics and political discussions are still not allowed here.**

**Tax Note: The IRS has [extended the deadline for filing 2020 tax returns](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/tax-day-for-individuals-extended-to-may-17-treasury-irs-extend-filing-and-payment-deadline) to May 17, 2021. This also extends the deadline for [making IRA contributions](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-extends-additional-tax-deadlines-for-individuals-to-may-17).**

# Third Stimulus Payments (EIP3) from the American Rescue Plan (Updated Apr 4)

For non-dependent individuals, you are entitled to $1,400 if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) is below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,800 if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependents receive $1,400 per dependent, regardless of age.

If you are a dependent who also files their own tax return and are claimed by someone, the person who claimed you will receive the $1,400, not you directly. If you can be claimed as a dependent, but no one actually claimed you, then you should still be eligible to receive the $1,400 directly. 

If your AGI is above the income threshold of $75,000 or $150,000, your payment will be reduced by the ratio of how much your income is above the threshold relative to $5,000 for individuals or $10,000 for joint returns. This limits the top of the phase out windows to $80,000 and $160,000, respectively, regardless of how many dependents you have.

If your 2020 return had not yet finished processing when the bill was signed Mar 11, 2021 (meaning you hadn't received your refund if you were due one), then your 2019 return was likely used to initially estimate the amount of EIP3 you were eligible for. **If based on your 2020 tax return you qualify for more than you initially received (including if you received nothing), the IRS has started [sending out payments](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-treasury-disburse-more-economic-impact-payments-under-the-american-rescue-plan-total-tops-130-million-with-more-to-come) for additional amounts people are eligible for based on since-processed 2020 returns.** If for some reason you do not receive what you are eligible for in 2021, if you're eligible based on your 2021 return then you can receive it when you file as the recovery rebate credit, similar to the EIP1/EIP2 and 2020 tax returns. 

**If you initially receive an amount based on your 2019 return but are not eligible based on your 2020 return then you will not have to pay back anything due to differences in eligibility across tax years. This also applies to changes in eligibility from 2020 to 2021.** 

The IRS has an extensive list of [Economic Impact Payment FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center) with more information from the first and second stimulus payments. 

### FAQs

* **Q** I was a dependent in 2019 and am not a dependent for 2020, but the person who claimed me has already received the additional $1,400 for having me as a dependent and I haven't received anything, *or* I have also received the amount myself, what do I do?

* **A** These are common cases. For EIP1/EIP2 you could receive the additional amount if you're eligible for it based on the different tax return referenced and nothing would have to be paid back. EIP3 is written the same way.

* **Q** I received the EIP3 and it was for an amount less than I am eligible for, how do I get that missing amount?

* **A** If it was based on your 2019 return then you may be able to get the additional amount based on your 2020 return with the mid-year payment date.  If it was based on your 2020 return and is still the incorrect amount, you're not alone, a lot of people have reported receiving incorrect amounts, it happens. If you're eligible based on your 2021 return then you can receive it then when you file as a tax credit. 

* **Q** I didn't receive a direct deposit this week. Will I get EIP3?

* **A** Millions and millions of payments have to go out, it will just take time. The [Get My Payment](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) tool has been re-opened and the IRS has started updating this to reflect when you might receive EIP3. Please note that ""Payment Status Not Available"" is a very common error, just check back occasionally for an update to your status. See the [Get My Payment FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment-frequently-asked-questions) for additional information about this tool. 

* **Q** Get My Payment says my check is being sent to a bank account I no longer have. What do I do?

* **A** You'll have to wait for the payment to bounce, then you should receive a change to your status in Get My Payment indicating when the payment will be mailed (noted in [these IRS EIP3 FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-details-about-the-third-round-of-economic-impact-payments)). Make sure your 2020 return has been filed with your most recent address. If your address has changed since your 2020 return was filed, set up mail forwarding. Worst case, if you qualify based on your 2021 tax return you can receive it when you file as a tax credit. 

Be aware of potential scams related to stimulus payments or other coronavirus relief packages. CNBC has a helpful article with examples of [common stimulus scams](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/stimulus-check-scams-here-are-red-flags-to-watch-for.html).

### Recovery Rebate Credit for First/Second Stimulus Payments (EIP1/EIP2)

If you have not received EIP1/EIP2 at this point and believe you are eligible, or are eligible for more than you have already received based on your 2020 tax return, you will have to file your 2020 tax return and claim the missing amount as the [Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit). See the [Recovery Rebate Credit FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit-frequently-asked-questions) from the IRS for more information.

**The recovery rebate credit is determined based on the information on your 2020 tax return**, you can see the amount you’re being credited directly on your Form 1040, Line 30 of your prepared return before you file. Any of the online tax services can handle this tax credit. If you have questions about which tax software to use, there is a [Tax Filing Software Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/kz613i/tax_filing_software_megathread_a_comprehensive/) with more information. 

# 2021 Child Tax Credit

The [child tax credit](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p972) is a tax credit for individual or joint returns who claim children under age 17 as qualifying dependents and have an AGI of less than $200,000 for individual returns (or $400,000 for joint returns). The credit normally reduces your tax liability by $2,000 per child. If the amount of the child tax credit exceeds your tax liability, then you may receive up to $1,400 as a refund of this credit.

The American Rescue Plan provides increases to the child tax credit for individuals with an AGI of less than $75,000, and joint returns with an AGI of less than $150,000, and changes the qualifying dependent age limit to anyone below age 18, so now 17 year-olds are included as qualifying dependents for the CTC. 

* The additional amount is $1,000 for children aged 6-17, and $1,600 for children under age 7. This equates to a total of $3,000 and $3,600, respectively, per child, if you qualify for the full amount of the increase.

* The credit is fully refundable, in that you will not be limited to the original $1,400 refund if the CTC amount you’re eligible for is greater than your tax liability.

* These increases are reduced by 5% of the amount your AGI is over these AGI thresholds. This makes the top of the phase out windows $95,000 for individual returns and $170,000 for joint returns. **These reduced amounts only apply to the increased portion of the credit. If your AGI is less than $200,000 for individuals or $400,000 for joint returns then you can still receive the $2,000 child tax credit as normal.**

### Advanced Payments of the 2021 CTC

The American Rescue Plan calls for half of the amount you would be eligible for based on your 2020 tax return (or 2019, if your 2020 return has not yet been filed), to be paid in advance as monthly payments from July through December 2021. It is written into the bill that an online portal will become available where changes in dependents, income, and preferred payment methods can be addressed. This post will be updated when that portal and more information becomes available. 

Unlike with the stimulus payments, there will be clawbacks of advanced CTC payments you are no longer eligible for based on your 2021 return, though not for the entire amount and only applied to certain income ranges. If your MAGI is less than $40,000 for individual returns or $60,000 for joint returns, you can keep up to $2,000 of the tax credit per child. This amount is phased out linearly up to $80,000 for individual returns and $120,000 for joint returns. 

# 2021 Earned Income Tax Credit

The Earned Income Tax Credit is a tax credit that reduces your tax liability as a refundable credit for lower income individuals and families. The AGI limit and amount of credit is based on your filing status and number of qualifying child dependents - see [this calculator tool](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/use-the-eitc-assistant) available from the IRS for determining the amount of EITC you may be eligible for the 2020 tax year.

The American Rescue Plan made several changes to the Earned Income Tax Credit for 2021, such as age requirements and criteria based on investment income, and the amount of the tax credit itself. The calculation for determining the amount of credit is rather involved - refer to the calculator linked above for guidance on the factors that go into determining this tax credit. This post will be updated as additional resources become available.

# Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit

The Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit benefits people who are employed and have expenses related to care of their children or dependents. Typically the maximum for eligible expenses is $3,000 for one qualifying dependent or $6,000 for two or more dependents, and the maximum tax credit itself is then $1,050 for one qualifying dependent and $2,100 for two or more dependents. The American Rescue Plan increases the maximum for eligible expenses to $8,000 for one dependent and $16,000 for two or more dependents, and the maximum tax credit itself to $4,000 for one dependent and $8,000 for two or more dependents. The ""applicable percentage"" of these expenses and their income limits has also been increased so that more people are eligible for this credit for 2021. [Publication 503](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p503) from the IRS has additional information on this tax credit for the 2020 tax year. Updated links will be posted as more information becomes available from the IRS.

## Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) 2021 Limit Increase

The contribution limit to dependent care FSAs has been temporarily increased to $10,500 rather than $5,000 for the year 2021. Your employer has to allow for you to make this change for it to be applicable. 

## FSA Rollovers

FSA account balances typically do not rollover year-to-year. The second stimulus package allowed for FSA balances at the end of 2020 to be rolled over and used in 2021. Any FSA balance remaining at the end of 2021 may also be rolled over and used in 2022.

# Unemployment Benefits (Updated May 14)

### The first $10,200 of 2020 unemployment income is tax-free for returns with AGI below certain income thresholds

For returns with an AGI of less than $150,000 (note that this is the same limit for both individual and joint returns and there is no phase out range), the first $10,200 of unemployment compensation (though per person for joint returns) received in the year 2020 is now tax-free. When determining if you're eligible to for this income exclusion, do not include the amount of unemployment income in the calculation of the AGI (this is worked out on the UCE Worksheet linked below). 

The IRS has issued guidance on how to address this change with the [Unemployment Compensation Exclusion Worksheet](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/irs-procedures/forms-publications/new-exclusion-of-up-to-10200-of-unemployment-compensation) for the Schedule 1 where UI is reported. **As of 3/19, most tax services have been updated to reflect this change. Check your return before filing to verify it's applied.** 

If you had already filed your 2020 tax return before the UI change was announced, the IRS will start sending refunds in May and continue throughout the summer, [starting the week of May 14th](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-begins-correcting-tax-returns-for-unemployment-compensation-income-exclusion-periodic-payments-to-be-made-may-through-summer). If you are eligible for new tax credits that weren't previously on your return, you may need to file an amended return. If you already claimed those tax credits but are eligible for additional amounts based on the change in AGI, the IRS will calculate those automatically. See their [recent announcement](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-to-recalculate-taxes-on-unemployment-benefits-refunds-to-start-in-may) for additional info. 

### Extension of $300/week federal boost in unemployment 

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) provides benefits to individuals typically not eligible for unemployment insurance, such as independent contractors or gig workers. Under the CARES Act these benefits were set to expire Dec 31, 2020. It was extended to March 14, 2021 in the December stimulus bill. **Under the American Rescue Plan this was extended to Sept 6, 2021.** Please visit your state’s PUA website for more information.

The previous unemployment relief of $300/week from the federal government and $100/week from the state expired Dec 26, 2020 (see the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for more information and FAQs regarding [this executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/) from August). The December stimulus extended this so that federal unemployment will provide an additional $300/week through March 14, 2021, and the maximum number of weeks that unemployment can be claimed has been increased from 39 weeks to 50 weeks. **The American Rescue Plan extended the $300/week federal unemployment boost to Sept 6, 2021 and increased the maximum number of weeks to 79 weeks.**

**If you lost your job or are at risk of losing your job:**

Please read the information available in the [Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)

# Changes to COBRA and Health Care Premiums with ACA (Updated Apr 9)

For individuals that lose their health coverage from their employer if they lose their job, COBRA is an option to retain that previous health plan. In the past, however, the individual would have had to pay up to 102% of the cost of coverage to keep that plan, which wasn't economically feasible for most individuals. The American Rescue Plan now provides a tax credit to employers to pay for the entire amount of the continued health insurance for the former employee, thus making COBRA now $0 for the individual to retain their health plan. This only applies to coverage between April 1, 2021 and Sept 30, 2021. If an individual is recently unemployed within the last 90 days, they can still contact their former employer and choose to get back on their former plan through COBRA. 

There are additional changes in the American Rescue Plan regarding not having to pay back excess advanced payments of the 2020 Premium Tax Credit. The [IRS will issue refunds](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-suspends-requirement-to-repay-excess-advance-payments-of-the-2020-premium-tax-credit-those-claiming-net-premium-tax-credit-must-file-form-8962) to people who already filed for 2020 and had to to pay back excess advance payments of the Premium Tax Credit. If you haven't filed for 2020 yet and had excess advanced payments, you do not need to include Form 8692 or the repayment on your Form 1040 when you file your 2020 return.

# Student Loan Interest and Payment Waiver and Updates on Tax-Free Loan Forgiveness from the American Rescue Plan

**The American Rescue Plan allows for student loan forgiveness to be tax-free for loans forgiven between Dec 31, 2020 and Jan 1, 2026.** This primarily applies to loans on an income-based repayment plan. See [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markkantrowitz/2021/03/06/covid-19-relief-bill-passes-with-tax-free-student-loan-forgiveness/?sh=6fc9c2102d1e) for additional details on the type of loans this applies to.

The CARES Act suspended federally-held student loan payments and interest charges until September 30, 2020. The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/) signed in August extended this to December 31, 2020. The December bill extended this date to January 31, 2021. At the [end of January](https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/f), the deferment was extended until Sept 30, 2021. 

Read https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/ for more information and updates.

# State-Specific Stimulus Payments - CA &amp; MD

The states of California and Maryland have passed laws to send out stimulus payments, in addition to the federal stimulus payments, to individuals below a certain income threshold based on their state tax returns. Both states are targeting low income individuals and families who are typically eligible for the EITC. **See the pages on the [Golden State Stimulus](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/about-ftb/newsroom/golden-state-stimulus/index.html) for California and the [RELIEF Act Stimulus Portal](https://interactive.marylandtaxes.gov/relief) for Maryland for more information.**

# Rental and Housing Assistance

The American Rescue Plan provided additional funding for [rental and housing assistance](https://www.ncsha.org/blog/house-passes-american-rescue-plan-act-senate-could-act-this-week/). 

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) signed in August required certain federal agencies to take steps to limit foreclosures or evictions. Following this in September, the CDC ordered [Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/04/2020-19654/temporary-halt-in-residential-evictions-to-prevent-the-further-spread-of-covid-19) that expires March 31, 2021. This was not extended under the American Rescue Plan. 

Read [Protection for Renters](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/) from the CFPB and visit the [NLIHC page for COVID-19 Rental Assistance programs](https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance) for additional information and resources 

Most mortgage owners are eligible for reduced or suspended payments for up to 12 months under the CARES Act - see this [step-by-step information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/housing) published by the CFPB about how to request payment relief.

### Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs. 

Effective Dec 1, 2020, refinancing mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will incur a 0.5% [adverse mortgage fee](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/refinancing-a-mortgage-will-cost-more-thanks-to-an-adverse-market-fee.html). 

# Funeral Assistance

The ARP includes additional funding through FEMA for funeral expenses for individuals who's cause of death was associated with COVID-19. See the [FEMA FAQs](https://www.fema.gov/disasters/coronavirus/economic/funeral-assistance/faq) for information on how to apply and what the eligibility criteria are. 

# Payroll Tax Deferral

The Secretary of the Treasury had been [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/) to defer the collection of Social Security taxes on those making a gross income of less than $104,000 / year ($4,000 or less per bi-weekly paycheck) starting September 1, 2020. Implementing seems to be optional by employers and many employers had decided to not implement this.

The IRS had issued Notice 2020-65 indicating that taxes deferred must be withheld and paid between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021, or interest and penalties will start accruing on May 1, 2021. **The window to payback the deferred taxes was extended under the second stimulus package to December 31, 2021. Deferred taxes must be paid by January 1, 2022 or interest and penalties will start accruing.** See the [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for FAQs regarding the payroll tax deferral.

# Coronavirus-Related Distributions from Retirement Plans

Penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts for Coronavirus-Related Distributions ended December 30, 2020. If you made one of these withdrawals during 2020, remember that you have three years to pay the income taxes on the withdrawal. The IRS has an article with [Coronavirus-related relief for retirement plans and IRAs questions and answers](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/coronavirus-related-relief-for-retirement-plans-and-iras-questions-and-answers) with more information. Note that this was not extended in neither the December stimulus bill nor the American Rescue Plan.

Anyone else selling at all time highs?,I was mostly in tech and still have my 401k invested but the money that I self manage has moved to cash.  Stimulus boosts the market again to all time highs and the fed has said that they want ease off the gas.

personalfinance,Question about the current housing market and cash-out refinancing,"I've been inn my current home 8 years now, and it was a HUD foreclosure when I bought it, so - cheap. I've had this idea lately that maybe since the market is so insanely high right now and interest  -rates so insanely low - that it might be a good idea to cash-out refinance my house and park the cash somewhere where it'll earn some interest for the time being until the market collapses again. Just thinking that in 3-5 years it might be harder to get a mortgage or to refinance, and if I have easy access to the cash now, and can drop ~1% (give or take) on my overall interest rate, it might be a good idea?  Worst case, the cash is there in savings or a money market account or something, and I just pay it back. Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,"Trying to understand what I can afford in a coop/apartment, I see generic tips but I feel like they're harder to apply to NYC? Am I misunderstanding general advice?","Hi all,

I recently got a new job where it was a significant pay bump, about $165,000 a year. I've been saving a lot of money on the side, and have about $150K that I can have on hand - so I've been looking at condos/coops to live in for the next 8-10 years in NYC (I'm 27, male).

I think, based on my math since I haven't gotten paid yet, that my monthly income should be around $5200 a month ($2600 twice a month) off taxes and contributing to a 401K. The money I have liquid is not what I'm looking to throw at a place, maybe around $80K.

I see something about how your mortgage shouldn't be more than 28% of your monthly income.. which makes sense, but NYC maintenance (/hoa?) fees look pretty huge, not to mention property taxes and what not.

I think for my budget, my max comfort level for a new home would be around 425K, give or take.

I've been using Streeteasy and Zillow, which I understand aren't 100% accurate, but I use as indicators of their estimated monthly payments, but jeez I feel like they're total killers out here.

I'll see an apartment for $419K, which I wanted to just investigate the numbers because it looks like I fit the general rules of thumb (total price of the house is less than 3x my income).

    Down payment: $83,900 

    Mortgage = $1561/mo

    Zillow estimates a 3.7% interest rate (I think it should be lower but I'd rather overestimate than under) for 30 years.

    Property taxes: Zillow assumes $239/mo

    Home Insurance: Assumed $147/mo

    HOA (maintenance fees): $700/mo is listed

    Estimated total monthly payment: $2701

Does it make sense to put more in a down payment? I mean even if I put more, I'm looking at range of like $2400-$2700 for a monthly payment. That's 45-55% of my monthly net income... Is this common for NYC? Is it just not possible to be a home owner without two incomes (i.e. marriage)? Is it possible to ""make the math work""?

I would love all your thoughts or experiences in the homeowner process.

If this is a dumb question, I apologize. Have a good day! :)",finance
personalfinance,In the process of refinancing home and appraisal came out much lower than expected. Reality or poor appraisal?,"We bought our home 2 years and 9 months ago.  We paid $750k and the appraisal came out at $780k.  Since our time here we renovated an old bathroom and added a pet shower to it, tore down and rebuilt an old rotting deck, rebuilt the fence along our property, painted the house and cabinets, and installed hardwood/tile in 50% of the house.  All of this was about $100k worth of work.

Due to the low interest rates and the amount of work we put in, we decided to try and refinance.  The bank was expecting an appraisal closer to $900k.  However the appraisal came back only as $815k.  I was a little shocked by how low this was.  

It seems like houses rose ~5-6% in 2018/2019/2020 which would already puts the expected value of our house around s $850k with no upgrades and already greatly exceeding the appraisal.  Then including the work we put in, we hoped it would be closer to $900k.  I’m no way expecting a 1:1 return for our work but getting nearly no return for our work when we take into account housing cost increase is surprising.

Bitcoin,"Why we don't Shitcoin, a post written by Udi Wertheimer - Send this to your Shitcoiner friends.","Altcoins (sometimes known as ""shitcoins"" among industry experts) are digital coins positioned as alternatives to bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

A naive examination of them may reveal similarities to bitcoin: altcoins use digital signatures, they have a chain of blocks, there are addresses, etc... just like bitcoin! But faster / smarter / better for dentists / etc

&amp;#x200B;

That’s why many of the world’s poor nocoiners see them as an opportunity to gain riches similar to those of ultra-early bitcoiners: if the alts are technically “better”, they are sure to win, right?

&amp;#x200B;

———

&amp;#x200B;

But the truth is, altcoins and bitcoins have almost nothing in common.

&amp;#x200B;

When a poor nocoiner first tries bitcoin, they usually don’t see it for what it really is. They get distracted by minor details, like “i can send it to my friends” or “i can hold my own keys” and then see those same properties elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

But the real value in bitcoin is its immutable monetary policy.

&amp;#x200B;

READ THAT AGAIN.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin holds long-term value because its monetary policy is immutable.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, it’s predictable. Dependable. Reliable.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the other features that Bitcoin has are really just implementation details to make the above possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Some poor people will say: “but bitcoin is mutable! You can change the code!”

&amp;#x200B;

No.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin isn’t defined by software. Software exists to assist humans in verifying the rules they agreed on:

21 million coins.

Decreasing inflation.

No censorship.

&amp;#x200B;

If you changed the software, you didn’t change bitcoin. You just made software that no one wants.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin allowed us to set the rules once, then move on to create value elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

We don’t keep “innovating” on the rules of the game. Bitcoin remains stable.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how money should work.

&amp;#x200B;

Altcoins are the opposite of that.

&amp;#x200B;

————————

&amp;#x200B;

Altcoins are completely different.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of a shared monetary system that allows value creation elsewhere, altcoiners seek to extract value by repeatedly changing the rules.

&amp;#x200B;

The altcoin issuer gets to learn the new rules before anyone else for their own benefit. They even get to design the rules for their own benefit, to play on their own strengths.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, “defi coins”, where new ones are released daily, each with intentionally obscure rules, like having the number of units you own change due to external events, or allowing one smart contract to empty coins in another, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Obscure rules mean issuers and friends have some time to attract attention and extract value, before others manage to put the pieces together and understand how to extract value as well... at which point the thing usually collapses.

&amp;#x200B;

Which is their sign to issue a new coin, and change the rules once more.

&amp;#x200B;

So, altcoins are the opposite of bitcoin. Short-term attempts to change the rules to extract value. To evade stability, avoid dependability, and prevent reliability.

&amp;#x200B;

————————

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing altcoins do have in common with bitcoin, is that they share the same infrastructure. Mostly for historical reasons, you can find XRP and ETH in the same exchanges and wallets as bitcoin, even though they have nothing in common. This will likely change with time (eg XRP getting delisted).

&amp;#x200B;

This does create fluctuation where liquidity moves from bitcoin to altcoins and back.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, it is possible to buy altcoins and make money. Those who tell you that it’s impossible are poor, or losers, or both.

&amp;#x200B;

What twitter influencers won’t tell you however, is that you have to understand the dynamics of changing rules and hype cycles to make it. If you understand this and think you can win this short-term game: maybe you can. Go ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you’re going into this thinking altcoins are improved bitcoins, you’re going to have a bad time. I hope that later you can at least have fun staying poor.",cryptocurrency

* **Borrow:** I borrow money from a bank or any other institutions and give to them some asset as a colateral, like real state or even Bitcoin.

personalfinance,Should I close opensky card after getting approved for unsecured card? I've had the opensky card for only 2 months,"Hey guys!

I applied for an opensky card a few months back, after being denied a SECURED card from U.S. Bank (debt to income ratio was too high due to student loans). I applied for opensky with a $200 deposit. I've had this account for only two months.

Today I applied for the discover student card and was immediately accepted with a $500 limit. The cash back bonuses are great and there's no annual fee.

So what I'm wondering is if I should close my opensky card now while my average age is low, or keep using it and close it before the next annual fee? I assume having two credit lines and keeping the utilization low will increase my credit faster. I could just use a few dollars on my opensky card to have a low utilization (and make sure to have low utilization on my new card). But if I close it after a year my average age will drop significantly correct? And it would be nice to have the $200 back in savings.

BTW My credit score is currently 680ish according to Credit Karma. My only accounts are student loans (about 30k in federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans) and the two relatively new credit cards. I had a credit card that went to collections a few years back after maxing it out but it's paid off and I used a past rental agreement to contribute to my credit score.

I would appreciate any advice on this issue. Thank you!",finance

CryptoCurrency,When someone doubtful tells you Crypto Currency is made up fake money show them this!,"Something *interesting* struck me today. 

*Currency has, since its inception 10,000+ years ago been moving further and further away from having intrinsic value*

**What exactly does that mean?**

Let’s go back to the beginning. Or before the beginning of Currency: 

We know that currency began around 9000-6000 BC as Cattle were domesticated and crops cultivated. They would be exchanged for services and other crops or food. This was a wholesome sort of currency. Tangible and tasty. 

In the millennia that followed, as farming was scaled up, in 3000 BC, Mesopotamia, debts to the temple would be paid in units of barley  would be exchanged for a clay tablet. This would serve as a record of the goods delivered. 

In 6000 years that that followed many different commodities were used as currency - salt, rum, barrels of beer, chickens, wine &amp; sugar. Eventually we see pieces of silver and gold being used as currency; The birth of the coin which would serve until the 11th century.. 

***

**Until** *someone* in China decided that all of that was nonsense. Something with inherent value like was way to clunky to serve as currency ! It had to be transported to be traded &amp; that was at great cost. 

So the basis of modern monetary theory was developed, a system was developed where you could write me a piece of paper saying you owe me 3000 gold &amp; through the might of the government that piece of paper made it mine. 

Suddenly all over China merchants were marching around with pieces of paper saying they owed each other things. They did this for long enough till they realised the paper they held was itself as value-able as the goods or services exchanged. 

A piece of paper. Without inherent value. But it would soon be running the world. Madness!

The idea of a currency that was easy to print sounded ridiculous &amp; amazing. The catch? Whilst you could print unlimited paper money, the goods and services they represent were always limited. 

The paper currency was only meant to be an IOU on commodities that existed

Since then, currency itself became the focus, being printed more and more, the commodities propping the currencies up, forgotten. 

This is the fundamental flaw with modern economics

**A world with a limited supply of commodities &amp; services needs a currency that is also has limited supply.** By definition it has no value if it is limitless. 

Enter: Crypto. In its perfect, realised form it can’t lose value as its can’t be overprinted, copied or forged.* As it’s decentralised no one has enough control over it to manipulate it. The power this brings to individuals, regular people like you or me can’t be overstated. 

The inequalities of modern society are widened due to the fact that the only way a regular person can hedge their savings against inflation is by giving their money to a bank who will make money from holding it. Then they might go bust and you’ve lost all your money. 

**Imagine you didn’t need a savings account you could hedge against inflation with a little hard drive stuffed under your bed** 

There’s a lot of institutional support coming now as people realise that Bitcoins success is inevitable. But never forget they fought for years to stop this because they knew how much power this would take away from banks to individuals!

In conclusion, cryptos are

Forex,What is Swap in Forex?,"A **forex swap** is a daily interest charge that is either billed or credited to you at the start of each new trading day if you are holding positions from the day before.

Swap charges can add up over time, affecting the profitability of your positions, so it’s important you understand how they work and factor them into your decision-making when planning your attack on the market.

*Forex swaps* can be a little confusing to the uninitiated as the term swap is used in various fields of finance.  Other names for forex swap include rollover and carry – these are less ambiguous as they only refer to the overnight interest charges we’ll be talking about here.

The term swap comes from the fact that through buying and selling currency on margin, you are swapping one interest obligation/right for another offsetting one.  Rollover comes from the fact you are rolling your position over from one day to another, as does carry.

Every currency pair you trade will have its own interest charge or credit rate applied to long or short positions, unlike exchange rates, these rates don’t fluctuate very often in normal market conditions.

They will generally slowly move in one direction over time with changes in monetary policy.

## Forex Swap Explained

### Why is swap paid and levied in the forex market?

When trading in the forex market, you are always using some leverage.

You never physically change the ZAR or USD in your account for any other currency.  The currency in your account is your collateral, used to borrow and take positions in other currencies.

If you open up a short position in USDZAR, you are borrowing US Dollars and selling those dollars to buy the Rand.  If the Rand strengthens against the US Dollar and you close your position, you sell the Rand, use the proceeds to pay back the US Dollars borrowed and keep any difference as your profit.

While you were borrowing US Dollars, you were levied interest charges on that loan, but while you were holding Rand, you were receiving interest on your holdings.  The difference between these two interest liabilities/rights is swap.

As South Africa consistently has a much higher interest rate than the US, you will likely always be paid swap on this trade and always be liable for it if you take the other side, betting against the Rand.  This is important to consider when making trading decisions based on a longer-term thesis – you may be right that the US Dollar is going to appreciate over the next 6 months, but is paying interest on a long USDZAR position for an extended period of time the best way to capitalise on your thesis?

You may want to look elsewhere in this case for a currency with interest rates closer to the US, reducing your swap liabilities whilst still betting on prolonged USD strength.

&amp;#x200B;

Conversely, if you are seeing prolonged USD weakness over the coming months, a short USDZAR position could be the perfect play as you will profit if your thesis is correct and receive daily interest payments for the duration of your trade either way.

### Who sets swap rates in the forex market?

Swap rates in the forex market are determined by your broker, based on the rates they pay and receive in the interbank market.  In turn, these rates are based on the official cash rates set by the world’s central banks.

Brokers have to charge a small markup spread to manage their own risk and generate a profit from their brokerage activities.  As such, if you are trading a currency pair where the official interest rate difference is only small, you are unlikely to be paid swap on either side of the trade, but you will only pay a tiny amount on whichever side you take too.

If you don’t want to worry about swap charges, pairs like this with small rate differentials can be a great option.

### Forex swaps in practice

Forex swaps will be levied or credited to your account every day at 4:59 PM NY, the end of the trading day, regardless of what time zone you live in or how long you have had your trade open.

This means if you hold a trade past that time, you will pay or be credited a full 24 hours of interest, regardless of whether or not you held the trade for 10 minutes or 12 hours.  For short-term, highly leveraged trades, this is definitely something you want to keep in mind – note you pay/receive interest on your position size, not the balance of your account.

Another thing to consider is the 3 x swap day, this is generally Wednesdays but can vary between brokers.  At the end of every Wednesday, traders who are rolling over their positions will pay or receive a full three days of interest charges on behalf of traders who will be holding over the weekend.

The sense in this, or whether or not it is equitable, is beside the point – it’s simply something you must be aware of as a forex trader.

If you want to avoid paying 3x interest, you could close your position before Wednesday’s close and re-enter once the new day begins and spreads settle down.  On the other hand, profiting on the 3x interest may be a little harder with a short term trade due to the wide spreads at this time of day – if you are entering a position to earn swap before the day ends, you should be happy to hold the position for at least an hour, as spreads may be wider than the swap you received at the start of the trading day.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 11, 2021. Please enjoy!","Stocks continued advancing on Thursday, with the Dow Jones (DIA) and the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) setting fresh intraday records. Market participants are encouraged after President Biden signed into law a new coronavirus relief package. Treasury yields also steadied at 1.525% at the time of writing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.3% up, the SPY closed 1% up, and the Dow closed 0.62% up.

After months of negotiation, President Biden signed into law a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package after the bill passed in both houses of Congress by party-line votes. The bill includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The bill comes exactly one year following the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 

Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote of the bill “The most immediate impact in the macroeconomic data will be in retail sales numbers, where some of the $410 billion in direct payments will appear in both the March and — especially — April reports.”

The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant’s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. The cyclical energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&amp;P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares.

The [Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) on Tuesday showed core consumer prices increased less than expected in February.{prices paid by consumers rose only 1.3% in February over last year, coming in below the 1.4% increase expected and slowing from the prior month. While it may not seem like a lot, the report helps quell fears that as economic activity increased and more stimulus was unleashed into the economy, inflationary pressures would begin to materialize. This also suggests the Federal Reserve can maintain its accommodative monetary policy and avoid rising interest rates for the foreseeable future.

personalfinance,I think I’m gonna go to jail for tax evasion..,"Before I get roasted, I’m 28 and trying to get my life back together. I didn’t know shit about taxes and the only time I have ever filed was when I was 17 - and my parents did it for me. 

Here’s the story..

It all started when I started a business, a business that generated profit for a few years. The first year in business I had an accountant do my taxes and paid what was due after deductions. The next year I started taking on a lot more expenses and was nickel and dimeing my way through life  and had no way to save to pay. The business was in a loss. In debt. Owed over $30,000 to lenders which was paid after a long court battle. Eventually the business flopped after trying to keep it alive for 5 years and went out of business. During that time I didn’t report any income, or file to the IRS. 

After the business ended about 4 months later I got a factory job making $11 an hour. These temporary workers that I worked with were always telling me ‘man fuck taxes we claim exempt to get the most out of our checks’. Being super broke at the time and not knowing how to make ends meet, I ended up claiming exempt on my taxes and have been for the last 4 years working with this company. I have not filed any w4’s while working at this company. Still claim exempt on federal and state withholding’s to this day. Realizing how truly fucked I am, today I changed my withholdings to non exempt. 

But here’s the thing. I don’t know how to even proceed with this. I know I will need a lawyer. I know I’ll need a lot of money. 

I am terribly afraid of being sent to prison for my foolishness. I have a lot to live for and can’t leave my family, friends and most importantly my service dog behind.

The nursing home is covered by the state.   She has no income really to speak of and the caregiver's cost is paid through the trust, depleting the principal over time.

personalfinance,Paying off private student loans while living abroad,"I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/l66jom/how_to_go_about_paying_off_american_student_loans/) a while back asking about paying off loans in general while living abroad. However, I've been concerned about private loans specifically recently. I plan on doing IDR for my federal loans. Private loans aren't flexible, and knowing that my wage would be lower in a foreign country, it would probably be a huge burden to pay off with a lower wage there.

As far as I know, I've taken all the federal loans I can (FAFSA). However, I'm really worried that I won't be able to pay off my private loans comfortably anymore.. I currently have a CollegeAve loan for $6,000, and will need about $25k more in the future. Please help.. what are my options?",finance
personalfinance,Ask employer to stop tax withholding?,"I’m likely leaving my job in the next few months to return to school. Assuming I’ve already paid the majority of my tax liability for the year, is it possible to have my employer stop withholding federal &amp; state income taxes from my pay? 

In advance of questions - I’d rather have more cash on hand now to spend during school than receive it via a refund next spring. Currently work for a big, bureaucratic public company.

personalfinance,How do I take advantage of these low refinance rates?,"Hey guys,
First time poster here. My house was bought cheap with cash by a family member  (60k) and I renovated it myself (40k) and then got a mortgage to pay them back for a total of 110k. The house appraised at 140k so I was feeling pretty proud of my self so I essentially took the first mortgage I could find to pay them back before they changed their mind. Never shopped it and have never even done so much as looked at my interest rate until about a month ago. 

My
Payment is only $835 with insurance so I always just sent $1000 and felt proud of myself. Just realized my rate is 4.5 percent but I only owe 88k now in principal. I know rates are at an all time low so I want to find the best way to take advantage of them. 

My family is growing so I do not foresee me staying here more than another 5 years. The market is exploding around me so my house is worth an easy 175 now. With another 20k in improvements the place is easily a 200k. 

I guess my long winded question is...how can I take advantage of these crazy low rates in the best way possible. I’m not ready to assume a bigger monthly payment for the renovations yet for financial reasons but I want to make sure I can do the “smart thing” while rates are low. Should I refinance for a shorter rate and term and keep roughly the same payment, or should I restart at 30 years again and lower my payments even more until I’m ready for a HELOC to renovate ?",finance
personalfinance,Question about interest rates,"I don't understand how interest rates on personal debt can be so high but letting institutions borrow our money gives such low returns. Shouldn't the banks just compete with each other on both ends to close that gap? I understand they have overhead to cover and take on risk when lending, but they are insured and if things really hit the fan they'll get bailed out by taxpayers anyway.

I am sure I'm missing a lot of knowledge on how this works and also not sure if this is right sub.",finance
personalfinance,Need Help Understanding Estimated Tax,"I’m new to contract (1099) work and this year will be my first full year receiving self employment income. When I filed my taxes for 2020 at HR block they helped me fill out an estimated tax form federally and for state with equal payments for every quarter.

My question is what if I make those estimated payments and end up owing more tax than originally estimated? Will I pay it all when I file my return for 2021? Will I incur a penalty for underpaying quarterly in that case? My self employment income varies month to month so it’s hard to accurately and estimate what I’d have to pay.

Any advice would be appreciated.

financialindependence,Paying debt High-Interest rate vs No Interest,[removed],finance
personalfinance,Paying Debt. High-Interest Rate Vs No Interest Rate,"So I've been catching a bug lately and been asking different opinions on different forms just to get different insight with the groups. So I've paid off my truck and credit card. I have two debts left. One is a car at 39k at 5.71% and a 10k loan at 0%. Wanted to see if it would be smart to put in a year worth of payments in an account for the 10k loan, and attack the car loan to hopefully have it paid off by the end of the year. Or just go ahead and pay off the 10k loan and then roll it over into the car loan. What are your thoughts? Good or bad it all helps. Thank you",finance
personalfinance,Savings and checking account help,"I currently have a checking account with BoA and looking to open checking/savings accounts that earn interest. These are the ones I've been looking at: 

* Checking:
   * Greater Alliance Credit Union (1.55% on a balance between $5-25k)
   * T-Mobile Money (1% any balance)
   * Alliant Credit Union (0.25% any balance)
   * Citizens Bank (offering $300 to open new account but no interest on the account)
* Savings:
   * Affinity Federal Credit Union (2% up to $2,499, then 1% up to $4,999, 0.10% on anything 5k+)
   * Alliant Credit Union (0.55% no min or max balance, plus offering $100 after 12 months of $100 deposits)

I'm thinking of opening a Citizens account for the bonus (and closing when i can without incurring any fees) and then torn between T-Mobile Money and Greater Alliance for checking. Also not sure what to go with for my savings.

So here are my questions:

1. Anyone have experience with using any of these places?
2. What makes more sense: Great Alliance even though it has a balance min/max or T-Mobile for more flexibility but less interest?
3. Do I even need a savings account since the checking accounts have comparable interest? 
   1. If so, which savings account seems better? 
4. Would I be losing any benefits going from a big bank to a credit union?",finance
investing,"Clover Health: My own CLOV DD, Bear Edition","First things first: The Hindenberg hit-piece was debunked correctly and holds no weight in my bearish sentiment on CLOV

That said, CLOV is just a small player in a giant, giant, GIANT field of Medicare Advantage insurance brokers, with titans like Anthem Blue Cross, Kaiser, United, Humana, and there are literally 400+ more. I've included the entire list along with their national star rating. (Hint do a search for CLOVER, and youll see where it is)

CLOV itself is an adoption story - how can a doctor's office add adoption to yet another insurance broker? This is underestimated difficulty. This is not to be taken lightly - the doctor is already swamped with records requirements and they don't need a broker that's going to send them traffic - private practice offices are already pretty discretionary about whom they accept. 

The NIH grant is literally just a grant and a long time horizon. CLOV definitely can make some strides but its a super, super long time horizon.

The fair market value on a 10:1 PE ratio should be in the vicinity of a 1-2 BN marketcap - priced at 7 its a bn cap. Definitely Sub $4 stock if priced fairly. If the market and bond interest rates issue becomes a thing again (which it will) the market will send this cratering.

I will absolutely pick this stock up at an accumulation zone. But $8-$9 share prices is absolutely nuts. Also Chamath is a genius - but he doesn't understand the medical field is much more delicate and resistant to change - just like many other fields.

BTW If you don't believe me how crowded this field is, here is the list.

personalfinance,Critique Our Budget / Tips on Trimming the Fat?,"Edit - after getting a lot of good advice I'm going to change up what we do. I'm taking the budget info down for privacy reasons. 

Here is what we plan to do: 

1) Pay down high interest half of cc debt immediately (literally today) with savings we have on hand.  For the remaining debt with 0% APR, we will slowly pay that off but finish payments before the APR deal ends (we have 20 months from now to do this, but will shoot to be done in 18). This will be very doable, as those payments would only be 1/2 of what we currently pay per month for cc debt. 

2) Stop putting money towards the 529 and Christmas gifts fund. Lower amount going monthly towards travel expenses. Also, cut the amount we pay to our down payment fund by half. This cut money plus the money that would have been going to cc payments will be reallocated to build an emergency fund. 

3) Once we have $10k in the emergency fund then lower the amount going towards that and reallocate it towards the down payment savings fund. Our ultimate goal for the e-fund would be $20k, which would cover 4 months of expenses. 

4) Down payment goal is still $50k. With this plan it will probably take us longer than originally planned but that's fine. 

A few people asked about retirement and student loans and my apologies for not including that in the initial post. As I state in a comment, we are both government employees who qualify for FERS/TSP.  We currently both contribute 10% of pretax income to retirement and have a combined ~$110,000 in retirement. Once we are free of toxic debt, have an emergency fund, and own a home, we plan to increase our contributions to 15% of income.  Theoretically this should be by 2023.

For student loans the amount is very high but we are relying on PSLF, which we should qualify for in ~4 years. So we are focusing on only making timely minimum payments based on IBR for that. The interest rate on these loans is 6%.

Finally, I truly appreciate all the advice that was given. Obviously, we are still learning and trying to better our habits. Even having read the flow chart and side bar we were still doing things in the wrong order. I think part of the issue is that we were letting our dream of owning a house cloud the importance of having no toxic debt and a good emergency fund to fall back on.  I did get some down votes here, and I hope that's not because I came across as rude or ungrateful or resistant to advice. I came here to learn and I promise that everything said here did make a difference in how we will move forward. Sometimes it just takes some reality checks from a third (or many third) party(ies). 

Thanks again!",finance
personalfinance,e-Filing for Non-resident student,"College sent me a ""free"" code for sprintax which is not really free because I still have to pay for state tax (code knocks off the federal tax fee)  
I see that no other site supports international students (turbo tax redirects to sprintax). I wouldnt mind paying the sprintax ransom but it isn't e-file.  
Is there a solution to e-file my taxes ? Preferably for free but I am willing to use a paid option too.

I have an assistantship and earn money. I need to file for two states (I reside in one and work in another) My country has a treaty with the US and I am entitled a small refund on the taxes.

Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Ideas for maximizing interest on savings,"Over the last year our family increased our emergency fund higher than normal. Our jobs have become significantly more stable over the last few months and with the economy improving, we are looking to phase out a portion of our emergency funds over the next few months. My question is if you have any ideas on where to put your money to get a higher interest rate? No high-interest debt to pay off.",finance
personalfinance,Need urgent advice on charge back,"Hi everyone,

I've been so frustrated that I hope someone could help me. I'll try to make the story as short as possible. About a month and a half ago I ordered a package from a merchant that I frequently order from. I ended up never receiving my package and in the couple of weeks between then and now I got into a fight with them and cancelled my account with them. I did a claim with Fedex but because the shipper is not from the US, I had to call them and they were suppose to ""investigate"" but they never sent me updates like they were suppose to. Now about a month has passed and because Fedex still showed that the package was ""delivered"" my credit card is now saying that the charge is valid. This is really upsetting because I don't want to pay for something I never received.

If anyone can give me advice on what to do, I would really appreciate it.",finance
personalfinance,Can we afford to enter the housing market?,"My wife and i are preparing to buy a home and unfortunately we live in a HCOL area.  We are looking at the 540k-560k price range.
Now in our area any home under 400k essentially gets you a garage with half a roof, and anything under 500k is a small townhome or very old and small home, otherwise we would be targeting much less.

I see very often on this sub the 2-2.5x a single salary on a home figure being thrown around quite aggressively. When I look at the numbers this just seems to be overly conservative.  

Salaries: 125k me, 75k wife

Savings: 35k emergency fund, 200k avaible for down payment, closing, etc.  

Investments: 401k 100k, taxable 60k, company stock 30k
Debts: 320/month for car. 

Monthly bills/utils/food: 1500

HOA:. 107/month

Property taxes: guessing about 6k/yr

Credit: high 700s

If we put 20-30% down to target a 400k or less mortgage and assuming an interest rate of 3.1%, we'd be looking at less than 2500/month for P&amp;I/taxes/HOA.  I bring in 10k/month just by myself, which gives 25% of pay on housing. Assuming another 1% of home value per in maintence, this jumps to ~30%.  

So is this a good financial decision or am i crazy to even be considering such an expensive home? We'd like to stop throwing away 2k/month on rent and start building equity.",finance
personalfinance,Should I quit my current job before graduation and finding another?,"I have worked at the same job part-time in big retail for the past 7 years. This May, I will be graduating with my bachelor's (statistics) and am just starting to look for a new job.

Because of COVID-19, for the past year I have been picking up tons of hours. And with some cooperate bullshit going on: sales up 18% over the past 12months, yet they are cutting department hours, cutting hazard pay, and leaving us short staffed, not to mention the A-hole customers... And while I like my co-workers and department manager, lately I have despised going into work and overall am just burned out.

I want to hand in my 2 weeks this weekend or coming week, but my parents said it was a bad idea and I should tough it out and wait until I graduate and/or find another job first. For I have should have a source of income to cover my current and future expenses. 

So, my monthly expenses are around $300. At least $200 of that is expenses for work, lunch, gas, etc. Due to the pandemic, I really only leave the my parents house for work. I have no real living expenses and no credit-card debt.  My student loans are $15,000 and I have $6000 saved to pay them but I want to see if Biden is going to cancel some of it first before throwing my money at it. I also have around $2000 savings and another $5000 for emergencies. 

Do you think it is wise for me to be unemployed for roughly 1-2 months until I graduate and get another job? Or should I just take the hit and stay working at my current job? For my parents said in this economy, who knows when I might find a decent job. And I would hate having to get another part time job for a few months while I look.",finance
Bitcoin,My one-year savings account just matured,"Last March I put £11,000 in a savings account that allowed a maximum of three withdrawals in a year before the interest rate dropped. 

I took out £4,000 in September, leaving a £7,000 balance. 

The account has just matured. I only made one withdrawal but the bank slashed the interest rate after a few months anyway. My final balance is...£7,030.

At the time I opened the account, a couple of days before the March crash, 1 BTC cost £6,100, so I could have bought 1.8 BTC. (Three days later I could have bought more like 2.8!)

Six months later when I needed £4,000, 1 BTC cost £8,400, so I would have needed to sell 0.48 BTC, leaving me with 1.32 BTC.

Today, 1 BTC costs £40,500, meaning my original investment, minus the withdrawal in September, would be worth £53,460.

That’s 7.6x what I actually ended up with. 

There’s a lesson in there somewhere, but I’ll be damned if I can figure it out...",cryptocurrency

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 03.12.2021,"Hey Everyone,

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. Finally, let me know if you like it or if it’s super ultra lame today.

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. There is also the looming possibility of a Bitstamp listing. [https://www.bitstamp.net/article/bitstamp-continues-exploring-support-additional-di/](https://www.bitstamp.net/article/bitstamp-continues-exploring-support-additional-di/)
2. Yoroi reaches 100k installs! [https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369952496307736578](https://twitter.com/YoroiWallet/status/1369952496307736578)
3. Cardano tattoos are starting to get elaborate. [https://twitter.com/BloomPool\_io/status/1370148734177325056](https://twitter.com/BloomPool_io/status/1370148734177325056)
4. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have hair that's even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.
5. Cardano reached 550k wallets in half the time it took BTC [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1369933366368362496](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1369933366368362496)
6. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
7. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

8. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum). This is one of those nice articles where the British guy pleasantly reads it to you if you want. Use this one to convince all your friends you are the ultimate blockchain expert:  “listen Kyle...the shortcoming of UTXO accounting is....” [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/)
9. Cardano devs at IOHK are the most productive in the industry! Already 3,170 commits and climbing this week! I sleep better at night knowing they are not allowed to sleep. Kidding….kidding.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying "" Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

11. What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?

17. Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark. Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

personalfinance,401K primary residence loan vs home equity loan for next house,"Hi all and thanks in advance for your insights!
 
**Context**: my wife (32) and I (33) are looking to move to our next house. We have 3 kids and a dog and the townhouse I bought before we had any of them (a 2 bedroom 1.5 bath) is now comically small for us. Because we have 3 kids that are 5 years old and under, we really want to avoid the whole ""sell your house, move somewhere temporary, and then move again into a new house"" thing; it just sounds terrible. We've made a few offers and even had one accepted (that we terminated due to big inspection issues) so we're definitely in the mindset to make this move happen. Because I don't want to sell my current house first, I'm wanting to buy the next house and move with the assets I have on hand. My debt to income is not an issue as my wife and I clear about $11K a month after taxes and other deductions (retirement, HSAs, etc) and our current mortgage is a tiny $880 a month. DTI is less than 20% according to my lender and we are looking at houses in the $350K-$450K range.

**Question**: I have available to me both a 401K primary residence loan and a no closing cost home equity loan. I would like to use this money to bolster my existing $30K down payment funds, make fixes to current and new house, and moving costs, etc (so I don't have to touch my emergency savings). I would immediately repay either once we are moved into a new house and the old house is sold. I'm not sure what to pick. Pros and cons as I can see below.

            
**401K Loan (primary residence)**

- No cost to obtain
- lower repayment cost per month
- lower interest rate (to myself)
- not a second mortgage on my current home
- can still contribute and get company match
- cannot be repaid partially, must be repaid all at once
- if I change jobs it would become a withdrawal unless paid back
- would take about a third of my portfolio out of the market until it gets paid back
- cannot be taken out until I have a sales contract in hand

**Home Equity Loan**

- No closing costs
- Slightly higher repayment per month ($300 vs $200)
- higher interest rate (8% vs 3.25%)
- is a second mortgage on my current home
- can be repaid whenever I like in whatever amount I like
- not impacted by a job change
- maybe tax deductions?
- no impact to my retirement's time in market

stocks,I analyze mentions and sentiment of stocks across social media to find rising stocks! This week's top growing stock and its DD: $RKT,"I had posted the previous picks from my program and my analysis here and the response I received was amazing. I have been working on improving the program and **have made the program public**. If you have seen the previous posts, please feel free to skip to the DD.

**How does it work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth.

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock: Rocket Companies ($RKT)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: 2332%

Month on Month increase in mentions: 1265.1%

Average sentiment across mentions: +14.2%

**Core Product**

Rocket is headquartered in Detroit and was founded in 1985. Their business model involves much more than just rapidly processing mortgages. They leverage analytics to provide real-time quotes to clients and provides end-to-end visibility into their transactions. 

Rocket operates both a direct-to-consumer business and a partner network which expands the platform’s reach.  Their major divisions include:

**Rocket Mortgage:** This is Rocket’s main division which contributes to the bulk of its revenue. They are the largest mortgage lender in the US closing more than $1 Trillion in home loans since their inception.

   **Rocket Homes:** Online home search platform and real estate agent referral network.

   **Rocket Auto:** An asset-light auto sales platform.

   **Rocket Loans:** Personal loan platform that operates similar to the core mortgage business.

   **Amrock:** Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and settlement services. 

Although only less than 10% of the revenue is generated from their non-core businesses, these products have the potential to grow faster than traditional mortgage in the future. Their ultimate aim is to provide a one-stop ecosystem for a wide range of financial products. 

**Financials**

Rocket, like other mortgage companies, had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials. 

Revenue increased 144% y-o-y to $4.7 Billion in their fourth quarter and net income increased 277% to $2.8 Billion. They also announced a special dividend of $1.11 per share. In FY’20 they had $320 Billion in loan originations with total revenue of $15.7 Billion (208% increase). Their net income for 2020 was $9.3B (948% more than 2019). They have a very strong cash position with total liquidity of $7.7 Billion. 

Rocket also increased gain on sale margin by 100 basis points year-over-year to 4.41%. Rocket Auto, their retail marketplace facilitated the sale of 9,400 auto units - Up more than 2,000 units as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Rocket homes assisted their clients with $1.6 B real estate transactions just in Q4’20. 

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Interest rates:** The Fed is currently pumping an insane amount of money into the economy and holding the interest rates down. The current interest rates are some of the lowest ever in recent history. Almost everyone who has a mortgage is refinancing it since the rates have basically halved over the past year. 

**Covid and Stay at home restrictions:** Rocket is currently the leading provider of online mortgages. Given that a large majority of people are currently stuck at home/unwilling to go out, if they want to refinance their loans, Rocket would end up as their primary option. This is accelerated as more and more young people who prefer online marketplaces start buying their houses. 

**Customer retention:** Rocket has amazing customer service (Predominantly due to their company culture, AKA ‘[ISMs](https://www.myrocketcareer.com/About-Us/Our-Philosophies)’) with a client retention rate of 92%. Their recapture rates were 82% for refinance transactions. This is an important metric since Rocket is foraying into other sectors such as homes and auto and will easily be able to cross-sell their products. 

**Risk and Competition** 

The main risks associated with Rocket are

**Mortgage rates:** The current refinancing boom is due to rock bottom mortgage rates. Any substantial increase in these rates would drastically affect both the revenue and the bottom line of the company. The company’s short-term prospects are almost completely dependent on the Fed. 

**Sale Margins:** The current jump in the margin for Rocket is predominantly due to the low mortgage rates as well as the huge demand for refinancing the mortgages. This led to loan originators restricting the demand by not decreasing their offered rates in line with their funding costs, which enabled them to improve their sale margins.

**Internal ownership:** The open market holds less than 10% of the total shares. So, if the insiders convert and sell even 10% of the ownership, the outstanding shares will double and can cause the stock price to drop.

**UWMC’s Announcement:** UWMC during a recent event announced that it would no longer work with real estate brokers doing business with Rocket Companies. The full and long-term impact of this announcement is not yet clear and can impact Rocket adversely in the near future. 

**Conclusion**

I deliberately left out the short interest and the short squeeze play as I believe it would be extremely difficult to time it if it ever happens. Rocket, with its emphasis on technology and outstanding customer service, is in a good position to gain market share in the mortgage market. On the flip side, the company is heavily dependent on the mortgage rates and on how long the refinancing boom would continue. I believe the company is undervalued given the explosive growth in revenue and future prospects of all their associated platforms!

personalfinance,How to offset raise vs increased federal taxes,"So I recently got a promotion in the govvie civilian sector, GG-11 to GG-12.  Combined with an increase in locality pay, it was a serious chunk of change.  Now that my paychecks are stable, I see very little of this raise due to my federal taxes going from about 500 a month to almost 900.

Should I increase my 401k automatic deduction to lower my taxable income or will that not affect it?  I am currenty doing 12% (6 to reg and 6 to Roth) with a 5% match.

If that does not affect it, I just might change my deductions to married 1 vs married 2 to offset what I pay each April.

**Excerpt:** The economy did collapse back then, but the government did not blow its brains out on fiscal largesse. So, we went into the 1920s with tremendous pent-up demand once the crisis ended, and balance sheets were in far greater shape. Government debt-to-GDP was 10 per cent — not over 100%. And that better public sector balance sheet allowed the federal government to CUT taxes by the mid-1920s — top marginal rates for corporations were initially raised from 10 per cent in 1920 to 13.5 per cent by 1926 but cut to 11 per cent by the end of the decade; for individuals, the rate went from 58 per cent after the war to 24 per cent by 1929. Does anyone think taxes are going to be coming down in the US any time soon?

**Tl;dr:** There are major differences between the end of this pandemic and the end of the Spanish flu, notably business productivity, capital allocation, tax rates, starting valuations of the stock market, demographics and especially government debt levels. We are unlikely to see a repeat of the roaring 20s this decade. 

**Additional lesson:** When multiple mainstream business publications are pushing the same narrative on their covers it often pays to go the other way.",finance
personalfinance,TurboTax caught someone trying to file my taxes,"Hi all, I have used TurboTax in recent years to do my taxes, both the web and desktop versions.

They told me I will have to file my federal return on paper, and fill out a IRS FORM 14039  -  Identity Theft Affidavit. They didnt seem to share any more info or what the implications are.

Bitcoin,"Tired of the stupidity behind the ""Bitcoin is inefficient"" argument","I am getting really tired of hearing the argument that Bitcoin uses lots of energy and is highly inefficient. Those who use it show a clear lack of understanding of how Bitcoin works, but maybe most importantly, they fail to propose a superior alternative that fixes that problem.

I am writing these 2 arguments for me and anyone else that would want to push back on this stupid inefficiency argument.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bitcoin is a decentralized ledger with strictly enforced rules built upon battled-tested cryptographic algorithms like ECDSA and SHA256.   
Participating in this decentralized ledger requires finding a piece of information, nonce, so that the SHA256 of such information is below a certain threshold.  This is the job of the miners.  
It is up to the participants to decide how to find that piece of information. You can use a pen and paper, a pocket calculator, a fortune teller, or an ASIC powered by your own Uranium-235 plant.   
The Bitcoin network doesn't say anything on how to find these nonces; that is up to the miners. These miners found that ASICs powered by industrial electricity seem to work nicely. They purchase these ASICs, pay for the electricity they use, and run an open-source code in them. How can the government have a say in the kind of software and the scale at which I run it in my own private property as long as I am paying the bill?
2. If you are going to criticize Bitcoin, you have to propose an alternative, and ideally, a better alternative.  
Mrs. Janet Yellet called Bitcoin an ""extremely inefficient way of conducting monetary transactions"" just a few days ago. The immediate question that comes to mind is, what should I use instead then?  
I guess her answer would be the USD, coincidentally and of course exempt of any conflict of interest; that's the shitcoin she helps to govern.   
The problem is that I, nor millions of others, want to use the USD. Time and again, governments of the world have lied and manipulated their currencies.   
The US being no exception. In 1933 the US government forbade the ""hoarding"" of gold - Order 6102 mandated US citizens to sell their gold to the Fed at a price the Fed itself set or face a 10-year prison term. More recently, in 1971, our great government temporarily suspended the convertibility of gold. Temporarily, in this context, means that 50 years later, we still cannot convert our dollars to gold.  
She fails to recognize that Bitcoin is a far superior alternative to the USD because of the systematic institutional betrayal. Said shitcoin can be printed at will, and ad-infinitum, rendering your hard-earned savings useless. For these reasons, people are moving to Bitcoin, choosing to trust cryptographic algorithms, not the government.

&amp;#x200B;

So until I hear a better alternative, I am HODLing for dear life.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to best invest for retirement under the below circumstances!,"Good day people, I may be a first-time poster, can't remember. But anyway, I'll try and keep this concise. This May I will be commissioning as a 2LT in the U.S. Army, Military Intelligence branch. My initial contract is 7 years, so I will be financially stable for the foreseeable future. 

USAA has a loan that they offer new officers, $25k at 2.99% interest. They will automatically deduct about $500 per month from my pay for 5 years until it is paid off. Because of my financial stability, I am not at all worried about making this payment. I do not plan on having many other debts to pay in my first few years besides maybe a house, but the Army provides BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) which should cover my mortgage/rent, not to mention any income that my parents or wife will provide since they will be living with me as well. 

Here is the part where I may lose a few of you, with this loan, I plan to pay off my student loans (about 6k), which is currently not accruing interest due to the pandemic, but that will change near the end of this year, however, the interest rate will be higher than 2.99% so I'd rather pay it off sooner than later. Secondly, I plan to fund a Roth IRA (6k) for both 2020 and 2021 to start saving for my retirement, I have been interested in retiring early, perhaps after 20 years in the Army. I will receive my BA in Computer Science, so I could even get a job in that field after my service time if I should decide to. The rest of the loan money I would either put in a high HYSA as an emergency fund (I do not have one currently) or I could put it back towards the loans. My question is: does this plan seem solid considering everything that is going on in the world right now? Any advice or suggestions would be highly appreciated, thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"What's better, a high balance credit card on an old CC with higher interest rate, or same balance on a new CC with lower rate?","My SO has a card with a balance that eats up too much of her paycheck. Plain and simple. 

I'm telling her she needs to roll that balance to a card with an intro rate that's lower than what she pays. 

What she wants to do is obtain a new credit card with intro rate, roll the balance to that, and then keep the old card open. This frightens me, as I feel like that'll open us up to an even higher amount of debt, as she would then have $10k extra credit capacity. She suggested a personal line of credit to do the the same, keeping the old card open as well.

I suggested, no, if you roll the balance over, lets close that old line so we can't possibly go into it. She is pretty much outright refusing, saying the credit bureau's consider the age of the accounts, and if they see she has a new card, they'll ding her for that.

She did offer to do this with her second oldest card, which is half the balance of the card I'm concerned about, but she won't roll out and close her oldest account. She says if I knew anything about credit scores, I'd know I was wrong.

I feel like credit bureaus consider most the balance to available ratio which wouldn't change at all under my scenario. She thinks she'll lose 40-80 points even if she maintains the same ratio and moves to a lower rate card.

Am I just plain wrong here? My fear with getting a new card and leaving the old one open is that the balances will keep going up, when we need them to go down. I barely have credit at this point, I do have cash and investments though. She's asked me for a loan previously to pay down her cards, and I waffled on that, since the investments are all retirement stuff which would force me to pay a penalty to pay her stuff off. I suppose I could borrow against them myself, but again, my fear is even if I do that, we'll just see the balances keep rising.

anyways, long story short, do we keep this ""oldest card"" and just move a newer card to a lower rate card? or do I keep arguing for rolling the highest balance card to a new card with an intro rate?

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,(Long Post) Motivation for Debt Repayment and My Second 'Coming Out',"Hello All, 

I am 33 (M) living in Kentucky. I am single but in a relationship and live alone.  

I am currently $78,468.38 in debt. 

* $49,594.28 - Student Loans (Went to a small private university) 
* $8,526.87 - Credit Card Debt (Average APR of 19%)
* $20,347.23 - In Loans 
* $0 - Savings

Debt and money issues have been apart of my life since I can remember. I grew up in a family of six in a shotgun house with one bathroom. It was always feast and famine with my family. We never ever went on vacation or did anything to make memories. My dad always drove clunkers and we relied heavily on the church (My father was a minister) for food and housing. I feel as though I have carried on this behavior/curse into my life. The debt has made me feel undesirable, unfit, and unwell. It weighs heavily on my mind and body. I don't believe there is a day that I don't think about money and I feel as I am one small stroke of bad luck away from losing it all. I know a lot of Americans are in the same position or worse because of Covid-19.

Late January I decided to confront my debt. I started an excel spreadsheet and wrote down every piece of debt, interest rates etc. The number is staggering to me. How did I let it get this far? I was foolish when I was younger thinking I needed to have the nicest shoes and clothes to attract a mate. Well those mates came and went but the debt didn't.   Come early February, I was speaking with close friends about bills and how they wanted to buy a house. I felt sad and that the world was leaving me behind. They were getting a house and I was still trying to figure out how to tackle this debt in a meaningful way.  I was putting up a façade that my finances were in order. Basically living a lie That I had what I needed to live happily. Then I broke, I spilled my guts to my friends and to my significant other. It was a huge sense of relief that washed over me. Knowing that I didn't have to pretend anymore or lie about where I was in life. I called this my second coming out.  Bringing my truth and my burden to the surface. My friends and significant other comforted me. It made me feel empowered and believed in. I consider this my second coming out. I wasn't living in the financial closet in a manner of speaking.

I've been working diligently to pay this debt off. Budgeting and putting any extra towards the mountain in front of me. Its been over a month and I feel like I'm losing motivation. I think its because I feel like time between my paychecks seems longer. The number is not decreasing as fast as I would like it to. I know that I suffer from wanting instant gratification. I have to give myself a healthy dose of reality frequently to stay on track. 

My questions are:

* What do you do to stay motivated?
* What resources did you use? 
* What small/large tips did you have to help move things along? 

I have 9-5 job and I pet sit for a number of clients as my side gig (Who doesn't have one these days?) I've managed to create a budget and I have been sticking with it. I've read endless amount of articles and blogs to help me shape my plan of attack. I've also been listening to audio books. They all offer very similar if not the same advice. However, they all lack a critical component I can't seem to find. MOTIVATION. I've been thinking about an accountability partner and I asked a close friend and she agreed but she is burdened with other things in her life and she hasn't even asked once how I was doing. I don't feel comfortable asking other friends as its a burden I don't comfortable to place on someone else. So if someone from this community is willing to hold me accountable that would be amazing. 

TL;DR: Almost $80K in debt and having trouble finding motivation to keep paying debt. What did you or are you doing to stay motivated.",finance

personalfinance,Denied Credit and Investment Accounts Due To Criminal History,"Hi there,

I've Googled for hours about this issue for several weeks and cannot find a single bit of relevant info, so here it goes-

Over a decade ago, I was 18, young and stupid, and convicted of a federal crime related to computer hacking. I served my sentence, finished my probation, and owed no restitution. Then I started my life.

2 years ago my Capital One card, which I've used for several years was suddenly declined. The account had always been in good standing. I called them immediately, I was transferred around several departments, until finally I got to someone who simply said ""I can't tell you why your account was closed"" and pointed to their terms of service that they can 'deactivate an account at anytime at their own discretion'.

I really had no idea what was going on... until a year later (last year), my financial planner wanted to move my ROTH IRA to Charles Schwab. He opened the account, everything fine. A day later I was flooded with paper mail from Schwab that my account had been deactivated with no explanation.

My advisor called me and said he'd spoken to someone at Schwab and was able to to find out I was apparently on an AML list (Anti-Money Laundering). I've never been a money launderer- I have no clue how to even launder money. My advisor was clueless and said he'd never seen this before.

Last week I wanted to re-open an old American Express account I had. Same routine. Approved, then declined soon after. Called Amex, I was tossed around, until finally someone told me ""A confidential department removed your application for confidential reasons"".

My TD Ameritrade and Fidelity accounts were both shut down in the last 2 years as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I am assuming these companies employ a 3rd party applicant screening software that use my name/social to combat potential financial crimes and high risk accounts. But, the screening software algorithms obviously can be wrong- no way am I on some sort of money laundering list- and if I am- I shouldn't be.

This whole situation is causing me severe issues and frustration. So, because I committed a crime when I was 18, I can't ever open an investment account and save for retirement? I have a child on the way, I can't open savings and college funds for my child??? I can't even get a personal credit card- I'm looking to apply for a mortgage in the next few months, and I fear I'll run into the exact same issue.

Any insight would be great. I really don't know what to expect with this post- everyone I've spoken to (attorneys, financial advisor) has never seen this happen before. Everyone is clueless, including me.

edit: clarification: I've had a bank account with a credit union for 7 or 8 years with no issue. I plan to hopefully get my mortgage with them (they know my situation), but they really don't know what underwriting will say.",finance

The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for investors under the federal securities laws.

The Complaint alleges that Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company was merely hoping that USPS was going to select an electric vehicle as its Next Generation Delivery Vehicle, and had no assurance or indication from USPS that this was the case; (2) the Company had concealed the fact that -- as revealed by the postmaster general in explaining the ultimate decision not to select an electric vehicle -- electrifying the USPS's entire fleet would be impractical and astronomically expensive; and (3) as a result, Defendants' statements about Workhorse's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

I’m getting antsy about my own place but I don’t think I’m going to find something with a lot of space to work from home in city under 1-1.1k a month.  I really don’t want roommate situation while being home all day working but there are options in the summer for me to do that.  

I found a decent studio in the city for 1.1k a month with no security deposit and first months rent and I’m tempted.  

My family doesn’t ask for rent and I’ve been saving 1k a month to it.. I asked my boss and he said not going back to office until next summer 2022.  I’m just not so sure I want to work in a small studio apartment ..

Would anyone have any thoughts as to whether I should stay at parents another year and pay off my bills or move out ASAP?  I was having fun in city before Covid hit but I was paycheck to paycheck.  I currently contribute a lot to retirement 4.5% mandatory, 17% to 401k, and pay 4% city wage tax.  That’s where I good chunk of my money is going right now apart from saving 1k a month.

On one hand, I suspect that competition between services like BlockFi, Ledn, etc will increase upward pressure on rates, but on the other hand, the supply of coins from people looking for this relatively low-risk yield may outstrip demand and drive those rates down.  Then there's the whole contango trade that's doing whatever it's doing.

Has anyone published any articles/blogs/podcasts/research that games out potential future scenarios for these rates on deposits?

I know based on the renovations I’ve done already and the increase of value for the property alone that it will appraise at the very least 50-60K above the balance of the mortgage already. Refinanced almost 6 months ago with an interest rate of 2.5%. 

My mother in law suggests a home equity line of credit to knock it out as quickly as possible and then refinancing again while rates are still pretty low. A bank rep we talked to said they thought reappraising and taking cash out would be a better thing to do, because HELOCs have variable rates. However, doing that would make my interest rate on my mortgage higher.

solar,"Just purchased a 13.5kW system (37 panels, 3 inverters, 2 Powerwalls, ~110% offset) with Sunrun | Requesting thoughts on the specific equipment","37x Longi LR4-60HPH-360M panels  
2x SolarEdge SE6000H-USS3 inverters  
1x SolarEdge SE3800H-USS3 inverter (Will not need this, and am not getting this, but added in initial plan)  
2x Tesla Powerwall 2 (comes with the gateway)

We bought our house 40 mins outside of San Francisco in 2017 and plan to live in it for many years to come. Our average energy bill through a utility company whose rates increase over time, **\~$445/month** currently. We have a growing family (currently 4 adults and 1 baby) and all work completely from home (lots of energy being used all the time = always in tier 3 = high kW rates).

I interviewed five companies over a 2-3 period, each around 1-2 hour video call in extensive detail. Tesla, SunPower, Sungrade, SunWorks and ended up going with Sunrun. **Complete solar plan = $320/month at 1.99% APR for 15 years, payoff completely at any time.** Obviously buying outright is best, but if you need to finance there are plenty of very good options out there (the lowest accepted credit score I found was 620, the median at 650, and high ends at 670+). **We get a federal tax credit of \~$11k.** We are actually using that to pay off one of our cars and purchasing a Tesla Model 3 in a few months.

Sunrun warranties + services (these vary from company to company quite a bit so make sure to check on this):  
\-25 Yr System Maintenance and Repairs  
\-25 Yr Monitoring  
\-10 Yr Roof Penetration Warranty  
\-25 Yr Performance Guarantee  
\-25 Yr Battery Replacement

Our utility account will transition to where annually they will calculate out our energy usage vs solar production, which our system should be around 110% offset of my existing electric bill that should place the bill on the utility, but there are still connection fees and taxes, so we'll see.

Current average annual electric bill: $5,400 / \~18,000 kWh  
Projected average annual solar production (annual solar payment): $3,840 / \~19,500 kWh

Next steps with Sunrun:  
\-Complete engineering plans  
\-Pull permits  
\-Schedule installation (2-5 weeks out from now)  
\-Inspection  
\-PGE approval (turn it all on!)

personalfinance,Want to use home equity to my advantage. I'd like some advice on making the most of my efforts,"Hey! I have a house that we've owned for a little over a year. I've put a lot of sweat equity into it in the way of major renovations. Last thing to do is the kitchen. We bought the house for $242k with $10k down. Interest rate of course is going to be pretty high at 6%. The original intent was to fix it up with cash flow then refinance the rate down.

What's the best way to handle my situation? I am optimistic at $100k in equity with $70k conservatively. A few goals I have:

1. Lower my interest rate from 6% to something around 2-3%
2. Pay off $15k in CC debt
3. Use the rest to start earning money passively.

Should I look into other options? HELOC vs Refi?

I'm 27 and not too risk-adverse. I want to keep equity in the house as low as possible and use that money elsewhere, so I'm leaning towards refinancing. I really think that using the money to start getting into real estate would make the a lot of sense and be something that my wife and I can do well. no interest in really becoming a lessor so the house would likely be a flip. What would you do in my position? I have some low interest cars, and some low interest student loans that are low risk to me. Basically, these are my cards, how would you play them?

Thanks in advance. I've beat my head against a wall trying to reason through it all, but I just don't know.

My outstanding mortgage is about two thirds  the value of the house. I am saving to buy a bigger house (my current home is too small for my family), so I am able to pay for either the repair or the new roof out of pocket without issue. My mortgage is my only debt.  


But given low interest rates, I am thinking it might make sense to take out a home equity loan of about 10k to pay for a new roof and do a few other things around the house.  


Is this an okay plan? Or should I just pay out of pocket and be done with the issue?",finance
personalfinance,HELP! How should I budget out upcoming finances?,"Hello, I'm looking for some solid advice. Please don't crucify me. I know this isn't an ideal situation, but I'm trying to fix it. Here's a little background: 

I'm 25 years old and trying to fix a lot of the financial decisions that I made in my early 20's. Those bad choices included taking my 700 credit score down to about 450, maxing out a credit card, a bank closing my account due to negative balance, and lots of bills in collections. Since that time, I've tried to work really hard paying things off and making things right. I've paid the bank back, and paid everything that was in collections. However, I still need to pay off the credit card charge off. The charge off amount is $1478. 

I now have a Transunion score of 632, an Equifax credit score of 635, and FICO score of 616. Definitely not anything to brag about by any means, but I'm trying. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Now, here's where I need advice:

Because I had made such mistakes with my finances, I have a couple open accounts with high interest rates. The main account that is the highest is my car payment. Winter of 2019, the car that I'd paid cash for broke down, and needed a completely new engine as well as other things. I'd already put so much money into trying to fix the vehicle, that I'd tapped out of my emergency fund. I had no way to get to work for 2 months and was just taking Uber's. Because of this, I looked into Carvana, because I knew that they would accept my low credit score.  I now pay $327/mo. towards my car with an astronomical interest rate of 25.07%. Horrible decision on my part, but at the time, I felt I needed to do it in order to get to work.

 Now, my credit union that I do my banking with has told me that they can refinance the loan and bring my payments down to $248.79 with an interest rate of 12.49% if I put $2,055 down. They are asking for money down due to the charge off that is still on my credit report.  

Credit Karma has recommended a company called AutoPay to refinance through which would bring my monthly payments down to an estimated monthly payment of $207 and an estimated interest rate of 6.24%. I'm unsure if this company would require me to put any money down as I haven't began an application process yet.

Would either of these options be a good choice?

Another important piece of information to note is that I am getting married in May 2022. I was planning on putting my tax return, and upcoming stimulus check towards the wedding. Now, I'm wondering if I should instead put the stimulus check towards the charge off account, and refinance my vehicle instead? If I did this, then I'd put the amount that I'm saving on car payments each month towards the cost of the wedding. My parents are helping out with a portion of the wedding, but my fiancé will have about $5k to put towards it, and I'll have about $3k to put down towards it. 

Any and all advice is much appreciated! Thank you",finance

stocks,Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics to Commercialize Canada’s First Automated Heavy Duty Trucking Technology,"Canadian National retailer Canadian Tire Corporation and Toronto based start-up NuPort Robotics Inc., Canada's first autonomous trucking company, have announced a partnership with the Ontario government to invest $3 million to undertake an automated heavy duty trucking project to test a first-of-its-kind-in-the-world technology.

The breakthrough technology provides a transportation solution for the middle mile, the short-haul shuttle runs that semi-tractor trailers make between distribution centres, warehouses and terminals each day. It is designed to enable next-generation automated trucks that are more fuel efficient, safer to operate, and provide an enhanced driver experience.

Backed by $1 million in support from the Ontario government through Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) and matched by $1 million investments from Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics, respectively, the two-year project is applying proprietary, artificial intelligence (AI) technology from NuPort Robotics to retrofit two conventional semi-tractor trailers - which will always be attended by a driver - with high-tech sensors and controls, a touchscreen navigation system, and other advanced features such as obstacle and collision avoidance.

""Ontario is proud to be a global leader in automated and connected vehicle technology and this innovative project is an exciting milestone toward automated vehicle tech in the trucking industry,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Ontarians rely on goods being delivered by trucks across the province every day and projects like this are demonstrating the ways that automated truck technology could help businesses meet delivery demands more efficiently while supporting a strong supply chain in Ontario.""

""This project applies unique and made-in-Ontario Artificial Intelligence technology that offers increased safety and efficiency, with a reduced carbon footprint, to the goods supply chains on which we all rely,"" said Vic Fedeli, Ontario Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This is the latest example of how Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network acts as a catalyst, fostering partnerships between ambitious technology start-ups and industry to develop and commercialize next generation transportation technologies that strengthen our economy and benefit society.""

""The trucks are currently transporting goods between a Canadian Tire distribution centre in the Greater Toronto Area and nearby rail terminals within a 12.5 mile radius, and early results are promising"" said Raghavender Sahdev, CEO of NuPort Robotics. ""The aim of the project is to develop a system that incorporates an autopilot feature for conventional trucks with a driver, leading to the most efficient way to drive and increase safety. The sensors work as a ‘safety cocoon' to cover blind spots and prevent accidents and the end result is peak fuel efficiency, meaning lower carbon emissions, and peak driving performance for an overall more optimal transportation experience.""

NuPort Robotic's approach to autonomous trucking is unique in the industry because it focuses only on solving the middle mile challenge, using a known set of predetermined trucking routes that are repetitive and high frequency as opposed to general highway driving. Ultimately, when implemented on fixed routes in the future, Canadian Tire will benefit from faster commercial deployments and improvements in supply chain sustainability.

""Canadian Tire embraces innovation and is always testing new technologies to improve our operational efficiency and safety. As proud Canadian companies, the safety of all stakeholders, including drivers, employees, customers, and public will be the top priority as we work together towards deployment of this technology,"" said Gary Fast, Vice-President of Transportation, Canadian Tire.

personalfinance,Federal income tax bracket help with salary and surprised bonus,"Hello everyone and thank you ahead of time for your help.  


I am currently around the 12% tax rate based on this chart from the Tax Foundation website:  
[https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/](https://taxfoundation.org/2021-tax-brackets/)  
(Pay is $50,000 or so and I am currently putting 20% into 401k and 1% into Roth. Leaving myself with roughly $39k in reported wages.)

&amp;#x200B;

|Rate|For single Individuals|
|:-|:-|
|10%|Up to $9,950|
|12%|$9,951 to $40,525|
|22%|$40,526 to $86,375|

&amp;#x200B;

However I got a really kind bonus from my boss and her boss of 1900$.   
After some research I found that the bonus is part of the supplemental income and is taxed at 22%.  


My question is, would this technically raise my overall gross income from this job and bump myself up to 22% tax bracket? If so I plan on increasing my 401k contributions to place myself under the $40,525 limit again or contribute a greater amount to charities this year.

personalfinance,Roth IRA excess contributions made 6 years ago. What do I do?,"I made excess contributions to my Roth IRA in 2014 and 2015. I corrected the excess in 2020 (before 2019 taxes were due) by removing the excess and earnings on it.

According to my research, I have to file [Form 5329](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-5329) to pay a 6% excise tax on the excess for every year that it wasn't corrected, and also pay a 10% penalty on the correction since it's an early distribution. What I'm not sure about:

* Do I have to amend all my previous tax returns, for years 2014 to 2019?  
The [instructions for Form 5329](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i5329.pdf), under ""Prior tax years"", says ""If you don't have any other changes ***AND*** haven't previously filed a federal income tax return for the prior year, file the prior year's version of Form 5329 by itself"". But what if I don't have other changes and I ***HAVE*** previously filed a tax return? It doesn't provide instructions for that case...
* Do I even need to be proactive in paying these taxes and penalties? One tax accountant told me that I shouldn't bother unless the IRS contacts me. He also mentioned that after 3 years some sort of statute of limitations expires.

With so many years passed since the excess contributions, so many forms I might have to amend/send, and so much money owed, this is causing me a lot of stress, so thank you in advance for any help!",finance

I have 6 months set aside as an emergency fund in the bank.

I have 35% of my net worth sitting in a brokerage account that is 90% cash at the moment.

I got the additional cash in the brokerage account from the sale of a house and with the low interest rates decided to take out the larger mortgage and make the cash work rather than dumping it into the house. It was gaining 1.5% in a money market account but is no longer.

I guess this is the reason we are where we are with the stock market. It keeps growing because there is nowhere else to go with our money.

personalfinance,Refinancing vehicle,"ETA: So someone brought it to my attention it's possible they took the bigger chunk of interest out in the beginning. I looked at my statements and it appears this is the case. So as they said, the damage re: interest has essentially been done. I'm going to keep my current loan and make extra payments to pay off faster. Appreciate all the helpful replies!

When my husband and I bought our Highlander 4ish years ago our credit was awful. Maxed out cards and he lived a good portion of his adult life in Greece and when he was in NYC he didn't have credit cards. He had no credit. 

Our loan was 72 months 15.24%. I'm aware how awful this is because prior to my first marriage divorce my credit score was around 750. My loan before that was 2.99%. We needed the vehicle. 

Here we are, we've been working on our credit and it's about 660 now. We're almost under 30% utilization on our cards but it the cards haven't reported yet so we're technically still showing 80+%    

Anyway,I decide to try to refinance to get lower interest rate/payment and I was going to double the payment. So I was dealing with Auto Approve. They said 48 months at 5.99% would be $426. Sweet, I can easily double that and pay off in 2 years. However, my husband decided to do the math. Currently pay $592 for 32 more months. When you multiply 592 x 32 and 426 x 48 the originally loan payment ends up costing us less overall. Are we idiots? How is that possible? I asked for a quote or something to review and we said she doesn't have anything until we push it through. 

Help???? At this point it seems paying an extra $1000 a month on my loan is the best option. Now I'm annoyed because I have a hard credit hit from this and we were going to try to buy a new car once I get this one paid off. We have a family of 6 now so I was going to pay off the Highlander and keep that for my car and then we were going to buy a suburban for our family car.",finance

My application was countered at $5000, ""cash"", meaning I could pay the credit cards with it if I want, but they would not specifically be included in the loan.  I was hoping to get at least $7k, but $5k is low for my needs.  

Can I counter the counter offer?  Or would this likely result in a denial?  

Do I have any other options beside bank shopping?  I have read that my loan amount may not change by much, even if I shop around.  

Also interest rate offered was 10.99.

personalfinance,A low interest car loan + investment makes more mathematical sense than buying cash upfront. Am I wrong?,"I used to follow Dave Ramsey back when I was younger. I appreciated the advice, because it encouraged me to save and live humble while everyone I knew was buying expensive stuff and living it up. It allowed me to slowly grow my business and 13 years later be better off financially than the people I knew who were splurging on everything.

One area of confusion for me was always his car loan advice. This was a point I never understood, and I'd love to learn what I am missing. **From my perspective, it seems like taking a car loan and putting the money you would've spent on the loan into a stock that tracks the S&amp;P500 index is financially better.**   

Let's say I want a $46490 car. Cash price, $46490. Loan price is 15000 + (489 \* 72) for down payment plus 72 monthly payments of $489. So, the car loan costs (15000 + (489 \* 72)) - 46490) = $3718. **The interest I am paying throughout the lifetime of the 72 month loan at 2.49% APR is $3718.**    

Let's take the first year of car ownership. I will have paid $15,000 down payment, plus ($489 \* 12) in payments in the first year of my loan. For the first year, I will have an additional $20868 available, that I would not have available to me if I had paid cash for the car upfront. This is assuming I put aside a full year's of payments just to be responsible. If I put that $20868 into the S&amp;P500 in June of 2017, it would've returned 14% in a year, which is $2921.52. My $20868 is now $23789.52! **In the first year, the cost of the loan is now reduced to (3718 - 2921.52) which is $796.48.**

Let's say I pull out (489 \* 12) at the end of the year to pay for the second year's payments, I now have 17921.52. 2018 sucked compared to 2017, the stock market took a dump at the end of the year so you only had about 4% return if you invested in the S&amp;P500. ((17921.52 \* 1.04) - 17921.52) shows us that **in year 2, you already made $716.86. $2921.52 + 716.86 = $3638.38.** 

**We're only at the end of year 2 of the 6 year car loan, and we've recouped 97.8% of the cost of taking the loan by investing into an S&amp;P500 index fund.** In the second year of the loan, you are already very close to being ahead of where you would've been had you bought the car upfront!   

**By the time you get to year 3, you will have profited as a result of taking the loan &amp; investing the spare cash you would've dumped into the car in an index fund, than what you'd have available if you paid for the car upfront in cash.** By year 4 and 5 you will have profited off the low interest rate. A commission free broker like ameritrade or robinhood will allow you to buy SPY cheaply enough that it will not cut into the profits here.  

So long as the rate of interest on the car loan is lower than the rate of return in a stable index fund, it makes sense to me, financially, to take a car loan. Is the desire for people to pay cash based on an old time reality when interest rates were much higher? Is it a mental thing, as in, 99% of the people using car loans use it to buy things they can't afford and not invest the money in an index fund? 

I would understand it if his line of thinking was *""The people who wind up coming to me for help are people that can't be trusted to actually invest the money they are not putting into buying the car upfront with cash into an index fund tracking stock.""* But, I can't understand how it makes sense mathematically, unless you believe the stock market is going to crash. 

Further, you would be putting the money into an asset that you can't easily pull it out of anytime you need. If you need the money from the SPY shares, you sell and withdraw to your bank account in 3-4 days. If you want the money you put into your car out of it.. good luck getting that done quickly while still retaining use of your car. 

What am I missing, that makes it more sensible to buy a car cash instead of take a loan and put the $   
 you didn't pay for the car into a stock? Where is the error in my math?",finance

If I withdraw some cash from my savings account, does it change the interest rate in any way? And will it show up in any way in tax reports? Does the transaction only show on the savings account or will it also show on the checking account?",finance

If they reject it, can I file online the second time? I only paper filed it because i just never got my 2019 tax return and so I have no idea what my AGI or PIN was but I learnt that you can just put in that you didn’t file taxes in the prior year on TurboTax..

Hey Everyone,

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. Finally, let me know if you like it or if it’s super ultra lame today.

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Actual spycam footage of Brian Armstrong watching Coinbase customers discover ADA. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1370516335298420736](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1370516335298420736)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying "" Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

2. Famed crypto enthusiast and billionaire Mike Novogratz asks the Cardano world ""Can anyone make a real bull case for [$ADA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=cashtag_click)? Does anyone build on it? Use it? Why is market cap so high? Should it be a funding asset? It’s one of the few cryptos I haven’t traded in my life.""

10. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
11. What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?

12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh. 
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)

17. Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark. Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

35. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have a hairline that is even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.
36. Cardano reached 550k wallets in half the time it took BTC [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1369933366368362496](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1369933366368362496)
37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum). This is one of those nice articles where the British guy pleasantly reads it to you if you want. Use this one to convince all your friends you are the ultimate blockchain expert:  “listen Kyle...the shortcoming of UTXO accounting is....” [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/)

Bitcoin,I love my crypto nerds but some of u just aren’t all that book smart. 21st century inflation explained to noobs,"Please for the love of god look up what debt to asset ratios are..

The more the US FED prints the more it owes back in debt, this isn’t the same inflation like we’ve historically experienced when we were tied to the gold standard. 

Imagine I pick apples for a living, and I need to always give 6 apples to this guard to cross a bridge out of town and get to the better apple orchards, 

now imagine I come back with a huge haul of 4 baskets of apples and the next day he says that He needs atleast 12 apples from me now to pass the bridge, since he’s seen me get 4 baskets without a problem.

Well y’all are looking at inflation like it’s the 4 baskets of apples, not the guard... and on-top of that, you’re even counting all your profit before you even made it back to town, and paid off your debt to the guard,  mixed with the fact that USD isn’t the only currency in the world and other countries have been consistently printing money this whole time, I think some of you need to reflect your game plan.

investing,"MeaTech, first publicly traded cultivated meat company, just launched $25 Million IPO","Figured this was worth posting for anyone interested in the future of traditional meat alternatives:

[MeaTech Announces $25 Million US Initial Public Offering &amp; Approval For Nasdaq Listing](https://vegconomist.com/trade/meatech-announces-25-million-us-initial-public-offering-approval-for-nasdaq-listing/)

First publicly traded company in this sector, they're using 3D printing technology to create high-end cultured meats such as steak. They create their own cells and meat tissue for this process. In December they acquired Piece of Meat, a cultured fat technology company, and said their first product could be on the market as early as 2022.

I see huge growth in this sector over the next few years. We've all heard about lab grown meat, usually in jest from news stories making light of it. But as years pass it's becoming increasingly clear that this is going to be a real and expansive market. Reports about the environmental urgency created by animal agriculture continue to pile up, and plant-based options have exploded in popularity over the past few years as well - but are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Products like this will be key in filling that gap and transitioning our food system away from current conventional models, by providing options to those not interested in plant-based alternatives. Cultivating meat also opens up a massive door in the future to addressing food scarcity issues.

MeaTech however launched to very little fanfare. Here's some info [ripped from Seeking Alpha:](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3672241-lab-grown-meat-company-meatech-3d-to-open-on-nasdaq-after-mixed-ipo#comments)

* Lab-grown meat firm MeaTech 3D (MITC) sank as much as 23.8% in its first trading day following a U.S. IPO as investors found the Israeli start-up’s stock less than appetizing.
* MeaTech fell to as low as $7.85 in early Nasdaq trading, way down from its $10.30 initial public offering. Shares beefed up some later in the session, but closed at $10 a share, down 2.9% lower on the day.
* MeaTech had a mixed IPO that saw it sell more American Depositary Shares than expected, but at a weak $10.30-a-share price.
* On one hand, the company sold 2.4M ADSs, well above the 1.7M that it originally offered. However, the company had originally expected to sell shares at $15.10 apiece.
* Still, the combination of more shares at a lower price meant the IPO raised about $25M, which was MeaTech’s original target.
* The firm also granted underwriters the option to buy 364,000 additional ADSs for overallotments.
* Each ADS represents 10 ordinary shares in the company, which already trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange under the ticker “MEAT” and U.S. OTC market as “MTTCF.”
* MEAT fell 5.8% in Tel Aviv on Thursday ahead of the U.S. IPO, while MTTCF lost 17.2% Friday to close at $1.20. That took the company’s market cap down to about $97.2M.
* MeaTech is developing three-dimensional printers and the biotechnology and manufacturing processes needed to assemble lab-grown proteins into meat “without the need for animal slaughter,” as per its S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
* The company also wrote in the filing that unlike rivals who are trying to develop “unstructured” lab-grown meat products like sausages, MeaTech aims to create “high-margin, high-value structured and cultured meat products such as steak.”

And here's a [bit of DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/greeninvestor/comments/m1yv2o/meatech_3d_ipo_will_this_3d_meat_printer_also/) from u/birdweiser2 as well:
&gt;PROS

&gt;First 3d meat printer (lab grown meat) listed on a major US exchange. The market likes cleantech, 3d printers, and stocks that are unique.

&gt;The founder (Sharon Fima) worked for Nanodimension. Should be enough for Cathie Wood fanboys. It could maybe get added to ARKK - who knows - but people are gonna think it will.

&gt;Bill Gates said rich companies shouldn't be eating meat. Gates is invested in Memphis Meats which does something really similar to what MeaTech does, but isn’t a public company. Memphis raised in 2019 which put the valuation at 2 billion, then raised again a couple months ago, but none of the articles I saw gave a valuation on that raise. Can anyone shine some light on that?

&gt;CONS

&gt;This company has no revenue and says it won’t for a while. So it’s basically a SPAC lol, but at a fraction of the price since they’re mostly all a billion and higher.

&gt;There’s a lot of competitors in this space, but again this is the first to list and it’s at least 10x cheaper than the biggest competitor.

&gt;Their meat products will be expensive when they do go on sale, but I think rich people will want them still. Kinda like how Tesla started - their cars were expensive for a long time, rich people bought them, it helped grow the company, and now they’re cheaper.


While this clearly won't see instant explosive growth like Beyond Meat did (an established brand that had been on the market for years), I entered a small position to keep an eye on this sector. Haven't seen anyone talking about it, so I'm interested to see what others think!",finance

personalfinance,Can't Deposit Money in Roth IRA?,"2 questions:

I'm in NJ if that matters for any kind of legal reasoning.
I made a Roth IRA back in late 2019 with my local credit union bank. In 2020 I made a small deposit into the account which went through no problem. As of recently I tried to make another deposit and I sat down with the guy and he told me that I am not allowed to make deposits on my Roth IRA. I don't remember the exact reasoning behind it but he said it was because of the ""type"" of Roth I had. I did a 5 year CD Roth IRA. I thought that I could deposits into any Roth IRA and he said no. On their website it even says you can contribute to a maximum of 6k per year. I'm confused and was wondering if this is an actual thing? A bank rule or federal rule? He offered to put my deposit in a small 4-5 month Roth cd where I could deposit money, or into the accumulator, but I said no and left without making any transaction. I'm going to go back soon and print out a paper from their website that says I can contribute and ask him to show me on paper where I can't deposit money.

It seemed like he was trying to sell me the accumulator really bad. That I needed it. 

Another note: When I tried to first make the account I didn't know there was different kinds. They made me something called a, ""NJ Roth IRA Accumulator"". The same day I later went back and realized I wanted the other Roth so they transfered the money into the 5 year cd Roth I have now. My other question is, will this empty ""Accumulator"" affect me in any way? Tax related or something? I asked to get rid of it but they said they can't, there's nothing in it and to not worry about it.

Tldr: can I make deposits in my 5 year Roth IRA CD?",finance
economy,About interest rates,"I'm not from the US, not have I taken any loans so this is less clear to me.  


1. What exactly is 'interest rate'?   
For example, reading up on investopedia, it says that interest rates and inflation generally have an inverse relationship. So is this the average rate that banks charge consumers and business owners?
2. What affects interest rates?   
I'm reading that rising interest rates hinders inflation. Somewhere else I read that inflation causes interest rates to rise. Which is the cause and which is the affect?
3. How are interest rates calculated?  
I don't want to know the exact calculation, but at least the factors which is used for the calculation. For example stock fluctuation is based on the balance of sellers and buyers.",finance

investing,Bridgewater co-CIO Prince on inflation and passive investing,"“with inflation rising and the economy doing better and the bond yield going up, do they keep it from going up or do they let it go? If they do yield curve control, do they risk the dollar?”

“Prince — co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater, which manages $150bn in assets — said he was also troubled by the growth of index investing. With low rates leaving yield-hungry investors few alternatives to equities, he said, index funds were paying ever higher prices for stocks with lower future returns.

“It has the look of a Ponzi scheme,” he said, “because if you can sell it on to someone else that’s fine but what happens if you can’t.”

TLDR; QE and passive investing has created a bubble in equites and the Fed will have to decide whether to yield curve control or let inflation run wild

personalfinance,Best option for short term savings (2 years),"Hi, I am writing here hoping for some guidance.

I have recently finished paying off private student loans, and instead of starting to spend the money I had budgeted for loans, I would like to save it.

I expect to be needing more money in around 2 years. Because there is a high chance I will be without a job for a while. So I would like a way, to easily save or invest this money with the intend of withdrawing it in 2 years time. 

My current savings account has a very low interest rate, so it seems I need to invest in some way. But I would like to invest in a way where I can just deposit the money each month and not worry about choosing stocks. And being able to withdraw it in 2 years without large penalties or fees.

I currently pay the max payments to my 401k which is intended for retirement.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Finally done with old cars, looking for something newer but do I get a bank loan or finance at the dealership?","My 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee is once again in the shop. It’s not the most expensive repair but I’m deciding I want to stop while I’m ahead as this is the second moderately large repair. I was looking at cars that are a couple years old 2017-2019 from dealerships as that is who I trust more than Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. I’m thinking of spending $15,000-$19,000 on a Toyota or a Honda. 
Currently I live at home and will for the next two years of college so I have no rent or food to pay for. I don’t have to start paying on my student loans for two and a half years (around $30,000 when I finish in 2 years). I would be putting down $8000 to $10,000 on the car and finance the rest. My plan would be to pay off a very large portion before I have to act on these loans so I can get debt free once again in a short time. 
My parents suggested getting a loan from my bank but there is also the option to finance at the dealership. Which is the better route to go considering the interests rates? My credit score is in the 700’s but I worry my age might scare them into giving me a higher interest rate. Is this true or am I just making things up in my head? 

Any advice on financing or even reliable car suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",finance
Bitcoin,Thoughts on upcoming USD inflation,"With the massive amount of USD having been printed over the past year, any logical person sees the next step is inflation. Do you think with people like myself putting a large amount of their savings into bitcoin it will bring some stability to it's value?  If so, what to you expect its stable USD exchange rate to be in the enxt year or two (i know, that depends on the federp reserve) ? 

Do you see the days of ""bitcoin as a high risk investment"" going away in the next year or two?

It's sad that the US Dollar is collapsing right in front of our eyes. Ron Paul and Peter Schiff (I know, he's a boomer that doesn't understand BTC. lol. ok grandpa, go read your newspaper and listen to CNN/Fox News) have been preaching this for year and it's pretty clear that it's coming.

CryptoCurrency,COMPREHENSIVE Collection of Celsius FAQs + Company Research (Can You Really Trust Them?),"With all the constant questions on Celsius here on Reddit (and my own research before investing heavily into the CEL token), I compiled a master FAQ list below. This helped me with my own research before investing 6 digit figures into the platform, and with convincing my other friends to join me as well. 

Note I had to remove like 20+ URLs due to Reddit policy, which I can send over to you if you PM me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

===GENERAL QUESTIONS===

Q: Is Celsius a bank?

A: NO, Celsius is not a bank. However, you can store either crypto or fiat currency (i.e. US dollars) in Celsius to earn interest rates &gt;6%. So in that way, Celsius acts similar functionally to a bank with superior returns. 

Q: Is Celsius profitable?

A: Yes, their business model is to give 80% of profit to depositors while retaining 20% for themselves. Because of this, Celsius adjusts interest rates for depositors as frequently as on a weekly basis. 

Q: How big is Celsius?

A: Celsius has the 2nd largest asset manager by AUM (assets under management) in the crypto space after GrayScale. - 

Q: Does Celsius have withdrawal fees?

A: No

Q: Why do other companies have withdrawal fees but Celsius doesn’t?

A: Celsius eats the cost of the withdrawal fees. That’s called customer service!

Q: Is there a limit on how often you can withdraw at Celsius?

A: Not currently (vs. BlockFi with 1 free withdrawal/month limit)

Q: Does Celsius mine Bitcoin?

A: Yes. Celsius has more hashpower from its mining operations than Riot, which is a publicly traded company valued at around $5 billion right now.

Q: Does Celsius loan out coins to short sellers?

A: In March 5th AMA, Alex said that Celsius doesn’t lend coins to directional traders (i.e. shorts) because that's where loss of funds occur, they only loan out coins to market makers

Q: Are all the CEL tokens distributed? Do they still need to be mined?

A: Yes, they’re all distributed already. 

Q: How much CEL does Celsius own?

A: Celsius holds about 270m tokens of the 695m. You can see the comprehensive breakdown here   

Q: Where’s the stats on Celsius users?

A: Here -  (REDACTED)

Q: Does Celsius work with Chainlink?

A: Yes, Celsius will use and support Chainlink’s Price Reference Data to calculate interest payment amounts to users. This will:

• exploit a decentralised, transparent and highly secure approach

• create a smart contract audit trail of its lending operations.

This will ensure that all Celsius interest payments will rely on the increased security of the decentralised network of independent – and security reviewed – Sybil-resistant Chainlink nodes. This means Celsius can move towards a new level of security and reliability which take advantage of Chainlink’s approach to decentralisation. -  

Q: How long has Celsius been around?

A: Since 2017 -  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

===SECURITY QUESTIONS===

Q: How healthy is Celsius? Can it survive a security breach?

A: Stats for Celsius as of Feb 12, 2021

\- 8.75b AUM (excluded California due to no lending licence); now updated on app &amp; website

\- 400k signups total, 18k last week

\- 327m gross transfers

\- 88m net deposits

\- 1m paid in promocodes last week

\- 5.8m paid in interest last week

Q: Celsius isn’t FDIC insured.

A: (1) FDIC insurance isn’t even big enough to cover the megabanks in the US from failing. (2) Celsius has $2 billion in reserves to a $10 billion AUM as of Feb 2021, while the Fed reserve requirement ratio for banks dropped to 0% during COVID-19, (3) several countries don’t have a FDIC insurance mechanism 

Q: Has Celsius been audited?

A: Yes, it was audited on Dec 2020 through Chainanalysis -   

Q: Does Celsius have insurance?

A: Celsius has insurance for its stored crypto, like most of its competitors. Problem is most of the coins on Celsius are loaned out at any given time, and no company has insurance on those coins right now. However, that’s mitigated by the fact that borrowers overcollateralize on Celsius. ALSO, YES Celsius IS coming out with opt-in insurance later in 2021.

Q: Who does Celsius custody with?

A: They use BitGo for coins in cold storage and Fireblocks for coins in hot wallets. See AMA here -  

Q: Can I trust the Celsius team? What’s their backgrounds?

A: Celsius puts security as a top priority--you can see this with app UI and withdrawal process that sacrifices convenience in order to mitigate user mistakes/hacks (users are often the weakest link and Celsius designs around this); a big, dedicated security team of Israeli cybersecurity professionals with an ""unlimited budget""; and the fact that Celsius has NEVER BEEN HACKED, unlike Ledger, Blockfi (), Nexus Mutual (), Binance (/)...the list goes on; and the use of Multiparty Computation (MPC) for securing funds internally (), which is the cutting edge of enterprise-grade encryption and security (). The fact that BlockFi got hacked on a SIM Swap is kinda shameful tbh. That's pretty much the 2nd thing everyone warns you about in crypto--don't use SMS based 2FA!!! (Note SMS based 2FA is not an option on the Celsius app)

Q: Is there like a technical architecture slide that shows the Celsius security stack?

A: Yes!  (URL Redacted)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

===TRANSACTION QUESTIONS===

Q: How does Celsius make money? It sounds too good to be true!

A: Celsius uses coins transferred by their customers as collateral for lending, rehypothecation, and other similar transactions. This works for a couple of reasons. (1) Celsius is one of the few organizations that accepts crypto as collateral, because JP Morgan certainly doesn’t. That enables Celsius to charge its borrowers a much higher interest rate than normally. 

Q: What if Bitcoin drops drastically?

A: Celsius overcollateralizes its loans.   

Q: Do you have proof that Celsius can survive a 50% Bitcoin drop?

A: In March 2020, Bitcoin dropped over 40% in a single day and Celsius was unaffected. 

Q: I have Bitcoin in my Celsius account, can I convert that to USDC or Ethereum?

A: Not yet, but in-app swaps are coming out later in 2021

Q: Can I connect my bank account to Celsius and buy Bitcoin directly?

A: Yes

Q: Can I buy crypto on Celsius through a credit card?

A: Yah but the fees are pretty high to do it that way so we recommend you fund your account in different ways

Q: What is CEL?

A: CEL is a “cryptocurrency” created by Celsius which sole purpose is to enable users to generate higher yield on their total portfolio if a certain % of their holdings are in the CEL token. For example, if I have a $10,000 account, and $3000 of that is in CEL token (with the rest in bitcoin), then my interest rate on Bitcoin would go up from 4% to 6%. This motivates users of Celsius to buy/hold the CEL token. 

Q: Is CEL the same thing as Celsius?

A: No. Celsius Network is the name of the company where you can deposit your crypto to earn interest. CEL is the name of a cryptocurrency token created by Celsius to assist with some of its mechanics.

Q: Can I buy CEL if I’m in the US?

A: No, Celsius considers CEL a security and only allows accredited investors to buy it. HOWEVER, you can buy most of the major cryptocurrencies (i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.) on Celsius. The SEC hasn’t officially ruled CEL a security, but Celsius is being cautious and following the law. If you make income &gt;$200k or have a net worth &gt;$1 million, you can buy CEL directly from the company by emailing them 

Q: Why can’t I buy CEL on exchanges? That’s sorta sketchy.

A: Alex has stated that Celsius doesn’t want to pay the exchange fees to list on Coinbase and other exchanges. With that said, you can buy CEL on BitFinex. 

Q: How can I buy CEL if I’m in the US then if I'm not rich?

A: You can use Uniswap or have an existing CEL user transfer CEL to your wallet.

Q: It’s taking me forever to transfer my USD to crypto, how long does this normally take???

A: Normally it takes 7 complete days at minimum, and can take a couple weeks max. It’s annoying, especially for new crypto users who aren’t use to / don’t know how long transactions can take.

Q: Is there a fee for buying crypto with Celsius? 

A: You pay in the spread, which is about 1%.

Q: Is there a fee for transferring crypto to Celsius?

A: You pay the gas fee for ERC-20 tokens (Ethereum-based tokens)

Q: How can I buy CEL if I’m NOT in the US?

A: Liquid, BitFinex, FTX, Uniswap

Q: Does Celsius participate in DeFi activity with our deposited coins?

A: Yes

Bitcoin,Coinflex is waging a shadow war against BlockFi,"I'm collecting some info for people who as I think the crypto community needs to be aware of bad actors and dishonest practices. While I do think using BlockFi has risks isn't decentralized by any means. What Coinflex is doing is harmful to crypto and our community.

We should call out this behavior and push people like this out of the community until they learn to act like adults.

Coinflex created a FUD website([https://ditchblockfi.com](https://ditchblockfi.com)) and has been using accounts on reddit to help fan the flames. I think this astroturfed movement is not organic. You can see they registered the domain and later changed it [here](https://i.imgur.com/u8WFhc6.png)

You can see an example of some of their reddit FUD on these posts that keep getting circulated:

They also recently have moved to [twitter](https://twitter.com/ditch_blockfi/status/1369177468310020098?s=19) after being called out on [this](/r/blockfi/comments/m12uzp/discussion_and_transparency_around_certain_risks/) r/blockfi post.

Coinflex then later changed their domain to private but the history is still there. https://www.whoxy.com/ditchblockfi.com

This is behavior I would expect from banks and governments. Sad to see it in our world.

 Some of the the biggest rebuttals people are saying is the ceiling in SK and the competition. This is defiantly something to keep in mind and look into.  As for me. I don't think this changes much in my eyes. I will wait a few weeks or months to buy because (as people have also said) it does seem pretty overvalued RIGHT NOW. With that said I still think this company has great potential and to me, most of the arguments being made against Coupang are arguments you can say about a lot of companies as well. Thanks again for the Feedback and the upvotes. Much appreciated!

This is my first ever DD, with that being said please be nice, and let me know if anything is wrong and or if I didn't include anything important. Would love some **constructive** criticism, thanks. Also with that being said I don’t know anything about anything. I'm just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here. I can’t tell the future. I am NOT a financial advisor.

I’m bullish on this stock but it did JUST go public therefore there isn’t a ton of history for how the stock performs. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

With that said. I hope you enjoy and learn something from this.

**Coupang Inc DD**

**Ticker - CPNG**

**Initial bullish info (for the apes who can't stand to read more than 100 words)**

* Talked about and known as the “Amazon of South Korea”
* Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba
* Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018
* IPO jumped more than 70%
* Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)
* CEO’s a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)
* Coupang has the highest market share of Korea's E-commerce business
* Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year
* Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow
* Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea
* Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services
* Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)
* Eco friendly packaging
* Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading

**Quantitative:**

* Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019
* Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020
* Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019
* Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019
* Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019

Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018

2018: -1.5B

2019: -698M

2020: -474M

In November 2018 Softbank's Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B

**Use of Proceeds:**

* Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.
* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.

I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don’t know anything.

📷

* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.

**Opportunity:**

Korea's GDP “gross domestic product” (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.

The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)

Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.

**Management:**

Range of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46

* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.
* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?
* \*\*Thuan Pham - (\*\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)

Other members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.

**Qualitative:**

Company Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: “How did I ever live without Coupang?”

* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.
* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)
* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.
* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. “People aren't the friendliest” “you're expected to work like a machine” “Work life balance can be hard” “needs more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.
* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)

**Services:**

* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.
* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.
* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and “Bombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I’d name them but I don’t think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show “Your Honor” and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *“We are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.”*
* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.
* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *“pursue operational excellence and innovation”* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don’t think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *“We believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.”*

**Top Risks:**

* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth
* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)
* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.

I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.

**TDLR:**

In my OPINION, based on everything I’ve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.

Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should’ve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing. As you may have noticed I haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I’m waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don’t own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I’m buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn’t you want to get into Amazon in 2005?

Thanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE

Bitcoin,The Paradox of Cryptocurrency Valuations,"This is a rather long post, so please bear with me. I will first describe an apparent mathematical paradox, and then relate it to the price of cryptocurrencies.

 

https://preview.redd.it/togan976oum61.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3cc40e677566e5daec2ceb88a1e4d0d25bb8fd6

# Paradox

Let us perform a Gedankenexperiment (a thought experiment).  
I promise you that this will be extremely relevant to cryptocurrencies, so don’t just skip this part.

  
Imagine that you are presented with two sealed envelopes, and told that each envelope contains a valid check (cheque) made out in your name.  
You are also told that the value of one of the checks is double that of the other check. (but not which envelope contains the larger amount).  
The envelopes are labelled ‘A’ and ‘B’, and you can only take one of them.  
Great! You excitedly decide to open envelope ‘A’. You receive a lovely surprise that it contains a check for $100. You can buy a nice pair of Nikes with that :)  
Now, you are given the option to swap and take envelope ‘B’ instead, but you will need to give up the first envelope and its $100 prize. ***Should you swap to the second envelope?***

 

Think about this for a moment. At first glance, it seems like there wouldn’t be any good reason to swap, since your prize might either double or halve.  
However, this is what is known as an asymmetrical bet. In fact, you have an even chance of gaining $100 or losing $50. In other words, you will end up with either $50 or $200 in your pocket, so your overall expected prize will actually be (200/2+50/2) = $125.  
So, mathematically, you should **certainly** swap to the other envelope, since then your expected prize is 25% more than your current prize.

This is all well and good, but there is an inherent ***paradox*** just around the corner...

You now know that when you opened envelope ‘A’ and found $100, you should indeed decide to swap to envelop ‘B’ instead.  
But regardless of the value stored in ‘A’, you should always swap to ‘B’. So you don’t even have to actually open ‘A’. Why not just choose ‘B’ in the first place?  
But hold on… if you were to open envelope ‘B’ first, then logic insists that you should then swap to envelope ‘A’.  
How can both envelopes be worth 25% more than the other one?

I am interested to hear **your** answers to the apparent paradox, but here are my two explanations of how to resolve it:  
**Answer 1. Resolve by Dismissing**  
Arguably, the initial setup of the problem is \*not possible\* in the real world. It is not possible to have two checks written down that has one double the value of other one, and with no preconceived information on the values of the checks.  
(This is akin to the old saw about ‘**what happens if an irresistible force meets an immovable object?**’. These two things cannot co-exist in the same universe, so the question is nonsensical to pose, let alone answer.)  
Why is the original description of the check/envelope scenario invalid? Because in the real world there are always ‘a priori’ facts known about checks. For instance, would a check for $100 be possible? Sure. $1000? Sure. $1,000,000,000? Well I guess, but perhaps not so likely, right?  
What about $1,000,000,000,000,000,000? You would have to say that a check for this amount is invalid or useless, and so *the relative chance of the check being worth an amount N is not completely flat over the set of all positive numbers N*.  
At some high dollar value, the likelihood of the ‘other check’ being a ‘doubled’ check is slightly less than 50%, and the chance of a ‘halved’ check is slightly more than 50%.  
In this way the paradox can be resolved, since the initial setup of the situation is not possible in the real world.

**Answer 2. Resolve by Infinity**  
An alternative solution to the paradox (and one that is more relevant to my upcoming segue into cryptocurrency) is the following:  
Given the original statement of the situation, each envelope does indeed contain 25% more than the other envelope. There is only one manner in which this is possible, and that is if the expected return (value) of both envelopes is infinite. (or $0, but we can ignore this case)  
Infinity plus 25% is still infinity. In a real mathematical sense, this is what we implied when we formulated the original problem statement. I*f there is truly no upper limit on the value of the checks, then the expected return is indeed infinite.*  
You can keep switching from envelope ‘A’ to envelope ‘B’ and back again in your mind (without even opening them) and each time your expected return will actually increase by 25%! It was infinitely large after the first choice, and 25% larger when you swapped to the other one. And again 25% larger when you swapped back to the original, etc!  (ah! The joys of infinity!)

========================

 

# CryptoCurrency Valuations

Now, let us draw some comparisons between this paradox and the market valuations of cryptocurrencies. I shall use the term ‘bitcoin’ here, but feel free to substitute your favorite coin in your mind whenever I write ‘bitcoin’.

Let us run a new thought experiment:  
**Crypto\_Gedankenexperiment**  
Imagine that it is 2021, and you are just hearing about an invention named ‘bitcoin’. Some people make outrageous claims about [hyperbitcoinization](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/) and how it will change the future of money.  
You are reliably informed that there is no logic by which to value the tokens of this new invention. In 12 months from now, one bitcoin is equally likely to be half its current value, or double its current value.  
You are very kindly gifted a single bitcoin. ***Should you keep the bitcoin for a year, or sell it immediately for its current price?***

As you might expect, this is also an asymmetrical bet. If you sell the bitcoin, you get some amount of dollars, $B. However if you keep the bitcoin, you have equal chances of doubling or halving your cash, which is a good thing!  
At the end of a year, you will (on average) end up with 1.25 times $B. You have just made 25% by HODLing.  
Given the situation as described, you should definitely hold onto your bitcoin.

But wait, this doesn’t just apply to you… it applies to everyone in the world. If you are going to make 25% just by HODLing, then everyone else can do the same. In an informed marketplace, this surely must push up today’s price for a bitcoin by nearly 25%, right? (minus a bit due to risks, inertia, interest rates, available capital, etc)  
But if the price $B today rises, that doesn’t affect the computation! (In the same way that you don’t actually need to open envelope ‘A’ in the original paradox to know that you should still swap to ‘B’.) You **still** make 25% just by waiting, even though today’s price is higher than you previously thought!  
*Man! I sure want some of that action*!

The parallels with the original Gedankenexperiment above are clear. If we really have no range expectations for the price of a bitcoin, and all values are equally likely, then the actual mathematical expected value for one bitcoin is infinite.  
This is the only way in which the value 1 year from now is 25% higher than today, *even if everyone knows it and factors it into their current buying decisions*.

**Bitcoin Price Probability Distribution**

Of course, in the real world, we don’t (quite) ascribe equal probabilities to all possible dollar values for a bitcoin. At some top end, we say… well a $Billion per coin is unrealistic.  
But recent history is littered with false conclusions about the extent of the ‘unknowingness’ of the true price for bitcoin.  
I would argue that the distribution curve for the bitcoin price is indeed flatter (more constant) than anyone ever expected, and it is ***flattening more every year***. A year ago, when BTC cost $5,000, the pronounced downward (i.e. less probable) curve of the expected price distribution started at, say, $10,000. Today, the curve is nearly flat out across to the $50,000 range and beyond.

# Summary

* If we have no *a priori* information about the price probability distribution for an item, then the expected value of that item is infinite.
* If the value of an item can either double or halve over time with equal probability, then in the long term its value increases without bound.

personalfinance,FreeTaxUSA says I owe $100 more than TurboTax,"Long time TT user who decided to give FreeTaxUSA a try. I've been filling in my data on both sites and with everything entered my state tax refunds (CA) match to the exact dollar, but for federal tax due I owe $101 more on FTUSA than on TT. I've checked and rechecked data and can't find any discrepancies. Any strategies for how to track this down?

Update: thanks to a pointer from u/wild_b_cat I was able to see my approximate 1040 on TT. I can see my entire federal filing on FTUSA. The discrepancy is in the ""Other taxes"" section where TT is $101 lower. According to FTUSA this comes from forms 8959 and 8960, which are for Additional Medicare Tax and Net Investment Income Tax. And that's where my forensics have bottomed out. I'm not sure which of these two TT computes differently. It seems like one possible area of wiggle room is in computing the portion of state tax allocable to investment income (8960 line 9b).

Update 2: I think I've found the missing $101! It is related to line 9b of form 8960. I content that a reasonable way to compute the value for line 9b is: (total investment income) / AGI * state income tax. If I do this, I end up with a number which is higher than what FTUSA reports by $2664. If I then multiply that difference by 3.8%, the applicable tax rate according to line 17 of form 8960, I get $101! This is a subtracted quantity, so that would lower my overall taxes by $101 as well. 

Furthermore, applying the same logic I can see that FTUSA is using a flat rate of $10k for state income tax in order to compute the amount of state tax allocable to investment income. This is weirdly the same as the SALT deduction limit and I found a similar discussion about this distinction on an older thread on the TT website: https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/investments-and-rental-properties/discussion/how-is-form-8960-line-9b-calculated-by-turbotax/00/534138

Update 3: Some helpful info on a similar thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0mjp7/freetaxusa_bug_niit_tax_not_including_state/ Though I question the contention that the full $10K allowable expense for state taxes can be allocated to investment income.",finance

personalfinance,Sell or Continue Renting First Home?,"Hi PF!

My husband and I bought our starter home - a 3 Bed 2 Bath condo - in May of 2015 for $103,000. Unfortunately (fortunately?) I received a job offer that I didn't want to refuse in 2016 that required location to NYC. Considering we would have lost money if we sold, we decided to rent the property out instead and have been doing so since with only a 3 month period with no renters in the past 5 years. We're at the point where we could sell and not lose money, and given the relatively high interest rate and inability to refinance (given that it's a rental property and the low total amount borrowed, we haven't found a lender willing to do so), I'm wondering if it makes more sense to 

1) sell when the current tenants lease is up, 

2) aggressively pay down the mortgage in the next \~5 years, 

3) do nothing and continue on as we have been.

All of the relevant info:

* We put 3% down and have a 30 year mortgage (fixed rate) at 5% with no PMI. We currently owe $84,750.
* Current value of the condo is roughly $120,000
* Fair market rent is $1,400 for the unit. Mortgage payment is $760 and HOA is $375 (high, but includes water, security, fitness/pool/dog run and lawn maintenance)
* Condo is located in a market with predominantly renters (Orlando, FL)
* I am able to comfortably cover the mortgage/HOA indefinitely without renters
* Property Management fees are 10% ($140/mo) plus 36% of one month when a new tenant moves in. There are also renewal/legal prep fees, but they're negligible. They do not collect anything as long as the unit is empty.
* We're mostly breaking even, all said and done. What profit we make is kept in a separate account for repairs and turnover maintenance.

**If this was your property, what would you do?** If the interest rate was lower, I'd definitely hold it, but it's the 5% gives me pause. We don't have any immediate need for the money, and any profit would just go sit in a Vanguard account.

investing,"Long commodities, short bonds. Protection against inflation, and the house of cards that is the US bond market.","Hey everyone,

So basically I think there is a good probability that we are at the edge of an economic disaster. I have been talking about the bond market, and looking into what is going on there and it is clear that the FED has their hands tied on this and our only path forwards are 1) hyperinflation or 2) failure in the bond market due to rising interest rates.

In 2019, the world economy was running hot AF. In just the span of time from 2018-2019 the us median income rose 2%, poverty dropped 2%, and it all seemed very good.

The FED saw that the economy was getting hot, and that their quantitative easing (QE) policy might be becoming less effective. They have some bank tools that are used to combat inflation and interest rates. These tools are IOER, SLR%, and YCC.

IOER: Interest one excessive reserves. This is perhaps the most important tool because feds can manually change the interest rate on the M1 money stock. This is important because from this first money stock, every-time one passes hands there is an interest rate associated with it. So Interest rate on IOER affects the M1 money stock, M2 money stock, all banks, and almost all of the credit that we try to get, it also affects SLR%.

SLR%: Supplementary leverage ratio %. This is basically how much loan loss reserves a banks and companies need to always keep on hand in order to meet the needs of their members. For example, the US fed can put a cap at 10% SLR% and that means that the bank can leverage 90% of its money out, while only keeping 10% on hand. This is influenced by IOER and this SLR% is the main reason we cannot raise interest rates using IOER.

In 2019 we tried raising IOER, which increased SLR. When we did that we moved the underbelly of a beast so massive we had no idea how big it could be. When we raised IOER many banks and companies have taken out so much debt that they literally COULD NOT STAY LIQUID with increases in interest rates.

[https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w](https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w)

Not only did this raise in interest rates lead to a huge liquidity disaster, it also led to liquidity disasters IN OTHER COUNTRIES. That is really really really worrisome. We raise interest in the IOER and all the suddenly Turkey also is having a major fucking liquidity issue. I don't know each country but I do know that our 2019 actions were affecting Turkey and other countries.

So what did we do in response the the 2019 liquidity disasters? WE LOWERED INTEREST RATES AND PRINTED MORE MONEY. WE KEPT THE ZOMBIE GOING.

then the pandemic hit...

The pandemic hit and the FED already knew we were at a knives edge with the bond market. So their plan, although they say it was to help us, was to pump up the zombie economy with a huge monumental stimulus. Then we got two more after.

I wanted this stimulus, we all wanted this stimulus, but by pumping the stimulus in the economy and pumping up these institutions that can't stay liquid if they had high interest rates has kind of put off the inevitable. A huge falling out of people who have too much debt.

So here we are in 2021. Government debt has not improved (it has got worse), credit ratings on many zombie companies that aren't turning a profit are going to get worse and worse credit ratings = high standards of SLR% to stay liquid. This is going to make it even MORE difficult for these companies to deal with high interest rates.

**WHAT DOES THIS FIRST PART MEAN?**

We have tools to deal with inflation, the most important being raised interest rates using (IOER) which influences SLR% and capital requirements of institutions. However, we have so much debt, and so much of this debt belongs to companies that don't turn a significant profit. So we can't raise interest rates if we don't want a flat out crash in the bond market and wave of bankruptcies of major corporations and possibly financial institutions.

so if controlling for inflation by raising IOER would lead to a liquidity crisis in the bond market, how do we control for and prevent hyper inflation?

People have been talking about Yield Curve Control (YCC) as it is a tool to control for inflation. However it is not. YCC works by the FED going into the economy and buying up as many 10y and 30yr bonds as they can (this puts more money in economy), then selling a bunch of their short term expiring bonds. This buying on the long end and selling on the short end would help keep interest rates low for companies to stay liquid, BUT LOW INTEREST RATES LEADS US TO MORE INFLATION, so this plan will not work for very long.

**THE FED IS BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE**

**increase IOER to control inflation** = major liquidity issue and a fallout of our bond market

**do YCC to avoid fall out of bond market** = more inflation!

**print more money** i**nject it into the economy** = buy more time but put off inevitable.

I have been thinking about this and I don't see that they have a way out. I have read into it and also heard people talk about this long before I got here. Below I leave some links so you can hear about this from someone else besides me.

**Commodities**

I don't want to talk about the inflation we are seeing in commodities because we have talked about steel a shit ton here and all of us know that inflationary signs are all over the economy. CPI will literally be the last indicator that inflation is here SO PLEASE INGORE THE FED WHEN THEY SAY CPI IS LOW.

We see inflationary pressure all over the market. Especially in commodities, producer prices, import costs, housing prices, etc. The FED is only saving face with CPI cause they know controlling inflation means crashing the bond market.

**My Plan**

**Exposed myself to commodities**: I have invested in a handful of commodity tickers $RFP $MT $CLF $LPX $CTT $PCH $SXC, $ADM because even if we have the catalysts of a crazy economic recovery we also have inflation. So no matter what these stocks do, they HAVE to go up. I think in 2021 any commodity stock that can produce cash is a good one to have.

**Expose myself to raising interest rates**: To ensure that I do not end up being a bag holder for the irresponsible lending and money printing that our government has engaged in for the last decade i am buying puts against the bond market. I have bought puts against $TLT $VGSH $HYG $VMBS $VGIT. I will keep buying them too.

**interest rates stay low = more inflation = commodity stocks go up**

**raise interest to control inflation = bond yields go up, prices of bonds go down. potential fallout of companies and institutions that can't meet SLR%**

I took out positions on Monday and its like i touched a beast that just woke up. It should not be possible to be up $1500 in one day. the VGSH puts for october that I got for 10 dollars are now worth like 300.

[https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc](https://ibb.co/DCJR0Vc) 

TLDR; If you want to protect yourself from inflation, buy commodities. If you want to protect yourself from the fucking house of cards that is the bond market, buy puts on bond ETF's against the bond market. This strategy might be VERY successful this year. Most of the puts i am buying are for the late fall or early next year.

If this country could handle higher interest rates I think we would be okay. But the 2019 disaster did not spur confidence that we we were in a position then, and now the house of cards has only expanded and our money printing has led to enormous amounts of speculation that this world has never seen. Cryptos, SPACs, NFT's, High valuations, Cathie Wood, Chamath, etc. etc. To make this wore we are already starting to see inflation pressures hit producers and commodities. EU and AU are doing MORE MONEY PRINTING and QE. Money hasn't even started moving through the economy too. We have not even opened up.

I sincerely wish I could believe this administration that we are in for a great economic recovery. They are completely ignoring the huge fucking problem right under their nose.

personalfinance,Mortgage rate lock question - what am I missing,"Mortgage rates have been rising every week. The lender we are using charges a .125% difference in rate depending how long the lock is. So for example, 15 days or less lock is 3%, 30 day lock is 3.125%, and a 45 day lock is 3.3%. As we understand it, if we exceed the lock, the fee is .125% of the loan value. That basically comes out to $500/week.

However, a .125% interest rate bump equals about $25/mo, or ~$10,000 over a 30 year mortgage.  So wouldn't it be cheapest to do a 15 day lock even though we know we need more like 30-45 days and pay the extra $500 per week?  Seems to come out to ~$2,000, instead of $10,000.

What am I missing?  Thanks.

personalfinance,What should I do with my savings,"Hi Personal Finance,

I'm feeling kind of silly at this point that I have this money and just have no idea what to do with it to make it work better for me. 

Some information, I'm self-employed, making enough to cover my bills and such. 

I max out my IRA yearly. Since I'm self-employed, I don't have a 401k.

I was in a car accident last year and my settlement for permanent injury (Traumatic brain injury) and car payout was $50k, which is now just sitting in my savings account. 

I've considered moving it into a money market or high yield, but up until the pandemic, I was getting 2% back on my savings account with Simple. Now that it's been absorbed by BBVA and post-pandemic, the interest rate has gone down considerably.

I don't have any loans, just a $1250 payment for my portion of my mortgage/household expenses  (the other half paid by my spouse.) Which is covered by what I earn. Ideally, I'd move 35-40 of this money into a safer investment so that it could grow better than 0.3%.  I'd save the 10-15K as a safety net. 

I honestly normally consider myself ""good with money"" but that's because I'm essentially Smaug and just hoard it under my mattress. I don't know how to make it work better for me.

(Also, if anyone has a bank they recommend instead of Simple/BBVA, I'm all ears! I'm not liking a lot of BBVA's policies.)  


Feel free to ask any questions if I missed anything.",finance

I'm 26 y/o and partway through my first year in a biotechnology Ph.D. program. I have $10K ready to invest, a savings account for emergencies, and no debt. I'm not married, and I don't know where I will be living in \~5 years when I finish my Ph.D.. I want to stay as adaptable as possible.

I want to do two things at the same time:

1. Save for retirement in \~2060
2. Save money to keep available towards a big purchase in 5-10+ years. This could be buying property or starting my own small company, etc. I also want to keep the door open to planning a  F.I.R.E. strategy, and say, using it to buy a rental property. Maybe travel the world for a few months. The purpose of this money depends on how my life is going after grad school.

My plan is to start BOTH a Roth IRA and a brokerage account at the same time. My plan is to divide my current savings as such, and to contribute future savings in similar proportions for the next 10 years:

\&gt;&gt;&gt; 60% in Roth IRA:

\- 50% stock market index funds

\- 10% individual biotech stocks (\*see below)

\&gt;&gt;&gt; 38% in brokerage account:

\- 33% stock market index funds

\- 5% bonds index funds 

\&gt;&gt;&gt;  2% in cryptocurrencies

&amp;#x200B;

\*I want to try setting aside 5-10% of my savings ($500-$1000 to start) for investing in individual biotech stocks. My hypothesis is that due to my educational/professional background in genetic engineering/CRISPR/protein engineering, I am in an unusual position to make smart biotech growth stock choices. I've been reading books (Lynch, Malkiel, etc) to prepare. I want to try this for 5 years during grad school, and then compare my returns to my index funds and see if I correctly assess my ability.

personalfinance,Do you ever feel ready when you're buying your first house?,"I've budgeted the hell out of my first home purchase with my SO. I've written everything down, dotted my i's, crossed my t's, and I still don't have a damn clue whether I'm making the right decision. I'm all out of time since we close on Monday. I absolutely hate the idea of needing to take a leap of faith, but it feels like that's where I'm heading. I mean necessary repairs are **already** popping up and we haven't even closed yet.

**The details for those interested:**

We found a house in the area that we loved that was kind of rough-around-the-edges. It was an REO property. It doesn't have a shed, the deck was torn out, it desperately needs to be cleaned, but we love the area and a lot of the house is exactly what we want (e.g., new kitchen, nice den, master suite, etc.). We overextended a bit on size (2300 sq. feet, 4 bed, 3.5 bath), but we are planning to have children and work from home so we'll need the extra rooms. It's actually in pretty good shape, all things considered, but there's still a lot to do.

*Income*

I make $110K per year (not including 5 - 10% target bonuses, which I didn't include for the purpose of budgeting). She makes \~$70K per year (she is up for a sizeable raise and promotion but we didn't assume that in the budget either). The house is $561K @ 2.90% interest rate. The homeowner's insurance is quite cheap in the area at $95/month for standard coverage. Property taxes are  $12,500 / year. These were recently increased based on a new permit, so they're unlikely to increase this year. It's a high CoL area.

*Savings*

We have $215K cash-on-hand, and both have well-established retirement accounts (including a DB plan). Closing costs are still TBD, but we're told to expect them to be $17.5K - $20K. The house appraised for well over the purchase price @ $580K at two lenders (i.e., two different appraisers). I'm not at all convinced that the ""housing bubble"" will burst any time soon in this area. It's an **extremely** hectic market because of people fleeing the city.

*Other Debt*

We both pay $250/month for our cars, with mine almost being done. She has $120/month in student loans, which is also almost done. We have no other debt.

*Repairs/Inspection*

There are some fairly significant repairs needed per inspection. I'm DIYing everything I feasibly can, but I need to be realistic about what I'm capable of:

1. New gutters (we anticipate this to be $3K - $4K).
2. New shed (we anticipate this to be $3K - $3.5K)
3. New Deck (we anticipate this to be $15K - $20K, but don't plan on doing this until much later)
4. Siding patch work (we anticipate this to be $500 - $1,000 and needs to be done immediately \[DIY\])
5. Hard wood 250 sq ft. room (previous owner let the dog use the den for... whatever it wanted. So it's disgusting. This needs to be done immediately. Figuring $3K for this)
6. Sand/stain hard wood 750 sq ft space: (This is our only aesthetic repair. The older hardwood needs some TLC, and we have a friend who does floors. Figuring $2.5K)
7. Central Air: This may need to be replaced. We couldn't kick it on because of the temperature, but it's from 2009 and not in terrific shape. Figuring $6K-$7K if we do need to replace it. Very much hoping we don't for a year or two.
8. Sheetrock: The sheetrock is a little beat up in various places. It's mostly corner bead and spackle work, which I can do myself ($500).
9. Molding: The moldings should probably be replaced everywhere ($2K DIY)
10. Main bathroom: We want one nice bathroom for having people over. The rest are extremely outdated, but we'll leave them for now. (Figuring $5K)
11. Plumbing stuff: There's a few things that needs a plumber (gas pipe for stove is too long, radiator isn't working in one spot, etc.) We figure $2K-$3K.

*Furniture:*

We need to fill the master bedroom, the dining room, a small eat-in kitchen, a den, and a formal living room. We're getting some help from family on this. Figuring $30K-$40K to get everything, but not anticipating this taking less than 2 years.",finance
personalfinance,Non-taxable income messing with my tax return?,"I held 3 jobs in 2020. I started inputting my W-2s on TurboTax and my return was calculating to about 600 when I put in my first two ( Walmart and a staffing agency). Then I put in my Peace Corps W-2, which do not qualify for federal tax withholding, and suddenly I’m owing. The TurboTax explanations basically said my total income is A(walmart + agency + Peace Corps), taxes you paid is X and tax liability is Y, so Y-X = what you owe.

solar,Panel choice help,"So, I've decided on an installer, but I'm having trouble deciding between two panel options: 12 [LG NeON 2 LG360N1C-N5](https://www.energysage.com/solar-panels/lg-solar/2313/lg360n1c-n5/) (4.32 kW total) @ $2.55/W = $11,016 or 12 [Q CELLS Q.PEAK DUO BLK ML-G9+ 380] (https://www.energysage.com/solar-panels/q-cells/2397/DUO_BLK_ML-G9Plus_380/) (4.56 kW total) @ $2.50/W = $11,400.

Both panels have 25 year material and performance warranties. Q Cells only had 12 year material warranties up until recently. Not sure if that indicates anything about the quality of their current panels. LG seems to have a better reputation for panel quality and warranty claims. 

End-of-warranty output is LG 90.1% vs Q Cells 86.0%

Temperature coefficient is LG PMax: -0.34 / Voc: -0.26 vs Q Cells PMax: -0.35 / Voc: -0.27. Those ratings look virtually identical, but I'm not familiar enough to say if they're functionally equivalent.

The backsheet is LG white vs Q Cells black. The panel location will not be generally visible, so the esthetics don't really make a difference to me. Will the Q Cells run hotter because of this? Will that affect performance?

As far as I've calculated, the production of the 4.32 kW LG array would offset right around 100% of our bills from the last year (factoring in NEM rules and TOU rates). The Q Cells array would produce around 400 kWh more, but we only get wholesale rates (~3c/hWh, I think vs 30c+/kWh retail) back for excess total production at yearly true-up (SDG&amp;E). Also, I think our usage will actually go down a bit over the next couple of years due to not working from home as much after the pandemic is over. Thus, the larger system wouldn't really result in our saving more money, but would be a bit more future-proofed in case we start using more energy for an EV or some other reason. Note that we would have to upgrade our electrical panel to add any more panels in the future. Also, if we were to add more than 1 kW, we would get bumped into new NEM rules (if any). 

Q Cells' parent(?) company Hanwha apparently does some munitions manufacturing, which doesn't make me feel warm and fuzzy.

Any other points of comparison? 

After writing this out, I'm leaning toward LG, mostly because we wouldn't really save anything more from the slightly larger and slightly more expensive system unless our needs change and LG has a better reputation. However, I'm having trouble leaving the extra production on the table; perhaps that just being greedy.

In November 2020 I moved out of my dads house who I was living with from August 2019-November 2020. Before then, I was living with my mom. In August 2019 she kicked me out and I had no choice but to live with my dad. 

While living with my dad I worked two jobs (Internship and restaurant). I paid for all my expenses such as food, transportation, and college expenses. I am a full time community college student. 

Last week I filed my own taxes (2020) for the first time  and marked that I was independent and couldn’t be claimed as a dependent. Yet, just like many other young people, I am trying to see if I qualify for a stimulus check this time around. 

As a renter, I received a rebate from my landlord, and I received scholarships and paid for books for my classes. My tax return in the coming weeks will be a little over 2k- federal and state combined. 

The issue is, my parents won’t tell me who is claiming me as a dependent. I am seeking advice to go through the best route of receiving money I believe I deserve as i’ve been more than half financially responsible for myself since the end of 2019. 

My relationship with my mom has been NC. Neither of my parents have supported me with my Fafsa (it’s unfiled due to them being unwilling to provide their tax info) causing me to choose CC over receiving additional scholarships from 10+ schools I was accepted to. Although through my moms taxes I would qualify for A LOT of financial aid. 

My mom says my dad claimed me, while he says the opposite. (they’re divorced and hardly amicable) Is there anyway I can see on the IRS who claims me? I want to know who is receiving the $1400 from claiming me. 

I tried to set up an Online Service Account but couldn’t, and when I checked the stimulus update it says I don’t qualify for one. I know I am under the age of 19, and a full time student, but is there any loophole that I can claim independence and not be a dependent?",finance

I know this has cost us, but I can't change the past.  

We currently have about $65k in revolving credit, about half of which is on higher interest rate cards.  We pay over $1k / month in interest alone.  We have no car payments or mortgage.  We don't live frugally and I know there's a lot of fat to trim in our budget if we gave a damn.  We've used YNAB in the past and were successful in paying down some debt and saving for goals, but never stuck with it long enough to become debt free.

Now that I'm switching jobs, I have an opportunity to do an early withdrawal from my 401k to pay off all debt.  I know that has near-term and long-term consequences, but I'm tempted to withdraw the $100k (~18% of total balance) to pay off the $65k in debt.

personalfinance,Refinance VA loan vs Conventional loan?,"Heya guys, first time posting here and I need y’all inputs. I currently have a VA loan and plan to move within the next 3-5 years out of our starter home.  We are in San Jose, CA and would probably move within the Bay Area.  With interest rates looking still pretty decent right now, should I:

A: refinance using the VA’s Interest Rate Reduction Loan (IRRL), meaning a guaranteed at least .5% interest rate reduction, no income verification, no appraisal, etc. Im currently at 2.75%, so at a .5% rate reduction, I’m looking at about $200/month saving.

B: refinance into a conventional loan, I would be ok with getting the current interest rate and everything stays the same. However, with the conventional loan, I’ll probably have to pay for appraisal, closing costs, and fees. So I’d probably end up with a higher loan amount.

My thought process is if I’m going with  plan B, then it would free up my VA loan, so when it comes time to move, I could use the VA loan for the new home and possibly keep the current house as a rental. 

I’d appreciate your input and pointers as I’m sure there are benefits in both plans I’m missing/not seeing. Thanks y’all!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Realistic outcome discussion of where crypto is going...,"I’ll start off with saying these are just limited views I have and if some disagrees, obviously feel free to comment. I’d like this to be a round table discussion of sorts. I don’t claim to be an expert by any means.

Idk even know how to start this.. crypto market is absolutely BOOMING this year. Whether it’s a bubble, I’m not sure.. I don’t think anyone can or should be allowed to claim whether it is or not. To me, the only thing that I know for sure are there’s a market for it.

But let’s talk about some realities that I don’t see discussed enough.. particularly, federal governments and regulations.

If someone wants to provide the numbers on this feel free, but whatever amount of US household income is going into crypto has to be seen by the federal government as lost opportunity. The amount of taxes they could be accumulating on transactions, etc. has to be absurd. Recently Fed Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the US is interested in dipping their toes into the crypto world, especially since they’d benefit from first movers advantage..- how soon? Who knows.. but I don’t take him publicly stating the feds interest lightly.

Does this mean an eventual US stable coin to compete for the crypto marketplace?

Realistically, idk what this means. Does it take away from other cryptos? Does this new US crypto coin have tax implications? Wont it have to implement blockchain? 

I understand their motivation. As far as I know, they’d be the first country to federally legitimize their own cryptocurrency, and as the worlds reserve currency, surely their coin would be valuable - but would it compete w/ and potentially overtake the likes of Bitcoin, Etherium, etc.? Will these cryptos have to consolidate their efforts to stay competitive as more country’s follow the US’ lead in creating their own coins? Will these country’s coins be decentralized?

These are the questions that have been puzzling me lately. I don’t the recent news of the selling prices of some NFT’s is helping either. Those are large transactions that are essentially benefiting from the foundation and utility of US tech companies.",cryptocurrency

Are banks planning on the fed extending the SLR rule so they can expand their balance sheet to accommodate these deposits?

Yes, likely. What does this mean? Banks will be able to hold more assets on their balance sheets. This is bullish for bonds.",finance
stocks,The Next Tech Software Play: Acquisition-Driven Vertical Market Software?,"Is the next Tech software play in acquisition-driven vertical market software?

[Constellation Software may cut dividend, plans to pursue bigger deals](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canadian-software-star-may-cut-dividend-as-it-pursues-big-deals-1.1563950)

Constellation Software (CSU) is a much younger version of Roper Technologies (ROP).  Think Berkshire Hathaway plus technology.  Also, the scope of the software offerings is broader for the former than for the latter.

This little-known Canadian play in vertical market software returned at least 3600% between mid-2010 and mid-2020.  More importantly, the stock went up *even as interest rates went up in 2016*, because all acquisition targets were already profitable and cash-flow-generating businesses, and were also bought at a discount.  In other words, all acquisitions were a corporate exercise in value investing.

In turn, this company has a little brother of its own, Canadian-based Enghouse Systems (ENGH), and has also spun out European-focused Topicus (TOI).

The earlier question isn't about any of the aforementioned companies specifically.

Is there potential for one or more ""next Constellation Softwares"" that are in the business of acquisitions for building vertical market software empires as lucrative as the above, especially as we come closer to 2023-2024 and beyond?

[Such plays could ""stonk"" even while the rest of the tech bubble pops, so long as their acquisitions are corporate exercises in value investing.]",finance

dogecoin,Future of Dogecoin and Inflation,"I realized that a lot of people just want a pump &amp; dump Dogecoin, but it makes no sense to dump Doge.

I dont looking foward to sell my doge i really think that doge will be fututre cc. It has really some advantages over btch so doge will stay an be stabile over 1 dollar iam pretty sure, maybe its only me but i realy think doge is more than a pump and dump and the reason iam buyng doge is the coming inflation it makes no sense to have fiat money more then you need just watch the balance sheed of the FED and you will understand. and if you want to have fiat better have it cash than on your acount. Iam from Europe an we had this cenario in cyprus you were only allowed to take 60 dollar per day from your acount and everybody who had over 100k usd on their bankacount lost it all ([https://www.brandeins.de/magazine/brand-eins-wirtschaftsmagazin/2014/vertrauen/wir-wurden-bestohlen](https://www.brandeins.de/magazine/brand-eins-wirtschaftsmagazin/2014/vertrauen/wir-wurden-bestohlen)) so why do you want to hort fiat money ? the next thing is if you can buy things with doge what allready is happening what is the need for dollar except to convert them in to doge ? tell me!

Only thing i have to add is that even if the dollar has mouch more debt than the Eurozone it will survive longer cause the most debt on the world is in usd and the usd is more used than the Euro to be precise give or take 3 times of the Euro, that means that the Fed can print three times the amount that the EZB does but in the end the dollar will also colapse.

Forex,Weekly trade Idea on USD/CHF,"Weekly trade Idea on USD/CHF

### Week: 15-19.03.2021

## Key event: USD. Interest Rate Decision

A rate hike tends to boost the local currency, as it is understood as a sign of a healthy inflation. A rate cut, on the other hand, is seen as a sign of economic and inflationary woes and, therefore, tends to weaken the local currency. If rates remain unchanged, attention turns to the tone of the FOMC statement, and whether the tone is hawkish, or dovish over future developments of inflation.\*\*

**We expect a similar reading to the previous month.**

## Until release day, we expect a continuation of the actual trend. A surprising data value could reverse the actual trend direction.

## Key Levels:

* Resistance 0.9460\*\*
* Support 0.9200, 0.9090, 0.9020\*\*

## Trend USD/CHF:

**Bullish**

**Price has surged and forming HH and HL, which could be the start of a new uptrend. It has formed new demand levels visible on lower Time Frames.**

## Call to Action/Trade Idea

**We will look to buy near supports and demand zones, with targets on resistance 0.9460.**

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 03.14.2021,"Hey Everyone,

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. 

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
2. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?
3. There’s a new Crypto Time Traveler and this one loves Cardano. [https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2](https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying "" Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

17. Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark.

19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh.

20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?

27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

EDIT: I GOT THE ANSWER!! So, I was looking at it like a “deposit money in the bank” situation, where you are quoted a nominal interest rate.

# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
*****
&gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
*****
&gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
&gt; “The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. “I think the message is going to be consistent.”
*****
&gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
*****
&gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
*****
&gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
*****
&gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% — its highest level in more than a year.
*****
&gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
*****
&gt; “The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year — deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,” said Peters of PGIM.
*****
&gt; “It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,” he said. “So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there’s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.”
*****
&gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
*****
&gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals
&gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
*****
&gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
*****
&gt; “When rates are very low, valuations don’t matter to people,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; “If rates are low, there’s no penalty,” he said. “If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that’s what we’ve seen here.”
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he’s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.
*****
&gt; “The names that I’m in — Visa, GM, Ford, Macy’s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,” he said. “It’s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.”
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.
*****
&gt; “Rate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,” Redler said. “Last week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‘Was that it?’”
*****
&gt; “Next Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,” he said. “Rates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday’s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.”
*****
&gt; Apple’s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market’s gains last year.
*****
&gt; “Watch Apple because it’s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,” Redler said.
*****
&gt; # Bond volatility
&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including February’s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.
*****
&gt; The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank’s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.
*****
&gt; The program expires March 31.
*****
&gt; “This is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,” Peters of PGIM said.
*****
&gt; “The markets are kind of divided on what’s going to happen,” he said. “I think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.”
*****
&gt; Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.
*****
&gt; “I think you’re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,” he said. “I think you’re going to see these whippy moves.”

&gt; # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13

&gt; Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader’s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.

&gt; March’s option expiration week performance is second only to December’s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ’s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March’s quarterly options expiration.

&gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?

&gt; Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.

&gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While we don’t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. “We remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.”

&gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.

&gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March

&gt; We’ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market’s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior – and likely to do so for some time to come.

&gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.

&gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today’s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week’s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.

&gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.

&gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.

&gt; # Versatile Outperformers

&gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**

&gt; Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.

“It’s important to teach problem solving, or teach to the problem and not the tools. Let’s say you’re trying to teach people about how engines work. A more traditional approach would be saying, ‘we’re going to teach all about screwdrivers and wrenches.’ This is a very difficult way to do it.

How are we going to take it apart? You need a screwdriver. That’s what the screwdriver is for. And then a very important thing happens: The relevance of the tools becomes apparent.”

— Elon Musk

I believe math to be the most basic universal truth. When I am told “You have an A so those 20 points won’t change anything” by my professor, but I understand those same 20 points to be the difference between A) proving elon’s theory that the education system is failing, or B) a perfect score from my first semester entering into a system that claims “I am here to ensure your success” then you can understand my cognitive dissonance.

Basically receiving a degree in psychology offers me merits and I am an addict seeking therapy. My life goals include exposing systems of corruption and incompetence, especially systems that have gained some controversy as being patriarchal and/or oppress feminine (creative) energy. Exposing the Federal Reserve and central banking system is what I have been doing that last 10 years and receiving a college degree was never a goal of mine until I learned the value of a token economy. I am also not afraid to use my voice in this setting as I stand to gain nothing for my reputation by being here, in fact as a self-taught hacker the school system is the last place I should be to keep my “cool”. 

So, again, in the words of my pal elon:

personalfinance,Claiming Child Tax Credit for 2018 while living abroad,"Hello!

I have quite a situation that I'm trying to understand.

I was living in a US tax treaty foreign country from 2011 to 2019.  I never filed Federal Income taxes while I was living abroad due to not even knowing it was required.  I never made over 50K/year; my bank account never exceeded 10K and from what I read, I probably won't owe any taxes.

My wife is a foreigner and we have been married since 2011.  We have been filing our returns in the country that we have been living in.  I have my tax documents all the way back until 2015, but they are in a foreign language.

I've been in the US since 2019 and have filed a return for 2019 and 2020 tax years.

My two children were born in 2016.  They are US Citizens, but I've only filed and received their SSN this year. 

I have only claimed them as dependents for the 2020 tax year since I provided half of their support for that year as well as them (and my wife) living with me for a few months in 2020.  Currently we are all living together and have been since the end of 2020.

Is it possible to file a 2018 return and claim them as dependents (which they legitimately were) and receive the Child Tax Credit for 2018 and expect an actual refund?

If I were to try and file all the way back to 2015, would I use a 1040 or 1040-X?  Also I understand that I may need to claim the FTC credit and need to file the associated documents as well.

I haven't received any notification from the IRS about any failure to file.  I'm just trying to avoid paying any penalties, hoping I don't owe anything and hoping that I can actually get some sort of refund, since I'm a little short on cash.

Any advice is welcome.

personalfinance,Paying off one of my student loans dropped my credit score. How do I fix/increase my credit?,"I have two student loans (both federal) from undergrad and graduate school. I recently paid off my undergrad loan and according to Credit Karma, it dropped my credit score by 15 points from 764 to 749. 

My undergrad loan represented my oldest credit account (a little over 8 years old) and my next oldest account is only around 4 years. I’ve never missed a payment on any of my accounts and my credit card utilization is very low, so I’m assuming this drop came from the decrease in my average age of credit history. 

I wouldn’t really be concerned except for the fact that my fiancé and I plan on buying a house in the next 12-18 months and I obviously want my credit to be as high as possible. Will my credit score increase on its own if I just keep making payments and keeping utilization low? If not, is there anything I can do to help my credit increase faster?",finance

personalfinance,Can I open a solo 401k if I received 1099-NEC from one job and W-2 from another?,"I currently live in NYC. For tax year 2020 I receive $66,900 as gross pay on W-2 from an independent pharmacy where I work as an employee. I get paid there biweekly. Also I received biweekly direct deposits for a total of $11,505 on a 1099-NEC from a Chain pharmacy where I work per diem. The form had no federal or state tax withheld. I got a total of $307 as other income on 1099-MISC from opening bonus brokerage accounts (e.g. Firstrade Securities Inc., etc.). No federal income tax was withheld.

Am I eligible to open a self-employed 401k? Is 25% of compensation considered 1099-misc and 1099-NEC together, but not W-2? Or the 1099-misc does not count too?

For 2020, could I have tax-deferred $11,505 if I opened a solo 401k? The $307 as well? Next year if I make \~$50,000 on 1099-NEC, can I defer $19,500 + $12,500 &amp; place $6,000 in a Roth account?

In my case, would my business be considered unincorporated or incorporated?

For 2020, if I had the option to open a SEP IRA, does that mean income limits apply to traditional IRA contributions or no since I did not open an account?

If in a certain year I do not receive a 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC due to no longer working at the Chain pharmacy, would I have no income limits to contribute to a traditional IRA?

Finally, if I want to re-characterize my 2021 traditional IRA contribution as Roth IRA, would the original $6,000 plus the earned dividends and/or growth of the stocks/index be transferred/re-characterized?

If I cannot open a self-employed (solo) 401k, can I open a SEP IRA?

Just wondering if anyone got into $seel on Friday when it was flying? I did because I could see it was obviously about to run up off of rumored news but after buying 10 options and 200 shares, I went and looked at the numbers and saw it was actually squeezing as they had zero short shares available to lend at a 53% interest rate. Also 68 million shares shorted on Friday alone. I believe after the close it went to 550,000 short shares available to lend so they had started to cover. Disclosure: I did capture the gains at the high point but left some in just in case Monday runs more or for possible long term . 

Just curious is anyone else is in on this play and any opinions about its movement? I like the stock long term for its potential but am trying exactly how to play it through a volatile term. I have Trauma from all the pump and dumps lately. 🤦🏻‍♀️",finance

defi,"Credit Delegation and Un-collateralized Loans, the next big breakthrough in DeFi?","In the current DeFi scene, most protocols require you to over-collateralize any loans you take out. To put it simply, to take out a loan, you must lock up more in assets than the amount you want to borrow.This is typically a good idea when loaning out money to strangers on the internet, but for most people who need a loan, it usually isn’t the case that they have several thousands worth of crypto assets. When Aave rolled out version 2 of its protocol, it introduced uncollateralized loans through trusted credit delegation. This allows users who are lending their crypto through Aave but are not using their line of credit to set up credit delegation vaults and delegate their credit to a third party.

 &amp;nbsp;

How this looks in practice is someone, lets say Alex, deposits crypto into Aave and receives aTokens in return. They then take those aTokens to set up the Credit Delegation Vault with the details such as the borrowing limit and interest rate. Then, Alex enters into an agreement with Bob, who wants to borrow. They write their contract up via OpenLaw, a platform that allows the tying of legal agreements with executable Ethereum code, and Bob’s address is whitelisted by Alex. Bob can then borrow crypto from the vault up to the predetermined limit without having to post any collateral at all.

 &amp;nbsp;

I think this is huge step in innovation in the decentralized finance sector as it opens crypto borrowing up to those who don’t have the crypto assets to post collateral and allows previously unused credit to be utilized. The lender is able to earn extra returns for taking on increased risk and more liquidity is added to the market.

 &amp;nbsp;

Has anyone had any experience with credit delegation yet? Do you all think this is logically the next step for other protocols like Compound? Has anyone heard of them working towards implementing it? Let's hear some thoughts.",cryptocurrency
bonds,How does bond ETFs gain value in long term?,"So I'm just building my long term portfolio (10+ years) and I was recommended to add some bonds ETFs into the portfolio for better diversification. I've read several articles about bonds and bonds ETFs and I think I can quite understand the basic logic of both. I understand the inverse relationship between price and yield, I understand why bonds (and bonds ETFs) prices go down when interest rates go up etc. But what I can't actually understand is how bonds ETFs gain value over time in long term. I mean when I am investing into stock ETFs (which is the majority of my long term portfolio) I'm doing it because I expect that I will receive dividends but also because I expect that companies I'm investing in will gain value over time. I expect that economy will rise over next let's say 20 years and that companies overall will be more valuable in long term meaning that their stock prices will rise and I will benefit from that. But when I invest into bond ETF I only receive the interests (that are actually reinvested in many bonds ETFs that are available for me to invest to right now) but I am not sure if I should also expect that the price of the bonds ETF itself will rise over time in long term? I understand that it can change in short term due to many factors like changes of interest rates etc. but if I assume that this will not change much in long term and I will add small portions of bond ETFs shares into my portfolio gradually over time so I will not benefit from any short time changes, is there any other benefit that I will receive from bond ETFs except for interest payments? Can I expect the price of bond ETFs to rise in long term? I realize that maybe it's stupid question but I really can't quite figure this out so thanks anyone willing to share their thoughts on this with me.",finance
personalfinance,"New home Mortgage, 2 different lenders before closing?","I have so many questions I don't know where to start. Back story is I am building a new home. The home is one that was in their inventory to be build. I have a close date that is 6 months away. I used my own credit union to secure lending and the builder knew this but pushed me hard to use their lender, so the sales manager for the builder threatened to cancel my contract if  I didn't use their lender. I know, I know, I should ditch the builder but I'm on a time schedule and I like the model they offer and really I am only having issues with the sale manager, everyone else has been great so far. 

&amp;#x200B;

I end up asking a friend that works for a large builder in the town over his thought and he suggested to just apply for the loan with my builder's preferred lender and if I don't like the terms notify them I will be using my lender to close as the home gets closer to closing time. I applied with their lender and they actually didn't come back with a horrible offer but I feel like there's something I'm missing. 

&amp;#x200B;

My credit union is offering the option of two loans to use, one is a ARM the other is fixed. Both offer a rate lock (currently locked at 2.75%) and the rate can be modified one time before close so if the rates go lower I can adjust to the lower rate within 15 days before closing. The adjustable rate is at 2.75% currently, it's a conventional loan with $3,000 credit towards closing pain by the credit union, no PMI is needed. My estimated cash to close is $19,130. The adjustable rate locked for 10 years, can adjust 2% a year capped at an additional 6% (8.75% total max). The 30 year fixed is just that, estimated cash to close is around $25,000.  PMI is required for this loan, drops off after 80% loan to home value has been met. 

&amp;#x200B;

My builders preferred lender offered a 30 year fixed @ 3.75%, bought points at the tune of $4700 to bring the interest rate down 3% and the builder offered almost $12,000 towards closing. This brings my estimated cash to close to around $19,000. This loan also requires PMI. This loan cannot be locked so it is subject to change before closing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: there is a water assessment coming through the community in the next 5-10 years for city water hookup. The cost is $24,000 and they appear to be charging 9% interest if you have it added to your taxes. This makes a full year of escrow payments pretty high but they level back off after year. Most people refi the cost of the water project into their mortgage when it comes along which I was considering and why I was also considering the ARM through my credit union. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:  Should I be considering the ARM or do you suggest the fixed rate for my situation? The property values where I am are skyrocketing right now so I'd assume I wouldn't be far off from having the PMI drop off a 30 year fixed. I am not sure how long I will live in this house but it will be for at least the next 10 years. Also if a fixed rate should I go through my credit union (rate lock, no surprises at closing) or should I go with my builder's lender? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any advice about going forward with both and choosing one over the other near closing time?  I feel like the builder's lender is the better way to go if I choose a 30 year fixed but I feel like there's something I'm not seeing.

CryptoCurrency,Opinions on crypto.com for a pseudo crypto newby?,"I have been following BTC and cryptocurrencies on a surface level since 2011, but I have never been in a financial situation or state of mind to really invest in anything till recently. I have started looking into crypto investing platform options and would like to hear some more opinions. I'll try to be as specific as I can so yall can give the best advice possible for a long term investor who really only understands the basics of the crypto space.

Crypto investing philosophy &amp; strategy:
IMO there are really only 3 crypto currencies worth investing in. BitCoin, Ethirium, and whatever your Ethirium hedge is. 

BTC has come a LONG way since I first heard of it as that thing criminals buy drugs with on the silk road. IMO it will never be the one and only currency, but it is absolutely here to stay in one form or another. Ethirium and ETH 2.0 sounds, to me, like frontrunner to be the global currency we all dream of. However, I know the limitations of my technical knowledge, so I'm the event I am wrong about ETH 2.0 I should hedge my bets with an alt coin trying to beat it to the punch. Currently I have caught the Cardano bug, so I plan to pick this as my ETH hedge. 

I plan to open an account with a platform that allows me to buy at least these 3 assets daily and build up my position over time. Since this is a long term strategy and I won't be using any money needed to survive staking my coins for great interest rates, even for long periods of time, is very desirable to me. I'm also not super worried about privacy or centralised exchanges. I will eventually keep a portion in a cold storage wallet, but the interest rate is more enticing atm.

My opinions on different exchanges:
Crypto.com:
With the research I have done this one has peaked my interest the most as the best ""all in one"" option. It offers all the coins I am looking to hold and the interest rates are, while not the highest, pretty good. I like that I can have one account to buy, stake, and trade my coins plus the idea of using it as a bank account to directly purchase things using the card is very appealing too. Not going to lie, it being a metal card is a big selling point too lol. 

However their marketing kinda worries me. When I first saw their adds on YouTube I honestly thought they were a scam, sorta seemed too good to be true. Any opinions on their validity or trustworthiness would help seal the deal for me.

Blockfi:
This suits most of my needs with no extra bells and whistles. I like their claims that 95% of their BTC is held In cold storage, so they (shouldn't) have any liquidity issues. I am not sure if crypto.com has made any similar claims. They also seem slower to adopt new coins, don't even offer ADA at the moment.

Coinbase:
They have been around forever, relatively speaking. Their IPO is interesting as well as it should offer a good amount of funding to expand services. Also I have heard good about coinbase pro's API for if I want to explore algotrading down the road.

Sorry for the long post, but hoping to hear more specific opinions on why you chose the crypto solution you did. Thanks in advance for any input.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Do you leave money on the table by selling an ETF then purchasing the mutual fund equivalent with the money?,"This is a very basic question but I can't seem to crunch the numbers correctly, perhaps I'm slow.

In about a month I'll have my extra $2k to invest, what if I keep buying VTI, then when the total value hits $3k, sell and roll the money into the minimum ($3k) investment for VTSAX?  

Am I giving up any potential gains?  I guess I'll have to pay the fees (expense ratio?) and short term capital gains when I sell the VTI to roll into VTSAX (I'm in the 22% federal bracket).

Or would it be better to let the funds sit in money market until I accumulate the necessary $3k then jump right into VTSAX (assuming the price stays the same/rises slowly over the next few weeks.)  Thanks!",finance

We started our refinance on October 7th, submitted every document they asked for, and had locked in a rate of 2.875% within a couple weeks. Then... nothing. I called, e-mailed, no response at all for a couple weeks until I called my loan originator's boss and then they were communicative for a short time.

personalfinance,How much time before student loan interest rates start going back up?,"As the title says, I'm wondering because I want to wait to improve my 686 credit score and I understand that now is a good time to refinance due to low-interest rates. My net worth is -49K, 82K salary, and \~110K in student loans (eeeek!). I think I should be able to get it above 700 in a few months. I explain how I think I can do that below but this is essentially my question: *how much time before student loan interest rates start going back up?* 

\-----

My credit score was almost 700 a few months ago but my credit card limits were reduced due to low credit card use; I'm using the cards more now. Based on my understanding, I need to increase the amount of available credit I have in order to get my credit score to go up; which sits at $26,800 with 12% usage (all other credit score metrics are in good standing). My plan is to decrease credit usage, ask for higher credit balances and avoid opening new accounts for now (4 hard inquiries ATM). 

So... I can use my stimy to pay down a $1,600 credit balance (on one card; no interest for 14 months) or invest it. And then (hopefully) ask for credit limit increases; some companies have said they are not doing this at the moment because of the pandemic, I would guess. For reference, my credit score is 686 as measured by Transunion and Equifax and 731 as measured by FICO Score 8.",finance
personalfinance,Tax Question on California State Adjustments to Itemized Deductions,"Hi there. I'm using TaxAct to file my 2020 return and am puzzled by one part of the questionnaire:  the  ""California - Adjustments to Itemized Deductions - Gifts to Charity "" page. 

For some reason, it auto populated a $300 in the ""addition"" field on top of the Federal entry. Should I remove this $300 or keep it?

For background/clarity:

1. So I gave $10K total to charity and relief programs last year. I listed this on my Federal and got $300 as part of the Standard Deduction. 
2. Now I'm doing my State Return and double checking if I need to do any adjustments. The ""California - Adjustments to Itemized Deductions - Gifts to Charity "" page lists the 10K as Federal, then autopopulated the ""addition"" field with $300.

Do I keep the $300 or delete this entry? Not really sure what this means.

Any help or advice is appreciated. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"I have about 20k saved up, and I'm not sure what to do with it.","For some background: I'm 25 years old, currently in a 4-year post-grad program, will be graduating school in about a year and a half.

Like the title says, I have about 20k saved up. During the school year, I work part time and barely break even with expenses. During the summer, I work full time and usually come out 7-9k in the green. I have a very modest lifestyle, my rent + utilities are around $500/month. No debt other than student loans. I have a reliable car, and I don't intend to make any big purchases any time soon (like a house, wedding, etc).

So I've noticed that my bank account doesn't fluxuate too much, and this money is just sitting there. It's great to have a bit of padding, god forbid I would have some sort of medical emergency, get in a car accident, etc etc. But I'm starting to think I could probably afford to do something with maybe 5-7k and still be okay financially. I have a couple options here.

1. Save it. 20k isn't that much money. Life is expensive. My projected earnings post-graduation is somewhere around 120k/year. An argument can be made that 20k NOW is worth much more to me than it will be when I have much higher earning power after I graduate, since it's a much larger percentage of my salary. Should I just leave it in my bank account and wait until post-graduation to make any big moves?

2. Max out my roth IRA for 2020. Yearly maximum is 6k/year, I've contributed 2k so far. Obviously great for my retirement fund, but I won't see that money for 40 years.

3. Contribute 5-7k toward my next semester of school. School is costing me about 15k/semester (which I borrow from the gov), and I'll be around 120k in debt by the time I graduate. I usually pay 1-3k out of pocket, but any extra money contributed will be money that is NOT accruing interest on my student loans. My interest rate for student loans is around 5%, so with some rough calculations, contributing 6k now will save me $300/year on interest.

So those are the options I'm considering.

Any and all advice is very much appreciated, thanks :)",finance

investing,"The evidence is in on negative interest rate policies, and it has largely worked","https://blogs.imf.org/2021/03/03/the-evidence-is-in-on-negative-interest-rate-policies/

https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Departmental-Papers-Policy-Papers/Issues/2021/03/01/Negative-Interest-Rates-Taking-Stock-of-the-Experience-So-Far-50115

Interest rates are low, and “lower for longer” has become something of a mantra among policy makers, regulators, and other market watchers. But negative interest rates raise an entirely new set of questions.

After eight years of experience with negative interest rate policies, the initial skepticism (paying interest to borrowers rather than savers was certainly unprecedented) has proven largely misplaced. The evidence so far suggests that negative interest policies have worked.

The evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns.

Since 2012, a number of central banks introduced negative interest rate policies. Central banks in Denmark, euro area, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland turned to such policies in response to persistently below-target inflation rates (most central banks set rates as part of their broader mandate to keep prices stable, thereby supporting jobs and economic growth). These banks were also responding to a very low “neutral real interest rate”—that is, the real interest rate at which monetary policy is neither contractionary nor expansionary. The move reflected the central banks’ struggle to boost inflation even when they had already pushed interest rates to zero.

The effects of the COVID-19 crisis, in an environment where many central banks are constrained, have brought back negative interest rate policies to the forefront.

Overall, these policies have eased financial conditions, and, in the process, likely supported growth and inflation. However, negative rate policies remain politically controversial, partly because they are often misunderstood.

Unfamiliar territory

At the time of introduction, many questioned whether negative interest rate policies would work as intended.

There were concerns about risks, given the untested, and in many ways counterintuitive, nature of the move. Would banks, households, and firms shift massively to cash in response to the new policies, thereby weakening the link between central bank rates and other interest rates? Would banks resist cutting lending rates, or even reduce lending to prevent profits from falling? Would negative interest rate policies provide a meaningful monetary stimulus?

Concerns about potential side effects of these novel policies also arose. Chief among the concerns were financial stability risks stemming from lowered bank profitability, and fear of disruptions in the functioning of financial markets and money market funds.

Based on the evidence to date, these fears have largely failed to materialize. Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies. For example, some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy. They also led to lower money-market rates, long-term yields, and bank rates.

Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits—because it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash. Bank lending volumes have generally increased. And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash, interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens.

So far, so good

Any adverse effects on bank profits and financial stability have so far been limited.

Overall, bank profits have not deteriorated, although banks that rely more on deposit funding—as well as smaller and more specialized banks—have suffered more. Larger banks have increased lending, introduced fees on deposit accounts, and benefited from capital gains. Of course, it is possible that the absence of a significant impact on bank profitability mostly reflects shorter-term effects, which could potentially be reversed over time. And side effects may still arise if policy rates go even more negative.

Money market funds in countries that have adopted negative interest rate policies have not collapsed. And, even if the existing “low-for-long” environment does create significant financial stability concerns (as it induces a search for yield or excessive risk taking by financial institutions), negative interest rate policies per se do not appear to have compounded the problem. For example, the increase in bank risk-taking does not appear to have been excessive.

Given this evidence, why haven’t more central banks jumped on board? The reasons are likely related to institutional and other country characteristics. Institutional and legal constraints may play a role, and some financial systems—because of their structure or interconnection with global financial markets—may be more prone to suffer adverse side effects from negative interest rate policies. For example, countries with many small banks that rely more on household deposits as a main source of funding may be more reluctant to adopt negative interest rates.

Even the adopting central banks have moved tentatively, typically with small interest rate cuts because of the risk that negative side effects become more apparent if the negative rate policy lasts for very long, or if rates go very negative.

In sum, the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns. Thus, central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further. And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit—even if they may be unlikely to use it.

Ultimately, given the low level of the neutral real interest rate, many central banks may be forced to consider negative interest rate policies sooner or later.",finance

personalfinance,"Trying to get a handle on finances in general - have some more specific, short term questions and some more generic, long-term questions about how to stay on track.","Hey everyone,

I'll preface this by saying I'm generally feeling analysis paralysis about finances and how to move forward. I've got some specific questions for my current situation, but would also love some help figuring out how to stay on track going forward.

Some financial information. I'm sort of just spilling this off the top of my head - let me know if anything else would be helpful. My wife and I make about 215k per year. She has some bonuses involved over the year, rough estimate being about 15k annually. She contributes to 401k with a decent company match. We're currently down to one federal student loan at about 23k. We've been putting aside a solid amount of money toward it each month, but are keeping it in savings rather than paying it as interest is still paused due to COVID. My company does not offer a 401k or matching. That's where the more short-term question comes in.

My old job offered 401k and matching. The job I started about 9 months ago does not offer either. We didn't want that to be a reason to stop saving for retirement, so each month we've been putting aside what my contribution + match were at my old job with the intention of eventually opening our own retirement account. That hasn't happened yet, so I've got a combination of funds in my old company's 401k plan and cash in savings. My contributions were Roth, my employers match obviously not.

The question here is - what next? Should I open an IRA? Roth or Traditional? If Roth, would I have to pay taxes on my old employer's contributions, and is there a way to determine what that would and whether it's worth it? Is there a tax advantage or disadvantage to doing this within the next month, before filing my 2020 tax return? If opening an IRA, is there a ""best"" way to open one as far as what institution to go with and how to go about it?

More long term - things have changed since the college days when my most pressing financial decisions were whether I should go out to eat or make food at home. We have a solid income, and don't have kids. We're on track to pay off our final loan and be debt free by the fall. I'd like to enjoy this time and do things like travel, but also make sure we're investing well and taking advantage of our discretionary income to save for retirement and eventually buying a home. That feels like a lot to juggle. At the point we're at, should we be looking at financial planners or financial advisors?",finance

# Understanding the eVTOL Space

(Note: Skip to next section if you feel reading this background info is a drag)

Before I even start discussing tickers and plays, I'd first like to shed some light on the groundbreaking Urban Air Mobility (UAM) space, where it's heading and who are the top players vying for the bigger piece of the pie. Understanding the potential investment opportunities without understanding this nascent space is a moo*o* point.

Electric VTOL (Vertical Take off &amp; Landing) air taxis are one of the great emerging technologies of our time, promising to unlock the skies as traffic-free, high-speed, 3D commuting routes. Much quieter and cheaper than helicopter travel, they'll also run on zero-local-emission electric power, and many models suggest they'll cost around the *same per mile as a ground-based ride share*.

Currently there are over 100 players around the globe (check [this article](https://newatlas.com/aircraft/evtol-air-taxi-flying-car-market-players/) to get an overview of some the key players in the eVTOL space) in various stages of designing, building and commercializing eVTOL airframes. As is the case with any disruptive industry, the development and production of eVTOLs is an insanely cash hungry undertaking. Currently, we've a handful of frontrunners around the world who have gone public (Chinese eVTOL $EH) *or* are ripe to go public soon. Here's a the link to a well rounded [DD comparing RTP-ACIC-EXPC-EH-Volo-Lilium](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/lwj8rs/a_world_of_evtols_a_comparison_of/) that I highly recommend checking out.

The United States is acutely aware that it ['missed the boat'](https://www.osinto.com/post/agility-prime-the-pentagon-s-evtol-power-play) on consumer drones, and it's an understandably sore point. But perhaps more importantly the geopolitical consequences of Chinese drone dominance appear to have reverberated around the corridors of the Pentagon for some time. One consequence of this situation is that the latest area of rapid aerospace innovation - eVTOL - has firmly captured the attention of US industry, investors and now the [Department of Defense.](https://dod.defense.gov/) Leaders of all stripes Stateside are determined that America will indeed be 'first' in this new and exciting area of aerospace innovation. The Air Force recently launched **Agility Prime**, a non-traditional program seeking to accelerate the commercial market for advanced air mobility vehicles (i.e., ""flying cars""). Check their [website](https://agilityprime.com/index.html?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=AgilityPrime#/) here and highly recommend reading this [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-flying-cars-could-take-off-soon-if-we-let-the-military-help/) by USAF's former Acquisition Executive, Will Roper who starts his argument by drawing inspiration from *the Jetsons.*

The outlook for UAM looks positive based on increasing congestion in cities. There are various estimates of the TAM (total addressable market) of UAM. In its presentation, Archer Aviation said that it expects a **TAM of $1.5 trillion for UAM**, which stretches to $3 trillion in the optimistic scenario.

Joby Aviation said that it sees the TAM for UAM at **$1 trillion globally and $500 billion in the U.S**. Joby Aviation cited the [2018 UAM Market Study from Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/bah-uam-executive-briefing-to-post.pdf) for its forecasts.

Now, What's stopping us from having eVTOL air taxis today, then? Here are some of the factors you should be considering while evaluating potential investment opportunities:

1. **Batteries!!** \- Battery manufacturers' roadmaps are currently focused on satiating EV manufacturers and developing battery packs with required energy density and specific power (i.e. ability to sustain Tesla's *ludicrous* mode for a few minutes v/s a few seconds) could take a few years. [Alakai Skai](https://www.skai.co/)'s (currently supported by a single private investor) decision however, to ditch lithium batteries for a liquid hydrogen powertrain completely eliminates the battery technology bottleneck that almost every other company is hoping will resolve itself by the time they launch commercial services
2. **Certification** \- These are entirely new categories of aircraft, and the process of certifying, testing and regulating them is going to be monstrously expensive and time consuming. Federal support and urgency to outcompete global players should help the cause.
3. **Safety** \- To coordinate their thrust, each of the electric motor and fan units will need reliable sensors to accurately measure pressure, temperature and other indicators. Each of the motors will induce vibrations in the wings, and their fans may not all spin with the same efficiencies as wear and tear set in. *It will be complicated to write software* to reliably control all that, [says Ella Atkins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/02/10/lilium-evtol-spac-air-taxi/?sh=33d80b54627c), an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. While Atkins says she doesn’t see anything that’s “absolutely a showstopper” with the design, she thinks the many years it took to solve the deadly control problems of the first tiltrotor aircraft, the U.S. military’s V-22 Osprey, offers a sobering parallel for Lilium and other EVTOL developers. *“You need a lot of money and time to be successful in aerospace, and the truth is, this industry is trying to go too fast,”* says Atkins. Next issue is use of ballistic parachutes. Ballistic parachutes can only save you above a certain altitude, maybe 120 feet or so. Below that, they don't have time to open up, which means that every time you take off or land in one of these machines, you're exposed to a window of time in which total system failure would drop you like a stone.
4. **Air Traffic Control** \- Down the track, there will also have to be a considerable leap forward in air traffic control if the skies are going to safely hold large numbers of these machines zipping about between a bunch of *skyports/ vertiports* dotted around an urban area.
5. **Public Perception** \- Public perception (trust and safety in tech) is a large obstacle. Safety is the greatest concern with “unruly” passengers, *“*[*lasing*](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers/laws/)*”* of pilots, and aircraft sabotage being main contributors. New importance of travel time, increase in telecommuting, urbanization and de-congestion scenarios could reduce the viability of UAM markets. Advancement in driverless car tech will likely make UAMs suitable for long-distance commute only.

All these problems are being worked on, and now we are ready to discuss 2 important SPAC plays that I have rounded up for investment in this space:

1. **Joby Aviation - $RTP** (eVTOL Manufacturer | Long term play)
2. **Blade - $EXPC** (eVTOL Asset Light Platform, aka 'Uber of skies'| Short-Mid term play)

# Outlook for EXPC and RTP

**Blade - EXPC**

[Investor's presentation](https://brs-apartments.flyblade.com/blade/production/uploaded-assets/1608040247.pdf)

* **Blade is an eVTOL index play**, often thought as the *""*[*Uber of skies*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-small-aviation-tech-company-will-turn-into-the-uber-of-the-skies-2021-01-11)*""* operates by connecting contract pilots with passengers to generate revenue via their proprietary platform.
* **Blade’s business model is proven and is profitable**; eVTOL is expected to improve unit economics and dramatically expand the addressable market of BLADE’s existing products.
* There are currently 167 different eVTOL aircraft under development. Blade is 1 of 1 asset light platform — poised to benefit regardless of which eVTOL manufacturer is first to market. Basically, Blade's strategy is akin to ***selling shovels in a gold rush.***
* Rob Wiesenthal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Blade, commented, “Ground mobility has been radically transformed by software and battery technology, as evidenced by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The next battle is in the air. **This transaction provides the capital for Blade to profitably expand its urban air mobility business using conventional rotorcraft today, while providing a seamless transition to EVA aircraft tomorrow**.”
* **Blade and KSL have already identified around $300 million in short- to mid-term investment opportunities** that will help Blade expand its presence in the northeastern United States, on the West Coast in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and in new markets that could include Vancouver, Jakarta, and Tokyo. (EXPC is sponsored by an affiliate of KSL Capital Partners, making the EXPC&lt;&gt;Blade strategic merger even more prudent).
* **Blade operates in four key lines of business:**
   * *Short Distance* – Flights between 60 and 100 miles in distance, primarily servicing commuters for prices between $595 and $795 per seat (or $295 for monthly commuter pass holders).
   * *BLADE Airport* – Flights between all New York area airports and dedicated Blade lounges in Manhattan’s heliports. Prices start at $195 per seat (or $95 per seat with the purchase of an annual Airport Pass)1 .
   * *BLADE MediMobility* – **Blade is the largest transporter of human organs in the Northeast United States**, reducing the costs and transport time for hospitals versus legacy competitors. This business is a critical part of the Company’s growth strategy as organ movements are expected to be one of the first uses of EVA, before flights for passengers.
   * *International Joint Ventures* – As part of its expansion strategy, the Company forms joint ventures with local partners in key overseas markets to provide the technology, customer experience, infrastructure design, and employee training, that enables a scalable and consistent Blade experience. **Blade’s first international joint venture launched helicopter services late last year in India** flying between Mumbai, Pune, and Shirdi.
   * The Company expects to use proceeds from the transaction to fund expansion into new markets, including the Northeast Corridor and West Coast in the United States, as well as target addressable markets internationally (Vancouver, Jakarta and Tokyo).
* **Blade's projected revenue outlook**:
   * Blade estimates its revenue in 2021 will reach $52 million.
   * Moreover, by 2023, Blade estimates revenue will reach $181 million and $402 million by the end of 2024. **This is all still before significant revenues occur from eVTOL which the company calls Phase 3 starting in 2025 and 2026**. It does not assume any passenger eVTOL revenue before then.
   * But in Phase 3, revenue is forecast to skyrocket to $601 million in 2025 and $875 million in 2026. (These numbers should be considered with a grain of salt)
* **Blade's Competitive Moat**:
   * **BLADE’s first mover advantage, extensive and loyal customer base and control of strategic infrastructure secures its leading position in the future of urban air mobility.**
   * **#1 market share in key short-distance aviation markets**, brings credibility to new market expansion.
   * **Strong management team with domain expertise** and public market experience.
   * **BLADE is already slated to leverage and partner with KSL’s portfolio companies** to generate attractive growth opportunities.
   * Proprietary technologies and asset-light model enables **flight volume growth** and **accelerates launch timeline for new markets**
   * While Joby Aviation - Uber partnership pose a significant competitive threat, it's worth noting that Uber Elevate failed to take off even with its branding and **it'll be challenging for Joby to front the customer acquisition cost** (after bleeding dry with production upscaling and certification costs) and outcompete Blade who have an edge in that domain with their ever growing loyal customer base. Another point to note is that Joby will be limited to their own aircrafts while Blade is already scanning potential players and will likely partner with different eVTOL operators depending on the nature of routes.
* **ARKQ is holding 2,748,457 shares**, which represents 9.99% of public float for EXPC. Once the merger is complete, there will be a total of 82.5M shares. This means ARK currently own 2.9% of the 82.5M shares.
* **Leadership:** Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Mr. Wiesenthal as Chief Executive Officer. The senior management team will also include Will Heyburn, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development, Brandon Keene, Chief Technology Officer, and Melissa Tomkiel, General Counsel.
* **Board of Directors** upon completion of transaction:
   * Eric Affeldt, Chief Executive Officer of Experience Investment Corp. and previously CEO of publicly-traded ClubCorp
   * Jane Garvey, former administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of United Airlines Holdings, Inc.

# What Blade/ EXPC and Joby/ RTP Stocks are Worth

**Blade - EXPC**

* PF shares outstanding: **82.5 million**
* EXPC SP as of 03/14: **$12.9**
* SPAC Cash = $375MM
* 82.5MM \* $12.9/share = 1.064Bn PF Market Cap
* PF EV is = $689MM (PF Market Cap - SPAC Cash)
* Disruptive technology platforms have an average EV-sales ratio of 8.2x. In addition, luxury brands are at 7.5x and recent EV / SPAC mobility deals have averaged 6.5x. The average of all four of these groups of stocks is **7.4x.** On page 37 of the presentation, Blade shows the EV-sales ratios of four groups of its peers.
* Unadjusted:
   * 2024 estimated revenue is expected to be **$402MM** (Blade isn't accounting any eVTOL revenue, international expansion, operational upside or any strategic upside in this number).
   * This means that the **unadjusted** **EV-sales ratio for 2024 is 1.71x sales**. That is very low.
   * This means that at 7.4x $402 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $2.975 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is **$3.35 billion**.
   * That is **215%** **above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion**.
   * **Unadjusted fair share price: 3.35Bn/82.5M = $40.61**
* Adjusted:
   * We need to adjust the 2024 numbers to derive their present value. At a 15% discount rate for 4 years, the 2024 sales are worth 57.175% of this in today’s dollars. The **present value sales number is $230 million** (i.e., $402 million times 57.175%).
   * As a result, the **adjusted EV-sales multiple is 3x** (i.e., $689 million EV divided by $230 million).
   * This means that at 7.4x $230 million, the EXPC stock EV is worth $1.702 billion. After adding back the $375 million in cash, the target market value is **$2.077 billion**.
   * That is **95.2% above today’s pro forma market cap of 1.064 billion**.
   * **Adjusted fair share price: 2.077Bn/82.5M = $25.2**
* Average between adjusted and unadjusted:
   * Target market value is $2.713 billion.
   * **Fair share price: $32.89**

**Conclusion:** ***EXPC stock is worth at least 154% more than its present price of $12.9*** *(As of 03/14/2021)*

This is without accounting all the hype from the merger announcement.

**Joby - RTP (Speculation)**

* It's difficult to value this stock since all the revenue projections are subject to a lot of variables (Timely certification, customer acquisition, production delays, etc.)
* Yet, I am long term bullish on this stock. With almost $2 billion in capital on-hand, the Elevate team, and Toyota as a manufacturing partner, Bevirt’s company has everything it needs to achieve his vision of *saving a billion people an hour a day.*
* Check Ehang (Chinese competitor) stock's trajectory over past 6 months.
* Clear that there's a lot of excitement surrounding eVTOLs and the news of merger should send this stock soaring in next few months.
* ARKX ETF is slated to launch end of this month and RTP is a great match for Cathie Wood's sub-orbital space category.

# How I am playing EXPC and RTP

* Catalysts:
   * ARKX ETF launch EOM makes both EXPC and RTP a great spec play
   * EXPC - A lot of spec predictions [floating around](https://mobile.twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1368222379080638467) about the shareholder vote on 3/31
   * Post NASDAQ sell-off was brutal for all SPACs and especially EXPC and RTP but these stocks are bound to rebound.
* Positions: 30 calls for 05/21 at $20 strike price, 18 calls for 8/20 at $25 strike price. I am tempted to pick up 04/16 $30 calls tomorrow.
* I don't have any RTP shares/calls but I might pick up a few calls tomorrow as well.
* Note that I am only playing catalysts at this point but may buy shares for RTP for long term investment (&gt;5years). I find advent of eVTOLs super exciting.

**Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor**, heck this is my first time writing a DD so what do I even know about investing. Do your own DD and most importantly, let me know if I've got any part of the thesis glaringly wrong.

personalfinance,How to approach $40k (USD) school?,"Hi!

I have been brainstorming about it for a while and looking for the best way to use my money.

What would be wiser - take a student loan at 6% (I guess it is annual accumulation) or take money out of Roth IRA tax and penalty free to pay for school (There is only about $14k (contribution, no gains, cause you can't take out gains), so it would only help lower the student loan.

  
I have noticed something though that if I leave my Roth IRA alone it might actually grow more annually than the student loan interest would be worth. So far (I am only investing maybe little over half year) it has total of over 13% gain. So annually, you know I would make more money leaving the big money alone and paying student loan only 6% interest rate. If I take out Roth IRA I will miss on that extra 7% growth. Am I right? Am I understanding this correctly?  


There is federal loan in question and a federal grant, but that just won't cover everything. I might still need to take out about $28k in loans.  
Ps. I got it saved up for living expenses for the duration of the school, so we are talking just the school expense itself.   


Thank you in advance.",finance
solar,Investigating if Solar is for us,"Me and my wife are investigating if solar is something that is for us.  We are looking at it primarily from a financial aspect and less than a green aspect though it plays a part just smaller than finances for us.   From some reading I've done we pay pretty dirt cheap for power, .901 for the first 800kwh and .856 after that.  There is a third tier but we'd likely never hit it.   The bad is we've recently moved here this past September so we don't have a summer usage yet but our highest was in December at 1875 over the winter in southern NC.   Lets say 2500 on the very high end in the summer for the sake of argument.  Our home is 2000sqft with a typical HVAC not a heat pump.  A converted two car garage is heated/cooled by a window unit.  We currently have my going on 15 year old daughter here who expected to move out in around five years at which point our usage will go down a good bit.   We plan to be in the home for around 20 years until we retire and will be relocating.   My wife bought a hybrid last year so it will be 8-9 years until an electric car is added as I will still be using gas in mine for the foreseeable future averaging 100-150 miles/week.  Usage wise that's all I can think of.  I we went solar I would want to essentially replace grid usage to the bar minimum and have battery back up for 2-3 of days not counting car charging.

Now implementation.  We need to reroof our detached garage which seems like a wonderful time to add solar.  (The house roof is about 10 years old which is old enough to be expensive to reroof in ten years tearing off and reinstalling solar but also a waste of half or more of the lifespan of the roof) I've added some photos with the in ground pool clearly being the newer picture with the trees behind the garage cut down.  The back of the house is pretty shaded and my wife isn't crazy about panels on the front of the house but the front of the garage is fine with both of us.  The photos are oriented as we are, east/west facing so the panels would be west facing.

So is it worth bothering getting quotes?  I'm thinking I'll be in the 12-14KW range?  Add a battery backup solution and I can see hitting mid $30k.  Does the math work?  Unless the rates go up I'm leaning towards no.   It's a little academic at the this point without going through a summer but would like to get into more serious research with the current fed rebate this year but having to reroof the garage makes it even more intriguing, just seems if we are going to do it seems like an excellent time too.  I am not trying to justify anything, I am perfectly OK with solar isn't for us.

I greatly appreciate the thoughts and comments.

&amp;#x200B;

edit

Would it fit in the space the garage affords?  Roughly monthly in finance what would the battery charge be?   Our power company does buy back extra so staying with a gas generator for emergency backup is an acceptable option.  Outside of hurricane and major ice storms we don't lose power much.  I'm sure they can wire that in as well.

personalfinance,Funding for college about to run out. Should I still take out a student loan if I have the cash to pay for college?,"I'm a 25 yr old college senior majoring in a stem field with about $20,000 in savings, a relatively low paying part time job, no debt and trying to decide if I should take a loan for college to keep the buffer I got.

I commute and have been living at home for most of my college career so those grants have carried me through completely.

personalfinance,Need help confirming social security requirements,"Probably not a typical day to day topic here -- but I'm helping my mom work out a retirement plan and it's pertinent.

Quick details...

* She is current 63y 2m.
* I'm projecting her retirement at the end of this calendar year (more or less 12/31/2021).  We may tweak this slightly, but it shouldn't change the questions.  She will be 63y 11m at this time.
* She will reach ""full retirement age"" of 66y 8m in October 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

According to this publication ([https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10003.pdf](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10003.pdf)), SSA benefits are reduced once your income surpasses $18,960 for 2021 (presumably this goes up slightly for 2022).  My main question is around verifying -- what is income?

* Are the social security payments counted as income?  I'm assuming no given some examples.
* Is it just W-2/1099?  What about investment income? Pensions?  Interest/dividends?

I then stumbled onto this page ([https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/whileworking.html](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/whileworking.html)) which says ""

When we figure out how much to deduct from your benefits, we count only the wages you make from your job or your net profit if you're self-employed. We include bonuses, commissions, and vacation pay. **We don't count** [pensions, annuities, investment income, interest](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/annuities.html), veterans, or other government or military retirement benefits.""  The link there talks about earning SSA credit, so not overly helpful.

This does seem fairly clear, but making a mistake with this results in a big change in what her monthly income looks like, so I'd like to validate.  I'm just stumbling onto pages via the magic of google, so who knows what else I might be missing.

Here is a summary of her income sources I'm expecting:

* Social Security Survivor's benefits (her second husband passed away 2 years ago and was right around full retirement age (\~66) at the time of his death.  Based on my initial pass, it seems better to take the survivor benefits, wait until 70 years old, then take her own benefits.
* What I think is a pension.  My dad (her first husband) retired from the State Teacher Retirement System and from their divorce she gets a payment every month here.  I'm not 100% sure how this is classified or how she records it in her taxes, but I'm guessing it's some form of pension.  This is the biggest concern, as it eats up right around all of the $18k limit if included.
* A very small amount of 1099-INT.  Maybe a few hundred given the current poor interest rate environment.
* A small amount of 1099-DIV.  Maybe a couple thousand.  I've mostly got her in Roth/Traditional IRA's for all remaining money, so nothing taxable out of there.
* Current thought is to take her pension (separate from the above) as a lump sum rollover into an IRA when she retires at the end of 2021.  I think it's a better deal, but it also avoids any questions about receiving a second pension income around this question.

Do any of these count?   Anything else I might be overlooking?",finance
worldnews,Why the market’s manic moves over the Fed and inflation may not peak until summer,,finance
Forex,Market Roundup,"The ECB, unsurprisingly, made no material changes to the current monetary policy. The bank did commit to ramping up the pace of their Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme yet overall, the size of bond purchasing will remain the same. The policy stance has always been non-exchange rate targeting and the ECB kept to that commitment, as the latest move is not expected to dampen support for the Eurodollar. 

Annualized inflation is moving closer to the Fed’s price stability mandate of 2%. In the 12 months to February, consumer prices climbed 1.7%. A surge in energy prices contributed the most to the rise in the index, however, consumer-related services continue to suffer from a lack of demand. The result marks a steady recovery, highlighting that growth in the world’s third largest economy continues to be asymmetric. The approval of Biden’s $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package should stoke consumer demand and that, coupled with a ramp up in the vaccination programme, should result a more rapid economic recovery. 

China’s trade balance data indicated a strong recovery as the region rang in the new year. Exports jumped 61% in January and February compared with a contraction 17% during the same period of 2020. Sentiment in Japan climbed in February, according to the Economy Watchers Survey.

CryptoMarkets,New crypto banking license ****First Blockchain Bank &amp; Trust****,"Ceo Marshall  Hayner 

Executive chairman Fred Krueger 
https://www.linkedin.com/in/frkrueger

Proton blockchain - Theyre about to receive their full banking license which will enable all crypto to have a direct partner in U.S. banking. Almost no one knows it yet either so it hasnt gone up 100's of % but when their approval comes through itll be some of the biggest news in crypto. Check out Marshall Hayners AMA in the Metal subreddit about it.

No more banking refusals for crypto projects very soon with 
****First Blockchain Bank &amp; Trust****

Proton is new and still under 1 cent at 0.0082usd.. and hasnt yet been listed on tier 1 exchanges. 
Question is - do you think the first crypto / traditional banking license will drive exchange listings and media attention?

Even $100 in it has excellent potential.. not financial advice, im not a financial advisor however. 
Ceo of Proton Marshall Hayner  -  answer.. ""First Blockchain Bank and Trust will operate just like any other national bank, with the core difference being the integration of what the OCC refers to as INVN or independent node verification networks, aka blockchain daemons. With FBB we plan to integrate Proton blockchain first and foremost for security with multi-factor authentication (MFA) using Proton Signing Request (PSR). The ability to add identity to the blockchain and quickly and easily issue blockchain-based assets to real identifiable consumers and corporations is the first step for major corporate tech adoption. Simultaneously, the gas problem needs to be eliminated, and that's exactly what we did with Proton"".

...plan to integrate other blockchains as well.

Another question / answer from Protons ceo Marshall Hayner

is there new progress on bank license apllication? 

Reply

u/MarshallHayner avatar MarshallHayner AMA Host

Yes, progress is moving along at a rapid rate. Unfortunately, due to the sensitive legal nature of the application, I can't disclose too much, but what I will say is I'm extremely excited to see First Blockchain Bank and Trust open our doors! One of the reasons this is so exciting is that we are the first national bank integrating fiat deposits and cryptocurrency custody, trading, trust services, and seeking full FDIC insurance and Federal Reserve membership with Fedwire and ACH access. It is truly a historic moment in cryptocurrency and banking, and I'm honored to have the opportunity to open the first full bank charter with blockchain integrated deeply. Specifically, Proton blockchain for MFA, identity, and transfers - also the usual players, MTL, BTC, ETH and more to come.

Their license was submitted 5 weeks ago approximately.

I have 2 US Credit card with $10k limit combined but no credit card debt. I guess you can say I have a “golden parachute” in EU so can’t exactly put a number on emergency fund but not a high concern.
I know $6k is nothing against that student loan debt.. the interest rate is 1-2.5% and I really think I should invest if I could.

I have to do taxes in Europe AND USA anyway.. and to top it all off, there MIGHT be a chance that I’m going back to the US for work/life for some years but with ultimate plan to return to EU. Just recently turned 25 and don’t want to waste time.

I was looking at coins on the Voyager app (trying it, coming from Coinbase), and noticed some pretty awesome interest rates for USDC coin. Seems too good to be true though? I’m wondering if I’m missing something.

Currently sitting at a 9% interest for USDC coin, it’s steady and matched the US dollar, and it pays out and compounds monthly. Seems like it would be a great savings account right? What am I missing?

Thanks for your help.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,I reported HitBTC to Federal Police!,"Cyber Crime department finally got back to me. They are going to ask Seychelles Police for cooperation to see if they can get my money. 

They were dumbfounded when I showed them how much KYC information I sent them and they asked ME why I would give anyone this amount of personal information.

I said because they have my money, so what choice did I have.

Hope they get some cooperation from Seychelles Police.  Hopefully this starts something! Why they are still trading I'll never know.",cryptocurrency
cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 03.15.2021,"Good Morning Cardanoverse!

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying "" Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. Famed crypto enthusiast and billionaire Mike Novogratz asks the Cardano world ""Can anyone make a real bull case for [$ADA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=cashtag_click)? Does anyone build on it? Use it? Why is market cap so high? Should it be a funding asset? It’s one of the few cryptos I haven’t traded in my life.""

8. Charles will be speaking at the Blockchain Africa Conference next week which may or may not give us more clues as to the African Bird announcement. [https://blockchainafrica.co/](https://blockchainafrica.co/) 
9. SingularityNet collaboration with Cardano going down. How else is Skynet gonna pay the Terminators?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ) [https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos)
10. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
11. What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1)
12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh. 
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)

16. Possible Soulja Boy Cardano collab on NFT. Maybe Soulja Boy could be best brohs with Charles and Stephen Wolfram broh? [https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907](https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907)
17. Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark. Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

35. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have a hairline that is even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.
36. Cardano reached 550k wallets in half the time it took BTC [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1369933366368362496](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1369933366368362496)
37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum). This is one of those nice articles where the British guy pleasantly reads it to you if you want. Use this one to convince all your friends you are the ultimate blockchain expert:  “listen Kyle...the shortcoming of UTXO accounting is....” [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/)

45. Cardano uses a tiny fraction of the energy some other top-ten blockchains use.   This factoid alone should allow you to hook up with eco-obsessed nature people. [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875)

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

stocks,Is The Stock Market Going To Crash Again In 2021? Should You Buy Stocks Today? Stock Market v Yields &amp; Jobs | Zoom &amp; Nio Opinion,"Hey there folks! Today I want to talk to you about what’s really going on in the stock market and what we should expected next…

**\[Don't: Read Very Long Post | Dislike Before Reading\]**

So, in the last couple of weeks, we have seen a very fast correction in the tech heavy Nasdaq [Index](https://imgur.com/aK26hjA) after the bond yields rapidly spiked over 1.5% for the 10y, as a lot of investors kept getting spooked by the employment numbers coming in slightly better than expected, though many important things are still hidden in those numbers.

For example, last week we saw the US gaining almost 400K jobs, but this barely moved the unemployment [rate](https://imgur.com/7PJTWUA) which still stands at 6.2% (and this doesn’t even include people who just quit searching for jobs). Almost all of the job [gains](https://imgur.com/B3av5gb) were seen in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has started to regain some momentum after it was the most affected by the events of last year, as this sector is still down more than 3.5M jobs since a year ago.

These past weeks we also [saw](https://imgur.com/yeudkin) jobless claims continuing to go down, with the latest initial jobless claims coming in at the lowest level since last early last year at just over 700K, as the continuing jobless claims also coming in at just over 4.1M.

But guys, regardless of the jobs &amp; unemployment numbers, the main thing that will keep investors on edge will continue to be treasury [yields](https://imgur.com/rDjy9fO), the interest rates and how this are affected by the inflation [numbers](https://imgur.com/awXUGgw) which are expected to see a huge bump in the next months as we will have very low comps compared to last year when we saw the rona starting to pick up steam.

We can see [here](https://imgur.com/QbuiSot) the core inflation came lower this month with an increase of just .1% which jolted the stock market and started a recovery after the sell-off in the past weeks.

Given that tech names &amp; EVs were some of the biggest hit stocks we should also take a quick look at NIO, as the company lost almost half of its value in the past month, dropping from over $66 to just $35 after the big sell off in the past weeks.

NIO’s drop was also amplified probably by the fact that they posted mixed [results](https://imgur.com/t0jRJEW) for the 4th quarter of last year, as they just missed the top line but did manage to post a solid beat on the company’s bottom line, losing just $0.14/share.

Investors might not have been happy to see a guidance of just 15% above their 4th quarter given the huge valuation and expectations of the company and the huge global chip shortage that will limit NIO’s production capacity to just 7.5K/month in the 2nd quarter of 2021.

I still have a mixed opinion about NIO’s stock, but after this huge sell-off, it has become more attractive given the continued [growth](https://imgur.com/cI1TNWJ) of sales the company has seen in the last years, while I also believe NIO will remain one of the winners of the EV disruption.

The other stock that I wanted to mention after what has happened in the past weeks is Zoom.

I really like Zoom’s products and I understand the hype of the stock, but I also really believe they will struggle to keep the huge growth rate going, as the company might have seen its peak growth after the massive work-from-home movement in 2020.

[Zoom](https://imgur.com/UygZxJZ) also reported a beat on the top &amp; bottom line and I expect them to continue to have another great first half to start 2021, but after that, the company will have very though comps to go against, which might really put some downward pressure on the stock, especially as more people go back to their workplaces.

You can see, even the company doesn’t expect the huge growth to continue, with the revenue growth expected to only slightly continue to grow during 2021.

Zoom is valued at almost $100B which is really hard to justify unless the company continues to innovate and bring more &amp; more products to the market, as the industry they operate in will only become more competitive over time with other big players like Google, Microsoft, Salesforce &amp; many others looking to take market share.

Guys, if you are still in doubt about what to do next in the stock market, you should just take a look at the chart below and start thinking long term, because investing, if you are really looking to make money is all about the long-term.

You can see [HERE](https://imgur.com/ZlO593t) in the past 100 years we've had 8 bear markets previous to the one we saw in 2020, with the average bear market lasting just 1.4years compared to over 9 years for every bull market with a staggering difference in gains vs losses as well.

We can also see in this [chart](https://imgur.com/wM39iSQ) that it only took 15 days for the Nasdaq to enter a 10% correction this time, but you can see the average 12 month return after a 10% correction is almost 30% which is huge, with the likelihood of the index posting a positive return in the next 12 months standing at over 90%

So, given that we had a bear market last year, I believe it’s highly unlikely that we will see a huge drop in stocks even if yields continue to rise, as the real return of the treasury yields will continue to be close to 0, as I don’t expect them to jump more than 2% for the 10y anytime soon.

Moving on, I recently saw some [comments](https://imgur.com/I3ijkKT) made by David Tepper which I wasn’t really aware of but which made a lot of sense to me, he highlighted that the other downward pressure put on treasury yields, which will keep them in check, will come from investors in other countries like Japan, Germany &amp; many others, as the US treasuries have become way more attractive than others.

One other thing that I think should be mentioned is that the [Dow Jones](https://imgur.com/undefined) has continued to make new high after new high in the past week, being led by companies like Disney which has just surpassed 100M [subscribers](https://imgur.com/fCTDNGX) on their Disney+ platform while also getting a boost from their other revenue streams starting to come back online, and of course the stock that has led the DOW in the past week, Boeing, as the [company](https://imgur.com/K6SPGY1) had more sales than cancellations for the first time since November 2019 as the 737 MAX crisis is finally starting to fade away for the company, with even more possible [deals](https://imgur.com/4XYgfs9) likely to close in the next period, as airlines start to have a better view of what the future will bring for them.

Friends, you shouldn’t be scared of stock market corrections or dips as we have [seen](https://imgur.com/74dAwZO) a 10% pullback once every 11 months as you can see, with the frequency of bigger crashes decreasing significantly, but as always, because we are highly emotional beings, it’s very hard for us to handle our emotions after a series of red days.

You should remember though, most often than not, the best way to go is just to ride out the dip and even starting deploying more cash into the stock market the more it drops. I think you should develop a strategy of not selling on big red days and deploying an increasingly higher % of your cash into great stocks the more the stock market drops.

I also fully expect some part of the next stimulus check, which was just signed by Biden, to end up in the stock market, which might help push the stock market on the right path despite increasing pressures from rising yields and possible short-term inflation fears.

**So just to end this post guys, is the stock market going to crash? My short answer is NO!**

I don’t expect that to happen any time soon. Even if we continue to see volatility in the stock market you should use that to your advantage and smartly deploy cash into great companies, which leads me to my other question, should you buy stocks today? Well, at the moment of writing this post, futures are currently trending down pre-market (SP &amp; Nasdaq in the Red, Dow +0.2%) and If they continue to do so it might be a good chance to deploy some cash, but don’t rush into the first red day you see, slowly build your positions or add to them. As a rule of thumb, I like to buy more once a 5% dip occurs in the stock market and slowly deploy cash the more it drops.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/15/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-15-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks set to rise after record closes for Dow and S&amp;P 500

&gt; * U.S. stock futures pushed higher Monday even as the 10-year Treasury yield held around 1.63%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs Friday. The Nasdaq fell modestly as recently slumping tech stocks continued to fight rising bond yields. However, the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all posted strong weekly gains. Ahead of Monday’s open, the Nasdaq was up more than 3.3% for the year. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 were up 7% and almost 5%, respectively in 2021.

*****

&gt; # 2. B/itcoin takes breather after surge to over $60,000

&gt; * B/itcoin dropped 6% on Monday, after jumping Saturday to another all-time high — this time above $60,000. The world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency has just about doubled this year. It’s soared more than 1,000% over the past 12 months. B/itcoin’s market value climbed back above $1 trillion last week. The incredible rally has been driven by increased adoption by larger institutional investors and firms as well as speculative demand.

*****

&gt; # 3. Treasury yields near 1-year highs ahead of Fed meeting

&gt; * While the 10-year Treasury yield was actually a bit lower Monday morning, it was only slightly below its more than one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. The rapid rise in yields this year has traders wondering whether the Federal Reserve may be losing control of the direction of interest rates. The Fed’s two-day March meeting begins Tuesday, with questions about how long near-zero rates and extraordinarily easy Covid monetary policy can last.

*****

&gt; # 4. Biden and Harris to sell $1.9 trillion Covid relief plan

&gt; * The Fed is expected to forecast better economic growth after last week’s signing by President Joe Biden of the $1.9 trillion package of fiscal measures designed to help Americans, U.S. businesses and state and local governments dealing with the fallout from the pandemic. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris hit the road this week to sell the Covid stimulus plan, which includes up to $1,400 in direct payments to many people.

&gt; * General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland’s AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world’s biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about 2.5% in Monday’s premarket.

*****

&gt; # 5. Fauci warns against lifting U.S. restrictions right now

&gt; * White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning state leaders that the nation’s battle with the coronavirus is still “not in the end zone.” He urged Americans to adhere to public health measures despite the ramp-up of vaccinations, pointing to new infection spikes in Europe as a cautionary tale of relaxing too soon. As of Sunday night, the CDC reported that nearly 37.5 million people in the U.S. were fully vaccinated — more than 11% of the nation’s population of over 330 million.

personalfinance,Is it ever wise to break a lease to purchase a home,"Hello all. Hoping you can provide me with some advice. I'm currently renting. I relocated to this area in January. Sold my home in my previous state. We do plan to purchase, but we weren't familiar with the area and all the surrounding communities. We opted to rent to get to know the area. We like our rent house. No issues other than a very long commute.

After some soul searching and therapy, I've realized how much I dislike my career path. I'm in retail management. I'm extremely passionate about wildlife conservation and would like to switch gears and go back to school. This will mean stepping down from my responsibilities and taking a smaller, less paying role. 

Our lease isn't up until end of December, but I'd like to start classes this Fall. As far as loan approval, I'd prefer to purchase a home prior to stepping down. We'd be purchasing within our means with me in school full time for a few years. This isn't an attempt to get a larger mortgage, just best approval and interest rate options. This would mean breaking our lease. Is this a terrible idea? My area is rent crazy. Most places rent out before even being viewed in person.
I have other reasons why it'd be beneficial, ie permanent school for my kids instead of transferring in January. But from a financial standpoint, will it be wise to break it?
I just want to make sure I'm considering all possibilities and repercussions.",finance
investing,Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose,"# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

stocks,Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose,"# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at this chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

cardano,Ada Lovelace - A Cardano Mythos Profile,"I've been reading a lot about the figures from Cardano's ""mythology"" for an NFT collection I'm working on and it has been a really wonderful experience. I love the way Charles and IOHK have embraced the stories of great people who came before and contributed to the formation of the world we live in today. Ada Lovelace, her father Lord Byron, the myths of Daedalus and Icarus, Percy and Mary Shelley, Voltaire, Goguen, and the list goes on.

I wanted to share what I've learned about Ada Lovelace, a woman who we should all know a bit better.

Ada Lovelace's mother was emotionally abusive and manipulative, and Ada was frequently ill as a child. Coincidence? I think not! Her mother hated her father, Lord Byron, and didn't want Ada to end up a poet as well. So she had her educated in mathematics and music (to counter dangerous poetic tendencies, of course). But it didn't work!

Instead of being silenced, Ada became something exceptional: a poet-mathematician. Her language was mathematics, but she wouldn't be bound to traditional rules. She questioned basic assumptions through the lenses of poetry and science. She let herself dream and in the end she stretched the field of  mathematics to an entirely new limit when she published the first computer algorithm ever written!

In 1843 Ada and Charles Babbage were working on the absolute cutting edge of technology at the time: the Analytical Engine - the world's first complex computer. During this time, Ada the poet-mathematician made an immense leap of foresight and imagination that no one had ever made in human history: She wrote that computers could be used for ""developing  and tabulating any function whatever... the engine is the material expression of any indefinite function of any degree of generality and complexity.""

People must have thought she was insane! A final working version of the Analytical Engine was never even physically built, and she was writing about its infinite possibilities. Reminds me a bit of crypto, tbh. Oh the places we'll go XD

After escaping her abuse laden childhood, Ada had finally hit her stride with the Analytical Engine, and she kept going. Among other projects, she was working on ""a calculus of the nervous system,"" which was meant to model how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings. But Ada's intensely unique point of view was tragically snuffed out when she died of cancer in 1852, at the age of 36. One can only imagine the wonders of mathematics she might have produced had she more time on this Earth.

You won't be forgotten, Ada.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Buying house vs maxing out retirement savings,"I need some support/input on a personal stressor.

I live in western Montana and work for the US forest service. Im 32, male, single, would like to get married someday but never want children. Good credit, minimal debt. I make about $69k/yr pre-tax, adjusted, $80k overall (factoring in untaxed retirement savings and thousands in excess travel “per diem”, more on this later). Im a wildland firefighter, so I can retire @ 50 years old. I plan on working for the Feds til Im 55-63 or so, to increase my pension. By my calculations, I’ll earn about $80-90k/yr in retirement.

**The Problem: the western Montana real estate market is red hot, like the 2nd hottest in the country.** “The median sale price in the Missoula urban area climbed to $414,000 last month, compared to $318,000 a year earlier and $282,000 in February of 2019” [source](https://www.foxbusiness.com/real-estate/heres-what-you-can-get-for-1-3m-in-missoula-montana).

I do not own... nor do I really want to other than accumulating equity. Renting sucks, but only cuz the market is so hot. Ive had apartments and houses sold out from underneath me, it take 2 months to find a new place... But rent isnt really going up, at least nowhere near enough to affect me. I pay roughly $1250/mo... BUT!!! that’s sharing a house with a great roommate in a great location ($750+utilities), a 10’x40’ storage unit for my 2nd vehicle/tools/gear/etc ($200/mo), and payments on a 28’ travel trailer that I live in during the summer (so a 2nd house, $230/mo)... plus odds and ends (camper &amp; rental insurance, storing the camper in the winter, etc). Annnnnd I get $5k/yr tax free from the govt for living at a remote ranger station. So i feel like Im kinda crushing my housing situation: 2 residences both in amazing locations + a massive, secure storage unit - all for under 30% of my post tax income.

But equity... most of my coworkers own. **And i endlessly hear about how much equity theyve accumulated in the past few years.** Many are up $100k+ from just 2020 alone. But most also complain that they cannot upgrade, due to the hot market. They could sell immediately, but buying is a nightmare right now. They also all live pretty traditional lives vs me, the bachelor.

Im jealous of their equity, but I also dont really wanna own a house. I dont like dealing with fixing shit, landscaping, etc. Im happy to pay some dude $750/mo and enjoy my weekends doing whatever the fuck i want. Fixing crap on my camper is about as much “homemaking” as I can tolerate. I think i could own if I really wanted to, but 1) id be broke and 2) im on the road 100+ days/yr firefighting and spend another 100 days living at the remote ranger station. I literally sought out a roommate to bring my mail in and water my house plants.

Buying a condo is an obvious option, but it would be somewhat of a reach. We’re talking close to $400k for a layout/location I actually want. But saving for a house is not really something I want to allocate funds for. **I feel rather than buy a house, I wanna crush my retirement saving and spend the rest of my money on luxury (winter trips, toys, going out).** And I still max out my IRA and put almost 10% into my TSP (on track for $150k by 35) and have ample emergency savings. I love “set it and forget it.” Also my retirement plans are probably gonna be living 50/50 in Montana and somewhere warm (snowbirding). And realistically, my profession is unhealthy - so who knows what my life expectancy is, but probably slightly below average.

Not really sure if Im asking anything, but guidance, criticism, or kind words would be appreciated.

TL;DR: I feel rather than buy a house, I wanna crush my retirement saving and spend the rest of my money on luxury.",finance

personalfinance,"Looking for advice on house buying and affordability - Washington, US","Hi /r/personalfinance,

My partner and I plan to get married and are starting to look into buying a house due to low interest rates. We are thinking that housing prices will only become more difficult in the near future with land becoming less available and with Biden's homebuyer credit plan of 2021.

As such, my partner thinks we can afford a house of up to 820k with a 20%+ down payment, but I am more hesitant as I've read varying values and ratios for determining if one is ""house-poor"".

Financial details as follows:

* both of us have no debt
* we are not going to do a wedding ceremony due to the related costs
* we are both investing into pre-tax retirements, e.g. 401k
* no pets and no concrete plans to get one
* we plan to have a child, BUT we plan to buy a home in a location such that her family is close by as they have offered to take care of our child when we are working, i.e. no need to pay for child care. They have also offered child-related supplies and items, such as clothing or diapers of which they have several
* we have enough money saved up for a 20%+ down payment, and are thinking of going beyond 20 to reduce the mortgage
* Looking at an 800k home with 20% down, we estimate the principal &amp; interest + property tax + HOA + homeowner insurance + utilities (sewage, water, electricity, internet) to be **approximately 4k per month**
* My partner and I currently have a **combined net income of approximately 8k per month**
* My partner and I also do not eat out very often, possibly once or twice a week, and even then it would average out to no more than $20 per person per meal

Any financial suggestions or advice on big expenses to take into account, or thoughts on us being ""house-poor"" or not, would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,What's everyone's outlook on the real estate market moving forward in 2021?,"I hope this is alright to post in r/personalfinance as opposed to a more specific real estate subreddit, but I'd love to hear the perspective from some financially responsible folks who (like me right now) are thinking of buying a house this year. 

We currently live in the Chicagoland area and we've been planning to move out of our apartment and buy a house for the last couple of years. We've saved up for a downpayment and gotten our debt to a much more manageable place. At this point, we just have some small balances remaining on student loans with very low-interest rates.  

Early in 2019 we told ourselves that at the end of 2020 we would begin our home search with the goal of buying a house in 2021. Of course over the last 6 months the real estate market has been going nuts. Prices are at all-time highs in the areas we're looking at, and competition is crazy as well. 

We've made a few offers so far, all of which have been beat out. Even putting 10-20% down and offering asking price, we're getting beat by Cash offers and people going far above asking price for homes. 

I guess my question is, can we expect the housing market to calm down anytime soon? We want to remain hopeful, but also realistic. We luckily have the ability to go month to month (slightly higher monthly rent) in our current apartment after our lease is over so we can extend our search timeframe. We'd obviously like to limit how long we go month to month, but the reality is we live pretty below our means today so the extra rent added will still be lower than any mortgage payment we'd be paying.

I have a few thoughts on the market's outlook (but I'm no professional by any means). On the one hand I could see rates going up as the economy starts to recover. This could lead to house prices to decrease, less competition because people aren't in a frenzy to lock in the low rates of today, and as people can start to go out more, there will be less focus on having a nice home. The reason I say this is because I feel like during Covid, people were putting money in their homes or upgrading to a new home because it's where they spend 90% of their time. 

On the other hand, I worry that if the economy keeps humming along, maybe rates increase and prices go down a bit, but the frenzy doesn't end and maybe it gets more competitive.

So I guess my question is, what is everyone else thinking? Are any of you who initially thought you'd be buying this year holding out? Are you biting the bullet and paying a premium to get into the house you love knowing in the short term you might lose home value? 

Again looking more for insight into people's outlook on the market moving forward instead of my personal situation. Thanks!",finance

retirement,How am I doing?,"***How Am I Doing***

My wife is concerned that we will not have enough in retirement. I believe we are better off than a lot of our peers. However, to alleviate her concerns, I’m posting this on Reddit. If you tell me otherwise I will look at professional guidance.

I’ll be 62 in June of this year and my wife just turned 66. A little background I retired from the active Army in 2011 as a Master Sergeant with my pension beginning immediately. I did a total of 35 years, 21 years active duty, and 14 years in the Army reserves.

I retired from my civilian job as a Federal Law Enforcement officer in 2017 and am receiving my pension from OPM. I am also a 90% disabled veteran from injuries in Afghanistan in 2006. Two combat deployments to Afghanistan and one combat deployment to Iraq/Kuwait. We live in Oklahoma City, though I’m originally from New York City and my wife is from Indiana.

Our current financial situation.

* My pension's Army, OPM, and the VA nets us a little over $6900.00 a month
* My wife just started taking her Social Security a couple of months ago. And receives $1195.00 per month.
* All of our monthly income sources have a cost of living adjustment annually
* I have 2 Thrift Savings accounts totaling approximately $500,000.00
* I’m not planning on drawing Social Security until a minimum of full retirement age
* Our house is paid off with an estimated value of $200,000.00
* My medical coverage is provided by the VA and my wife is covered by Medicare and Tricare for Life which is free
* I have Survivor Benefits for my wife with both my Army and OPM pensions. When I die the VA pension will stop as they don’t have any Survivor Benefits program
* We live what I would describe as an average lifestyle, not too exciting…
* We have some consumer debt that I am paying off, but nothing overwhelming

personalfinance,Should I transfer my (previous) state retirement fund to Roth IRA?,"I live in Florida and make about $25k a year.

I would like help on what is best to do with this account. I have no plans to move back to Ohio, but also do not plan to stay in Florida long-term.

I have read that Roth IRAs can typically earn 7-10% (I understand that this is post-tax), while my current OPERS account earns 4% annually pre-tax. So If I pay taxes to transfer my OPERS account to a Roth IRA (I have roughly calculated $2,800 federal and Ohio state taxes on $22k), it seems like I would start earning more money after 3-5 years in a Roth IRA at 7-10% than with my OPERS account. Does this sound correct? And with the Roth IRA already being taxed, this seems to make more sense to me.

Alternatively, I cannot find if there is reciprocity between Ohio and Florida PERS. If there is reciprocity, would that mean that I may be able to transfer the account to Florida PERS without paying taxes? Might this path be worth exploring further?",finance

personalfinance,Questions to ask while refinancing a home?,"First time homeowner, and I'm absolutely clueless here.

I'm in the military, and bought a home back in 2018 while attending a 20 month course - the rental market is unbelievably strong, so it was an easy choice. With my complete lack of credit at the time (Currently at a 750ish), I was given a 30yr/4.99% interest rate on a $114,000 home. I put down $24,000 to avoid PMI, with my note hovering around $700 - but have paid an extra $200 towards the principle every month.

The mortgage company sent out an email offering refinancing, and on the phone told me I was eligible for a 15yr/3.25% loan with payments around $812. Downside, since the home is no longer my primary residence, it keeps me from receiving a lower interest rate. If I continued to pay $900/mo, the house would be paid off within the next 12.5 years. The home is currently being moved into by a friend and his family, and he will be paying $1125/mo in rent. I do plan on selling the home within the next 3-5 years, after I attend a 5 month career course at the same base (exact timeline unknown).

Comparable homes in our home are selling between 700k-775k NOW. (I don’t know where that will be in August when we pass the 1 year and aren’t subject to proceeds on income (If you sell under 1 year you’re taxed in your income bracket, after 1 year it’s capital gains.)

Sell for 700k (very very very conseratively)

GROSS-270k 

Lose 15% to Capital Gains- Now at 229,000

Pay buyer realtor $14000+ 5000 cc (I’m a realtor, don’t need to spend on one lol)

Down to 210k. Nuke all of our debt (CC, student loans, my car (I’m a contractor the peace of mind helps at 14k w/ 8% interest anyway)

Left with 165k for a house. 20% down + 10k closing costs, probably walking away with 40k CONSERVATIVELY (I really think we can get another 85k out of the price. 

IF we do this. Our mortgage is our only debt at MAYBE 20% DTI, we have a huge head start on investing (Mid 20s). And we’re in the area we want to be in and it may even be the track to FIRE by 35 if we can now contribute 60kish a year to retirement.

Bitcoin,Why India’s Bitcoin Ban Doesn’t Matter,"Why India Banning Crypto Doesn’t Matter

India Bans Cryptocurrency

India will propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets. Even China, which has banned mining and trading, does not penalise possession. Holders of cryptocurrencies have up to six months to liquidate.

The draconian bill is believed to give jail of up to 10 years on people who mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose of, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies (1). 


Why? 

Illicit activity with crypto is no longer a valid argument for censorship. It is currently believed to make up less than 1% of Bitcoin transaction activity, a stark contrast to the 2% to 5% of global GDP caught up in money laundering alone. As legitimate cryptocurrency use goes up, crypto crime as a percentage goes down. 2020 crypto crime was $1.9 billion in 2020, down 57% from 2019’s $4.5 billion (2). 

The Reserve Bank of India voiced its concern again last month, citing what it said were risks to financial stability from cryptocurrencies. At the same time, the central bank has been working on launching its own digital currency, a step the government’s bill will also encourage.

Quantitative easing (inflation) is seen by governments as imperative for maintaining financial integrity and mitigating financial crisis, despite the negative socio-economic effects associated with the loss of purchasing power (3). 

Bitcoin is immune from both fiscal and monetary policy and avoids the need for cross-border foreign exchange transactions. The Indian government is therefore likely banning cryptocurrency eliminate competition, centralising financial power and imposing inflation and monitoring on national digital currency users. 


Implications

Governments acting to improve the well-being of a community often make misjudgements, unintentionally creating “almost as much harm in ruining lives and destroying wealth as the most destructive wars”(4).  

The proposed ban on crypto will be particularly damaging to the already poor financial inclusion in India. A World Bank study that found there were over 1.7 billion unbanked adults in 2017 (5). 

It is unlikely that other governments will follow in India’s steps. However, for institutional investors to participate in a new asset class, it must be underpinned by a robust infrastructure able to support an efficient market, so more regulation is expected. Governments themselves are being pressured and many are re-considering their own currency offerings (6). 

Bitcoin's global reach and neutrality could spur it to become the currency of choice for international trade (7). It is almost impossible for a government to shut down access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies or prevent its ownership or usage without what would effectively amount to a shutdown of the global Internet (8). Today, access to the Bitcoin network is enabled by satellites in areas with unreliable or no Internet connection, which further reinforces its censorship-resistant properties (9). India’s poor policy making simply slows national institutional adoption. 

September 2017 was the last time Bitcoin suffered a pull back from a government banning it (China). Spot price went from $5000 to $3000 before proceeding to run up to $20,000 in the following months. If anything this proves the resilience of decentralised currencies.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Frequency Therapeutics - A sleeping biotech giant, about to wake from its slumber","**Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.**

This is not a company I came across through my general stock research. In fact, it is a company I stumbled across through my own personal health journey.

I'm expecting a significant jump in the stock price in the next week or two (possibly even in the next day or two) and so wanted to post my own due diligence for others. I am currently long on $FREQ.

**Some personal disclosure first**

As mentioned above, I came across this company through my own personal health journey. Until Frequency Therapeutics, I had never invested into biotech as I deemed it was too risky and I considered the science beyond my understanding, and to some extent still do. To put it simply, I saw no reason in investing in something I couldn't understand.

This all changed when I started to experience problems with my hearing. I currently suffer from hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis. Frequency Therapeutics' leading drug candidate aims to regenerate hearing in the human ear.

Naturally then, I am not only financially invested but also emotionally invested in this company. I want them to win and it’s only right I disclose this. The thing is, these conditions have led me down a journey towards understanding the science behind the anatomy of the human ear over the years, as well as look into why previous attempts at regenerating hearing have failed. I do not have a medical background, but I believe the amount of understanding I have accumulated over the years after having read dozens if not hundreds of peer-reviewed medical journal articles has given me an insight into an area of biotech - namely otology - that I otherwise would not have had.

So as I say, I've seen many companies come and go over the years, attempting to treat hearing loss with no success. I did not invest in any of them. So what's different this time?

My analysis will focus on five things: the leading product and how it works, how this drug is different from other companies trying to treat hearing loss, Frequency's clinical trial results so far, the team behind the product, the financials and the potential market size.

**The leading drug candidate: FX-322**

[FX-322 aims to regenerate hair cells in the cochlea.](https://www.frequencytx.com/pipeline-programs/hearing-program/) The auditory system is complex with many points of failure, but the most common cause of hearing loss along that pathway is induced by the loss of these hair cells, either due to noise exposure, age or drugs (ototoxicity). When these cells die, they are gone forever. Current treatments consist of hearing aids and cochlea implants, which simply amplify the remaining signal from the surviving hair cells. They do not replace or restore the clarity and frequencies lost by dead hair cells. These hair cells are located in the cochlea, a small membrane located behind the middle ear and in one of the most difficult-to-reach areas of the body. Treating hearing loss therefore poses not just the challenge of developing the drug, but also finding a way to deliver it to the cochlea once developed.

Interestingly, birds and some other animals are known to regenerate their hair cells, and therefore their hearing, naturally. The relevance of this will become more obvious further down below.

Until now, one of the obvious attempts at restoring hearing in the ear has been through the use of stem cells. The idea behind using stem cells, as we all know, is that a stem cell can turn into any other cell. Stem cells, however, present their own sets of challenges. As described above, there is a delivery issue. Even if one could culture a good number of hair cells from stem cells, it is very difficult to transfer them to the cochlea. Moreover, the process of injecting the cochlea would itself cause cochlea damage (and potentially hearing loss). Secondly, stem cells turned into hair cells lack the genes required to integrate fully into the the colonies of other hair cells. It would be a retro-fit, rather than a seamless fit. Thirdly, developing stem cells on a mass scale for such a big market (which I discuss further down) also presents its own challenges.

Back to FX-322.

A few years ago, researchers discovered that the cochlea is a host to what are known as progenitor cells. Progenitor cells are cells that are slightly further down the line of a stem cell, but unlike a stem cell, which can turn into any kind of a cell, a progenitor cell has a pre-determined cell “fate”, in that it can only turn into one type of cell. A man named Will McLean, co-founder of Frequency Therapeutics, discovered during his PhD that a certain progenitor cell in the cochlea - the LGR5 cell - was the progenitor cell during development (i.e. in the uterus) responsible for going on to become a hair cell. This was an important discovery, as it was not previously known “which cell became what”. These progenitor cells divide and replicate until there are enough hair cells, and the process is self-limiting in that once the 15,000 hair cells found in the human ear have been produced, the division and replication stops. This is important, because you would otherwise have a cancer risk, but this is nature we are talking about. The LGR5 cells continue to remain in the cochlea after birth, but the cell signalling required for them to continue to divide and replicate has been “switched off”. This is in contrast to birds and other animals, where the cell signalling remains.

Around this same time, another researcher, Xaiolei Yin, working in the same lab, had been doing some [research on the lining of the intestine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3951815/). Many do not know this, but the human intestine is one of the few regenerative tissues in the body - it replenishes every 5 to 7 days. Xaiolei Yin was able to show that this regeneration was down to the exact same type of progenitor cell – the LGR5 cell. The difference between the LGR5 cells in the intestine and in the cochlea was that the intestine was accompanied by something else called a Paneth cell, which provides the cell signalling required to “turn on” the LGR5 cells. No such cells exist in the cochlea. Xaiolei Yin, however, was able to show that if you used two small molecules – CHIR (a proprietary molecule) and VPA (valproic acid) – you could replicate the effect of Paneth cells on LGR5 cells in the absence of Paneth cells. [Will McLean took this idea and applied it to his cochlea research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124717301365). By applying VPA and CHIR, Will McLean was able to completely regenerate hair cells in mice and human cochlea ex vivo. Moreover, this process too was shown to be self-limiting: a key requirement in terms of cancer concerns. Finally, Will and his team were able to show that this method allowed them to regenerate 2000x more cells than previous research attempts.

In short, they were able to “switch on” the body’s innate ability to regenerate itself. This is when [Frequency Therapeutics](https://www.frequencytx.com/) was born.

Fun Fact: Will McLean used to post on reddit many years ago as PhD student while doing his research into progenitor cells and used to post regularly in hearing loss and tinnitus forums about the work he was doing in his lab.

**Previous attempts and how FX-322 is different from the competition.**

As mentioned above, previous attempts have consisted of retrofitting stem cells and other experimental approaches. Frequency does have some competition from other biotech firms, namely [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com/), [Regain](https://www.regainyourhearing.eu/) and [Pipeline Therapeutics](https://www.pipelinetherapeutics.com/).

\[Imgur\]([https://imgur.com/AewCyUu](https://imgur.com/AewCyUu))

These companies have a similar approach to Frequency in that they too are trying to make use of progenitor cells but they all differ in one key way. These companies all use an approach called direct transdifferentiation, whereas Frequency Therapeutics use an approach called mitotic regeneration.

\[Imgur\]([https://imgur.com/4yzH814](https://imgur.com/4yzH814))

Using direct transdifferentiation, one can convert a progenitor cell into a hair cell. The problem is, once you do this, that original progenitor cell is gone – it has been depleted. In other words, the prospect of repeat treatment is zero. Frequency Therapeutics drug is different in that it induces the progenitor to asymmetrically divide into another progenitor cell and a hair cell, meaning that the original progenitor cell is never depleted – the equilibrium is maintained. The new hair cell then takes the place of the dead hair cell, which is absorbed and/or washed away by the body. This difference in drug philosophy has many implications, both from an effectiveness point of view and also a financial point of view, in that it allows for the same patient to receive multiple treatments if required.

If you recall, I also mentioned something above about drug delivery. The beauty of Frequency’s approach is that the procedure is extremely simple. It simply involves an injection through the eardrum using local anasthetic. The gel then diffuses from the middle ear to the inner ear through what's known as the round window, so the cochlea is never compromised. The molecules then do their thing.

So where are we now?

**Phase 1 results**

Frequency are due to release Phase 2 results any day now. All we have now to glean data from are the Phase 1 results.

I feel this is the point where most people have missed the value of this stock, in that they have totally misinterpreted the data and why this stock has gone under the radar the way it has.

Phase 1 trials are usually conducted with one thing in: safety. They rarely look into efficacy of the drug, as the sample is so small. However, Frequency did carry out some small efficacy research. At first glance, these results were somewhat underwhelming. Audiograms showed no statistically significant changes. Some 4/15 patients showed a minor blip at the very top of the audiogram – 8,000kHz – but again nothing to write home about. Furthermore, out of the 15 patients who received FX-322, only 6 showed improvements in their word recognition scores and only 4 of the 6 at a statistically significant level.

You’re probably now thinking I’ve just wasted your time. **Bear with me.**

There are a few things to note here. Firstly, audiograms only test for a range of frequencies. Humans can hear up to 20,000 Hz, but audiograms only test up to 8,000Hz – that’s less than half of the frequency range. Until recently, it had been suggested that the frequencies above 8,000 Hz were not important and of “academic interest” only, but for reasons that will soon become apparent, this is not the case at all. In any case, [check out this study.](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/47/23753) Secondly and most importantly, when one reads the actual study, it is made clear that only 6 of the 15 patients who received FX-322 had “headroom” to improve their word recognition scores. In other words, the scores of the other 9 patients were already so high, that it would be impossible to differentiate at a statistical or even clinically meaningful level whether an improvement in those high scores was down to re-test variability or the drug itself. So Frequency decided it was best to compare the 10 patients who had the headroom required for hearing improvement: 6 who received FX-322 and 4 who received placebo.

When Frequency did this, the results were staggering.

\[img\][https://i.imgur.com/pmZNvZo.png\[/img\]](https://i.imgur.com/pmZNvZo.png[/img])

Two patients saw their word scores more than double, while two other patients saw their words scores almost double. The other two patients also improved, albeit not at a statistically significant level. None of the patients who received placebo showed any such improvement.

*These patients were tested and retested over more than a year and their results remained (when accounting for re-test variability) at the end of the durability study, with the exception of only one patient who worsened below original baseline. We don't know why this one patient worsened, but one idea is that the false sense of security arising from their initial improvement may have resulted in them returning to dangerously noisy activity again (the new cells are equally prone to damage as the old ones)* ~~One patient~~ ~~did fall out of the statistically significant boundary but remained with a notably improved score.~~

The question then became: if these patients are improving their word scores, why are we not seeing it on the audiogram? Those investors left unimpressed by frequency’s results have suggested that either the sample size was too small while others have outright accused them of “p-hacking” (a very serious accusation). I personally believe the answer to be quite simple.

If you may recall, I said above that 4/15 patients did see a 10db improvement at 8,000 kHz. 10db may not sound like much, until you realise that the hearing loss scale is logarithmic. A 10db improvement means that sound sensitivity has improved 10-fold. But here is the pertinent point. Have a look below at the diagram of the cochlea.

\[Imgur\]([https://imgur.com/5pcsPFs](https://imgur.com/5pcsPFs))

You will notice that different parts of the cochlea are responsible for different frequencies. You will notice that the very top of the range - 20,000 Hz - coincides with an area of the cochlea called the round window. As you may recall, the round window is the entry point for FX-322. In other words, the very first cells that regenerate from the drug are in the very frequencies that audiograms do not traditionally test for. The hair cells responsible for these frequencies are also the “first to go” in human hearing, and therefore have the most amount of damage – and therefore the most amount of regeneration. This would also explain why some improvement was observed at 8,000kHz in that it was the highest frequency on the audiogram. The part of the cochlea responsible for this frequency is closer to the round window than any of the other frequencies on the standard audiogram. The idea then is that the improvement in word scores are down to improvements that cannot be measured on the audiogram. As a result, Phase 2 results are now measuring patients’ hearing using extended audiograms up to 16,000 Hz.

The problem is, this doesn't explain why improvements were not observed at lower frequencies. Frequency Therapeutics' own modelling has shown that the drug in its current dosage and form does not reach the majority of the lower frequencies measured on the audiogram:

\[Imgur\]([https://imgur.com/p8uQC5b](https://imgur.com/p8uQC5b))

This is a pharmacodynamics issue and would explain why improvements were not observed in the lower frequencies. It may, however, be resolved in Phase 2 for one of two reasons. Phase 2 is currently testing multiple doses, the idea being that not only does the drug reach deeper into the cochlea with more doses but also that, because less of the drug is likely to absorbed once the first “wave” of regeneration has occurred in higher frequencies, it means the drug will simply travel through to the lower frequencies without being immediately absorbed. It remains to be seen whether the drug will reach deeper into the cochlea, but ultimately this is something that can be improved down the line with a reformulation. Frequency only need to prove that the drug is safe, that it works in principle and that it gives a real quality of life improvement to take it to market. They can always reformulate the drug carrier - the gel - and bring an improved version a year later. We know this is possible because other companies, such as Otonomy, that are focusing on other ear-related conditions, such as Meniere's and genetic hearing loss, have developed a [sustained release delivery vehicle](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/otonomy-presents-data-on-breakthrough-ear-treatment-92658769.html) that can reach the lower frequencies of the cochlea.

As I said at the very beginning, the biggest issue is drug delivery. Frequency have not completely cracked that, but they seem to be on the right path.

**Phase 2 results**

Phase 2 results come out any day now. I believe we will see some phenomenal responses in the extended audiograms and some improvements in lower frequencies in the higher-dose cohorts. I also expect there to be some improvement if not resolution of other associated conditions, such as tinnitus. Although not mentioned in their study or above, [Frequency have been on the record saying that they have anecdotal cases of patients from the Phase 1 trial saying their tinnitus improved](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/transcript-tinnitus-talk-podcast-ep12-frequency-therapeutics.pdf). They have therefore added tinnitus as a secondary outcome measure.

**The team behind the product**

I’ve already mentioned two individuals who played a key role in developing FX-322. I now want to spend a moment talking about other people behind the company. There are many to pick from, but I will focus on just two. The first man is none other than [Robert Langer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Langer). Why should you care about this guy? Firstly, his forehead is brighter than my future, but more importantly, he is the most cited engineer of all time, the 4th most cited individual in history and he has participated in the founding of more than 40 biotech companies, including Moderna. He is also regarded as the founder of tissue engineering in regenerative medicine. This is a seriously big name to have and I do not for a moment believe he would be [part of this](https://www.frequencytx.com/people/robert-s-langer-scd-2/) unless he believed this drug is the beginning of something special.

The other man is someone called [Carl Lebel](https://www.frequencytx.com/people/%E2%80%A2carl-lebel-phd/), their chief development officer. Carl Lebel specialises in getting drugs approved by the FDA. He knows the process inside out and is someone you want on your team if you are trying to get your drug to market. However, the most pertinent point about Carl is that until he joined the company in 2018, [he was actually retired](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/transcript-tinnitus-talk-podcast-ep12-frequency-therapeutics.pdf). It wasn’t until he saw the product and data with his own eyes that he realised this was a boat he could not miss. When one considers that it takes, on average, 10 years to get a drug to market, this was a pretty big decision to make, and not one I think Carl would make unless he was confident this drug would indeed get to the market.

**The financials and potential market cap**

Like most start-up biotechs with no drug currently on the market, Frequency is, for now, [loss-making](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/freq/financials/cash-flow). Without cash and investors, this company is as dead as the hair cells in my ears. It looks like, however, that this should not be a problem for frequency, assuming they hit their targets. Following Phase 1 results, they came to a deal with Astellas for over half a billion dollars with an [80m upfront cash payment](https://investors.frequencytx.com/static-files/bd82e199-8b2c-4c35-9929-3d7ed4cbcfc2). The deal is contingent that Frequency hit certain milestones through their clinical trials and in return Astellas get the rights to license FX-322 outside the US, although Frequency Therapeutics will receive royalties for sales outside the US.

Institutional ownership amounts to 81% of current shares and big names include [Blackrock, Vanguard, Federated Hermes and others](https://fintel.io/so/us/freq#:~:text=Lucchino%20David%20L.&amp;text=Ownership%20and%20Shareholders-,Frequency%20Therapeutics%2C%20Inc.,a%20total%20of%2027%2C594%2C671%20shares).

In short, the company is well placed financially to get FX-322 to market, assuming the product lives up to expectations.

Recent appointments this year, including [Kevin Franck,](https://www.frequencytx.com/people/kevin-franck-phd/) who is responsible for strategic marketing and planning, and [Quentin McCubbin](https://investors.frequencytx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/frequency-therapeutics-appoints-quentin-mccubbin-phd-chief), are also positive signs that the Phase 2 data Frequency are sitting on is positive.

The last question from an investment point of view then becomes one of how big the market for this drug is.

Here’s just a few numbers for you. The global hearing aids market was recently measured at $8.9 billion and is projected to increase to over [$13 billion by 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/05/2153196/0/en/Global-Hearing-Aids-Market-worth-USD-13-38-Billion-at-8-2-CAGR-GN-Hearing-Launches-Revolutionary-New-Hearing-Aid-Named-ReSound-ONE.html). The cochlea implant market is valued currently just under [$1.7 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cochlear-implants-industry) and is projected to increase by approximately 10% every year until 2027. This would give an expected market cap for cochlea implants of over $3 billion and a combined hearing aid and cochlea implant market of over $16 billion by 2027. Frequency’s market cap is currently just under $1.4 billion. If you may recall, neither hearing aids or cochlea implants are ideal solutions. They only amplify the signal that’s left, they do not restore the signal that is lost - not to mention that aesthetically they are awful. The demand for a natural, regenerative treatment is high and the cost of hearing loss to the world economy is estimated to be approximately [$750 billion annually.](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/254659/9789241512046-eng.pdf;jsessionid=FA333887A741DE3503CF3A7F70231FF1?sequence=1)

Approximately 466 million people have hearing loss and the number is increasing exponentially due to the excessively noisy world we live in and increased use of portable sound devices.

Moreover, there is also the global tinnitus market. Some 32% of the US population has tinnitus - approx 100 million people. There is no cure for tinnitus currently and the size of this market as far as a treatment is concerned is pure speculation. For what it’s worth, current tinnitus treatment (such as TRT or CBT) currently costs the UK economy £750 million a year – approximately $1 billion a year. Given the UK has a population of 66 million, I can only imagine how big of a market there is for tinnitus worldwide. I should make it clear, however, that although the primary cause of tinnitus is hair cell death (resulting in misfiring neurons, producing a phantom signal), it is still speculation as to whether FX-322 will cure or treat the condition in these cases. The only evidence we have are the anecdotal cases from Phase 1, as well as the general anecdotal cases of patients with hearing aids and cochlea implants who see their tinnitus improve, suggesting then that the underlying cause is a loss of input.

Frequency Therapeutics also have another drug in their pipeline aimed at treating MS. Their aim is to regenerate the myelin sheath using the same small molecule approach. They are expected to announce this drug candidate for clinical trials later this year. The current MS market is valued at $25 billion and is expected to reach $40 billion by 2027.

Finally, Frequency Therapeutics, in their investor statement, have stated that their small molecule approach may have applications for many other diseases and conditions throughout the body.

**Conclusion**

I believe Frequency Therapeutics are at the pinnacle of a major medical breakthrough and I believe we may be seeing the leader of regenerative medicine in its infancy. I know I am personally and emotionally invested in this company, but I believe I have researched this company enough to know what I’m investing in. I urge others to do their own due diligence as well.

Phase 2 results will be announced end of Q1 2021, and with a [hearing conference taking place this Wednesday](https://www.tinnitustalk.com/attachments/event-schedule_fhhconference-pdf.43840/), which Frequency are sponsoring and presenting at, I believe those results could well be announced as soon as today or tomorrow.

Edit 3: Just clarified something about one patient in the durability study who not only lost stat sig but also worsened below baseline. Not something I think to worry about though, as there are two possible explanations for this. Either the patient had a false sense of security post-treatment and returned to dangerously noisy activity again, or the hair cells that were not only originally regenerated (most likely in the lower frequencies) continued to wear and tear until they died as well. I suspect it may have been a combination of both.

personalfinance,Waiter/Waitress Tip Out Deductions,"I've been asking around, and no one seems to know the answer to this question.

In the restaurant industry, it's common for waiters/waitresses to have to ""tip out"" support service staff. We pay bussers, hosts/hostesses, bartenders, etc. based on a set percentage of our GROSS SALES for the night. At many restaurants, this amount is small and isn't a big deal when it comes time for tax season. At some, like the restaurant my wife and I worked at this past year, it's a massive amount of cash that we pay out every night (6% of our gross sales).

This is the tax issue: we are taxed based on our GROSS TIPS **BEFORE** we have paid the other staff 6% of our nightly SALES. For example, if I make $200 in tips for the day (about 20% of my $1000 in sales), the federal income tax (12%) taken out of my paycheck is $24. Before I take home my tip money, I then have to pay 6% of my GROSS SALES to other employees. On a night where I grossed $200 in TIPS, 6% of my SALES would be around $60 of lost income. So, while my income tax is calculated based on $200 of earnings, my real income for the night would only be $140. The federal income tax (12%) I SHOULD pay on my $140 night is really $16.80, so I'm overpaying $7.20 on federal income tax alone for this one hypothetical night.

We kept our payment receipts from every night we worked that prove the amount we were taxed on and show exactly how much was paid from our income to other employees.

With the combined income between me and my wife totaling over $20k this past year at the restaurant, we will end up overpaying thousands in taxes if we can't figure out how to deduct our tip outs from our income. I know a lot of people hate the service industry because of how many people end up underpaying taxes on their income, but my wife and I will end up overpaying an amount that we really can't afford unless someone is able to help us figure out how to deduct these tip outs from our income.

personalfinance,Reality Check - Can we afford this house?,"Hi everyone, this is a throwaway account - just looking for some advice on affordability with our specific situation. We found the perfect house, unfortunately it doesn't fit into our perfect budget. Aside from being assured that we can afford this house by our lender and a few other people we trust, our guts are telling us this is a bad idea. My spouse's income is rock steady and will increase every year; mine is more turbulent (freelancer) but I've been averaging $5k/month net for the last few years - it feels more difficult to count on this. We're currently renting, and own two rental properties.

**Mortgage:**

Purchase price – $1.3m

Down payment - $100,000

(Using a VA loan, so very low interest and no PMI)

Total estimate payment including property taxes + insurance: \~$6,200

**Income:**

After taxes and retirement - \~$15,000 month

Rental properties: $4200 month

**Savings:**

Retirement: \~$900,000

Available cash: $200,000

**Equity:**

2 rental properties: \~$400,000

**Debt:**

2 rental prop Mortgages: $3400 month

**Expenses:**

Don't want to get too detailed here as there are things we know we can cut back on, but on average we spend about $4k/month on food, bills, transport, utilities, entertainment, etc. This does not include the mortgages for the rental properties. No student loans, no car payments, no kids.

The house needs some work - it's liveable, but we want to upgrade things to our taste including big ticket items like kitchen + baths. When we boil it down, we can't get away from the fact that we'll most likely be spending close to half our take-home on the house (mortgage, taxes, utilities, maintenance, etc). It feels like too much and goes against everything I've been told, but then again our retirement plans include a great pension (plus the $2m minimum we have targeted in savings) and we aren't having kids - so the other half of our brains say buy it now while the interest rates are low.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 15, 2021. Please enjoy!","Stocks rallied on Monday after a choppy day, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) closing at new record levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered some lost ground as market participants continue to balance optimism regarding economic growth against rising Treasury yields.

Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to hover near one-year highs at 1.607%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, “The pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.” 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital in order to fuel their growth and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

personalfinance,Help evaluating HELOC offer,"Location: Minneapolis, MN, USA -- if it matters.

Hi everyone. I am in the market for a home equity line of credit for a duplex I recently purchased, and I am looking for advice on an offer of credit I received. Basically, it looks good to me, but I don't know the market and I am wondering if I should look around for a better deal or not.

The duplex needs work and I've been doing projects to fix things up, but I don't have enough cash to do everything I want to do. The duplex is not really an investment property: I live in one unit and I rent the other to a family member at a steep discount. It was appraised for $330k and I owe about $235k on a mortgage. I have about 30-50k worth of updates I want to do, and after that the house should be how I want it. My credit is good (\~790), so I applied for a HELOC to fill the gap at my local credit union. They are offering a 10-year draw period with no repayment period, so I will have to have everything paid off within 10 years, which is fine with me. I do have the option to pay interest only, which is great because I have a $750 monthly payment that will end in about 18 months -- my thought is that I can do whatever updates I want and pay interest only until those payments end, and then figure one what I need to pay monthly to get the line paid off in time and start paying that much. The interest rate is variable at prime + 1.25, which comes to 4.5% at the moment, and closing costs are $500. It's a $50,000 line of credit on top of my mortgage, bringing me to about 88% LTV if I access the whole amount, which is not certain.

Personal info: other than the $750/month I'm paying (which is for heating system upgrades for this house installed shortly after the purchase), I have no debt. I have about $25,000 in liquid funds between checking, savings, and brokerage.

This offer basically works for me, but again I don't know the market. Am I likely to find a substantially better deal if I shop around or should I just go with this? Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,"Credit Card Denied For ""High Risk Source Of Application"" - What Does That Mean?","I apologize for the long post but I'm sure this has happened or will happen to at least one other person and boy, lemme tell you, it is infuriating. I'm just hoping people will be able to find this if we can get any useful information.

**tl;dr:**

Despite excellent credit history, I was instantly denied by Synchrony Bank for a new credit card (I've *never* been instantly denied before). The reason given was ""high risk source of application"", which I am not (if it's even referring to me). Phone support *cannot* help or explain (they don't even have access to the information), I don't have any history with Synchrony Bank, and I don't have any fraud nor red flags on any credit report (checked *after* I applied for this card). In fact, Synchrony didn't even pull my credit; I was denied flatly with no further information. So what the hell does ""high risk source of application"" mean?

**Long post:**

I recently applied for a new credit card (B&amp;H Payboo) which is issued through Synchrony Bank. I have pretty good credit; 805 credit score, &gt;$100k total limit, 100% on-time payments, etc. I don't get denied often, and when I do it is *always* after manual review (the ""we'll send you a letter in 7-10 days letting you know"" thing).

But that didn't happen this time. I was instantly denied, right in the browser. In a decade of applying for, receiving, and occasionally being reject for credit cards, I have *never* been instantly denied. So that was my first clue something was wrong here. They said they'd send a letter with the reason for the decision. Good, I hope they can offer an explanation. After eagerly awaiting the letter, I take it out and the reason given was ""high risk source of application"". Clear as mud. I'm not high risk, obviously, so the reason must be something else.

To figure out what it means, I called Synchrony (which utilizes an understaffed call center in India for their front-facing customer service - awful experience) and after waiting 45 minutes, was transferred to their US applications support team. Very friendly lady pulls up my application and gives me some info:

- Synchrony does not expand on any of their credit decisions for phone (or any other) representatives to explain what the reasoning for a decision actually means. Not ""support agents can see the info but aren't allowed to share""; it is literally ""the agents do not have access to any further information, period.""

- Synchrony does not have a reconsideration line, nor do they do credit reconsiderations.

- Synchrony provides no information for the representatives, no recourse, and no one to contact in the event your credit decision has an entirely meaningless description like ""high risk source of application."" If the person you talk to on the phone can't help you, there is *no one else* to talk to. Brick wall. End of story.

I felt bad for the woman helping me because I'm certain I was bringing down her metrics with such a long call - it's not her fault Synchrony's management makes it (in this case, literally) impossible for the phone team to help. All we could do was brainstorm what the hell ""high risk source of application"" means. The best we could come up with was either 1) remarks on a credit report of previous identity theft, etc or 2) extremely negative history with Synchrony Bank to the point of not even needing to pull a credit report for them to say no. Well, my credit report from all 3 bureaus is completely clean - checked more than a week *after* the application, so it's more up to date than what they could've pulled - and I've never had any credit or even an application for credit with Synchrony before.

She pointed out that there should be a credit bureau listed on the letter, and maybe calling them to figure out what information Synchrony received or if *they* would have any explanation for ""high risk source of application"". I let her know there wasn't any credit bureau listed on the decision letter *at all* - meaning they didn't even pull my credit before instantly denying me. Which leaves the only option as ""such poor history with Synchrony that they don't even bother pulling your credit and just auto-deny you"".

But I pulled all 3 credit reports a week after the application, and (I already knew this but verified it again) I have never done business with Synchrony. At all. There is no connection. Not even a fraudulent application.

In short, I have no idea what it means or why I was denied. Synchrony's own support representatives don't know what it means. There is no one to contact at Synchrony who can tell me what it means - even if they *wanted to* they are literally unable to access any information on the decision. Does anyone have *any* idea what ""high risk source of application"" means?",finance
personalfinance,Optimal Mortgage Strategy - Need your thoughts!,"My wife and I are on the warpath to buying our first place. I have few scenarios that I have been working through but after staring at the numbers for a while I feel like I need to throw it out to you smart bunch to gut-check and see if you spot something I am missing.

**TLDR:  I'm looking at the best strategy to maximize our maximum purchase price given a few variables**. 

I apologize in advance for the long post. If you make it to the end, you're my hero.

**Background**

**Market: We're in Vancouver, BC**. 

Housing has always been stupid expensive here but between the market lull in condos caused by COVID and the historically low lending rates, now is a better time than never. As COVID restrictions are lifting and lending rates are creeping up, the housing market here is starting to heat up fast, so we're looking to make some moves ASAP.

As the market is heating up, sales have been all over the place (both under and over asking) but, in general, the more sought after places are going above asking (5-10% above). Because the market is heating up I want to give ourselves as much headroom as I can to be able to make competitive offers (but obviously still within what I think the place is actually worth).

We're looking at 2 bedroom units that either have good potential for a value bump with renos or are already great to just live in now - we're cool either way. For either case, there seems to be a sharp inflection in quality, location and nice-to-haves once you get above $720K-760K, with the odd gem down in the $680K-720K range. Places on the upper end of the inflection point will likely have better appreciation down the road and have the potential to be better investment vehicles.

We plan to stay in this new place for 5 years and then look at getting into a townhouse with a yard once that market cools off a bit.

**Income**

My questions for you all aren't about affordability but I will include this here for additional context. My wife makes $94,000/year and, before COVID, I typically made $130,000+. COVID changed my employment situation and also made me question my career path. I recently started working for my friend's company in a fun, relaxing position for $72,000+ while I recalibrate my path and start chasing down the big money again. I will be targeting positions in the $150K+ range starting late 2021.

BECAUSE I am in a career transition, we've opted to do a mortgage pre-approval **only using my wife's income**. We could add my name to the title to increase our pre-approved amount but it's complicated - and complicated is not an advantage as the market heats up. 

In short, the condos we are targeting are well within our means and we are able/comfortable spending more, however, our total mortgage amount is limited due to only using one income.

**Other Finances**

* We have a contingency fund, RRSPs, etc that *we will not* be touching for this process. 
* We have $230K cash for a down payment 
* We already have an amount set aside for closing costs, so I'm not including it in the discussion.
* We have an additional $107K in a term deposit maturing within the next week. My MIL has mental health issues, so we put together that $107K fund as a contingency in the event she needs to be put into a care-facility and to cover costs while we sort out her finances/assets. That amount is actually overkill for its purpose but we gave it a very healthy margin.
* MIL has been stable for a number of years, so we **CAN** use *some or all* of that $107K amount but we would want to replenish that fund within 5 years. That said, I would ideally prefer to touch as little of this fund as possible.

**Mortgage Options (Note: all options already take into account condos fees, property tax, etc)**

All options are over 30 years. The cost to borrow is so low at the moment that I can move the additional amount we'd pay with a shorter amortization toward our other investments that have a much higher rate of return.

**Option 1** 

* 5-year Fixed Rate @ 1.84%, $495,000
* This gives us a soft cap of $725,000 and a hard cap of $832,000
* Monthly payments would be $1790 with up to an additional $1667/month if we need to replenish that MIL fund... but that's also up to $1667/month we're not saving toward our other goals
* This allows us to search for places at the lower-end of that mid-$700K inflection point, with the fund allowing us to either be more competitive or give us more options to bid on in the higher end of the inflection point.

**Option 2** 

* 5-year Fixed Rate @ 2.39%, $575,000
* This is through a credit union who can use a lower qualifying rate than traditional banks
* This gives us a soft cap of $805,000 that gets us over the awkward inflection point without tapping into our other fund
* Monthly payments would be $2239
* While the monthly payment is higher, this would allow us to maintain our other fund AND continue saving more toward our other goals
* In addition, if we maintain our $107K fund in an investment vehicle that provides in interest rate of 2.9% or more, the interest earned would more than offset the additional interest paid over the 5-year term of the mortgage
* This option also comes with the peace of mind of having that $107K fund intact

**Option 3** 

* 5-year Variable Rate @ 1.45%, $495,000
* Same as Option 1, this gives us a soft cap of $725,000 and a hard cap of $832,000
* Monthly payments would be $1696
* If we target the same effective monthly payment as Option 1, the reduced mortgage payment allows us to increase our extra payments toward the principle or toward our MIL fund (if we tapped into it).
* After running through a few scenarios, variable rates would need to stay below 1.84% for at least 52 months for this option to really make sense and we run the risk of locking into a fixed rate higher than Option 2. Recovery from COVID makes be think that rates will above that level late-2022/2023.

**Option 4**

* 5-year Fixed Rate @ 1.84%, $765,000
* Basically the exact same as Option 1 but it would include my income from my interim job
* This would give a cap of $995,000, though we would only use what we would need to get past the awkward mid 700K inflection point without needing to touch the MIL fund
* The downside to this approach is that the lender will need to do a lot more due diligence, will require additional info from my current employer/friend (justifying why I have no probation period) and, in general, drag out the time needed to close.
* Slower closing times have been a deciding factor in the current market, so this approach could dramatically reduce our competitiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

While it feels counter-intuitive to pick the option with the higher interest rate, my gut feeling is that Option 2 meets the goal of getting over the price-quality inflection point hump while keeping us in a position to save and be less concerned about rebuilding the MIL fund.

Thoughts?

vet,Insurance awareness for veterinary,"Hello all!

How you are doing well! My wife will soon be a veterinary upon graduation and I'm very excited for her. However, one thing that caught my attention is the little training she received during school regarding personal finance, particularly about personal insurance, contrary to medical school students.

This strikes me because being an insurance professional who works on developing life/disability insurance products to protect people with various need, I see that veterinaries are exposed to the similar risks as physicians, if not higher given the contacts with animals (who may not be in a good mood being treated), with similar amount of debts from student loans.

However, the statistics showed that the % of veterinaries who took on personal disability income protection are significantly lower *(30% of vets have personal disability policies, I don't have the data on group disability which can be bought from AVMA)* than physicians *(80%+ of physicians have personal disability policies, \~30% bought group disability policies from AMA)*. One thing I learned by talking to medical students is the amount of training they received during the school years regarding financial planning and personal finance.

Obviously, my wife's situation may not be representative, and I'm hoping to get some firsthand response on your situations and thought process, to get a better picture of the situation. If you have 3-5 minutes, I will really appreciate you can fill out a brief survey:

personalfinance,Any advice for a small windfall?,"Hello PF community,

I would love to hear your thoughts regarding my situation. I am in my mid-20s with an incredible amount of student debt (\~240k) and a decent salary (\~175k gross annual). Throughout the duration of the federal interest forbearance I have saved around 60k to payoff my loans.

However, I recently came into a windfall of around $200k from a family member. The current interest forbearance is set to expire in September 2021 and payments will resume in October/November. The interest rates for my student loans are broken down as follows:

$122k is at about 6.8% (unsubsidized)

$90k is at about 5.8% (unsubsidized)

$28k is at about 4% (subsidized)

Now my question is, with about 7/8 months before payments are to resume, what would you recommend that I do with the $260k? I have had thoughts about sticking it in an ETF (such as VOO) to just let it grow as much as possible before liquidating and paying off my loans. However, in fear of an incoming market correction or general pessimism about the market I do not want to shrink or destroy my chance at paying off my debt in one fell swoop.

If it aids your advice at all, I already have a $30k emergency fund (apart from the amount that I mentioned above) and am currently maxing out my 401k. A future goal is to buy a home sometime in Q3 2022.

personalfinance,Question about charging nanny cost to dependent FSA,"We are directly employing a nanny in Pennsylvania.

personalfinance,"How to calculate total taxes due next year - including credits and breaks, etc.","Just did my taxes using one of the many online self-serve platforms. I have two w4 jobs and a few children. One of my w4 jobs, I take all the benefits, and take 4 allowances (smaller bu-weekly pay). The other w4 job, I decline all benefits and take 10 or 12 allowances (can't remember the exact number). Have been in this exact scenario for 3 fiscal years.

Doing taxes this year, my federal refund due after the first w2 was $15K. After entering the second w2, the refund due went down to $2K. After entering children info, mortgage interest, etc. I ended up getting \~$5K refund.

My question: other than eye balling the allowance values on the w4s, how can I pre-calculate those numbers so my bi-weekly paychecks are as high as they can be so that next year I get no refund, but also pay nothing (that is, the precise amount is withheld)? Even if I'm +/- $3-500, I'd be happy.

**EDIT**

I was not aware that allowances are gone. I'm glad I'm asking this now. So with allowances being gone, does that mean a more accurate amount will be withheld?

Again, what I'm trying to do is to anticipate the things I know will lower my taxable income (children, mortgage, charitable donations, tuition, etc.), so I'd like to do the equivalent of having less money withheld per paycheck.

*Issues I have*

Car gets poor gas mileage (12 - 15 mpg), with around 2k repairs, and 3k of regret upgrades put in. I really enjoy the car, and would rather not sell it.

--
Rent I can get down to around 1400/month come October. I rented closer to work expecting a commute, however WFH has been the standard. Thus the extra cost feels wasted currently.

--
*Goals*

Emergency fund - 15k for around 4 months of expenses (job in high demand)

Save up for down payment

Contribute to Roth IRA - I've stopped since the pandemic started

--
**Advice needed**

I’d like to save up for a house. Prices around here are very expensive, 350k will get you something decent if you’re around an hour from the city. I’ve been looking into other forms of mortgages, though I’d rather not have mortgage insurance. Ideally all extra income from freelance goes towards this. 2 + family houses are lucrative, and I would put in the work, but for a good location they’re at around 450-600k. 

--
Having my own place, among other things, would allow me to do recreational activities (woodworking, MMA) which I value highly. 

**TLDR**


After paying off my credit card debt, should I continue paying the minimum on my loans (as all but one are at 4% or lower interest rate) and save up for a down payment, or focus on paying off my loans? I want to get a house within 2.5 years, but not sure if that’s doable. Food is high due to a restricted diet, though I can probably get that lower. After October I plan to rent for at most 1400 per month.",finance

EDIT: Just wanted to summarize some of the comments. Apparently, Credit Karma Tax isn’t free for every tax situation, but it does cover most of them. There’s also been some bugs with it that other comments have pointed out. For me, it worked great and was super easy, but you may decide a different service like FreeTaxUSA is more your style.

[Session 5 Notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m3ygkx/taking_genslers_blockchain_and_money_mit_course/)

Given what's going on financially and macroeconomically in this moment in time (inflation, retail vs institutional battles, etc), I'm going through [Gary Gensler's (Biden's SEC chair nominee) MIT course ""Blockchain and Money.""](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/index.htm) Ever since I heard that Biden's pick for the SEC had previously taught a blockchain course, I've been interested in checking it out. I'm also curious to pick up on any hints as to Gensler's 2018 attitude on crypto along the way...(spoiler alert: in the intro lecture he said he would put himself on the ""center-minimalist"" part of the minimalist-maximalist spectrum.)

I'm sharing my personal notes on here as I go through the lectures. It might spark some good conversation, and I'm sure some of you are curious about the course too, but might not want to watch 25 hours of lectures.

FYI, all the source material is at the link above...lectures, slides, assigned readings, etc. The notes are just a way to share the things that stood out to me the most, and maybe save you all some time.

One more FYI - I'm definitely interested in Gensler's personal views on crypto, but the notes I'm sharing here are more just about the actual course subject matter.

**Session 6: Smart Contracts and dApps**

* **Smart contracts:** set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols, within which the parties perform on these promises (Szabo 1996), not AI, may or may not be legal ""contracts""
* Bitcoin and Ethereum have same cryptographic design features
* Ethereum has more than 1 Merkle tree (BTC has 1)
* Ethereum does not have transaction script or UTXO, uses state transitions, account-based, 7 languages
* Bitcoin is transaction ledger, Ethereum is balance ledger
* **Bitcoin:** Nakamoto January 2009, non-Turing (script), ledger (UTXO, transaction), Merkle trees (transactions), 10 minute blocks, SHA256, mining = ASIC, hashrate = 54 exahash/second, no presale, 12.5 BTC per block in 2018, monetary policy (halves every 210,000 blocks or 4 years, set to be immutable, voluntary fees)
* **Ethereum:** Buterin July 2015 (was a journalist writing about BTC), Turing complete (Solidity, Serpent, LLL, Mutan), state - account based, Merkle trees (transactions, state ,storage, receipts (with nonces)), 14 second blocks, Ethash (still based on elliptic curves but different than SHA256), mining = GPU (more decentralized than ASIC), hashrate = 260 terahash per second, ICO and prerelease of 72 million ETH (2018 SEC said it was decentralized enough to not be a security, raised $18 million), 3 ETH per block, monetary policy changes by updates/proposals, needed and market-based fees, higher inflation rate
* Core developers can propose to nodes to make a change, core of Ethereum is highly concentrated around Ethereum Foundation, Consensys, active advocacy to bring down inflation rate
* **Smart contract platforms in 2018:** Ethereum (2015, $22 billion 2018 market value), EOS (2018, $5B in 2018, $4.2B year-long ICO, venture funding arm to encourage development on platform), NEO (2016, $1.1B, China, delegated BFT, supports wider range of code), Ethereum Classic (2016, $1.1B, DAO hard fork), LISK (2016, $360M, code in Java, uses side chains), Stratis (2017, $150M), NEO and EOS potentially faster and more scalable
* **Smart contract potential use cases:** digital identity, records, securities, trade finance, derivatives, financial data, mortgages, land title, supply chain, auto insurance, clinical trials, cancer research, none have taken off yet
* **Multi-language:** more development of apps
* **Single language:** fewer vulnerabilities to attack or outage
* Gensler more into multi-language, ""democratizing access to capital""
* **Decentralized applications (dApps):** run on decentralized blockchain network, **generally** have native token and run as smart contract on top of a platform, can run dApps based on underlying token also, most active = gaming/gambling/exchanges/finance (still small numbers of daily users)
* **Initial coin offerings:** crowdfunding for investment and consumption, proceeds used to build networks, tokens usually issued prior to being functional, development is open source but largely centralized, promoters get ""premined"" tokens, tokens fungible and transferable, scarcity with preset ""monetary policy,"" profits through appreciation, $28B ICO $ raised through August 2018, 2000 to 3000 of 4500 ICOs were able to raise money, 59% fail within first 9 months, 25% to 75% are scams
* **Smart contract legal issues:** performance for performance understanding of ""contract,"" terms can be express and implied, implied by a legal system (which means they have an interest in your contract), state is 3rd party along with promisor and promisee (state cares about kinds of contract, effect of contract, terms of contract, taxation of contract)
* What is effect of digital rights management on copyright law? Code becomes part of law
* Relationship between policy that the law wants and policy of the technology
* Smart contracts can enable transactions that can hide from law
* Objective of contract law is to **allocate** risk, not eliminate, price risk allocation, delivery risk allocation, allocation only matters with a system to process the breach of a contract (enforcement, typically legal system, this is where technical infrastructure could really benefit developing nations with limited legal systems)
* **Key value of smart contracts:** substitute for failed legal systems, infrastructure of legal system, enable contracts where transaction costs otherwise too high, ""no touch products""
* **Transaction costs:** system costs (less developed legal systems), contract costs
* Obscurity is often a value, every miniscule term doesn't need to be defined, can be determined by judge if needed, ambiguity is a way to negotiate ex post (after the fact, using the court), should smart contracts be used when we want/need some degree of ambiguity? cost of specifying all decisions in a tree could be higher than the benefit of smart contract, don't yet have a good way to ""fake"" ambiguity
* Boilerplate specifying choice of law/jurisdiction, fairly standardized, can plug in automatically
* Code can be more verifiable than interpreting contract language
* Naive to think code will operate outside of real-world legal structure
* Need to muster political will to break lawyers' monopoly, no reason for 90% of what lawyers do to be done by them, get lawyers to focus on hard cases
* E-signature legal framework still works for smart contracts
* Lawyers have to become technically sophisticated to read code like they read legal contracts, need to be able to think creatively about it, cultural problem

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. 

Let's go....

Newly covered today:  

1. Today is staking rewards day for Epoch 253!  Let’s get those duckets!
2. Cardano is getting a disproportionate cut of the attention market compared to its CMC neighbors. [https://twitter.com/CardanoRise/status/1371431289895665665](https://twitter.com/CardanoRise/status/1371431289895665665)
3. “Ask the Doctor” is switching from ERC-20 to Cardano. Note that Ask the Doctor is linked to FD7 Ventures in Item 7 below.

4. We get another People of Input Output Global video.  This one features Dan Friedman. He currently lives in Japan.  But, the interview starts off with some very interesting stories about his youth in 1980s Kiev, Ukraine.  His speaking and story-telling style is similar to the ""Captain"" character in a 1990s buddy cop movie (in a good way). Very interesting and compelling guy. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1371574441637937153](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1371574441637937153)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying "" Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

2. Famed crypto enthusiast and billionaire Mike Novogratz asks the Cardano world ""Can anyone make a real bull case for [$ADA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=cashtag_click)? Does anyone build on it? Use it? Why is market cap so high? Should it be a funding asset? It’s one of the few cryptos I haven’t traded in my life.""

8. Charles will be speaking at the Blockchain Africa Conference next week which may or may not give us more clues as to the African Bird announcement. [https://blockchainafrica.co/](https://blockchainafrica.co/) 
9. SingularityNet collaboration with Cardano going down. How else is Skynet gonna pay the Terminators? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ) [https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos)
10. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
11. What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?

12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh.

14. Charles claimed Elon was trolling Cardano with “meta for k” on twitter. Can anyone argue one way or another on this? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1364350825271685122](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1364350825271685122)

16. Possible Soulja Boy Cardano collab on NFT. Maybe Soulja Boy could be best brohs with Charles and Stephen Wolfram broh? [https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907](https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907)
17. Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark. Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

35. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have a hairline that is even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.

37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum).

45. Cardano uses a tiny fraction of the energy some other top-ten blockchains use.   This factoid alone should allow you to hook up with eco-obsessed nature people. [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875)

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

yesterday i tried to do my taxes trying both websites. 
Turbotax has the ability to log into my other stock and bank accounts which made it easier. But 
Freetax USA wanted me to fill everything manually which was hard. 

Is there a trick to FreeUSA to log in into other accounts that I don’t know about? 
Also another question why the difference in the refund between both websites 
. Free tax USA gave me initial federal refund of 200$ more than turbo tax even though i entered same W2 in both. 

IS there tax app better than those 2 but has the ability to log into other accounts?

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-16-2021.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs again

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month’s record high close.

&gt; * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

*****

&gt; # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

&gt; * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government’s February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed’s extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation’s central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

&gt; # 3. Moderna studies Covid vaccine in kids; more countries halt AstraZeneca

&gt; * Moderna has started testing its Covid vaccine in children ranging in age from six months to less than 12 years old. The mid-to-late stage study intends to enroll about 6,750 kids in the U.S. and Canada. In a separate study, which began in December, Moderna is also testing its vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years old. The two-shot vaccine has already been authorized for emergency use in Americans 18 and older.

&gt; * Sweden and Latvia on Tuesday joined a fast-growing list of European nations suspending use of AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine as health regulators proceed with a new review into its side effects after reports of blood clots. Germany, France, Italy and Spain on Monday said they would all stop administering it. However, the World Health Organization and Europe’s drug regulator have recommended that countries continue to use AstraZeneca’s two-shot regimen.

&gt; # 4. Regulators investigating ‘violent’ Tesla crash; Autopilot not ruled out yet

&gt; * The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating what it calls “violent” crash involving a Tesla sedan and a tractor trailer last week in Detroit. Authorities have not yet said whether the electric car maker’s Autopilot, Full Self-Driving or FSD beta may have contributed to the accident. The NHTSA has previously embarked on probes into more than a dozen crashes that were thought to involve Tesla’s advanced driver assist systems.

&gt; # 5. OxyContin maker Purdue proposes $10 billion plan to exit bankruptcy

&gt; * OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is proposing a $10 billion plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Those efforts would include a significant boost, more than $4 billion, from members of the Sackler family who own the Connecticut-based company. Court documents show Purdue officials continued to push to maintain sales of OxyContin even as it became clear the drug was being abused. Complicated litigation is playing out in courts across the country in efforts to hold the drug industry accountable for the nation’s opioid crisis.

personalfinance,Car Loan vs Student Loans,"A family member is going blind and can no longer drive their 2019 car that's in great condition. I've decided to purchase it from them and had originally planned to take out a loan which I've been pre-approved for with a rate of 2.45%. Here's where I'm hesitating - the past year I haven't had to pay off any of my student loans, but I've been putting the money aside anyways. I figure that in an emergency, it's good to have it around but once interest starts accruing again my plan was to throw it all in there if nothing came up. It just so happens that the amount I would have been paying (I have been trying to pay them off pretty aggressively) is just about how much this car costs! So, I technically have the money right now (and a similar amount in savings). Part of me wonders if it would make more sense to not take out the loan and avoid paying any interest. By next September, I could re-evaluate and take out a smaller, personal loan if needed, still throw a bunch of money at my student loans...

I realize that a personal loan will probably have a higher rate and that rates in general will likely go up by September. There's also the possibility that some student debt could be forgiven at some point - I'm definitely not banking on that but even if 10 grand is a possibility that would be enough to justify avoiding another loan. Some of the federal student loans I've taken out have rates low or lower than the car loan and some of them are much higher. Am I being stupid for even thinking of this option or is it worth looking into?",finance
personalfinance,Should I cash in my 401k to clear high-interest credit card debt?,"I have a high interest rate on a credit card and it's one of the largest monthly bills I have to cover. Clearing it completely would allow me to contribute into my savings again in a way that I haven't really been able to do over the last two years. I have an old 401k from an employer who fired me and while I'm working on a contract now I have not been contributing to that account since being fired.

What I'm wondering is if it's worth it to just cash in that 401k and clear that debt so I can focus my budget on paying off my student loans and contributing to a savings/IRA. And if so, if anyone has advice on the most efficient way to cash that out I would certainly love to hear your thoughts!

\~ $12k in 19.99% APR credit card debt

Bitcoin,A question about institutions entering BTC,"So I've read a lot excitement about big institutions and companies entering BTC and crypto in general. In these posts many seem to think there is now a floor on BTC price and that the crashes aren't going to be so severe going further.

Isn't it in their very nature to not HODL like a retailer/enthuasist but rather get in cheap, ride the wave up, take profits, short and spread FUD, watch it all burn and repeat the cycle? Why are we thinking the sharks are going to be kind cryptoholders who will save us from the dips from here on out?

Isn't the ride gonna get rougher with these players in the game?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Early Retirement Question!,"New member here... forgive me if these questions have been asked before, the search feature is not working for me. I’m 27 and just recently decided to get serious about saving for retirement. The idea of retiring early is very intriguing, although, so to the fact that I enjoy what I do and the benefits it offers (pension, pay, etc), I plan to retire around the age of 45-50. My union DOES NOT offer a 401k match. 

I currently have no money saved for retirement specifically. I bring in about $45k/year (+\- depending on OT) after taxes. The only debt I have is my car and my student loans which total about $31k. I’m on track to pay my car off this year ($16k left). I have 3 months expenses in savings at the moment, as my job is pretty secure (union tradesman). After paying my car off, my monthly expenses total around $2,000. So needless to say, I should be able to start saving 50%+ of my income for retirement at the end of this year. I can currently renting at $1570/month, although my roommate pays $700 toward that. Housing is my area is stupid expensive, and don’t plan to buy until the market calms a bit. Also, my income will increase by 10% every year for the next 3 years. Then will remain rather still aside from yearly raises to adjust for inflation. 

1. What are my best investment options for withdrawing money before the age of 59.5?

2. Would it be worth it to hire a financial planner to deal with my money and investments? Or maybe get started with a robo-advisor for now? If so, any recommendations?

3. Should I focus on investing now rather than paying off my car first? My interest rate is 4.84% and It’s worth more than I owe.",finance
investing,US Cannabis is my highest conviction investment for the next 3-5 years (DD and analysis),"**General Overview**

*  We are at a time where investor demand has been proven in the cannabis sector, yet the stocks for the leading US companies in the space are difficult to buy and undervalued compared to their hyped Canadian counterparts. These US companies have much stronger balance sheets, are growing faster, get much less media attention/hype and trade for far lower multiples than their Canadian counterparts. Given that the USA is currently the largest cannabis market, both in legal and illegal sales, and is poised to become the global leader in legal cannabis, I truly see no other investment opportunity quite like this currently available in the market for the average retail investor. I firmly believe that the US cannabis market is one of the best investment opportunities for the upcoming 3-5 years and potentially longer.

**The Market:**

* The cannabis market consists of the plant and flower itself, topicals, oils, edibles, beverages, vaporizers/equipment as well as cultivation and real estate. While cannabis is a plant, it’s not really comparable to investing in crops like wheat, corn or other commodities. It’s more comparable to investing in wine rather than investing in grapes themselves. Just like the wine industry isn’t just about growing the grapes, or the tobacco industry isn’t just about growing leaf tobacco. These industries have some of the highest profit margins among consumer products. 

* Data from legal states and countries have reported a similar trend - cannabis flower is the top seller initially, while edibles/topicals and other alternate forms of cannabis are trending up and many experts believe that these will be the top sellers in the future. Many people will simply not smoke or vape anything, but would be open to trying cannabis in a food or topical form if it were available. 


**US Cannabis as an investor:**

* Since Cannabis is still illegal federally in the USA, these companies cannot trade on the major US exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ. They trade on the smaller Canadian stock exchange (CSE) and the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. This limits the volume and exposure that these stocks get and generally makes them less attractive to many investors, both retail and institutional. 
 
* The federal illegality of cannabis creates hurdles for US companies. These companies do not have access to traditional banking. This means they cannot accept debit or credit cards in stores and are largely cash businesses. Also, since cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, these companies must set up their entire operation for cultivation and retail in the states they operate in. Many of these companies have operations in multiple states, hence are termed “Multistate Operators” or MSOs. These companies are integrated vertically within the states they operate in, as they create, distribute and sell their own products.

* Finally, the lack of federal legality prevents access to investment banking and typical financing that is available to businesses. This prevents large institutional investors from investing in these MSOs, and makes large corporations such as big tobacco, pharma and alcohol unable to invest in these companies. 


**Haven’t we already missed the boat?**

* You may have heard of several major cannabis companies in the past and maybe even seen their stock have major run ups and felt like the ship has already sailed. I am here to tell you that there is an extremely high chance that you heard of a Canadian cannabis company, or Licensed Producer (LP) as they call them. This includes companies such as Canopy Growth Corp, Aphria, Tilray, Cronos, Sundial Growers, Aurora and Hexo. These are all Canadian companies that do not currently sell cannabis in the US. 

* It’s ironic that many of these Canadian companies, such as Canopy Growth, Tilray and Aphria, are able to be listed on the NASDAQ for the sole reason that they do not sell any cannabis in the USA, while the US cannabis companies are unable to be listed on major US exchanges for actually selling cannabis in the USA. With the major US listing comes major volume, media attention and increased access for both retail and institutional investors. For example, the Canadian companies can be traded on Robinhood, Webull, M1 Finance, Cash app, etc while the American ones cannot be found on those platforms. 


**Canada vs USA** 

* Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. With legalization, came benefits for these companies and access to traditional banking and investments, financing, availability for mergers, acquisitions, major joint venture deals and listing on major exchanges. 

* In 2020, Canada had $2.1B in cannabis sales. This is an increase of over 120% since 2019. Unfortunately, these numbers are underwhelming and speak to the poor implementation of legalization across the country and the low population in Canada. While this should improve over time, many of the Canadian cannabis companies are way overvalued and lose money year over year, only few of which have real plans for profitability. 

* Compared against Canada’s $2.1B in sales, Colorado had just over $2B in cannabis sales in 2020 alone, which pales in comparison to California’s $4.4B in cannabis sales that same year. 

* In 2020 alone, the USA had $18.3B of legal cannabis sales across recreational and medical states. For comparison, the illegal US sales were estimated to be around $60B in 2020. It’s expected that illegal sales will come down as legal sales increase and prices come down over time to match or beat the illegal market. 

* Legal sales of cannabis in the US are projected to hit $30b by 2025 while only considering states which have legalized or enacted medical laws prior to July of 2019, so this projection does not include states which have enacted cannabis reform since July of 2019 and makes no assumptions for more states to legalize or federal laws to change prior to 2025. 

* The states with legalized or medical cannabis are those in which the US MSOs are building market share and revenue. As of 2021, cannabis is legal 12 US states (California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Maine, Colorado, Nevada, Vermont, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Arizona), with 3 more states (Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota) having just voted to legalize in 2020, and Virginia just recently passing legalization to take effect in 2024.


* As we can see, there is ample room for growth both at the state level and federal level in the USA. Since the MSOs are vertically integrated within the states they operate in, they have higher gross margins and any changes on the federal level will only further benefit the efficiencies of these companies.



**Canada vs USA - The Numbers**

* Despite the US companies having higher growth, they carry a value many fold lower than their Canadian counterparts and have stronger balance sheets. To illustrate this, I have provided financial information on major Canadian and US cannabis companies below:

* [Canadian LPs](https://imgur.com/a/yCvRWw0)

* [US MSOs](https://imgur.com/a/rWfeax8)

* The difference is actually quite staggering. The average NTM TEV/REV for the Canadian LPs is 19x and only 7.4x for the US MSOs. Most of the Canadian LPs have negative forward PEs and EBITDAs, while most of the US MSOs have positive EBITDA at decent ratios to TEV and positive forward PEs. The rich multiples of Canadian LPs trading on the major exchanges is further proof of the investor demand for cannabis companies.



**Who are these US cannabis companies?**

I have provided some financial data for two of the largest US cannabis companies, Curaleaf and Truelieve. The point of this is to show that these companies are not fly-by-night operations that are on the verge of bankruptcy or insolvency. These companies are bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue each year with strong balance sheets, all while operating under the very limited federal establishment. 

**Curaleaf:** 

* Curaleaf has 101 retail locations, 23 cultivation sites and 30+ processing facilities across 23 US states, and holds #1 market share in legal or medical sales in many of them.
* 2020 revenue was $626m, up 183.5% YoY.
* Gross profit was $315.5m, up 266% YoY
* Adjusted EBITDA was $144.1M, up 556% YoY
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $1.2B with 53% gross margin and $365m EBITDA
* Curaleaf is the market leader in New York, a state which is widely expected to be legalizing cannabis in 2021. 

**Truelieve (as of Q3 2020):**

* Truelieve has a presence in 6 states, but is the market leader in Florida, which currently has medical use of cannabis, operating 66 stores in the state alone and serving over 383,000 patients just in Q3. 
* Florida is expected to vote on cannabis legalization in 2021.
* They are on track to do $515m in revenue in 2020, up 103.8% YoY with $253m.07 EBITDA, up 91% YoY.
* Expected gross margin for 2020 is 72%, up from 65% in 2019
* Estimated 2021 revenue of $825m, $375m EBITDA and 70% gross margin


**The bear cases**

***It’s just a plant, can’t people just grow it at home?***

* Of course it is possible to grow cannabis at home, but most people aren’t going to do that. You can also brew beer at home, but not many people do. It’s a nice hobby for enthusiasts, but not a real concern. 

***What about the Tobacco companies or Acquisitions/Mergers?***

* Investors who think that the major retail, food, alcohol or tobacco companies are going to take over and dominate after legalization are in for disappointment. These big, non-cannabis companies cannot even invest in the leaders of the current US cannabis market today.

* Even after legalization at the federal level, cannabis will be a tightly regulated substance. It will be quite some time before you see weed cigarettes sold at every gas station just like cigarettes. In the current system, states only hand out certain amount of licenses to cannabis retailers, and the leading US MSOs have these licenses and operations set up in the legal states. The most likely federal change would entail a curbing of regulations while leaving implementation up to the states, and this will only further benefit these existing US cannabis companies. While this will likely expand over time, there’s no reason to think that large non-cannabis companies would be able to enter the space shortly post-legalization and get sizable market share without acquiring or merging with one or several of the existing large players in the US market. 

* In the event of future acquisitions, the firm getting acquired typically gets a nice boost in the stock price. I’d rather be holding the cannabis company getting acquired than the big tobacco company doing the buying.

* I firmly believe that the best investment opportunity in the US cannabis market in terms of % return will be these leading US cannabis companies, not the existing tobacco/retail giants or the existing international cannabis companies. 



**Tailwinds and upcoming catalysts:**

* Approval for cannabis legalization has been on an uptrend among the population across all age groups and demographics. As of November 2020, Gallup reported 68% of Americans being in favor of legalization of cannabis. For reference, this same poll found only 34% approval in 2001.

* Democrats, Independents and Republicans are all in favor, with 76%, 68% and 51% approving legalization, respectively.
 
* The current administration and congress is the most supportive legislator of cannabis law reform that we have ever seen in this country. While federal legalization may still be a few years out, there are some other major legislative acts that would be huge steps for the market:

* The SAFE act: would allow banks to service cannabis-related companies in compliance with the state laws of their jurisdiction. This bill had 206 co-sponsors in the house and 33 co-sponsors in the Senate. It is currently under review by the Senate Banking Chairman, and the recent elections may put this back in the spotlight.

* The Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act: would decriminalize cannabis by removing it from the controlled substance act - this bill’s lead sponsor was then senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who is now the senate majority leader. 

* There are several other bills with varying levels of chances to be brought up or passed during this congressional session. The hope is that there will at least be changes to the banking laws through the SAFE act, or that cannabis will at least be moved from schedule 1 on the controlled substance list (indicating it has no medical value and is the same as heroin) to a lower schedule. 

* Even in the worst case of no federal action occurring under Biden, there are 9 states considering legal cannabis and 5 considering medical cannabis efforts in 2021, and more states will continue to enact laws opening them up as new markets over time until legalization at the federal level occurs. 

* Many people will outright just not risk using cannabis while it is still illegal in their region. As more states legalize and as federal laws relax, the total potential audience of cannabis users will rise, both in terms of current users and new users. 



**My Strategy:**

* I am a typical retail investor in the USA. I see so much growth opportunity in this market that instead of choosing specific companies, I chose to buy an ETF which holds only US cannabis companies. This is the MSOS ETF by AdvisorShares, and it’s the only one of its kind holding only US cannabis companies. This ETF trades on the NYSE, and as such, cannot actually hold shares of these US cannabis companies due to federal law. Instead, this ETF holds total return swap derivatives on the companies. These are contracts with institutions like Blackrock where they hold the shares, while MSOS takes all the risk and gain of the shares. It has the same effect as holding the actual shares, but allows MSOS to trade on the NYSE. They are the only ETF that offers this on the market. This fund is actively managed by fund manager Dan Ahrens, a very knowledgeable manager in the space that actually wrote the book on investing in the US cannabis industry. 


* I see this as an opportunity to invest in a market with massive growth potential and tailwinds before the floodgates of institutional and retail investors have really opened. Whether it takes 3, 5 or 10 years for federal legalization, I see continued growth in this market year over year as more states legalize, federal regulations get lifted and the companies become more efficient. 


**Discloser:**

*I am investing in the MSOS ETF as roughly 10-15% of my overall portfolio and plan to keep buying for the forseeable future. Cannabis is a volatile market with inherent risks, invest at your own discretion.*",finance

CryptoCurrency,An extensive list of earning strategies and DeFi protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem,"**Introduction.** DeFi is the future of finance with equal opportunities. Despite being at its inception, with currently more than $40 billion in total value locked (TVL) \[1\], there exist already plenty of opportunities for you to make your idle crypto tokens do the hard work for you to earn some interest. Some of the strategies offer a high risk-reward ratio, whereas some are rather safer. Many people do not know where to start with DeFi because the term itself is a buzzword (e.g., similar to the term BigData) with ambiguous meanings that get people easily lost. DeFi encapsulates various decentralized financial services whose functionality is immutable and persisted on (Ethereum) blockchain, which simply means these services are *accessible to anyone under the same rules and conditions*, which is a huge difference from traditional financial (tradFi) services. DeFi offers various strategies and this extensive guide should outline and uncover the most common earning strategies—including advantages and disadvantages—in the Ethereum ecosystem. The strategies proceed from the more mainstream and community-approved ones to more advanced ones, concluding with inspiring platforms and trends.

|\[+\] Low-risk strategy as this functionality is supported natively in the ETH protocol|\[-\] Inactivity penalties (rather low) for offline time, risk of slashing for misconfiguration|

**1.2 Staking ERC-20 tokens**

Tokens: *Aave (LEND) \[3\], Synthetix (SNX) \[4\], Sushi \[5\], Curve (CRV) \[6\], Badger \[7\], The Graph (GRT) \[8\], and many others...)*

    rewards: various, ranging from 3% APR

There exist many tokens on Ethereum that incentivize users to lock their tokens to earn staking rewards for various activities: computation (e.g., verifying transactions), asset collateralization, governance—or no activity at all (\~reward distribution tokens).

|\[+\] Earning interest on your favorite coins|\[-\] Risk of token price depreciation in projects that are not mainstream or that have a long-term token issuance scheme|
|:-|:-|


**2 LENDING**

dApps: *Compound \[9\], Aave\[10\]*

You can provide your tokens to be lent to borrowers at (usually variable) interest rates. Some exchanges and centralized services offer these services as well. Lending rewards are typically low for leading crypto projects (ETH, wBTC) but are very interesting for stablecoins.

**2.1 Stablecoin lending**

    rewards: 3–20% APR, up to 30% APY

You lock your stablecoins into a vault. All the tokens in the vault earn the same reward. The interest rate fluctuates depending on the demand. Usually, in bull markets, the APR is higher than in bear markets. The reward is around 3-20% APR but compounding these rewards can slightly improve the rates, supposing the provider offers in-built compounding solutions (otherwise it does not pay-off to pay the high TX fees to claim rewards repeatedly).

|\[+\] Better rates compared to tradFi, but essentially on the same asset (dollars)|\[+\] Low-risk strategy only depending on external factors (stablecoin losing peg)|
|:-|:-|
|\[+/-\] Stablecoins keep their price (disadvantage in bull markets, advantage in bear markets)||

**2.2 ETH, wETH, wBTC lending**

    rewards: 0.15–3% APR

Wrapped ETH (ETH is not ERC-20 token) and wrapped BTC (wBTC, renBTC) can be lend or staked to provide a yield that is in general rather low, but for holders with bigger stacks, it can be a very effective way to earn stable income on the two most mainstream cryptocurrencies.

|\[+\] You HODL your crypto and you get a small additional income|
|:-|


**3 LIQUIDITY PROVIDING**

dApps: *uniswap\[11\], sushi\[12\], 1inch\[13\], Loopring\[14\] (L2)*

    rewards: up to 100%´s APR (with rewards)

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) run automated liquidity pools in order to facilitate the swaps (i.e., exchange trades). Users can provide liquidity for a DEX-traded pair by locking both assets to the pool, at 1:1 volume at their current corresponding price ratio. By locking the assets, you are eligible to earn the fixed fees (around 0.3%) of every trade, proportional to your stake in the liquidity pool. It makes sense to lock assets that you want to hold anyways and in the long-term, e.g., ETH/stablecoin pairs. New pairs are very often incentivized in providing liquidity by offering rewards schemes.

|\[+\] Acquiring a reasonable proportion of the pool that has high trading volume can generate interesting profits|\[-\] Inter-pair token price fluctuations or decline to $0 lead to permanent and impermanent losses|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Many liquidity pools are incentivized by token providers or DEXes by additional token rewards that might severely boost the interest|\[-\] Pools with low or no liquidity provide unstable ratios|

**4 YIELD FARMING**

dApps: *yearn\[15\], curve\[6\], badger\[16\], harvest.finance\[17\], alphahomora\[18\] (leveraged farming), and many others...*

    rewards: up to 100%´s APY

In typical staking, lending, or liquidity-providing scenarios, there is no compounding. In other words, you have to claim your rewards manually to earn them and re-stake them to compound your interests.  Some of the farming protocols collect the rewards for you. Yield farming basically removes or socializes the transaction fees to claim the rewards, which means that your earned interest is continuously compounding which increases the APR (to APY) without the need of repeatedly interacting with the smart contract which is expensive. Some aggressive yield farming strategies focus on harvesting both yields AND rewards from various protocols and compound all of them, which can make them very profitable in short term.

|\[+\] Very high rewards (100+% APY is not problem)|\[-\] Some farmed assets cease to exist leaving you with permanent losses|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Farming aggregators (e.g., harvest.finance) offer multiple strategies and additionally offer interesting reward tokenomics|\[-\] Many strategies are short term only and are not worth paying high TX fees|

**5 MISCELLANEOUS**

There are many wonderful projects around that attract and deserve attention and offer plausible earning strategies.

**a) Yield farming on non-fungible tokens (NFT)**

dApps: *Syncbonds\[19\], VeryNifty\[20\]*

Reward generating NFT tokens. Cryptobonds\[19\] are tradable reward-generating NFTs that lock up interest-bearing liquidity tokens. You can emit your own bond, participate in emitting one with others, or buy already emitted bonds on the open market.

With VeryNifty\[20\], you can wrap your NFTS and turn them into vNFTs that earn you interest in the MUSE token. Careful, conditions apply that might burn your NTFs. There is a [uniswap pool](https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/0xc2BdE1A2fA26890c8E6AcB10C91CC6D9c11F4a73/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) to stake and generate yields and trade HashMasks.

**b) Synthetic assets**

dApps: *Synthetix \[21\], Mirror\[22\]*

Synthetic assets are derivatives that are incentivized to hold the price peg to the underlying asset (stock, fund, commodity). The main advantage of ""synths"" is that anyone can get immutable exposure to any asset at any time (looking at you Robinhood traders). The disadvantage is that you do not really own the stock so you can not partake in ongoing short squeeze (looking at you GME apes). Ensuring the collateral to back up the synthetic asset pair with stablecoin can earn you good rewards while exposing you to the stock at the same time. The leading projects are Synthetix\[21\] and Mirror.finance\[22\] that uses its Terra UST cross-chain stablecoin.

**c) Future yield tokenization**

dApps: *APwine\[23\], Syncbonds\[19\]*

Imagine you can stake your tokens to gain future yields without locking the tokens and imagine you can sell these interest-bearing tokens INCLUDING its future yield in advance (for some discount, or even premium if you are lucky or smart). Sounds like a Matrix loophole. The markets are so far rather small, but the APwine\[23\] project is worth keeping eye on.

**d) Self-paying loans - alchemix**

dApps: *Alchemix\[24\]*

Alchemix\[24\] lets you take loans that do not generate debt for you but yield. You deposit a certain amount of crypto as collateral and you are able to withdraw up to its half as ""a loan to yourself"". The other half is getting paid automatically by farming strategies.

devops,"Looking for a low-RAM, but high-storage/high-bandwidth server. And, something that is affordable...since my site will be predominantly supported by ads. Does such a thing exist?","Hi

&amp;#x200B;

So I am currently developing a site and have been browsing around for various VPS solutions, though didn't really find anything that matched what I was looking for...I naively then looked at AWS and others, with the logic that since they are massive companies, operating at massive scale, they would be able to provide cheaper rates...only to find that even for a TB of data, they will charge you $92 (realistically, it doesn't seem even Netflix would be able to operate at that cost, even getting $20 per subscription per month...but for a small site which would run and ads and perhaps 0.001% of users who will buy a cheap ($1-$4) membership, the costs would utterly dwarf any revenue you made

&amp;#x200B;

So does anyone know a service which provides affordable bandwidth &amp; storage space? Let's say I need:

&amp;#x200B;

\- 10TB of storage

&amp;#x200B;

\- 100Mb/s guarenteed/unmetered connection

&amp;#x200B;

Now, admittedly, these wouldn't be figures I'd be hitting on day 1, but I of course want to be prepared...within a year, it's possible these numbers would be required - possibly even more.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, currently the best offer I have found is [https://contabo.com/en/vps/](https://contabo.com/en/vps/) which offer 8GB RAM, a 200GB SSD and (supposedly) a guarenteed 100Mbp/s outbound traffic speed. This is for $6.99 per month. It's possible my calculations are wrong, but if not, according to the AWS calculator, a constant stream of 100Mbp/s for a 1 month period (25TB) would cost a whopping **$2830**.

&amp;#x200B;

The main problem with this Contabo offer, however, is that additional space can't be added to their VPS servers - that's only 2000 users uploading 100MB and that 200GB is all used up. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other day, for example, I bought these 2 USBs - they were 1TB for $4.5.  (10TB of USB storage for $45) - now, I assume, at least, it wouldn't be possibly to host a site with a large number of downloads on USBs like this, but looking at high-end dedicated servers with these sort of specs, it wouldn't be uncommon for sites to be charging anywhere from $200-$1000 per month. Many of these come with anywhere from between 64GB-320GB of RAM. As far as I know, I would only require a small amount of RAM (8-16GB) - just testing, I can load up a dummy DB of 10 million documents and perform 20 simultaneous requests (querying, updating, inserting, deleting) with an average response time of only 225ms. This is running on Ubuntu in a VirtualBox on my desktop, which I only allocated 8GB of RAM - the database even on a scale that would be unlikely to achieve after 10 years of operation for such a site. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I feel like I am getting a bit incoherent, so the main questions I have are:

&amp;#x200B;

1) do you know any cheap services which provide high storage/bandwidth, while low RAM (in order to save cost...there's no point having 60x the RAM for what I need, just to get a plan which will have the corresponding amount of storage/bandwidth)

&amp;#x200B;

2) what would a ballpark kind of price be for these kinds of specs (say 10TB storage, 100 mbp/s bandwidth) - since, realistically, I imagine 99.9% of users won't pay to remove ads...and at least in my experience before, I have often got horrific (like 0.005$ cpm rates) - rates that unfortunately would be dwarfed by the cost of the server prices I've been seeing online

&amp;#x200B;

3) in theory, would it be possible to create some octopus-style monstrosity, with 20 1TB USBs sticks all plugging into some kind of central device in order to host the files? USB 3 has a max transfer speed of 5Gb/s...realistically, when I transfer files, I seem to get something much slower...like 10Mb/s or so for large single files...and into the 100Kb/s range when transferring lots of small files. Despite the 5Gb/s max performance, would it be possible to have a setup like this...or would have multiple users (let's say 10) requesting files stored on a particular USB simultaneously be effectively unusable?

&amp;#x200B;

ethereum,An extensive list of earning strategies and DeFi protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem,"**Introduction.** DeFi is the future of finance with equal opportunities. Despite being at its inception, with currently more than $40 billion in total value locked (TVL) \[1\], there exist already plenty of opportunities for you to make your idle crypto tokens do the hard work for you to earn some interest. Some of the strategies offer a high risk-reward ratio, whereas some are rather safer. Many people do not know where to start with DeFi because the term itself is a buzzword (e.g., similar to the term BigData) with ambiguous meanings that get people easily lost. DeFi encapsulates various decentralized financial services whose functionality is immutable and persisted on (Ethereum) blockchain, which simply means these services are *accessible to anyone under the same rules and conditions*, which is a huge difference from traditional financial (tradFi) services. DeFi offers various strategies and this extensive guide should outline and uncover the most common earning strategies—including advantages and disadvantages—in the Ethereum ecosystem. The strategies proceed from the more mainstream and community-approved ones to more advanced ones, concluding with inspiring platforms and trends.

**1 STAKING**

This is not DeFi per se, but to make the list complete, I will start with this, as ETH 2.0 staking is the *most important strategy* that can not only grant you passive income but also helps *keep the network decentralized and safe*. Also, the rewards compared to traditional finance are very appealing.

**1.1 ETH 2.0 staking**

    rewards: ~8% APR

There has been written a lot about staking already, for those who are interested to read more, the best start is Etehreum official website \[2\]. Several variants exist (self, validator-as-a-service, stake pools, custody, exchange) each of which suits better for people at different skill levels or involvement.

|\[+\] Ultimate HODL strategy|\[-\] Tokens are locked indefinitely|
|:-|:-|
|\[+\] Low-risk strategy as this functionality is supported natively in the ETH protocol|\[-\] Inactivity penalties (rather low) for offline time, risk of slashing for misconfiguration|

**1.2 Staking ERC-20 tokens**

Tokens: *Aave (LEND) \[3\], Synthetix (SNX) \[4\], Sushi \[5\], Curve (CRV) \[6\], Badger \[7\], The Graph (GRT) \[8\], and many others...)*

    rewards: various, ranging from 3% APR

There exist many tokens on Ethereum that incentivize users to lock their tokens to earn staking rewards for various activities: computation (e.g., verifying transactions), asset collateralization, governance—or no activity at all (\~reward distribution tokens).

|\[+\] Earning interest on your favorite coins|\[-\] Risk of token price depreciation in projects that are not mainstream or that have a long-term token issuance scheme|
|:-|:-|


**2 LENDING**

dApps: *Compound \[9\], Aave\[10\]*

You can provide your tokens to be lent to borrowers at (usually variable) interest rates. Some exchanges and centralized services offer these services as well. Lending rewards are typically low for leading crypto projects (ETH, wBTC) but are very interesting for stablecoins.

**2.1 Stablecoin lending**

    rewards: 3–20% APR, up to 30% APY

You lock your stablecoins into a vault. All the tokens in the vault earn the same reward. The interest rate fluctuates depending on the demand. Usually, in bull markets, the APR is higher than in bear markets.  The reward is around 3-20% APR but compounding these rewards can slightly improve the rates, supposing the provider offers in-built compounding solutions (otherwise it does not pay-off to pay the high TX fees to claim rewards repeatedly).

|\[+\] Better rates compared to tradFi, but essentially on the same asset (dollars)|\[+\] Low-risk strategy only depending on external factors (stablecoin losing peg)|
|:-|:-|
|\[+/-\] Stablecoins keep their price (disadvantage in bull markets, advantage in bear markets)||

**2.2 ETH, wETH, wBTC lending**

    rewards: 0.15–3% APR

Wrapped ETH (ETH is not ERC-20 token) and wrapped BTC (wBTC, renBTC) can be lend or staked to provide a yield that is in general rather low, but for holders with bigger stacks, it can be a very effective way to earn stable income on the two most mainstream cryptocurrencies.

|\[+\] You HODL your crypto and you get a small additional income|

**3 LIQUIDITY PROVIDING**

dApps: *uniswap\[11\], sushi\[12\], 1inch\[13\], Loopring\[14\] (L2)*

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) run automated liquidity pools in order to facilitate the swaps (i.e., exchange trades). Users can provide liquidity for a DEX-traded pair by locking both assets to the pool, at 1:1 volume at their current corresponding price ratio.

**4 YIELD FARMING**

dApps: *yearn\[15\], curve\[6\], badger\[16\], harvest.finance\[17\], alphahomora\[18\] (leveraged farming), and many others...*

**5 MISCELLANEOUS**

There are many wonderful projects around that attract and deserve attention and offer plausible earning strategies.

**a) Yield farming on non-fungible tokens (NFT)**

dApps: *Syncbonds\[19\], VeryNifty\[20\]*

Reward generating NFT tokens. Cryptobonds\[19\] are tradable reward-generating NFTs that lock up interest-bearing liquidity tokens. You can emit your own bond, participate in emitting one with others, or buy already emitted bonds on the open market.

**b) Synthetic assets**

dApps: *Synthetix \[21\], Mirror\[22\]*

Synthetic assets are derivatives that are incentivized to hold the price peg to the underlying asset (stock, fund, commodity). The main advantage of ""synths"" is that anyone can get immutable exposure to any asset at any time (looking at you Robinhood traders). The disadvantage is that you do not really own the stock so you can not partake in ongoing short squeeze (looking at you GME apes).

dApps: *Alchemix\[24\]*

Alchemix\[24\] lets you take loans that do not generate debt for you but yield. You deposit a certain amount of crypto as collateral and you are able to withdraw up to its half as ""a loan to yourself"". The other half is getting paid automatically by farming strategies.

personalfinance,Aggressively pay down federal student loans or focus on maxing retirement?,"Hey y’all!

After four months of being unemployed and a nasty bout of depression, I just accepted a job offer! I’ve spent the past two days combing through the wiki and prime directive, and have an idea of my priorities/goals. I wanted to go over my specific situation, though, in the hopes I could get some guidance on where paying off my federal student loans should fall into my priorities.

I’m married and my husband and I are both 37 living in a MCOL area. Here’s the details:

**Income:** 168k total (pre-tax)

**Debts:** I have ~65,000 left in federal student loans. They’re all under forbearance right now. Normally the interest rates range from 5.3% - 6.3%.

Mortgage has 182k left, 4.85% interest rate. I know that’s high - I was able to secure a first-time homebuyer loan through my credit union that required 0% down. This is a starter home and we’re planning on moving in 2 years.

**Savings:** We have about 90k in savings accounts.

**Retirement:** I’m behind for being 37 - have about 60k spread between two different retirement plans and investments (index funds via T Rowe Price). My husband is likely behind, too, but doesn’t know exactly how much he has (I’m working with him on this, lol). He didn’t start investing until he was 30/31.

Note: my new employer **does not match**. My husband’s employer does match, but it’s some variable dollar amount dependent on how the company is doing and how much money my husband puts in.

Neither of us has an IRA. We’ll be electing a HDHP so I can start pumping money into an HSA.

I have a budget and I track our expenses every month. We have a sizable emergency fund, so steps 0-2 of the prime directive are complete. I estimate we’ll have ⅔ to ½ of our take-home salary left over after expenses every month.

**Some considerations:**

1. I need a new car. I drove the last car I owned for 15 years into the ground and donated it to Habitat for Humanity (repairs would cost more than the car’s value) a few weeks ago. My credit is excellent and I want to try and take advantage of some of the 0% APR offers out there at dealerships.
2. We’re trying to start a family, but are having difficulty conceiving, so it’s looking like we’ll need infertility treatment. Our insurance covers infertility treatment (not sure exactly how much, but it’s covered), so we’ll need some money saved for this.
3. We’re aiming to buy a new house in ~2 years and anticipate needing 80-90k saved for a 20% down payment/closing costs. Currently need to save an additional 25k so we have enough to cover a 6 month emergency fund and the down payment.
4. There’s water damage in our master bathroom, so we need to remodel the (small, thankfully) master bath. I’m anticipating this to be anywhere from 10-12k.

With all of this in mind, how aggressively should I be focusing on paying down my student loans vs. maxing out my 401k contributions? I was thinking my priority, other than increasing our savings, should be:

1. Have both my husband and I open traditional IRAs and max them out for the year
2. Increase my 401k contributions to at least 15%
3. Max out HSA for this year and last year (prior to April)
4. Start aggressively paying off student loans with whatever's left

Or should I start off by paying down the student loans first and then increasing retirement contributions? I hope that some form of student loan forgiveness is coming, but I don't want to count on it.

We’ll use one of our [Mining Insights Profitability Calculator](https://insights.braiins.com/profitability-calculator) to illustrate why miners should not be thought of purely as “sellers of BTC” who suppress price increases. **Miners are HODLers too.**

**Scenario #1:**

[insights.braiins.com](https://preview.redd.it/euovy2xrien61.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d24e1fd52cd59de0b7fdc5799e04e1195cd9297)

☝️ This chart is an 18-month cash flow visualization for a miner with 6.8 PH/s of hashrate, all S17 Pros.

Bull market parameters:

\- Difficulty increases 4%/month 

\- Price increases 6.5%/month

In this projection, the miner sells all BTC into fiat each month and has an **end profit: $1.1MM**

**Scenario #2:**

☝️ This chart is for the exact same miner and all of the exact same inputs, with **one difference:**

**HODL Ratio = 100%**

All profits are kept in BTC instead of selling to fiat and the miner ends with an **end profit: $1.9MM**

We added the HODL Ratio input to our Profitability Calculator in order to make it more useful based on  [The Intelligent Bitcoin Miner](https://www.aniccaresearch.tech/blog/the-intelligent-bitcoin-miner-part-i), a report from Annica Research. It's a must read for understanding the evolution of the BTC mining industry.

I know this has been asked a couple of times before, but since everyone's situation is a little bit different I don't think it would hurt to have a new post on this topic. I am trying to decide if it would be worth it to hire a CPA vs just using TurboTax.

Last year I only had W2 wages, but this year my I will start a moonlighting opportunity (1099 independent contractor) a couple times per month that will yield me $20-30k annually. My W2 wages this year will be around $90k. The only other things complicating my situation are my $60k in student loans (all federal) and the fact that my wife and I are married filing separately. In the future I would like to purchase and rent real estate, but this is not something that will happen this year, so it should not be relevant unless there would be things I could do now to better set myself up for rental income in the future.

For our situation would it make sense to hire a CPA? Do you think that they would be able to help get us enough tax deductions to make the cost worthwhile?",finance

personalfinance,Debating Paying off Car,"Hello everyone! I been going back and fourth on this in my head for months now and I just wanted to see what other people thought.

I’m currently 24 living at home in my Junior year of college. My only debt is a $540 car payment that I would be on track to finish in 2025. I currently have $12K in liquid savings, $22K between my employer Roth 401k and my Roth IRA. I used to buy old cars that would break on me and so I decided to buy a 3 year old car so I’d have something newer that would be more long term and I financed the cost. Right now I have about $22K for the payoff with a 3.59% interest rate. I know my interest rate isn’t that bad but I want to free up more money to save because I plan on moving out in another two years when I graduate. 

If I were to use $10K from my savings would it be foolish of me to get the remaining $12K from retirement accounts? I hate to have debt and it pains me to even think about touching my retirement accounts but I think if I do this now I can wipe out that car loan completely and focus on saving more monthly by adding my car payment into my savings every month and I can also max out my IRA earlier in the year instead of doing little bits throughout the year until I reach my limit. 

This could be a completely dumb idea but I wanted some other opinions. Thank you in advance!",finance

I filed through Turbo Tax like I always do - I don't have a complicated situation so it's always super easy.

I knew I would owe taxes this year and towards the end, Turbo Tax gave me an option to apply for the IRS payment plan which I went ahead and signed up for.  I paid around half of the owed amount on 3/8, and the payment info shows under ""my account"" on the IRS website - even though it doesn't show an account balance.

stocks,How To Spot A Bubble,"Yes yes, another one of these. I thought this article was a really interesting read, and goes in-depth on the indicators of a bubble:

[https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc210315/](https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc210315/)

It is worth bearing (pun intended) in mind that the author is regarded as a perma-bear who has been bearish on the markets for most of the last decade, although he did call both the 2000 and 2007/8 crashes. I would rather discuss the rational of his post rather than his previous record, as it seems pretty spot on to me. It would be good to hear discuss counter arguments which aren't the common ones we see on reddit: ""Low interest rates"" / ""The Fed has our back"" / ""stonks only go up!"" (all of which were addressed in his post).

I will pull out some quotes below, though I would encourage you to read the entire article. I think the question I see quite often across the investing subs (even /r/valueinvesting recently), is that although we know we can't time the market, does it really make sense to overpay so much based on nothing other than fomo?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The expectation of growth produces the growth, which confirms the expectation; people will buy it because it went up. But once you are convinced that it is not growing anymore, nobody wants to hold a stock because it is overvalued. Everybody wants to get out and it collapses, beyond the fundamentals.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If prices rise, and expected cash flows haven’t changed, investors  recognize that future returns will be lower. In the “bubble” case,  investors have high expectations about future returns, mainly based on  past returns, and they act on those expectations by driving prices up  further. So the expectation of additional price increases is simply  reinforced. “The expectation of growth produces the growth, which  confirms the expectation.” 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The truth is simple but uncomfortable. If interest rates are low and  expected growth is held constant, higher valuations imply lower  long-term returns. If interest rates are low because expected future  growth is also low, higher valuations are not required. Long-term  returns will be lower anyway. A valuation premium just makes future  returns even worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To say that margin debt to GDP is at the highest level in history is to  say not only that stocks are heavily owned on margin, but that those  stocks are also breathtakingly overvalued. That combination is  particularly worrisome.   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The value is in the future cash flows that will be delivered to  investors over time. The elevated price only ensures that the long-term  return between now and then will be dismal.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 16, 2021. Please enjoy!","Stocks fell on Tuesday, after the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) set fresh records yesterday, as market participants digested a weaker-than-expected report on retail, rising Treasury yields, and looked ahead to a Federal Reserve policy meeting later this week. 

Retail sales fell 3% in February from January, the Commerce Department said, worse than the 0.7% decline economists polled by FactSet expected. However, many analysts blamed bad weather and expect incoming stimulus checks to cause retail sales to spike.

Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. At the time of writing, the Treasury yield sits at 1.606%. 

In light of rising Treasury yields, market participants are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, where the Central Bank is widely expected to reiterate its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy while the economic recovery gains momentum. 

With large amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus supporting economic activity, analysts at BlackRock are anticipating ""a much stronger post-COVID economic restart than what we would expect in a normal recovery. The rapid upward adjustment in U.S. Treasury yields and more muted movement in inflation-adjusted yields make sense in this respect, and are still consistent with our new nominal theme of higher prices and government liquidity.”

Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

A lot of the hottest names in the street sold off more than 50% in the past few weeks. Nasdaq sold off 12% from its intraday highs.

In this Market Commentary, I laid out reasons why I thought these trends were happening and how I'm positioned in this environment.

I wanted to re-emphasize key lessons to keep in mind, which I alluded to here, as we are trading through these types of corrections.

2. Learn from other people's mistakes but more importantly, from your mistakes.
3. Mental discipline is key.

I understand that some of you have just started investing in the markets this past year.

Let me warn you upfront that these types of corrections are minimal pains compared to actual bear markets.

I mean really, the recent corrections/recessions have been very short-lived. The longest correction in the past 3 years is 2 months. Take a look below.

My point is that corrections and recessions are not short-lived all of the times. Imagine your favorite stock dropping 70% over a period of 2 years.

The reason why I bring it up? I want to reiterate the importance of balancing your hedges, if you are not a buy-and-hold investor. (more on hedges here)

So always keep in mind bear markets can be dragged longer than you experienced so far.

Another key lesson to keep in mind is stay invested, as long as your security selections are solid.

I can't remember exactly what the stats are but it goes something along the lines of

""if you missed out 20 best trading days in the past 20 years, your annual returns go from 12% a year to 7% a year""

\*Please don't quote me on the exact figures but you get my point.

I don't need to go back too far to prove my point. Just look at the past few days.

📷

If you missed out on that huge gap up on 3/9/2021, you missed out a lot.

Keep in mind corrections create great opportunities, but don't underestimate the length of the correction period.

**My strategy, which doesn't work for everyone due to differences in risk tolerance, investing time period, and discipline, is to slowly buy into the dip in increments, and load up on existing hedges if I think the correction is headed deeper.** During this process, you'll be fighting lots of naysayers. Those who believe we are doomed for tech massacre. Those who think the days of growth stocks are over and now the value stocks will shine. Try to keep distractions out of your analysis and stay focused on your game.

**2) Is this the end of the growth stocks selloff?**

The short answer is yes, more likely than not.

Again, I explained in this market commentary why I think this is a short-lived correction and it was probably good buying opportunity.

Now, I want to prevent anyone from spending his/her life savings on stocks just yet.

Remember this game is about probability. Do I think the other guy on the poker table is bluffing? Absolutely, at 80% probability. But it could very well be the case that he actually wasn't bluffing and has trip tens.

My point is that anything can happen and we need to think in probabilistic terms, not absolute terms.

Based on a few technical indicators, it seems that the market is again heading for a bullish action but I'm not a huge believer in technicals so I give little weight to this sort of analysis.

📷

If you look at the above chart, you are seeing a consistent gap higher with high-lows and high-highs, meaning for each day, the low is higher than the previous low and the high is higher than previous high, commonly seen in an upward trending market.

Furthermore, it bounced back from its 100d MA support level, with three straight-up days.

I believe we are likely out of the woods but one or more events can turn things over in a matter of a day, which I will explain more below.

**3) What happens from here?**

I have repeatedly mentioned that the two key drivers of the markets right now are monetary and fiscal policies.

Therefore, any shifts in tone regarding these two policies will cause major changes in trends.

Key things to look at are FOMC meeting tomorrow (monetary policy) and Biden administration policies (fiscal policy).

I'm partially afraid that the Fed officials may say something that'll upset the markets tomorrow.

For instance, if their dot plots indicate faster than expected rate hikes, that would certainly be bad for the markets.

Or if JPow &amp; Co suddenly shifts his tone to a more hawkish one given the rising inflation expectations, the risk assets won't like that either.

I am assigning low probabilities in either of those events happening, hence my view that the tech selloff is over, but it is a non-zero risk.

What I am more concerned about is the fiscal policy.

Biden administration is already considering tax hikes to fund deficits, specifically 28% corporate tax rates and higher tax rates for wealthy individuals.

Based on how the risk assets have reacted to Trump administration's tax cuts, I believe it is likely that the risk assets will react negatively to the proposed tax policies.

To summarize, I am still bullish for the long run but that view will depend largely on how the monetary and fiscal policies change. The Fed has reassured us that they will be very patient in the inflation front so I'm not too worried on that front. I am more concerned how the Biden administration will wind-down its spending earlier than expected, but no one can know how that will play out.

The best we can do is to stay invested and monitor the developments as closely as possible, especially the FOMC meeting tomorrow.

investing,Google Play to Slash Fees App Developers Pay,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/google-play-to-slash-fees-app-developers-pay-51615922419

Alphabet said early Tuesday that it is slashing the fees it charges app developers who use the Google Play store, months after Apple announced a similar move amid criticism of the high costs of such charges.

Shares of Alphabet (ticker: GOOGL) were up 1.5%, at $2,084.40, in recent trading.

In a blog post Tuesday, Alphabet said that it was lowering the fee it collects to 15% from 30% on the first $1 million app makers bank from its app store. Alphabet made the decision to slash its fees, which takes effect July 1, amid regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department and several state-led efforts.

Apple (AAPL) made a similar change last year, reducing its rate to 15%—also from 30%—but limited the change to developers who report annual sales of less than $1 million. Apple is being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulators for potential antitrust violations reportedly related to its app store.

Google said in the blog post that 99% of app developers would have their fees cut in half. It wasn’t immediately clear what impact the change would have on the company’s third-quarter sales and beyond.

Alphabet includes its Play store revenue in its “Other” revenue segment, which also lumps in hardware and nonadvertising products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions. The entire segment reported 2020 revenue of $21.71 billion.


Criticism over app-store fees increased last year after Epic Games, the Tencent Holdings (0700.Hong Kong)-backed maker of Fortnite, launched a public campaign against Apple and Google over the fees related to the app store. Apple booted Fortnite off the store, and Epic filed an antitrust suit over the issue.

Shares of Alphabet have advanced 95% in the past year, as the S&amp;P 500 gained 69%.",finance
personalfinance,What to spend extra money on correctly.,"Between my left over income taxes and recent stimulus check. I have roughly 9k-10k in savings. I have a truck I'm upside down on that I was considering to throw it all at it in order to pay it down enough to sell it. Which would save me roughly $600 a month but would leave me without a extra vehicle for my wife/kids. I have another vehicle but I travel for work and that's what I use. 

We are wanting to finally buy a house and considered taking the money to put it towards closing costs or with a FHA I could put it towards repairs. That's more a longer term goal than anything. Which would have me saving for longer but less overall since I have a good chunk to start off with. 

Leading up to the house option I was considering paying off my credit cards in order to improve my credit score. Which in turn would help with a home loan/interest rate.

personalfinance,"Small potatoes investing, just starting out. Not short term, but not for retirement","I would like to start investing between ~$10k annually, but not specifically for retirement - more for use in...10?15?ish years. Not for anything specific - I just know that once you have some savings set aside, holding onto cash long term is unwise. I tend towards being pretty conservative in my spending / risk-averse, and my parents are vehemently opposed to investing...but I’ve been starting to read and trying to educate myself. 

I’m married, with 2 kids. I’m in my early 30s, my husband his late 30s. My husband works full time and maxes out his 401k/employer matching. I am home with the kids and work part time from home. We own (“own”) our home and go back and forth between moving in a few years or staying put. We don’t have any debt, we have ~$30k set aside in an AmEx Personal Savings account(...which DID have the best interest rates when I opened it years ago, although that may not be the case anymore. I see Ally mentioned here a lot - worth considering moving it over?). We did start 529s for our kids but are not contributing regularly; kids are 2 and 4. 

Our finances are commingled, so I’m using “I” / “my” for clarity’s sake - it’s our money, obviously. But: we basically live off the money he makes; I’m an independent contractor so when I started working again we set up a separate account to put that money into for tax &amp; tracking purposes. The plan was to have me start depositing a set amount monthly into our joint checking account while keeping enough in the separate account to cover my 1099 income for taxes. But we found we haven’t really needed it, so it’s just kind of sitting in that account. I did start a Roth IRA and am contributing the max amount to that annually, and I will probably keep some in there just for fun money / random expenses that come up. 

But I’d like to use some of the ‘extra’ to start investing (wisely) and I don’t know where to start. My ideal scenario is a ‘set it and forget it’ type setup, but that’s not a must if it’s not smart. In short my question is: If we wanted to invest $10k or so annually, and see some solid growth over time but not have it locked up until retirement (although we’re fine with not touching it for awhile; it’s not slated for anything specific besides...life)...where should we put it?

Our family is growing and we are on the hunt for a new house with more room and better schools. Our stats:

Combined income - 200k (Me: 125k plus 25k bonus; Partner: 50k)

Cash: 125K

Retirement (IRA/401k) - 300k

Investment accounts - 150K

Home value: 500K-550K (purchase price 300k)

We are looking at getting a home in the 750K range. So we can either buy a new home first then sell or sell our home and then buy a new one.  Either way we will have to take out a mortgage.  What are the different ways we could go about doing this.  If we don't sell first then we are being told then we would probably have to take out a jumbo loan at a higher interest rate.  Is there a way to avoid doing that?  

Second question: We have been planning on putting 100% of the sales price of our home into the down payment/mortgage of our new home.  Does that make the most sense or is there something else we should be doing with that money (put it into the market, invest some/down payment with some, etc). Our real estate agent seemed surprised we wanted to put the entire sales amount into our next home.

I know we are in a very fortunate situation, and these are not really complex questions but we really are at a loss.  The sales of our house is going to provide a huge influx of cash.  We just want to make sure we are not wasting an opportunity or making a stupid decision.

Any other ideas based on our stats above would be appreciated as well.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Beyond Greed,"There is no doubt that greed plays a crucial role in facilitating the widespread adoption of Bitcoin. The allure of making an early investment to get outsized returns is a very real driver of the adoption of this technology and there is nothing wrong with this. It is fair that those who took the initial risk should see the largest returns; as the popular saying goes “Everyone will get Bitcoin at the price they deserve.”

What concerns me is that many people view Bitcoin as nothing more than an elevator asset. The puerile version of the Bitcoin dream vision found all over the internet goes something like this: invest as much money as possible into Bitcoin as early as possible, HODL, then in 5+ years when it is widely adopted sell your Bitcoin (or take a loan against it) to generate enough fiat currency to live comfortably or indeed lavishly for the rest of your life. Everyone who owns Bitcoin harbors this dream to some extent, but it also strikes me that there is nothing really admirable here and in some ways it is self-defeating. Let me explain.

Consider the following thought experiment: imagine we lived in a world where Bitcoin came into existence not gradually but all at once and the sum total of everyone’s money and investments defined broadly was converted to Bitcoin instantaneously. Never mind the mechanics of how this would occur, it is obviously infeasible. This scenario is essentially the end-game of Bitcoin where people and organizations will convert some of their Bitcoin reserve holdings to local fiat to cover day-to-day expenses while Bitcoin itself will function as a giant worldwide savings account that preserves the purchasing power of deposits until needed at a later point in time. How excited would you be about Bitcoin in this scenario? I imagine that many reading this post would quickly become disenchanted with Bitcoin and move onto the next lottery ticket investment.

To view Bitcoin solely as a one-way ticket to extreme wealth greatly diminishes its full scope and potential. I submit that many people with this mentality have never stopped to think about why they are dreaming this dream. Why do you feel like you need to win the lottery? Everyone’s answer will be different but there are some salient underlying factors that contribute to this collective dream. Perhaps the most important factor is the rising level of wealth inequality that is increasingly manifesting itself in the politics of even the most historically stable developed nations. This wealth inequality, driven in part by the explosion of technology, has only been exacerbated by the policies of central banks and the politicians that influence them. There is a universe of detail to go into here, but one takeaway is that many western countries are heading away from free markets towards the paradigm of centrally planned economies. Those who control the money supply pick winners and losers, the winners being companies and people who have easy access to capital. When a currency is debased the outcomes are not distributed evenly across a society, it is the individuals with the least wealth and access to capital that are hurt the most. It is not hard to imagine the destabilizing effect this has on a society.

It is ironic that so many people view Bitcoin purely as a means to extreme wealth while not even realizing how wealth inequality is contributing to their own dissatisfaction and inability to provide for their families and plan for the future. Bitcoin is more than a lottery ticket, it is a tool to make the world more fair and transparent. It can empower individuals by providing a way to safeguard the monetary energy that is the result of their labor and time. With Bitcoin everyone has the opportunity to take control of their own financial future instead of ceding control to banks and state actors. Going back to the original thought experiment, if Bitcoin were to become the world’s reserve currency without the early adopters accruing excessive wealth it would still be a blessing without comparison. In fact, it would be a miracle. To not see this is to not see all of the injustices and inefficiencies built into our current economic and political systems.

For whatever it is worth, I would exhort this audience to spend less time thinking about the price of Bitcoin and more time considering how it could be used as a force of good to change the world. There are many other angles you could consider along these lines. For example, Bitcoin mining could provide an economic incentive for the development of inexpensive sources of renewable energy and be an economic boon to disadvantaged parts of the world. Be generous with your Bitcoin; it is better to send a little Bitcoin to your family and friends and teach them how it works than it is to hold onto every last Satoshi out of pure greed. We must first educate ourselves and then others for Bitcoin to succeed. Spending time and energy obsessing about daily price fluctuations and how much to stake and when does not help the cause and in fact makes Bitcoin appear toxic to many no-coiners. If that energy is diverted to self-education and teaching it will be much better spent and actually increase the probability that your investment and belief in Bitcoin will pay off later. It will also make the journey more rewarding and enjoyable, and give you even more reasons to HODL when things get choppy.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Part-year Resident Confusion!!,"So I moved from Illinois to Arizona last summer. I'm doing my taxes (on TurboTax) and everything looks about as expected until I get to states. 

I get promoted with the following:

""Enter the Arizona portion of each federal amount shown. If none, enter zero"". 

""Enter the total of all income and adjustments during the period you were an Arizona resident plus all Arizona source items during the period you were a nonresident"".

The federal amount listed is ZERO!

At first I assumed I was supposed to enter the total amount of money I made while living in Arizona, but that directly leads to me owing thousands of dollars in state taxes. 

A similar question comes up for Illinois with even worse results if I enter an amount. 

Am I just supposed to leave this slot blank.

personalfinance,[US] What should I do about my student loan situation? Advice?,"Bit of background: I was just chilling today and then I got a call saying that my financial aid Pell grants didn't go through. I need that for the tuition to go down. I also found out there was a cap on the amount of Federal loans I can take out every year so now I'm not really sure what to do. This is what someone recommended.

&gt;Federal unsubsidized loans have a fixed cap. For a dependent student that's $5500 for your first year, $6500 for your second year, and $7500 each for following years. Federal subsidized loans, which have more generous terms, are limited based on your family income. There's a total cap of $31,000 for your entire undergrad education.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you need more than that, your parents will have to cosign either a federal ParentPLUS loan, or a loan from a private lender. This is not advisable, though, as the terms of these loans are less favorable and they allow you and your family to take on much more debt than is necessary or reasonable.  
&gt;  
&gt;You are best served picking a school and living situation that allows you to cover the costs with the direct federal loans, plus financial aid, scholarships, your parents' income/savings, and your own income from working.

Why is a ParentPlus loan not advisable? What should I do? Any advice?",finance

personalfinance,Using Home Equity to Pay off Credit Card Debt,"I have been slowly turning mine and my wife's finances around after spending a lot of money in a small amount of time a few years ago. Namely getting marred and buying at house at the same time.

Currently own a home worth roughly 330k with 233k left on the mortgage. It was foreclosed before we owned and we have put in a ton of sweat equity. $1600 monthly payments on the mortgage.

However we both put money on credit cards to pay for parts of our wedding, and for home supplies. A mistake I knew we were was making - but can't undo past rash choices.

Currently have 36k of debt consolidated into a sofi loan at 13% interest. Monthly $817 payments.

My plan current idea is to re-finance our home, which I plan to do anyway to reduce interest rates. In that process add a good chunk to the mortgage and take out the 36k in cash to pay off the sofi loan. The goal being one payment slightly larger rather than two split payments. Then start paying off the mortgage and adding principal payments. 

My question is, is there an actual benefit to this? Or am I just moving money around with no benefit? Is this something that I can actually do? And are there any red flags I am missing in the process to adding to the mortgage in this way?",finance

The valuation battle between XLM, XRP, and ADA has been fascinating. All three have been vying to take ETH 1.0's marketshare, leveraging the POS benefits to latency, scalability, cost,

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tvrw64jr9in61.png?width=1363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93bc39e1222fb86fa4185e306e322d3fe50b43f4

Before we get started, let me quickly run-through some factors that I used to determine the Fundamental Analysis and subsequent Technical Analysis.

**Fundamental Analysis:**

Fundamental Analysis is attempting to put an accurate price on a item based upon an objective calculation of its worth. This is normally a nebulous number that roughly correlates to its in-kind purchase power if transferred to a universally traded currency. It answers the question of, given the ability to buy its competitors, what is the value of this good in a fair market setting. Fundamental Analysis generally seeks to answer whether the current price is overvalued or undervalued.

Some Fundamental Analysis include:

* Market Cap:
   * Current Price x number of coins
* 24 hour Trading Volume:
   * How much coin is being exchanged
* Yearly Inflation Rate:
   * How many new coins are introduced over a year

Best sources for Fundamental Analysis data: [https://research.binance.com/en/projects](https://research.binance.com/en/projects)

**Technical Analysis:**

Technical Analysis is to Fundamental Analysis as a crystal ball is to a NYSE ticker quote. Technical Analysis is the attempt to predict the market value of an item given all the outside factors that influence it. A technical analysis is generally done when historic numbers are used to predict future trends. Correlation analysis, candlestick patterns, and social media references are ways analysts assess a coins technicals. Technical analysis generally seeks to predict the future price of a coin.

**The White Paper**

This, often overlooked, gem is the thesis behind the coin. This is the coin's reason for being and the market space that it intends on owning. A coin with an undefined white paper is a coin with an undefined answer, namely to the question, what makes you so special?

It contains:

* The type of system
   * POS, POW, etc
* The coin's answer the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (how a coin proofs consensus of trust in an imperfect environment)
* Tokenomics of the coin
   * How coins can be received or distributed
* The coin's ""why?""

**Valuation and Bubbles**

A bubble can occur when there is a deviation between the Fundamental Analysis, what something should be worth based upon its own merits, and the Technical Analysis, where the market places the item's worth based upon outside factors. The idea of a bubble occurring is driven largely by projected future value and real future value. Both types of analysis seek to explain the market evaluation of an item.

A quick word on bubbles and bitcoins. This hits on tokenomics, or the inherent value of the coin based on its function as a store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange. A coin's risk can be determined by its degree of usability, valuations, inflation rate of the coin, information surrounding the design team, and volume of fees (indicating a rough level of willingness for people to trade coin for other currency).

**System Types:**

**Proof of Work (POW):** The basis for traditional Cryptocurrency, where a complex equation is solved, providing the equation solver with a unit of currency. The currency gains intrinsic value through the value of the expended energy used to complete the equation. Thus, the tie between energy and currency allows the valuation of the currency.

Examples: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH)

Pros:

* The first, and most tested, way to ensure decentralized control over a currency.
* POW provides incentives for miners to behave well and creates a system to settle transactions.

Cons:

* The process wastes resources, which is unscalable with the current dominance of fossil fuels in our energy production.
* The transaction time increases as the system seeks to prevent against double spending through verifying against “double spending”
* Subject to 51% attacks\*  

   * Miners can technically control 51% of the currencies computational value
* This allows them to effectively re-write node history and secure bitcoins from other miners, controlling supply

**Proof of Stake (POS):** The newer version of POW, favoring efficiency over whole-chain verification. Ouroboro’s Genesis-based POS relies on actors providing collateral to verify reduction of tradable coins in the marketplace. Traditionally, verification was performed through a reduced version of POW, where a portion of the blockchain is recorded and used to verify that the owners had not spent the stake. A second method of verification involves creating a lag time between when the currency being un-staked and the ability to spend the coins.

Examples: Zilliqa (ZIL), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT)

Pros:

* More environmentally friendly
* Reduces latency when compared to POW
* The required code to obtain the currency can be dynamic, allowing for scalable security

Cons:

* Environmental pollution, latency, and security varies by the coins design
* No consensus on how the system is verified
* Requires users to trust the system as a whole and does not allow for selecting verifiers

So lets get to it:

**Ripple (XRP)**

Ripple was founded 2005 by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz. The Ripple Protocol, outlined in [Ripple’s 2018 Whitepaper](https://ripple.com/files/ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdf), describes its model for using the Byzantine Agreement system in conjunction with decentralized trust.

XRP is a Frankenstein's Monster of Crypto. It's developed by the folks at Ripple, and managed through their service. As a coin, XRP does not achieve decentralized control and is instead backed, in part, by the company itself through their [verification system](https://ripple.com/xrp/). XRP supports a limited number of functionalities including: Payment channels, escrows, deposit authorizations, a decentralized exchange, amendments, and invariant checking.

Pros:

* Oldest coin between the three
* Attached to a payment company
   * Not likely to go down to zero
* Developed within an ecosystem

Cons:

* Attached to a payment company  

   * Decentralized trust not achieved
   * Node selection lacks the same degree of trust
* Market share dwarfed by ADA

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ui3948nu9in61.png?width=1367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4373a17c823877cdc4e5d46d940f54c8116c336d

**Stellar Lumens (XLM)**

Stellar, was founded by Jed McCaleb, a co-founder of an earlier coin, Ripple. The Stellar White-Paper explains the reasoning for the currency and the market gap it seeks to fill. Stellar seeks to create a word wide financial network, ensured through a Stellar consensus protocol (SCP) built around a decentralized trust model called the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). Through implementing its decentralized trust model, SCP, the Stellar system seeks to ensure:

* Decentralized Control
   * No gatekeeping or barrier to entry for consensus
* Low latency
   * Faster processing through spreading work over decentralized nodes
* Flexible Trust
   * User determined nodes, providing security based upon users predetermined trusted nodes.
* Asymptotic Security
   * Flexible digital signatures and hash families allowing for scaling for security

Technicals:

Unlike competitors, XLM seeks to fix POW’s latency, trust, and security problems through their SCP model. It’s worth noting that XLM’s SCP model was built before [Ouroboro’s Genesis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243848).

XLM allows individual users to select trusted nodes, separating them from Ripple’s earlier attempt to create master sheets with trusted nodes. Rather than individually selected by users, the master sheets employed by ripple ended up transferring the byzantine system of authority from ripple to the sheet owners, leading to sheet owners maintaining control over the term “trusted nodes” within Ripple.

The XLM model diverges from the decentralize admission Ripple attempted in an important way, rather than relying master node lists that are editable, FBA relies on a consensus between decentralized nodes. Turning different nodes into individual owner’s elected officials that verify transactions for them. Thereby allowing for a decentralized consensus along with all the benefits of the Byzantine Agreement. This change, according to XLM, allows their model to create the decentralized consensus that achieves their goals of decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security.

Pros:

* Brainchild of McCaleb, a crypto vet
* Its tech is consumer focused and better than current market leader ETH
* Pre-dates ADA as a and has a longer history as a currency
* Historic ties to ADA and similar functionality *may* indicate an undervaluation of the currency

Cons:

* Smaller market cap to ADA, indicating smaller adoption
* Its tech puts the security onus on the owner

&amp;#x200B;

**Cardano (ADA)**

Cardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, and was launched in 2017. The main goal of Cardano was to solve Bitcoin’s speed and rigidity, while also addressing Caradano’s stated issues with Ethereum’s scalability and safety.

Technicals:

Cardano, unlike Bitcoin, uses a Proof of Stake (POS) rather than Proof of Work (POW). This difference rewards the first rather than the most powerful, a system known as [Ouroboros Genesis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243848), where miners can rejoin their chain and continue where they ended. The goal of POS through Ouroboros was to reduce the amount of energy needed compared to BTC and ETH, which both use POW.

Secondly, like ETH’s ecosystem, the second layer of the Cardano is a layer similar to ETH, enabling using the system for smart contracts and applications. Cardano’s POS and computation layer, when combined, offer the benefits of BTC’s security and ETH’s functionality.

Pros:

* Largest market cap of the three
* POS tech that connects security, reduced latency, efficiency, and scalability
* Not reliant on ETH's current market  

   * Target market is [developing world friendly](https://why.cardano.org/en/introduction/what-it-the-point-of-all-of-it/)
* Has a secondary layer to its code allowing for it to function as a software platform
* You can end staking whenever you like, with no end period

Cons:

* Viability after proposed ETH 2.0 in question
* Historic tie between ADA:XLM:XRP *may* indicate an overvaluation

**Final Thoughts**

Cardano as a currency arrived at the right place, at the right time, and with the right tech to allow for it to finally break from its competitors. Its ascendance was owed to its superior tech, and it was able to beat out XRP, a coin with a company backing, and XLM, a POS coin that, while an early entrant to the market, has not kept up with ADA's recent adoption. At the time of writing this, Coinbase pro recently announced that ADA will begin trading on its exchange. This change will likely exacerbate the difference between the currencies. Time will tell if the space between ADA and XLM will close or widen over the long run. At this point, however, I think ADA will prevail in the developing world over XLM.

personalfinance,How much debt on equity 'healthy' for an individual investor?,"Personal Situation:

I recently discovered that I have access to large amounts of low interest margin loans from interactive brokers (rates benchmark rate + 1-1.5%).

I am planning on taking a $300k margin to buy a property in my home country (where the housing market crashed due to covid) - 4000 sq ft luxury townhome in a golf course for my parents retirement - mortgages in my home country are 7-10% a year in interest and I can't get a US mortgage for the purchase.

My financial situation

Net Worth - 1.6 - 1.7M depending on the day (+500k in the last year due to active trading) - this is not counting capital gains liquidation taxes.

\+0.5M in RSUs of my FAANG employer.+0.4-0.5M in diversified blend of high growth tech companies that skyrocketed in the pandemic+600k in stable 'adult' investments - broad based ETFs, dividend aristocrats etc across 401k and portfolio.+ No debt

Stats - Income - \~420k, age 30, unmarried - no kids - annual savings around $250k/yr.

Now debt at high interest rates is clearly bad and I've avoided it throughout my life, but getting access to millions at 1-1.5% seems like too good an opportunity to give up. In addition to the $300k purchase - I am thinking of taking on an additional 200k to buy up some stable high-dividend (3%+) stocks that I think are currently mis-priced (midstream oil, consumer goods).

After doing this my portfolio will become:

\+0.5M RSUs+0.5M growth stocks+0.8M adult stocks+0.3M property- 0.5M USD cash

This amounts to a debt to equity ratio of 1:3 in my brokerage account I think (the property won't get counted) - which still seems quite safe in terms of avoiding a margin call (given that my margin call maintenance ratio of is 17%) - and the diversification away from growth will probably help derisk my portfolio a little.

My average dividends from the 0.8M adult stocks are &gt;3% and should be able to service the 1.2% interest on the margin loan for the foreseeable future.

As long as I'm comfortable with the leverage - this looks like free money lying on the table provided I do my due diligence to ensure that what I'm investing in is not a dividend trap. I am ok being bearish on USD because I think the massive stimulus is going to lead to strong inflation in the foreseeable future. Also taking on debt at 1% and letting my portfolio grow without tax seems to be way better than paying 30%+ income tax or 15-20% capital gains taxes.

Is there anything that I'm missing here? I know that interest rates going up can change things dramatically - stocks fall and debt servicing goes up - but it doesn't seem like I'm doing anything too different from someone who buys a house worth more than their liquid net worth. The main risk seems to be that the interest rate rises rapidly and I need to pay down the margin loan at a rapid pace - which should be possible for me until I get married/have kids.

Would love to hear people's thoughts on this. Is this crazy? Or have I inadvertently discovered 1%er hacks.",finance

investing,People worried about the 10y yield going out of control should recognise some things.,"As I see it:

1) The yield is already starting to become attractive major foreign buyers. Japanese institutions are the biggest foreign buyers and are continuing to add more.

investing.com/news/economic-indicators/foreigners-raise-holdings-of-us-treasuries-for-second-month-in-january-data-2447322

2) Fear of China selling USTs to cause chaos needs to be seen in the right context. While technically this might be possible, consider the fact that China just had a record $ 100 Billion trade surplus two months vs the US.

To continue to keep their own currency competitive in this humongous inflow of $s, while simutaneously not buying USTs further, they inevitably have turned to buying JGBs. Going on for a while now, and also why the Japanese became the largest holders of USTs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/14/why-china-is-buying-up-more-japanese-government-bonds.html

So what do the gigantosaurous Japanese pension funds do in this instance of massive inflows? They buy even more USTs, which ties back into point 1.

3) With the Fed continuing to buy monthly, a serious lack of treasuries is becoming a thing (believe it or not), expecially in the repo markets.

Overnight rates going -ve .4 for the 2 year, for instance. [On a related note, Fed's ""operation twist"" might actually kill two birds with one stone. That is, restock the front end of the curve with enough bonds, and pull some out of the back end]

4) Also, while ""inflation expectations"" have certainly gone up, we are yet to see proper inflation data (cpi, ppi, etc) reflect this. And given the recent Feb retail sale numbers turning out worse than expected, I'm not sure we are about to get some crazy inflation any time soon.",finance
personalfinance,Is this a good way to allocate this money? (UK),"At the moment, we have £7,650 in our savings account. My husband works full time taking home around £2,000 a month and I'm self employed taking home around £300 a month (we have a young child so I literally work a few hours a month from home and I have one client that I send an invoice in for each month and get £300 a month from them). 

We have £2,868 on our credit card with an interest rate of 20%. We also have £1,140 on an account with Klarna with an interest rate of about 8%. We have also just had our annual council tax bill in for £1,640 which needs paid in April or we can pay monthly for 10 months until Janaury 2022. 

My thoughts are:

Clear the credit card now
Clear the Klarna account now 

We will save another £500 through April then pay the council tax bill at the end of April.

Once all this is done, we will have £3,000 left in the savings account.


Is this a good idea? This time last year I wouldn't have dented our savings this much because everything was so unknown with covid. This year is different as things are looking to get back to normal (hopefully) and we will keep the credit card open just with a zero balance on it so that will be there just in case. 

We own our house (mortgage) but have done a lot to it over the past 6 years so I doubt anything will come up with the house for the foreseeable and all appliances are new. We each have a car with no finance and have both recently passed their MOT. 

If we pay these things off, we will be able to save an extra £500 a month so the savings will be back to what they are now by the end of the year. I know it's a good idea but I'm weary of only having £3,000 in our savings account until we build it back up incase something happens. Am I just being anxious for no reason and should enjoy the fact we can pay these debts off now and save more each month? The credit card will also be there with a £7,000 limit for emergencies.

CryptoCurrency,Do I save with crypto.com or a defi lender?,"I am new to cryptocurrency and for the past month have been moving my investment money from traditional managed investment services to various crypto projects that I believe in and expect to use in the future or profit from if they grow.

Now that I have a 3 months of expenses backed up in my bank account I would like to start putting savings money into crypto instead of my savings bank account with a terrible &lt;1% interest rate. I was originally going to put monthly contributions into bitcoin on [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) and earn &gt;=4.5% annual interest, and also hope that the bitcoin price grows and my savings grow that way as well. However I realise that doing this would almost betray the philosophy of decentralised currency as I'm replacing my bank-managed savings account with another centralised entity. So I looked in to defi lending and saw that I can get \~10% annual interest with Aave if I deposit a stablecoin like TrueUSD. That sounds great but I of course miss out on the opportunity to capitalise on any price increases as stablecoins are pegged to fiat value.

I'm not sure what to choose here. One option would likely see my savings grow the most (if we assume bitcoin is guaranteed to continue rising in price) but betrays the philosophy behind crypto and is vulnerable to hacking, whereas the other is decentralised but would grow my savings less. What would you guys do?

investing,Fed Set To Reaffirm Dovish Stance With Powell Likely To Urge Patience,"Bolstered by the impact of fiscal and Covid-19 stimulus packages, the US Federal Reserve is expected to forecast an improving economic outlook with the labour market and inflation to rebound faster than anticipated in December.

However, traders will likely be disappointed if they are expecting sunnier projections to translate to changes in monetary policy when the US central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ends its two-day meeting on Wednesday.

Reaffirming its extremely dovish stance, the FOMC will hold its funds target range steady at 0%-0.25%, analysts forecast, while the QE monthly purchasing target should remain at “at least” USD 80bln in treasuries and USD 40bn in agency mortgage-backed securities.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to stress a change in plans for interest rates and bond purchases is premature while he wrestles with questions on tapering given the choppiness in bond yields.

While analysts expect the central bank keep rates at current levels through 2023, the recent wave of volatility in money markets has stoked speculation of a break from its holding pattern. The Fed may be forced into a technical adjustment, but virtually no one expects action at this week’s meeting.

&gt; # 1. Dow futures steady as bond yields rise but Nasdaq futures fall

&gt; * Dow futures were steady Wednesday even as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to a new 13-month high ahead of the Federal Reserve’s post-meeting release of new economic and interest rate projections and Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference. However, Nasdaq futures slumped about 1%, in step with recent pressure when bond yields rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday broke a seven-session winning streak, retreating from a record high close. The S&amp;P 500 also fell from a record close, breaking five straight days of higher finishes. The Nasdaq bucked Tuesday’s trend and finished higher.

&gt; # 2. Powell needs to tamp down inflation concerns while defending policy

&gt; * As bond yields rise on concerns about inflation, Powell needs to convince traders that easy current Fed monetary policy won’t overheat a recovering economy that just got another Covid stimulus boost. Central bankers get a new batch of housing data to consider at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect February housing starts to drop 2.5% following a 6% decline in January. Building permits for February are seen falling 7% after January’s 10.4% gain. The Fed concludes its two-day March meeting Wednesday afternoon, with no one expecting any change in rates from near zero or any shift in the extraordinary measures designed to support growth during the coronavirus pandemic.

&gt; # 3. 15% of U.S. adults fully vaccinated; Trump touts shots to supporters

&gt; * New daily Covid cases in the U.S., down about 80% from early January, continued to fall as immunity protection increases from vaccinations and high levels of prior infection. More than 15% of the U.S. adult population has been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, while heading in the right direction, health officials say those vaccination numbers need to go much higher to stomp out the disease, which killed an average of 1,285 people in America over the past seven days, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

&gt; * Former President Donald Trump urged people to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, saying he would recommend it to “a lot of people that don’t want to get it, and a lot of those people voted for me.” However, in a Fox News interview Tuesday night, Trump acknowledged that people were free to decide for themselves whether to get shots.

&gt; # 4. White House sets low bar for Thursday’s U.S.-China meeting

&gt; * The White House is setting low expectations ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security advisor Jake Sullivan’s first face-to-face meeting with their Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. According to a senior Biden administration official, the two sides won’t deliver a joint statement and no major announcements are expected.

&gt; * Reflecting Washington’s concern about the erosion of Hong Kong’s rights, the U.S. sanctioned an additional 24 Chinese and Hong Kong officials over Beijing’s ongoing crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. China said the new sanctions expose America’s “sinister intention to interfere in China’s internal affairs, disrupt Hong Kong and obstruct China’s stability and development.”

&gt; # 5. Uber grants UK drivers worker status after losing labor battle

&gt; * Uber will reclassify all U.K.-based drivers as workers, in the wake of losing a major labor battle there earlier this year. Under the new designation, more than 70,000 drivers in the U.K. will get some benefits, including a minimum wage, holiday time and pension contributions. However, they won’t receive full employee benefits. In a SEC filing, Uber said its U.K. ride-hailing business accounted for 6.4% of all mobility gross bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020. Shares of Uber fell more than 2% in U.S. premarket trading.

CryptoCurrency,Some friendly advice,"Before reading this you need to have a few things in mind. U must not consider this as financial advice as im just an advanced monkey with some dire thoughts. You must also (always) dyor and keep in mind that the only one responsible for your own investments is you.

Binance and other exchanges are experiencing huge growth these days. Along with this the market keeps hitting all time highs. Nothing lasts forever, even this run of the bulls. Acknowledging that basically zero interest rates is the key factor behind all of this is quite important. Not everyone sees the current hyperinflation, but its occuring every day in stonks, crypto, property etc. Others will notice as equity is allocated from these ever-increasing entities to regular commodities. 

-

If u have not prepared yourself in a proper way and smart way it will hurt you among others. Now, having read this so far chances are youre one of those who understands why investing in crypto is essential to combat the challenges ahead. Far from everyone has prepared themselves and they will think that its like lightning coming from clear skies when its not. Large institutions understood this a year back and allocated their capital accordingly. Among these was tudor and lately its musk. To many of us they seemed to show up late to the party, but keep in mind that its better to arrive late then never arriving. In other words, we are no longer strange investors investing in strange projects. Oh, im almost done dont you worry. Now to the closing arguments. 

In a year the total marketcap of crypto grew approximately 10 times. Still, the federal reserve keeps producing dollars that will find their way into the crypto sphere. 

Closely looking at the direction capital flows shows we still will be on this run for some time. Online banking is increasingly being replaced by defi. More and more are seeing this and trying it out. Irrational investors are piling up just for the fun of it. No matter what intentions newcomers have coming into this, their money still counts. Good luck to all of you in your endeavours to overcome the future inflation and spend your money wisely.",cryptocurrency
investing,"Research on Teradyne Inc, a stock seeing an increase in chatter over the last few weeks.","Teradyne Inc, Ticker: **TER (+38% mentions)**

Market cap: $19.5Bn

Teradyne Inc supplies automation test equipment for semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronic systems in the consumer electronic, automotive, industrial, communications and aerospace sector.

Essentially, the chip powering the phone or laptop you are reading this from has most likely been tested by Teradyne.

Teradynes biggest customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Intel, Boeing, Texas Instruments, 3M, and IBM.

Don’t have time to read the whole thing? I’ll summarise below

3 main reasons why I like this stock:

* Overall semiconductor market future
* Finances and balance sheet
* Cathie Wood investment

2 possible downsides:

* Low future earnings forecasts
* Recent price volatility

Future

Almost everything requires a semiconductor now, and that will only grow further in the future, some of the biggest examples are:

* The majority of mobile phones sold nowadays are smartphones, and while that growth has slowed down over the last few years, 1.5 billion a year are still sold.
* The ecosystem surrounding mobile phones is growing rapidly, think tablets, smart watches, headphones, laptops, speakers.
* Internet-of-things devices are booming, think Alexa, smart lighting, ovens, fridges,heating, mirrors etc.
* Car technology (especially in electric cars) is mostly driven by semiconductor technology, shifting further and further away from analog technology
* Gaming, from Playstations to VR headsets, again all require semiconductor technology
* Automated manufacturing

Even without COVID, supply cannot keep up. There have been huge shortages this year for semiconductors causing pinches everywhere *(have you tried purchasing a PS5 recently?)* meaning lots of pent-up demand, even without, a number of HUGE factories have been built or will be built that are expected to ramp up supply. examples of those:

* [Samsung’s $17bn factory](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/319926-samsung-files-documents-to-build-new-17-billion-fab-in-the-united-states)
* [TSM’s $12bn plant](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/15/taiwan-semiconductor-to-build-a-12-billion-chip-pl.aspx)
* [Intel’s $7bn plant, completed in 2020](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145990-intel-fab-42-now-ready-pump-leading-edge-products/)
* [List of all current fabrication plants to give you an idea of size of market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)

All of this will require automation and testing.

Long-term, it’s very safe to assume that irrespective of economic or technological shifts, semiconductor demand will not only sustain, but surge. A few things on the horizon that will likely affect this:

* 5G technology being rolled out worldwide
* Space technology &amp; tourism growth
* AI &amp; data technology

The biggest kicker? Teradyne provide the majority of the automation and testing for all of these sectors, meaning any growth here only benefits them.

Furthermore, to me they are also proofed from the whole *“economy opening up means a move away from tech“* as it’s not like people will stop using electronic devices, unlike companies like Zoom which will see a big drop in usership as normality returns.

Finances

Even during a COVID year, Teradyne grew revenues from $2.29bn to $3.12bn, an increase of 36%.

They grew their net income even further, going from $467m to $784m, an increase of 67%.

Earnings per share *(profit by number of shares)* also grew, from $2.6 to $4.28 (**+64%**) last year which is astounding. (*general consensus is anything above 25% growth is good).*

When taking the price of the stock into account, and looking at Price-to-Earnings ratio *(Price of the stock vs the earnings per share of a stock, the lower the better)* Teradyne has a PE ratio of 24.9x, which is way better than the industry average of 38x.

From a debt position, Teradyne is very healthy with an equity-to-debt ratio *(the lower the better, below 1 means more equity than debt)* of 0.18.

Cathie Wood Investment

Cathie Wood, the very aggressive bullish investor whos ETF [ARK Invest](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ARKK/performance/) saw returns of 152% last year, [has recently purchased a further 139,619 shares](https://247wallst.com/investing/2021/03/12/cathie-woods-ark-invest-buys-and-sells-3-12/) to add to the current position.

Extra purchasing here shows long-term confidence, as this was added after ARK had to rebalance and sell some Teradyne shares last year.

Possible Downsides

Some analysts are predicting modest future revenue growth at 5.8%, compared to the industry average of 16.2%.

Furthermore, the price this year has seen some large volatility, suffering from the sell-off that affected technology and growth stocks earlier this year. If more sell-offs ensue, this could cause the price to drop further in the short term.

Summary

Teradyne commands a large portion of a market that is only growing further every year. A financially healthy and well managed company, with high revenue and EPS growth, along with some strong investment backing. While there may be some volatility in the price of the stock short-term, long-term this company still has tremendous potential.",finance

stocks,"CDX at All Time Low, Bond Yields Continue to Increase.","Corporate debt during the pandemic has increased significantly - the worldwide total of which has reached about $80 trillion dollars. Due to low bond yields, new corporate bonds are typically of a lower grade. Bond traders are trading lower grade bonds due to a total decline in yield in the bond market. Even junk bonds are only giving sub 5% APR. However, they are being misreported by the credit agencies, and even highly graded corporate bonds are actually complete dogshit at the moment. Moody’s + Standard &amp; Poor’s are not weighting variable loans for corporate debt at all basically, since it is their belief that the 10 year will not trade above 2% within the next 3 years, so even corporate bonds with a shit-ton of variable loans may be graded highly. 10 year yield hit a high of 1.68% today, and it’s yield has increased by approximately 60%-70% from the beginning of the year, so idk when the yield will actually stop increasing. 

The yield increasing affects almost every asset class, since they all need to provide an APR that is higher than government bonds (arguably the safest asset class.) So variable loan interest rates will increase proportionally (why would someone loan another money, when there is a less risky option at a higher APR?) We could see the debt bubble begin to weaken as there is an interest rate squeeze in these “Safe” corporate bonds. 

We are also seeing another potential housing bubble - real US home prices are almost back to 2008 levels, with no increase in the real wages of the (US) population, I think it is mostly due to speculation in housing driven by the low interest rate environment, and is being further exacerbated by what seems to be the first bear market in bonds in the past 40 years. (Everyone needs to get in NOW before rates increase, basically) I’m not sure how many of these loans are variable rate, but basically nothing has changed since 2008 to prevent another housing crisis - the CDX is also trading at an all time low. I think a housing bubble is less likely though, since hopefully banks have changed their lending practices, and due to government stimulus. 

Nobody knows what will happen - this is likely the first bear market in bonds in the past 40 years, and it is unlikely that there are traders who can offer insight into trading during 60s-80s. Stay safe out there.",finance

investing,eBay due diligence and why I think the stock is undervalued in an expensive market,"I've drafted up a somewhat short write up on why I believe eBay is a good buy at the current price. Any feedback is encouraged for missing points, disagreements, anything really. Hope you enjoy. 

**Bull Thesis**

•	Revenue growth in Q4 accelerated to 28% year over year and \~35% once you normalize for pending asset sale

•	eBay has a sweetheart deal with Adyen, receiving warrants to purchase up to 5% of Adyen (Adyen is a $80B dollar company)

•	eBay has been aggressively buying back shares over the past 3 years at very good price (37% of the shares outstanding have been bought back)

•	eBay is selling off assets unlocking great value (Classifieds business $11B set to close in 2021)

•	eBay has been paying off debt and refinancing for lower interest rates

•	eBay returning capital to shareholders through dividends 

**Bear Thesis**

•	eBay is a stagnant boomer company used by my parents 

•	The company has been selling off some of their best assets (Stub Hub, Classifieds). 

•	Exceptional growth experienced in 2020 will reverse or at least slow drastically as the vaccine gets administered

**Background**

eBay Inc. operates marketplace platforms that connect buyers and sellers worldwide. The company's Marketplace platform includes its online marketplace at [ebay.com](https://ebay.com) and the eBay suite of mobile apps. Its platforms enable users to list, buy, sell, and pay for items through various online, mobile, and offline channels that include retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants, shopping channels, and networks. The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.

 Over the past few years eBay has changed their business strategy to that of a mature company with stalled growth by refocusing on the core business, divesting non key assets and returning equity to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This all changed in 2020 with the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic causing a resurgence in eBay’s core business. The emerging growth and strategic plays taken by eBay have and will continue to unlock huge value for shareholders. Let me begin. 

**Revenue Growth**

For a long time revenue was flat to declining at eBay, until 2020. Revenue growth on their core business accelerated to 28% YoY in Q4/2020, which excludes lost revenue from the sale of their Classifieds business. Organic revenue growth estimated to be closer to 35%  if we were to normalize and remove Classified’s 2019 revenue. I do not think the market is properly pricing eBay as a technology company with accelerating revenue growth north of 30%. 

eBay trades at under 5x revenue and 25x Free cash flow. These are very reasonable multiples, especially when looking at eBay’s peers. Etsy trades at 20x revenue while Shopify trades at 68x revenue (albeit these companies are growing faster). Amazon seems like a good comparison in terms of revenue growth rates and revenue multiples to eBay. However, Amazon’s gross margin is only 25% versus eBay’s 75% gross margin and EV to Free Cash flow at Amazon is twice that of eBay.  Amazon is more of a traditional online retailer while eBay is a pure marketplace play, but why are they traded at the same revenue multiple? Other technology companies with similar revenue growth rates to eBay are trading at 20-40x revenue. This all leads me to believe that based on eBay’s core business, the eBay is priced at a discount relative to their peers. 

The bear argument would say that the 2020 growth is due to pandemic and things will shift back towards retail as vaccines are administered. This very well may be the case, but when we look at other companies that have this same accelerating growth during the pandemic (Etsy, Shopify, Lightspeed), these companies are priced at exuberate multiples. If we see continued upside in online buying as we live in ‘the new normal’, then eBay should see continued growth in share price as a result of both revenue growing and expansion of valuation metrics given the sustained growth. 

**Adyen Partnership**

In 2002 eBay acquired Paypal for $1.5B. Back in 2002, 70% of eBay’s transactions were processed by PayPal. In 2015 eBay spun out PayPal. You are probably thinking so what PayPal processes transactions for eBay…not anymore. In 2020 the agreement between PayPal and eBay for processing transactions finally ended (5 years after spinout) and eBay started using Adyen for processing transactions. This partnership has many advantages such as eBay owning risk management (higher acceptance rates), and offering improved checkout features to optimize conversion (alternative payment methods). There are additional opportunities down the road that eBay could look into, like consumer financing, wallet, etc…. through their partnership with Adyen. These are opportunities that eBay could not previously do with PayPal as PayPal owned the payment data for customers at checkout. 

But the best part of the deal with Adyen would be the economics. Although eBay does not say, I would be surprised if eBay did not receive discounted pricing from Adyen. A 10bps saving would result in $100m of savings each year, based on 2020 GMV. eBay also received warrants to purchase 5% of Adyen as part of the deal. Adyen is a $80B company. Those warrants have and will continue to print……ALREADY VALUED AT OVER $1B!!! Overall I am bullish on the partnership between Adyen and eBay. 

**Share Buybacks**

Over 389 million (37% OF THE COMPANIES EFFING SHARES OUTSTADING!!!! ) have been bought back by eBay over the past three years. eBay used proceeds from disposing of assets and cash from operations totaling $14.6B and bought back shares at a very low price (\~$37/shares versus todays $60/share). This was a great way to effectively return capital to investors and grow the company’s share price. When you look at the growth in eBay’s share price over the past three years it is almost entirely accounted for simply by these share buy backs. 

**Debt Outstanding**

eBay has $7.7B of debt outstanding. The debt is easily serviceable through eBays free cash flow (2020 free cash flow of $3.3B versus $300m interest expense). So you might think the story ends there, nope. eBay has paid off $3.3B of debt over the past 3 years. Again utilizing their cash from operations to improve their balance sheet. The story is not done yet. eBay’s management team has been doing a great job optimizing their interest payments as interest rates come down through refinancing debt at lower rates and paying off debt with high interest rates. In Q1 2021 eBay repaid a $750m note with a 6% interest rate (this was the earliest they were eligible to repay the note at face value). This alone should save the company $45m a year in interest expense. 

**Dividends**

In 2019 eBay started paying a dividend of  $0.14/share (about a 1% payout). Hey, dividends are nice and they attract a longer term stable investor. 

**Classifieds** **Sale**

eBay is selling Classifieds business to Adevinta for a package valued at over $11B ($2.5B cash and Adevinta shares). They are losing only $200m of income from Classifieds business so the impact to free cash flow is 10% all while unlocking $11B of value.

**StubHub**

In February 2020 eBay sold off their StubHub business for $4billion in all cash sale. Could the timing of this transaction have been any better? Right before the pandemic, selling off a ticket resale business for large events….and using the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares of eBay at a depressed price. Long term eBay is losing a valuable asset, but I do not think they could have gotten a better ROI on these assets over how things played out. 

**Ownership**

The stock does have a major ownership stake by Pierre Omidyar (founder) who owns 7% of the company. Since his departure from the board in 2020 he has been selling his shares. In Q4/2020 he sold 13m shares. As he continues to sell there could be some pressure on the share price, but in my opinion this is also a reason likely why the stock is still cheap. I expect Pierre to continue to liquidate as he focuses on philanthropy.",finance

personalfinance,Student loans and savings,"I'm considering using the remaining time of the COVID student loan interest forbearance to dump savings into a higher-interest account. The idea here is to build up interest on cash savings, and then pay as much as possible into my student loans right before the end of forbearance (October 1st 2021 is when interest begins to accrue again).

&amp;#x200B;

I already use Betterment, through which I have a Roth 401k and an emergency fund. They offer a special account called [Cash Reserve](https://www.betterment.com/resources/betterment-everyday-faq/#13) and advertise this as the exact account for my needs (essentially an easily transferrable cash account with a 0.4% apr).  My questions are thus:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Because this account relies on market fluctuations for interest rate, is this a bad idea? In that I could lose more than I invested and end up farther behind?
2. For the sake of argument, say I put in 10K, and contribute 1K / month for the next 6 months (ending 10/1/21). This earns me like $20 worth of interest? Am I calculating this right? Is this even worth the risk?
3. I also have that 'emergency fund' account through betterment which is 90 stocks / 10 bonds split, and which currently has about 8K in it. This is about $5,800 in deposits since 1/5/2015 and about $2,200 in earnings through dividends and market changes in that time. Over the last 3 months, this account has grown by about 500 in earnings. Does it make more sense to capitalize on this hopefully-ongoing-market-trajectory and put the aforementioned $10K into this account instead? This carries a higher risk due to more market fluctuations.... but may - hopefully - pay out better in the next 6 months? 
4. Since 7/2019, I have paid off my car ($14,000) as well as about $29,000 in student loans. I have another $108,000 to go. Should I just dump extra directly into student loans? Even if the Biden admin decides to forgive 50K in student loans - which is highly unlikely to happen - I will STILL have another $60K to go, so holding out doesn't really make any sense. Should I skip all the investment shenaniganry and just put extra into loans as I have been already doing? Is it even worth the gamble or should I just stay the course?

Thanks in advance, kind people of PF!",finance

&amp;#x200B;

I have saving up for a couple years for my first home, and considering that covid is very likely to end this year, I would like to jump in before the interest rate go up again. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was doing some research for myself, I learned that pre-qualification is the very basic first step for home buy, and it does not impact my credit score. However, when I pick up the phone a talk to lenders from big banks like Chase, and local lenders, they all insist on only giving out pre-approval. I do already have 20% down ready and a credit score of 770+, and still non of them want to give out only a pre-qualification.

Is my understanding of pre-qualification wrong? Or pre-qualification is just not worth the time for lenders in the current competitive market? One lender told me that a pre-approval credit pull docks at most 10 points and go back up within 3 months, is that also true?

personalfinance,Could debt consolidation help my credit score in the killing run.,"So I’m a bit in debt. It’s not particularly bad, around $12k across various sources. The bulk of that is a personal loan I’ve been paying off for a while now and a credit card with an 18% interest rate. The rest is mostly a number of various old bills that went to collections from a few hundred to just under a grand.

I have no doubts that I could pay it all off. I make enough money now it’s not really a worry. My main consideration is the hit to my credit score, which is very low as of now.

I’m curious if consolidating most or all of this debt would be worth it in the medium-long run for my credit score. If I can move a number of various accounts under one account and make constant payments towards it, would it be better for my credit score than to pick off various accounts one by one? I believe I can manage to pay off everything either way in 3-5 years worst case.",finance

economy,The Bond Market Are Relevant Again,"Traders or investment managers sometimes say they know it’s bad when  random relatives ask them whether they should buy random assets. While I  am far from being either, I still get a lot of questions from friends  (who are *not* into finance) about what they should invest in.  So, in the craziness of today’s markets, with all time highs being  printed every month and everybody seemingly getting rich on Revolut, why  bother talking about the *bond* markets? 

While  trying to understand the relevance of the volatility in US government  bonds from recent weeks, it’s useful to start with the fundamentals.

### Where are the bonds trading and how did they get there?

When  people mention ""rates sell-offs"" they are usually referring to downward  pressures on the prices of government bonds. In recent weeks, the focus  has been on US Treasuries (which are the government bonds backed by the  United States). Drilling down even more, we look at rate usually  referenced in market commentary (the 10-year US Treasury note), which,  at pixel time, is trading at a modest 1.62%.

So, what's all the  fuss about? The discount rates we use in ""applied"" examples in arcane  accounting modules at uni is 6%, so 1.62% surely seems low enough. Well,  the situation has been altered over the past decade by government  intervention, which changed the rules of the game by quite a bit.  Central banks have provided the markets with never-before-seen [monetary stimulus](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/basics/monpol.htm), which is implemented through either interest rate cuts, asset purchases, or both.

Interest rate cuts involve lowering the rate (or, more precisely, a *base* rate) at which people and institutions can borrow money from each other. Asset purchases (also known as [quantitative easing](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-quantitative-easing-definition-and-explanation-3305881)),  involves a central bank buying securities (like, say, government bonds)  in the open market. Both have the effect of lowering long-term bonds  yields.

You would like to hold the bonds if you knew the  government will also come and buy trillions of dollars of them, right?  This is pretty much the fundamental dynamic which has governed the  markets in recent years. COVID-19 has done nothing but accelerate this  trend.

### Where are we now?

Something commonly  asserted is that, over time, the effect of the government intervention  in supporting financial markets has created ""complacency"" for investors.  What this means is market participants have slowly started to assume  that the support from central banks such as the Federal Reserve (in the  US) and the European Central Bank (ECB) is here to stay.

Moreover,  they are permanently demanding assurances from continued support. As  this support never seems to cease, we see equity markets (and most other  risk assets) on a sustained rally. *As a side note, this leaves a  lot of capital in people's hands and is arguably one of the reason why  sofa traders are seemingly getting rich overnight,* [*Shaquille O’Neal*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2020/10/20/shaq-moves-into-spacs-with-former-disney-execs--mlk-jrs-son/) *is doing SPACs or artists sell JPEGs for* [*$69 million*](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/)*.*

In  recent months, the central banks seem to be facing a series of apparent  challenges. The one grabbing the spotlight is the prospect of  inflation. Why should we care? As the governments are printing money and  supporting economies through fiscal stimulus (see below), a ""return"" of  inflation is becoming plausible. This makes government bonds less  attractive for investors, prompting sell-offs similar to what the rates  markets have been experiencing in recent weeks.

### Is this relevant for other asset classes?

A [common phrase](https://www.ft.com/content/6e21921a-7cdc-4ba3-ad3a-8c7ed84681d2)  in financial press these days goes along the lines of: ""This \[rates  sell-offs\] is especially relevant for high-growth technology companies  whose valuations have been underpinned by low rates.""

This might  sound confusing, but the argument is fairly straightforward. Indices  such as Nasdaq Composite are composed of growth companies, i.e. firms  which are using the low rates available to borrow cheaply and finance  their growth. Hence, yields going up is hurting growth companies, which  are now dominating equity markets in the US and beyond. *This is a  break in the traditional relationship we learn about in finance  textbooks, namely the inverse correlation between stocks and bonds.*

While  similar lines of reasoning apply to other asset classes, the central  idea is that higher levels of yields for US Treasuries pose a risk for  the rally in growth assets. It might be useful to keep an eye on  inflation prints, 10-year rate and the DXY. 

The story above will hopefully illuminate why a lot of the recent headlines on Bloomberg seem to be about the Treasury markets.

personalfinance,"IRS holding my money for ""fraud""?","Hi all!

I'll cut to the chase. I (23M) am trans and recently changed my name and updated my social security card from my new name. I filed my 2020 taxes on Feb. 11th through turbotax and was told my filing was accepted. My state return was direct deposited about week later, but I still haven't received my federal return.

My federal return also included 1800 dollars from past economic relief (""stimmy"") payments that I didn't get last year due to a ""fraud"" issue where there were apparently two names (my deadname and my changed name) in the SS system registered to one social security number. I was told this would be resolved with my 2020 taxes filed. 

Now today I tried to check the status of the latest stimmy payment on the IRS website and was told my information couldn't be accessed. I tried to check my tax return status and was given the same notice. I tried calling the stimmy phone number for the irs and was immediately disconnected due to high call volume. The same happened when I called the specific tax line, and a couple other of the general help customer service lines.

So now I have no idea what to do. Do I just wait until the phone lines calm down? Do I go to my local IRS office and try to talk to someone? Can TurboTax help me navigate getting this fake ""fraud"" cleared up?

Some facts:

* Savings (savings account): 40,000
* Debt: maybe 500 USD on credit cards
* Roth IRA: 11,500 - Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (Settlement fund)

* Checking account: 1-2000
* Expenses (monthly): 2,000
* Play money: 500 (rest into savings)
* Total assets: \~76,000

Second, I'm thinking about increasing the 401k contributions until I hit the cap, but it'll make money less liquid if I'm buying a house.  


Third, I was saving for a house, but prices keep going up and I'm not sure where I'd want to live. 40,000 sitting in a savings account isn't the worse, but it'll grow more and I feel like inflation is coming. What should I look into for off-loading this money, maybe minus emergency fund. Do I dump it into SP500, or do I just keep adding until there's enough for a house down payment (400,000 / 20-30,000 dp)?  


Feeling like I'm missing out, just need some thoughts on whether I'm doing something stupid currently and where to go from here. Or point me into a direction, I can read more.",finance

Age: 28F

Marital status: single

Location: New Jersey - most likely will stay here for the unforeseeable future (5+ years), as my career field is highly concentrated in this area

Pre-tax annual income: $150,000 base salary (I get a target 15% annual bonus on top of this). Important to note: I went to school for an advanced degree + post-doctoral training (8 years total). So, I have only been within this income bracket for 1.5 years. 

Total savings: $30,000 (this includes emergency savings)

Debt: $75,000 in federal student loans - I make monthly payments on these

Investments: Employer-provided 401K - I invest the max employer-matched pre-tax contribution each paycheck (6% from me, employer matches 6%); Employer-provided HSA account

Current housing: Living alone, renting a 2 bedroom/2 full bathroom luxury apartment in an apartment complex community for $2,077/month. Additional costs include utilities, water, and internet. The building also has a gym I use daily- cost of amenities are $300/year. My year lease is up July 1, 2021.

My current thoughts: I love my apartment. I really don't want to buy right now. I like the luxury of renting and the peace of mind knowing that if anything happens, it's not my responsibility. I live alone and work 12+ hour days, so I really don't have the time or energy to stress about homeowner responsibilities, as it would all fall on me (no roommate, partner, etc). I'd rather invest the money I'd spend on a down payment for a condo in the stock market, mutual funds, or bonds.

Another piece: My mother is a realtor and has been on my case daily about buying a condo vs continuing to rent my apartment. She argues that I am ""throwing my money away"" by renting, as I am simply just paying the landlord's mortgage, property taxes, with added buffer for repairs, up-keep, and his profit. She also says that interest rates are at an all time low, and I would be stupid not to get a mortgage now.

Thoughts? Any counter-arguments to my mother's? Any general arguments for/against buying/renting?

Forex,Midweek Hindsight session! GBP/USD,"As promised a few hours ago I will share my thoughts on the week. Only Hindsight today, will share an actual chart tomorrow for Thursday probably for New York Session don't know yet.

So what we see this week should already show you how the market moves when specific events happen at the right time. First I will show you a H1 Chart of the current week and discuss what I am seeing.

[H1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/5py6ccsmomn61.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=345c35b5f538b670ac53c249b4b5251952a928af)

So I wanna keep my charts clean and simple I think. It's useless if I have 10 Boxes 20 Lines and everybody is confused. I think I will outline the most important that just when you look at it you should understand what's going on. So I think it is already clear what I wanna explain today. Of course you can't act blindly on what I tell you here and just trade without looking at the chart. So what I am about to tell is not like a holy grail you should take for granted and just take trades with out question it critically. Especially in this business you are mostly on your on, but obviously it's never wrong to look into new things.

As you can see the London Session has been exactly the same for Tuesday and Wednesday and on both days there was a chance to make profits in New York session since London already gave us hints what direction NY will trade to. So the two lines shown in the chart are 1.) Low of the previous day (Monday Low) and 2.) High of Tuesday. So what do I look for before I even consider a Trade I want a High or Low being broken, because that's when the real and ""easy"" setups come around. As outlined Tuesday plays into our hands by breaking Mondays low during London session and on Wednesday it breaks the high of Tuesday during London session. Did I know that it will reverse during New York session as I saw the Low (Tuesday) or High (Wednesday) being broken?? No I did not \^\^ But I will show you when I did when I go more in depth on the Tuesday! So what you can take away here is that once a Low or High is broken the real profit setups form either in form of reversing or continuing.

Now we will go in depth of the Tuesday of this GBP/USD Chart!

[GBP\/USD M5](https://preview.redd.it/9aoz0n7ksmn61.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b52e35bd6700e7e2163a4b5c506f4fa5e0bbdbb)

I hope you can see shit on this image on my screen it looks scuffed right now, but hopefully it will be fine once I posted it. So Here I quickly explain what showed me that this is not a dump but a stop run that just happend in London session. A dump on H1 is a steady falling chart on low time frame, really rarely you see big black or green candles on M1 and M5 chart. Usually you will see a lot of lower lows or higher highs and working it's way up or down. So when am I convinced that the chart will turn. I start paying attention once a previous high is broken on lower time frame. As you can see here at the start of New York we break the most previous high that was created during the dump that happend in London. Right there I started to look for a long entry, which took place with the next M5 Candle. The 2 black Candles I outlined with the white box are now support for me! So once it trades inside of them I will go long. As showed on the chart it barely touches it with almost no draw down. From here you can decide the target and the Stop Loss yourself. Whatever you feel comfortable with.

So this would conclude my ""short"" thoughts on what happend so far this week. Usually on Thursday I make my most profits so I will probably share a chart either GBP or EUR before New York opens. :)

I hope this was informative and as said in my (Welcome back post) I don't wanna offend anyone who might trade a different style. I just wanna share my thoughts and try to help some people with it.

3.) Spouse makes around $100K a year, but that may change in the next few months as he is looking to move from outside sales to HR/consulting work. I think a more realistic salary will be in the $60-80K range. The likely pay cut will be an adjustment but needed for his mental health (the high pressure and constant sales grind is getting to him)

4.) I make $45K, but I am expecting my first child in June and then will be completing my counseling degree from September-March, and may not work during that time. 

5.) We live in the Portland, Oregon metro area and average home prices are close to the $500K mark with 20+ plus offers and tens of thousands over asking 

6.) We are currently renting a small daylight basement apartment from family well below market value 

7.) My husband is a dual UK/US citizen and we are strongly considering a move to western England or southeastern Wales in the next few years in order to be closer to his family 

Are we better off getting on the ladder now while interest rates are low and try to sell in the next few years if we move to the UK (hoping that appreciation continues at a similar rate and we can further pad our savings?) Or do we hold tight and just continue to save (for the UK, current goal is $100K), especially considering the likely changes to our current income levels? 

While it’ll be good to have as much money as possible behind us if we move over, we’d likely have to wait two years to get on the housing market there as we’d have to establish our credit (credit scores are excellent here and non-existent there) so home ownership would be at least 4 years out from now. We’re just feeling anxious that would be too long/we’d be too “old” to be first-time buyers and we will have to resign ourselves to renting for the remainder of our lives. I know that sounds a bit doom and gloom but recently articles on the housing affordability crisis are really getting to me. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,28% Interest Rate,"After a massive debt paydown last year my partner and I are down to our last $11k and some change. 

$3800 from his student loan.. currently on a forbearance. Payments are currently scheduled to resume later this year. 

Also $7000 on a car loan with the 28% interest rate (Relocated states, horrible credit, low income at the time, and just desperate). We have had this car since 2018 and it kinda of goes without saying that absolutely nothing is paid on it. We make the monthly payment on it. Nothing more. To pay it off in full it's $7200. From my research it sounds like we can't even trade it in at this point... we would like too. 

I've read on here about getting a personal loan for $7k and we got a preapproved for a few at 34.99% LOL. -\_-

So anyway what is the best way to go about paying off this car and student loan. With the Stimulus we should be getting $4200 which would payoff his student loan. Or make a significant dent on the car loan. But I'm scared that if we put $4200 down on the car the interest rate with eat it up all over again. Should we continue making the payments while saving $3000 and then paying it off at once. The loan matures 6/23.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 17, 2021","Stocks edged higher, rallying sharply in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) key monetary policy meeting and an upgraded economic outlook by the Federal Reserve. Treasury yields rose again, with the 10-year benchmark at 1.646% at the time of writing.

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to speak tomorrow.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

Concerns continue to flare regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Germany, France, Italy, and Spain becoming the latest countries to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination efforts, which were already behind schedule. Studies are currently being conducted in the UK and other places. More information is needed.

It was a solid day today, even with the uncertainty today due to waiting on the fed's decision whether or not to increase the interest rates. Even before their decision, $BB is still holding very well. \~1% in the red for most of the day, and once they released no interest rate hikes we spiked \~4% from today's low. That's awesome.  


ICYMI - Feds are saying there are no interest rate hikes likely through 2023  
SOURCE: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/fed-decision-march-2021-fed-sees-stronger-economy-higher-inflation-but-no-rate-hikes.html)  


What does this mean, you ask?   
Interest rates are also known as the ""price of money"". Low interest means borrowing money is cheap, and if borrowing money is cheap you can take out a loan and make more money with that loan, negating the cost of interest you need to pay per month to the bank.  


For the dumb-dumbs: Money easy to borrow. Borrow money from bank and put money into stock market. Borrowed money easy to repay if stock market go up.   


For ultra-dumb dumb: Replace the word ""money"" in the sentence above with ""banana"". Borrowed money make banana into bigger banana.  


What else happened with $BB what the fuck else do you have to say?  
Low volume. Extremely low volume. From [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com), this was the lowest trading day since January 13th. Lowest trading volume in over two months. Why is this relevant?  


We are green on very low volume. Green on low volume means people are accumulating slowly and holding. No/hardly any sellers. I can only assume that this is due to a lot of baggies and that there's a lot of people interested in having this stock hit that sweet $15 strike price this Friday. I'm currently expecting a lot of volatility in the next couple of days due to:  
\-No interest rate hikes  
\-$BB still holding that strong uptrend  
\-Very tight Bollinger Bands on the daily and hourly  
\-RSI on Daily, 4-hour, Hourly are smack dead in the center. This means we are not overbought so we have room to go up, that being said this also means we can go down.  
\-Triple Witching. Read this if you don't know what this is.   [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triplewitchinghour.asp)  


With tight Bollinger Bands, the RSI in the middle the stock is able to go either direction in the next couple of days, and triple witching hour happening this Friday, this means $BB COULD, by technical analysis methods, be very violent. Up or down.  


Right now, for those of you that are long and strong like me, do not worry about tomorrow or Friday if $BB goes down. Daily fluctuations do not matter in the long term.  
If $BB spikes, we might see some crazy numbers if it breaks the line at \~14.44.  


Enjoy the rest of your day and I'll catch you guys on my recap of the week on March 19th.  


Take care.",finance

personalfinance,Account juggling for taxes,"I've been looking at a few different ways to see how I can minimize taxes on my gains.  Here's the initial context:

A non tax advantaged mutual fund with 60k, 40k in unrealized gains.

An Income of 60k in a given tax year

A desire to retire early with minimal penalties

A company 401k plan with a 1% match. Roth available.

a 30 year mortgage at 2.875%

0% state income tax

&amp;#x200B;

I currently can't afford to max out my 401k to the $19,500 limit.  I could afford to do this If I used the money from the mutual fund to support my lifestyle.  This would effectively move the money from this mutual fund into the Roth 401k.  However, I would be taxed on the earnings in the mutual fund, meaning less money to make earnings on, while also taxed on the money going into the RothIRA.  This would also make my gross income inflated for the years this occurs making me pay a higher federal income tax.  A reason I've been skeptical about putting more than a matching % into a 401k is that I value the flexibility of the money and the option to make withdrawals without penalties.  If I can take money out of a Roth 401k up to contribution without penalty, this sounds like it would work great.  If I retired early I could keep withdrawing money from the Roth 401k without penalty and hope that by the time I start eating into the gains section I've hit 59.5 years of age.

What I'm asking here is if for my goals should I keep money in the mutual fund, move it via this strategy to a roth 401k, or some other option?  Given this scenario, what about future investments? with an emergency fund already developed and high debts paid off, where should excess income be placed?",finance

personalfinance,"A more detailed explanation of the $10,200 unemployment exclusion","There have been a lot of requests asking for an ELI5 version of the [$10,200 unemployment compensation exclusion post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m544kk/the_irs_has_released_guidance_on_how_to_handle/). So this is my attempt at that; in particular, I want to talk about the concept of withholding taxes and what it means and doesn't mean toward the UCE.

I'll start with the general concept of withholding. Simply put, tax withholding (in any context) is a GUESS. It is almost never exactly correct. Whoever is withholding your money is guessing how much tax you'll have to pay on the money they're giving you. And a guess is the best they can do--no one can know exactly how much tax you need to pay until the end of the year, but the IRS wants the money during the year, not at the end of the year. That's why you file your taxes at the beginning of the next year--to reconcile the withholding (guesses) from the previous year to what you actually should have paid. For example, if your job guessed that you should have paid $1,500 in tax but you really should have paid $1,000 in tax, then your job paid $500 too much to the IRS on your behalf and you get that back when you file.

How does this apply to unemployment? If you had money withheld from your unemployment, like all withholding, it was a guess. It wasn't even a very educated guess--just a flat 10% no matter what other income you had or didn't have. (And some states screwed that up and didn't tax 10% of all unemployment income.) So even if the UCE didn't exist, you would still need to file your taxes this year to reconcile that guess with the amount you really should have paid.

All that said, the UCE does NOT subtract from your withholding. It subtracts from how much unemployment you received, not how much tax was withheld. Your withholding or lack thereof actually makes no difference in how the UCE works. Withholding will change how much you owe or get refunded, but it doesn't change how much you \*should\* have paid to the IRS during the year.

Let me illustrate with a simple example. Let's say you're single, you got $25,000 in unemployment in 2020 and had no other income. If you withheld and lived in a state that got it right, 10% of that was taken out, or $2,500. That's the guess that was made. Now let's look at how much tax you actually owe. Before I run the numbers, let me explain that in 2020, everybody got to deduct $12,400 from their income before they pay a cent of tax. That's called the standard deduction. (It is possible to increase that in some cases by itemizing, but that's beyond the scope of this post.) So now for the numbers:

Income: $25,000

Deduction: $12,400

Taxable income: $25,000-$12,400 = $12,600.

Actual tax owed: $1,318.

How did I get that last figure? By looking it up in the [IRS tax table](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040tt.pdf). Don't worry if that table looks intimidating--any decent tax software has that table programmed in.

Now we need to reconcile. During 2020, you paid $2,500 in taxes to the government--that was the (very naïve) guess that was made as to how much tax you owed. But you only really owed $1,318. So you get the difference back. $2,500-$1,318 = $1,182 goes back to your pocket after you file. Of course, it's money you already paid, so in reality you gave the government an interest free loan. But I digress.

Now let's apply the Unemployment Compensation Exclusion (UCE). The UCE states that, under most circumstances, the first $10,200 of your unemployment income isn't taxable. (Of course, the UCE can't be more than the actual amount of unemployment you received during the year, so if you received $7,500 in unemployment, then your UCE is $7,500, not $10,200.) To apply this to the example above:

Income: $25,000

UCE: -$10,200

Taxable income before deduction: $25,000 - $10,200 = $14,800

Deduction: $12,400

Taxable income: $14,800-$12,400 = $2,400

Actual tax owed: $241 (again, from the IRS tax table)

Tax you'll get back: $2,500 (this was the guess made during the year) - $241 (actual tax owed) = $2,249

So in this example, the UCE netted you an extra $1,067 ($2,249-$1,182).

Some key points:

* No matter what, if you got unemployment benefits in 2020 and had tax withheld, you must file taxes. This would be true even if the $10,200 UCE didn't exist. This is how you reconcile the withholding (the guesses) made during the year with how much you truly should have paid.
* It's impossible to say exactly how much money you'll get back from the UCE without actually calculating the exact tax based on all of your numbers--we can make educated guesses, but there's no shortcut to get the exact amount, and our guess could be way off. So if you really want to know, you should run your taxes twice in your favorite tax software: once without the UCE and once with the UCE. Then compare the results. And of course, make sure you run \*all\* your numbers for both scenarios--include any other income you got (jobs, bank interest, etc.) and any withholding that was taken out as well.
* If you've already filed, had any unemployment income, and are eligible for the UCE, then your tax burden will almost certainly be reduced, and you almost certainly will get money back. The IRS is still working out how they'll handle this situation, so sit tight and bookmark [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-statement-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-statement-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021) .
* I haven't talked about how the UCE can make you eligible for various tax credits or increase the size of those credits if you were eligible for them in the first place. That's beyond the scope of this post, but just know if your income was low, you might get a small or even large extra boost from those credits. Any decent tax software will calculate which credits you're eligible for.
* I focused on federal taxes in this post, but the same concepts will apply for state taxes if you had those withheld. EDIT: What I mean by this is that the amount of state tax you'll get back will be (state tax withheld) - (state tax owed), and of course if that quantity is negative, then you'll owe tax. But the details could be vastly different depending on what state you live in--I don't think all states have even said they're going to allow the UCE to reduce one's state tax liability.

Hope this helps.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Big tech and crypto: from blue checkmark to the new order,"If you are following Charles Hoskinson on YouTube, you probably have seen the video on *""blue checkmark""*. (For those unfamiliar, Charles is the main figure behind Cardano blockchain platform.) The term refers to the symbol that decorates verified accounts on Twitter, and means they actually are under control of the person they claim to be.

The story is of course about something more than a mere checkmark. It's about basic rules of human interaction and elementary decency, which the social media have apparently lost... or perhaps dropped them intentionally?

For a couple of months already there have been another crypto bubble ongoing. Like in 2017, plenty of scammers pop up, impersonating known figures. It's hard to watch YouTube without seeing an ad where Elon Musk is asking to participate in a crypto giveaway. He promises that for every amount transferred to his address the sender would receive twice as much. Naive, stupid — you may think Well, there are lots of people falling for that.

Overall losses are already counted in millions of dollars and in the eyes of many victims, unfamiliar to technical aspects, the crypto industry seems like a huge scheme set up by scammers and cheaters. For many of them this opinion sets deeply and probably for their remaining lifetime. Having things stolen is a deep experience.

Charles talked about it in his original, empathetic way. Using rational thinking but talking to the emotions, he sketched grave social effects such activities could bring about. He's so much better at explaining it, so I recommend watching it (link at the end of this post).

He asked a simple question: Why the social media companies (esp. Twitter) don't allow him to have the account verified and the blue checkmark stamped on his profile screen? He's actually the right person to ask such question, as there's [another Charles Hoskinson](https://twitter.com/cehoskinson) on Twitter and he's got the checkmark. Cardano CEO, on the other hand, had his requests refused under the pretence ""they do not continue the program"".

Why that clever algorithm, which detects when someone said ""coronavirus"" or ""covid"" and marks the video with pandemic info box underneath, it cannot be used to detect ""giveaway"" or ""airdrop""?

Why the deplatforming weapon so recklessly used against politicians from broad spectrum, ranging from Donald Trump to Ron Paul, cannot be used to remove scammers' accounts?

Why the social media have taken so anti-social stance, turning blind eye to obvious criminal activity, or even profiting from it indirectly by charging for ads being streamed?

**I think these are rhetorical questions. Charles is a public, exposed figure and he cannot express accusations he's got no solid proof for. However, I do.**

Let's have a look at the state of the world economy. Advancements of the plandemics (no to confuse with the pandemics ongoing alongside) have caused, that in the name of security millions of people have been banned from work and thousands of companies defaulted. That's especially visible in retail and services industries. The lockdown has hit especially small and mid-sized businesses, those being close to the people. Big corporations can always get a enerous bailout or have their bonds purchased with preferable interest rate (effectively negative).

Once the people will have been degraded enough and small businesses decimated, those big corps will divide empty market among themselves. In some countries, government-owned companies will also take their share, although given the level of cooperation with authorities, most of those corporations have already became govt-owned at some level.

We don't have to wait until the lockdowns have been lifted to see that happen. Look at retail, which has moved online once the physical shops have been suffocated by the new laws. Who gained the most are big players, ranging from enormous Amazon down to local mid-sized ones like Allegro (Central European here). Thanks to the scale effect, they are able to manage supply chains more effectively and negotiate better fares with delivery companies that drop the goods at customers' front doors.

So far it sounds like a net gain for the consumer. But really does it?

In about 10 years virtually all the retail trade will have been done online, where huge platforms will dominate. Amazon, Aliexpress, eBay, and a handful of indomitable local players who still hold out against the invaders. Physical shops will also be dominated by huge chains like Jeronimo Martins, Lidl, Carrefour, Auchan (or Walmart on the other side of the pond). Independent shops will become a rarity and will likely serve business niches, not the trade of everyday items.

Meanwhile the governments will eradicate cash, which allegedly spreads the virus so efficiently, and finish their development of CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies). All people will be granted accounts at the central bank, superseding the private banking and making it useless. Since that moment, if the Big Brother decides to dislike your company, you will be cut off from the financial system and there won't be any competition you'd turn to in order to use their services.

How do you think, given such environment of a handful of corporations and their government bed fellows, how broad would be the choice of means of payment? You'll be able to settle deals using a handful of CBCDs and... that's all. In cashless supermarkets only plastic cards of two approved operators will be accepted.

Where's the future where we are shopping with crypto? Perhaps Facebook's Libra, should Zuck agree to share his profits with other market players, in exchange of having it added to the basket of blessed payment forms.

Or perhaps crypto won't be used for shopping, but like it's today, as a store of value and a speculative asset? I wonder how do you plan to realize your gains. At an exchange keeping their accounts at the central bank? Do you think it would be allowed? Even now, in the era of private banking, there are numerous examples of exchanges being shut down, driven to bankruptcy or chased abroad because of hostile financial authority or just denial of service by the banks. Do you think a central bank, having finally gained absolute control of the currency, even that being stored at citizens' wallets, would allow for widespread cryptocurrency use?

If you think my vision is dystopian, try to imagine you're at the beginning of 2020. What if someone would tell you then, that a restaurant owner could be heavily fined for having a customer just sit at their restaurant table? Or that you might get punished financially for not having your mouth covered by a mask while walking down the street? You'd probably say it sounded like in Venezuela. Well, talking about that beautiful country, please note that the boss of the regime, Nicolas Maduro, has the blue checkmark on Twitter. Do you still hold any illusions along what ideological lines contemporary alliances are being aligned?

The pandemic has shown there's no country in the world openly breaking out of the common approach. It's astonishingly difficult — and that strikes me the most — to find people openly questioning the ongoing policies and loudly asking whether they actually are useful in fighting the progress of the disease. The easiness of pushing agenda into people's minds by the media is dreadful.

Therefore I daresay the crypto scams described above haven't been allowed accidentally, nor are they a result of negligence by social media employees. This is a consciously waged first phase of war on cryptocurrencies, initiated by big tech corps and their government bed partners. The objective is to defame and discredit the key figures of the crypto world and finally, to ruin all the trust in the industry as a whole. Cryptocurrencies, in common opinion, are to remain a toy for speculators and scammers trading worthless digital symbols. A toy that the protective government would better disallow.

In exchange for that favor the governments / central banks will add some fiats to corporate accounts, so they could more efficiently compete with small businesses set up on hard-earned money. Soon there will be just two kinds of employers: the state and big corporations. The people, collectively expropriated from their savings by inflation and the war on crypto, will be tied by loans and forced to pay them off by laboriously earned CBDC tokes, the same that privileged entities would receive effortlessly.

*""You will own nothing, but will you be happy?""*

And for the dessert, the promised video from Charles Hoskinson. I admire him for sounding so optimistic despite all circumstances:

Great insight regarding the new stimulus: 

&gt;On TV on February 7, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen responded to a question about inflation risk posed by the proposed Covid-19 relief package with a long discourse on the importance of delivering relief to Americans who are suffering. Few would argue with that premise. She also made clear that she believes it’s better to provide too much relief than too little. True as well. But that doesn’t mean (a) the more relief the better or (b) there aren’t risks attached. Experts from both sides of the political aisle have questioned whether the $1.9 trillion relief package under discussion is too much and/or misdirected; Larry Summers, a progressive economist, wrote to that effect in The Washington Post on February 4:


&gt;*. . . a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 — an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.*


&gt;*In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package — but without any new stimulus — the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.*


&gt;*In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large. . . .*


&gt;*Another [way of assessing the scale of a fiscal program] is to look at family income losses and compare them to benefit increases and tax credits. Wage and salary incomes are now running about $30 billion a month below pre-Covid-19 forecasts, and this gap will likely decline during 2021. Yet increased benefit payments and tax credits in 2021 with proposed stimulus measures would total about $150 billion — a ratio of 5 to 1. The ratio is likely even greater for low-income individuals and families, given the targeting of stimulus measures. . . .*


&gt;*. . . while there are enormous uncertainties, there is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability. (Emphasis added)*


His conclusion is also key:

&gt;The bottom line is this: given current conditions, should investors be at their usual risk position, more defensive or more aggressive? **While the risk-adjusted returns of most asset classes seem to be at rough equilibrium relative to each other, all absolute returns are ultra-low, commensurate with today’s equally low interest rates.** On balance, I think it’s appropriate to be in one’s normal stance, perhaps with a modest bias toward defense. Since the rewards for moving further out on the risk curve – such as yield spreads – aren’t lavish, I have trouble seeing this as a time to aggressively chase high returns. **Moreover, the surer one is that rates will soon rise meaningfully, the more cautious one should be today.**",finance

stocks,Now is a great opportunity to go long $TLT,"As the title indicates, I believe now is a great time to start building a position in the twenty-year Treasury ETF, ticker $TLT.

This is not a revolutionary idea--probably because I am not a financial advisor, and my thoughts on capital markets should not be misconstrued as investment advice. I am, however, a businessman. As a businessman, I have experience doing business things. It might therefore be pertinent for you all to consider my thesis, for academic purposes at the least.

The last month or two have been, hm, shall I say humorous. Gracefully, I held my tongue as the entire market flipped out about rising treasury yields. Why was I calm amid sharp equity selloffs, rocketing yields, and talk of damaging inflation?

Because a) we've heard this story too many times before, b) not mutually exclusive from a), Jerome kept on trying and trying to tell everyone that rates wouldn't rise for the foreseeable future, and c) this inflation story has not only been bandied about like folklore, but furthermore, all the while, *we've failed to even reach minimum inflation targets*.

Today, we finally heard from our great Teacher, JPow, who reminded the kids that the rules still apply. And what are the rules? Keep printing money and keep rates rock bottom low.

I do not for one moment buy that the unprecedented printing of money, in the face of an unprecedented halt of the entire economy, will cause problematic inflation. Also, in the end, Treasuries are not absolutely tied to the Fed's overnight rate; the demand for Treasuries is what decides the price and therefore yield of said Treasuries. We've just seen one of the biggest selloffs in Treasuries since 2018 (and the very early days of last Feb./March, until the bond ETFs regained sanity and there was a flight to safety). I don't see yields rising more, becoming totally detached from the Fed rate.

For thirty years, bonds have raged bull-wise. I don't see that ending when money is cheap as ever. 

If anything, I see markets settling on cyclical, strong balance sheet equities. Even that, however, is a stretch for me. FANGMAN is about as cheap as it's been in a while. Facebook is ridiculously cheap. Amazon doubled earnings expectations recently and wasn't even rewarded for it. Semiconductors are brimming with demand. Financials are on fire. Airlines and cruises and live events and etc. etc. are preparing to come back with a vengeance. People are buying Bitcoin as if it were gold circa 1849 for Christ's sakes. We're just entering the biotech and clean energy age, even if it's still fledgling and speculative.

Moreover, we've just finished off a HUGE Treasuries selloff. It's not about where we are now, but where we were relative to recently, and with rates still near zero and the economy ready to explode, I simply don't see a reason to seek shelter; bonds will remain strong as a speculative device, as it is in all bull markets. (Bond prices don't rise because your grandma bought you a couple 20-year Bills so you could make $500 dollars when you turned 21. They rise because institutional investors are trading them.) We'd have to see a serious extension of the recent selloff to justify the velocity of Treasury yields--which have already slowed significantly since the latest growth/tech correction. **Oh yeah, and the Fed is still buying Treasuries...Lots and lots of the every day all day from sunrise to sunset and maybe still in the night when no one is looking.** 

For a while now, institutional investors have been short $TLT (lots of put buying as well). Last August, I held the same thesis, didn't have the confidence to follow through, and shed a single tear for each day that passed as a phenomenal opportunity passed me by. Rates had nowhere to go but back up. Especially mortgage rates had gotten out of control. But this is exactly the overextension I was looking for. This is, potentially, an equally profitable opportunity on the upside.

The beauty of this trade is, you can also use this as a mechanism to hold cash for future buying opportunities, keeping it low risk. For example, say you park 10% or so in $TLT. Say it continues dropping for a bit longer. You can sell calls, collect the dividend, and keep your basis down until it turns around again. And if it stays flat, fine, either take the premiums or collect the small interest.

If you're speculating, I think calls are a decent play but not quite yet. Premiums are high as a result of the recent selloff. Personally I think shares are the way to go until IV drops as things stabilize.

I'm going to start building a position slowly as it continues dropping--about 1-2% as a nice foundation, then about .2-.5% every week or two after that. Then, when it begins to flatten out and reverse, start buying more aggressively and discontinue my short call program, until I reach about 10% of my portfolio. I'll then keep it at 10% moving forward, rebalancing when opportunities arise or more cash comes in from the 'ole 9-5.

The first card has a 7% interest rate and has just under 5k on it. The second card has an 11% interest rate and just under 3k owed on it. With the exception of once in the past few years, I never put anything on these cards, I'm just paying them off. I pay them off more than the minimum due, sometimes twice the amount each month. Some months just the minimum, but I'm trying to pay them down as fast as possible.

I have also been trying to save money (for random house/car/life incidents) and have managed to save up about 6-7k. My question is, am I doing this all wrong?

CryptoCurrency,A speculative piece on why I think Filecoin (FIL) will continue its upward trajectory,"There are a lot of questions about Filecoin (FIL) popping up in the daily thread which is my home so I'm going to try to explain my thought process and research behind getting in ""early"" and the potential I still believe is available price action-wise. I've never been a fan of writing giant paragraphs in the daily thread because the effort tends to outweigh the exposure which is why I'm doing so here. This is not financial advice and it's definitely not the most technical but I feel like I got this one right by using real-world common sense. I did my research around 2/20/2021 and purchased my stack of FIL a few days after digesting it.

The thing about FIL pumping, besides Greyscale, and the main reason I invested in FIL is that it has somewhat of a true monopoly, in my eyes, which is a very rare thing in crypto. Storage even in a traditional sense is not very competitive, there will always be some sort of competition but unlike ETH for example, where there's a handful of network coins competing for the same piece of the pie, storage is a much smaller uncontested piece of the pie. On that note, when you think about Filecoin, which other storage cryptos can you say it's in competition with? I didn't have an answer to this question myself which is one of the main reasons why I invested in it.

A month ago, when I was searching for the answer to that question, I went to a site a friend had shown me a few weeks prior. It's called [Cryptoslate.com](https://Cryptoslate.com). One of the functions I use is the option to break crypto into ""sectors"" and one of those sectors is ""storage"". When I went to the storage sector I was met with this: [Top 10 storage crypto](https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/storage/). As you can see, there's a large difference in storage market cap. I started at ANKR because it was what I was interested in at the time and worked my way up but really I feel like the only 3 worth mentioning at this time are Siacoin, BitTorrent, and Filecoin.

* [**Siacoin**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin) \- I started with the smallest because I was trying to figure out why it's dwarfed by things like BitTorrent and Filecoin. It has its own Blockchain which I thought was great. It's also community-driven and open-source which are both factors I think are important. The biggest concern I had with Siacoin was its lack of adoption in the time that it has existed since 2015? I felt 6 years is a long time to lack significant adoption for a service so basic yet important, within a sector lacking in competition, so to speak. That was enough for me to move on from Siacoin and onto BitTorrent
* [**BitTorrent**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bittorrent) \- This was probably the easiest one to make my decision on. Two red flags immediately appeared, the first was that it's run on the TRON blockchain which has a controversial figurehead in founder Justin Sun. The second red flag was that there were a handful of people calling it a scam in multiple places that I've looked. Regardless of how they felt, the most damning thing for BitTorrent besides the fact it's trading under a cent is that it's not exactly traditional storage. True to its name, BitTorrent is Torrent-focused, enabling you to download at faster speeds, so as far as I was concerned, it wasn't even in contention in what I was looking for to diversify my portfolio via storage.
* [**Filecoin**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/filecoin) \- Filecoin was released in 2020 and has steadily outpaced its competition in every way. Funnily enough, I found myself reading about Filecoin when I was researching a multitude of other cryptos, its reach is kind of scary, it's providing a service for many. When I compared the market cap it confirmed what I was starting to believe, it's enormous. Anything else is dwarfed 3-4 Billion times over. This was enough for me to recognize that I needed to add this to my portfolio because of the potential that it has.

It felt great to be rewarded for my research but I realized that Filecoin had been under my nose for quite some time on Coinbase and I had missed it. It goes to show that as important as storage is, it's something we frequently overlook without even noticing. We don't think about the file on our computer until we need it, just like we don't think about the storage required for something to download until it doesn't fit or threatens to use too much space.

**Random** **Price prediction**: In the coming months I expect Filecoin to sit somewhere comfortably between $130-$150. I came up with that prediction when it was $30 so now that it's trading at $80 I can confidently make that prediction without sound like a complete hopium shill.

The analogy I'll leave you with is this one:If you were going to store something super important, would you pay for the mom-and-pop storage facility down the road that's nothing more than a gated property of garages, exposed to the elements, or would you pay a little extra to store your item at one of those indoor, guarded, multi-floor, well lit, heated, storage facilities you can often see near exits of the freeway. To me, the latter is what Filecoin is while everything else is a mom-and-pop storage.",cryptocurrency

solar,COmpare quotes: SunPower vs Hanwha Q-Cell,"Hello all! Another post asking for advice comparing quotes.

My house has a SW facing roof where most of the panels would be placed. However, I do have 2 trees partially shading about 30-40% of that area, leaving limited real estate. Therefore efficiency matters. I'm in the North NJ area. My power consumption (yearly) is a bit of guessing game, because I've  moved here recently, and my house is a complete remodel. All appliances, HVAC systems etc are brand new. Our estimate is between 10-12K / year.

I'm paying in cash.

Option 1 - SUNPOWER: (24) X22 360W, 8.64 kWp.

* Est. production: 10,007 kWh
* $28,080 (before incentives, plus $500 VISA card)
* No guarantees on production
* 25 years warranty (92% production post-warranty)

Option 2 - HANWHA: (23) Q.PEAK DUO BLK ML-G9+ 380W, 8.74 kWp.

* Est. production: 9,990 kWh
* $24,515 (before incentives, and they offered me a no interest loan based on my federal tax incentive, so I'd pay 18k now and then the $6k-ish next year, upon receiving my federal credits)
* Guarantees 95% of production
* 25 years warranty (86% production post-warranty)

What do you think? Based on what I've read, SunPower is highly regarded as the most efficient and best in class. However, is it worth the extra $3,000, plus no guarantees on production?

I'm leaning towards Hanwha also because of the guaranteed performance, lower cost and better payment option (lower upfront cost, then using my federal credit next year). However, since my roof ""premium"" space is limited, I'm considering paying extra for a more efficient panel and with lower degradation overtime.

What would you do? Sorry for the lengthy post, and thanks in advance for your ideas!",energy

U/Breezytrigga1

Investing in Palantir now could be life changing  money in 3 years (I am holding 10) . Here is my take and why 80% of my portfolio is in this: 

1) Exposure to Military and Defence sector: Government contracting had early extension- Government money was PLTR’s main source of income for years. Biden was part of OBAMA party and he was high on war and tech. History will repeat itself and they will always be number 1 in government support. “CEO mentioned importance of this himself goes both ways” 

2) Monopoly &amp;amp; Patents/ Ai: 
The Technology they use is so complex IBM could not compete for years and later became a client. No one is able to offer their services similar. There is 0 competition and if anyone wants to compete with their data science it will take a long time to complete. 

3) NEW Contracts/Clients(Commercial): 
They had massive contract signings as they move into Commercial sector which they have never done. Helping big names and look into how many country’s they are in. Mostly US. That is changing fast with new contracts in Japan, and UK. Also, this is the 1st time they had a Sales team to get new clients and introduce what they can bring to the table. Their new contracts were not shown in Q1 report and reason the stock fell+ lock up period over. Q2 and Q3 will reflect all the new money. 

4) FED statement “Powell” Today: 
Powell said very specifically interest rates are not going up. For Growth companies and Giants this is the time to scale and take advantage with good leadership. 
He also said “Late cycle behaviour says companies absorb higher labour cost in their margin” what does this mean? 
Basically saying companies (Ex: Amazon) will take the hit on margin for employment on their net profits- without lowering wages to stay more competitive because there is lots of competition. 
This tells me that big business is going to eat up the small guys because they’ll have a hard time growing with smaller margins because they don’t pump the same volume. 
Which Company Benefits from everything? 
Palantir: not only is it a monopoly and the biggest fish in its pond. 
It is the best thing to help the big fish in every other sector have the edge it needs to dominate.  The small fish can’t access it because they can’t afford it. 
Imagine trying to run a business against your competitors without using Google in any way shape or form. This is the best comparison on a larger corporate ladder to show how impactful it is as a resource.

Hope this helped and you buy and hold.

CryptoCurrency,I use to think the SEC were the bad guys... Now I don't,"https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases.htm

I recently made a post about what I found digging around SEC's website and the things posted on there regarding Ripple. But this isn't about that...

I dug around on their on going litigation webpage:https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases.htm

because I wanted to see what they had on Ripple. Oddly, I couldn't find anything related to Ripple, Brad, or Chris... So if anyone knows why that is, I'm all ears...

However, what I did find were on going and finalized litigations. And people may think Ripple is unique, it really isn't. SEC is suing AT&amp;T for privately leaking insider information to investment firms that then used it for insider trading.

Lots of insider trading cases are listed, and lots of people faking and manipulating earnings reports and number of investors/funds raised for different projects.

What's even more striking is the number of crypto related fraud cases. Many Ponzi and pyramid schemes that people tried to pull off, and its not small amounts either. People were cashing in on 10's of millions of dollars. Absurd levels of fraud that rival Bitconnect, though Bitconnect is most known because they were so publicly shilled.

There are some cases that probably shouldn't be there and handled by state level entities... there was a guy who commited fraud by ponzi scheme but only made 11,500$ in profits, SEC lawyers probably make more in a week. No way they will squeeze blood from that dense ass rock.

Anyway, my point is, they get things right more often then they get things wrong, but they do get things wrong sometimes. I guess that's why things are handled in federal court and the SEC aren't their own judge/jury/executioner.

I'm grateful for the SEC, even if they miss their target sometimes.",cryptocurrency

This is extremely beneficial to them since they could choose to either develop the property or just sell it. Their history here with failed companies is also telling: they used to work with K-Mart. K-Mart failed. Agree did not.

Their most attractive point is omnichannel retail. While competitors in the publicly traded REIT space like to focus on e-commerce resistant companies (and I own these companies too), Agree embraces e-commerce. Omnichannel means what you think it means: big box retailers will maintain dominance in retail but will also use these spaces as logistics centers for deliveries. I think their take on the future here is realistic, rather than an all or nothing take.

Judging by their history they've offered nice growth as well. 80% return over 5 years, *completely disregarding dividends reinvested.* I maintain equity REITs are growth stocks by nature, only with more safety. For reference Walmart returned 96% over the last 5 years, only with far less diversification spread for investors. Check out a 5 year backtest if you want to see an interesting CAGR convergence where Walmart's total return is trending down and Agree's total return is trending up.

They currently trade at a p/ffo multiple of almost 20, so the current valuation is a bit high to me. I'll buy more of them at 65 or 66 dollars a share. Current buy in yield is 3.6%, which is lower than I would like. But they are also poised to increase the real dividend. At a 4% yield I would buy without reservation and I expect to meet this target once the stimulus froth wears off.

They recently switched to a monthly dividend model and raised their dividend by 6%. Not bad for a dusty old boomer asset class everyone thought covid would destroy. Market cap is 4 and a half billion dollars, which is a good size with growth runway for this type of company.

And one of the best features of the company is you can talk to the CEO. Joey Agree will talk to you in his free time and answer questions you may have. I usually dislike family owned REITs, like Monmouth, but Agree is very transparent and publicly engaged. It is utterly mandatory to have good management at a REIT, or any company for that matter. It is internally managed, and the management is invested in the company just like you or I might be. They also didn't fuck around with covid rent relief since most of their tenants didn't truly need rent relief--they said pay up because we know you can afford to pay up. They did offer relief to select small tenants who truly needed it, so they aren't sharks.

Risks are organic interest rate hikes and companies like Walmart calling it quits and selling all their wares over the internet exclusively. The likelihood of that happening is nil. Another downside is their dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates unless held in a Roth. And I suppose their IG tenants could eventually refuse to work with REITs and keep all their real estate in house, although this is highly unlikely.

Current payout ratio is around 71%, which is very conservative for a commercial real estate company that hasn't cut their dividend since the Great Recession. Contractual rent escalations are included, too, for the inflation worriers (although this is around 1% annually, which admittedly is low... this is an unfortunate function of working with tenant companies that have negotiating power). They also demand tenant financials so they aren't flying blind; should a tenant decide to close a store they usually know well in advance.

Just thought I'd mention a company that isn't exotic here, but rather focuses on that sweet thing we all know  as cash flow. And what is likely the real future of sophisticated retailers. Unlike Amazon's loss leading retail side, Agree's tenants actually profit from their business models.

Edit: I don't think investing subs usually worry about sources but most of this data is from Seeking Alpha authors. That website is fantastic when it comes to REITs, if not tech. I wrote this post out myself, on my phone, but I felt bad and decided to include the fact I gleaned this data from others who did the hard work of looking into SEC filings. Credit goes to them.",finance
personalfinance,Accidental contribution to roth ira,"Last year (2020) I accidentally contributed to my roth IRA for the first time thinking I would be below the allowable limit. Unfortunately thats not the case, and all my contributions were technically not allowed.

&amp;#x200B;

In January of this year (2021) once I realized I completely withdrew all my contributions from my roth ira. (Initial contribution was 6000, final balance was 6800). My bank required my to pay 10% federal taxes on the total withdrawal amount (6800). Right now I'm looking to file my US federal tax's. It seems like my bank should only have taxed me 10% on the initial $800 gain and not my total contribution from my understanding? And that on my taxes I have to claim the 800 as income and pay taxes on that.

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking for some clarity. Thanks",finance
stocks,"The Walt Disney Company, a multi-sector play $DIS","A small write-up on a good swing play for Disney! 

I previously written up on bullish semiconductor stocks, bullish PLUG, and bearish CLOV and have been for the most part correct on those (anyone who followed those plays should have made tendies :\] ). 

For Disney $DIS I see it hitting 200 and maybe as high as 210 in the distant future.

Disney is in a good position for further growth. They are now multi-faceted. You can consider them a **technology** stock with high growth (i.e  DIS+,  HULU), **entertainment** **and** **news** stock (i.e ESPN, Marvel, Star Wars, Disney being the obvious), or even a **reopening** play (i.e their amusement parks, cruiselines, shopping districts).

Their latest earnings report was excellent, but was overshadowed by the nasty drop in tech stocks the last month. Even then, DIS hardly dropped and is reclaiming the 200$ price point.

UBS has a price target of 200$ with the average price targets totaling to 205 according to FinViz.

Catalyst --&gt; DIS to reopen parks in California by April 30. This is huge. The company is only operating from half strength right now in it's online presence of DISNEY+ and other foreign theme parks. I'm from Orange County where the parks are located and there is a strong community of people who will rush to go to the park. Competitor amusement parks such as Knott's berry farm in the area already started hiring thousands of employees in preparation for reopening and Disney will do the same.

Meanwhile DIS has a strong prospect for its streaming purposes. Total subscribers across Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ were over 140 million in January. Management has forecasted it doubling to 300M+ by 2024. For reference, Netflix has around 200million right now in the 4th quarter of 2020. Prior to DISNEY+, the company has not had a direct connection to its consumers besides the parks, but now it has ""hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide being fed a constant stream of content throughout the year.""

I believe Disney will retest the 200 position and have more to grow from there depending if market conditions have calmed. This is easily a large growth stock going into 2021.

My current positions:  DIS 4/16 200C's",finance
cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 03.18.2021: Coinbase Day!,"Happy Coinbase Day!

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. 

Also, there’s now an audio version available for anyone interested:  [https://youtu.be/6aZ5Z-99e0A](https://youtu.be/6aZ5Z-99e0A)

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. Today is Coinbase day! Finally!  Rejoice.  Trading on Coinbase Pro is supposed to open at or after 9am Pacific!

3. Perceptions are shifting on which platform will be #1 for smart contracts over the next decade. Here’s the biggest crypto youtuber asking his co-host if he’s losing faith in the traditional #1. If you’re in Cardano, you can guess which coin his answer is shifting away from. [https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270](https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying "" Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

10. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
11. ~~What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?~~  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1) RETIRED!
12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh. 
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)
14. Charles claimed Elon was trolling Cardano with “meta for k” on twitter. Can anyone argue one way or another on this? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1364350825271685122](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1364350825271685122)

17. ~~Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?~~ RETIRED!
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark. Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. ~~Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?~~ RETIRED!
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

35. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have a hairline that is even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.

37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum). This is one of those nice articles where the British guy pleasantly reads it to you if you want. Use this one to convince all your friends you are the ultimate blockchain expert:  “listen Kyle...the shortcoming of UTXO accounting is....” [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/)

45. Cardano uses a tiny fraction of the energy some other top-ten blockchains use.   This factoid alone should allow you to hook up with eco-obsessed nature people. [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875)

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

Trading,Importance Of the Treasury General Account (TGA),"Rising yields have been beneficial for the Dollar lately. However, over the next 4 months, the Treasury General Account or “TGA” is projected to fall considerably, **which all else being equal is likely a dollar-bearish variable.** So far, it has only just started:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t3lh5n8ivqn61.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfa600ba6f8ee7178038cc76eac2cc7868278a92

The government funds its expenditures with taxes, and the remaining deficit is funded by issuing Treasury securities. When they issue Treasuries at a faster rate than they spend, the money collects in the TGA, which is the federal government’s cash account at the New York Fed. Then when they slow down Treasury security issuance and keep spending, the TGA goes back down.

In 2020, the US Treasury under Secretary Mnuchin built up a record cash pile in its TGA. At $1.8 trillion, it was more than 4x any previous level. This means the US Treasury issued a lot more Treasury securities than they spent, and **this sucked dollars out of the system and held them there in limbo.** An increase in the TGA tends to be somewhat dollar bullish while it’s going up.

In early 2021, under Secretary Yellen, the US Treasury announced that it’ll reduce its expected Treasury security issuance and rapidly reduce its TGA, by spending more than it borrows. The recent stimulus bill will affect both sides of that equation; the Treasury will be spending faster and will likely need to issue Treasuries faster as well, but still it’ll be on track to draw down the account by over $1 trillion this summer, which **puts those limbo dollars back into the commercial banking system, with all else being equal, will be a headwind for Dollar strength.**",finance

CryptoCurrency,FDIC is a U.S. government corporation that provides deposit insurance to depositors in U.S. commercial banks and savings banks. Currently the FDIC insurance fund has $118 billion in it. Total US bank deposits right now are $17 trillion. Less than 0.7% of US bank deposits are covered.,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation providing deposit insurance to depositors in U.S. commercial banks and savings banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Bank Act, enacted during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system. More than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common. The FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US$250,000 per ownership category.


The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding. The FDIC also has a US$100 billion line of credit with the United States Department of the Treasury.


As of September 2020, total US bank deposits reached $17.12 trillion. The $118 billion FDIC fund covers less than 0.7% of all those deposits. With the additional $100 billion line of credit they have, that doesn't even cover 2% of all bank deposits. Any major bank failure and the government would need to bail them out... With taxpayer money. Yet another example to show how fragile our financial system is and why we are looking for alternatives to store our hard earned money.

So I received the last two stimulus checks based on my 2019 tax return, but in February I filed my 2020 tax return and filed no income as I hadn't worked last year as I was out of the country for some 8 months. 

Now I did get a $63 tax rebate from the state, but nothing federal, and so it never asked for my banking details, but am I still eligible for the 3rd stimulus check that was released? Based on no income that is, and if so, will they just physically mail me a check to the mailing address I had on file?

CryptoCurrency,A list of 43 countrys and their cryptocurrency regulations,"It took a bit more time than expected but i collected information about regulations over 43 countrys/nations. It started out fun, but became quite some work. Lets see what countrys are crypto regulated and which are less or not. I searched on the government websites and other legal advice website. Please if you have more information, let me know. 

**Legal tender:** Legal tender is anything recognized by law as a means to settle a public or private debt or meet a financial obligation, including tax payments, contracts, and legal fines or damages. 

# Argentina

Bitcoins are not legal currency strictly speaking, since they are not issued by the government monetary authority and are not legal tender.  Therefore, they may be considered money but not legal currency, since they are not a mandatory means of cancelling debts or obligations.  Although bitcoins are not specifically regulated, they are increasingly being used in Argentina, a country that has strict control over foreign currencies.  According to some experts a bitcoin may be considered a good or a thing under the Civil Code, and transactions with bitcoins may be governed by the rules of the sale of goods under the Civil Code

# Australia

In 2017, with the legalization of cryptocurrency, it had recognized such items as property and is subject to their Capital Gains Tax (CGT). This has made Australia one of the industry leaders, with the fintech community gaining a favorable position in commerce. 

In 2018, digital currency exchange providers were placed under new regulations from AUSTRAC, the country’s intelligence and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF), which seeks to prevent the use of these systems for money laundering or to finance crime and terrorism. All DCEs operating within the country must register with AUSTRAC. A registration helps gain the consumer’s confidence and protect the country from adverse manipulation to benefit crime. Registered entities are required to implement a process to identify and verify their customers. They will also have to monitor and report suspicious activities taking place on their platform.

# Belgium

There are no specific laws or regulations regarding Bitcoin in Belgium.

Virtual currencies are defined by the European Central Bank (ECB) as 'a digital representation of value, not issued by a central bank, credit institution or e-money institution, which, in some circumstances, can be used as an alternative to money'. It clarifies that even though they can be used as an alternative to money, virtual currencies are not money or currency from a legal perspective. It provides further clarification by proposing three subcategories of virtual currencies that are classified according to their interaction with legal tender (or similar instruments) and on their ability to be used to purchase tangible goods and services.

# Brazil

Cryptocurrencies have yet to be regulated in Brazil.  The Brazilian Central Bank has issued statements regarding the risks posed by this type of currency and its lack of guarantee by the monetary authorities, and has advised that companies that trade in virtual currencies are not regulated, supervised, or licensed to operate by the Bank.  Recently, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission issued a statement saying, among other things, that cryptocurrencies could not be classified as financial assets and could not be acquired by investment funds.  A bill of law currently under analysis in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies seeks to include virtual currencies and air mileage programs under the supervision of the Brazilian Central Bank.

On October 9, 2013, Brazil enacted Law No. 12,865, which created the possibility for the normalization of mobile payment systems and the creation of electronic currencies, including the bitcoin.  The Law provides, among other things, for the payment arrangements and payment institutions that comprise the Brazilian Payment System (Sistema de Pagamentos Brasileiro, SPB).

Law No. 12,865 defines “payment arrangement” as a set of rules and procedures that regulate the rendering of a particular service to the public that is accepted by more than one recipient, through direct access by end users, payers, and recipients.  “Payment institution” is defined as a legal entity that, by adhering to one or more payment arrangements, has as a principal or secondary activity, alternatively or cumulatively, one of the activities listed in article 6(III).  “Electronic currency” is defined as resources stored on a device or electronic system that allow the end user to perform a payment transaction.

# Canada

Canada allows the use of digital currencies, including cryptocurrencies. However, cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender in Canada. Canada’s tax laws and rules, including the Income Tax Act, also apply to cryptocurrency transactions. The Canada Revenue Agency has characterized cryptocurrency as a commodity and stated that the use of cryptocurrency to pay for goods or services should be treated as a barter transaction.

Canada allows the use of cryptocurrencies. According to the Government of Canada webpage on digital currencies, “\[y\]ou can use digital currencies to buy goods and services on the Internet and in stores that accept digital currencies. You may also buy and sell digital currency on open exchanges, called digital currency or cryptocurrency exchanges.” However, cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender in Canada. According to the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, “\[o\]nly the Canadian dollar is considered official currency in Canada.” The Currency Act defines “legal tender” as “bank notes issued by the Bank of Canada under the Bank of Canada Act” and “coins issued under the Royal Canadian Mint Act.”

# China

China does not recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender and the banking system is not accepting cryptocurrencies or providing relevant services. The government has taken a series of regulatory measures to crack down on activities related to cryptocurrencies for purposes of investor protection and financial risk prevention. Those measures include announcing that initial coin offerings are illegal, restricting the primary business of cryptocurrency trading platforms, and discouraging Bitcoin mining. In the meantime, China’s central bank is reportedly considering issuing its own digital currency.

China has not passed any legislation regulating cryptocurrencies.  Regulators are not recognizing cryptocurrencies as legal tender or a tool for retail payments, and the Chinese banking system is not accepting any existing cryptocurrencies or providing relevant services. In a 2013 circular, the government defined Bitcoin as a virtual commodity, but while warning citizens about the risks of virtual commodities allowed them to freely participate in the online trading of such commodities.

In recent years, especially since September 2017, however, the government has taken a series of regulatory measures to crack down on activities related to cryptocurrencies, mainly due to the concern over financial risks associated with such currencies. 

# Croatia

The National Bank of Croatia adheres to the following idea: the assets forming cryptocurrency cannot be considered financial, but the circulation of electronic money in the country cannot be considered illegal, cryptocurrency exchanges are not prohibited.

The absolute majority of Croatian financial experts consider it necessary to introduce regulatory procedures at the legislative level and even licensing of ICO activities.

Currently, a license for cryptocurrency in Croatia is not issued, and there are no legislative acts regulating the operation of various crypto-projects. Considering the views of the National Bank of Croatia and the Central Administration of Tax Administration that bitcoin is not a financial equivalent, but merely an instrument, the government is slow in coordinating measures.It is worth noting that parliamentarians positively assess the course of cloud assets in the local business environment, but licensing a cryptocurrency exchange in Croatia is in the future.

# Denmark

Denmark has not adopted legislation that specifically deals with cryptoassets. A crypoasset transaction may fall under Danish regulatory authority, depending on whether the cryptoasset is considered a form of payment (currency), capital asset (investment), or financial service.

The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority has stated that the use of cryptocurrencies as payment is generally not regulated by the Authority, but the applicability of Danish securities law will depend on the specifics of the initial coin offering (ICO). ICOs that are similar to initial public offerings (IPOs) are subject to securities law, and the issuing corporation must publish a prospectus in connection with the ICO.

Denmark generally treats cryptocurrencies as capital property for tax purposes, taxing gains and allowing for deductions on losses. However, losses may not be deducted as a business expense when the value of cryptocurrencies that have been received as payment for goods or services has decreased.

# Estonia

In Estonia, the use of bitcoins is not regulated or otherwise controlled by the government.  Because of the Bitcoin service’s growing popularity and increasing use by the country’s population, however, the Bank of Estonia (the nation’s central bank) monitors financial arrangements that use Bitcoin.According to Google’s search statistics, Estonia is the country with the second largest number of Internet searches for the term “Bitcoin”; Russia has the most such searches.

When Estonia introduced a license specifically for cryptocurrency exchanges in November 2017 it was groundbreaking, and Estonian cryptocurrency licenses, issued by the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit or FIU for short, continue to be sought after, since the government is extremely supportive of the cryptocurrency industry in general, allowing many companies within the industry to really thrive and for truly innovative thinking.

# European Union

The European Commission recognises the importance of legal certainty and a clear regulatory regime in areas pertaining to blockchain-based applications.

The EU strongly supports a pan-European framework and hopes to avoid legal and regulatory fragmentation. With the view to increase investments and to ensure consumer and investor protection, the Commission on 24 September adopted a comprehensive package of legislative proposals for the regulation of crypto-assets, updating certain financial market rules for crypto-assets, and creating a legal framework for regulatory sandboxes of financial supervisors in the EU for using blockchains in the trading and post trading of securities.

A digital Euro

The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Commission services are jointly reviewing at technical level a broad range of policy, legal and technical questions emerging from a possible introduction of a digital euro, taking into account their respective mandates and independence provided for in the Treaties.

More information: Joint statement by the European Commission and the ECB on their cooperation on a digital euro (19 January 2021).

Proposal for a new EU law on crypto-assets

Crypto-assets qualifying as “financial instruments” under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (e.g.: tokenised equities or tokenised bonds) have already in the past been subject to EU securities markets legislation. However, these rules predated the emergence of crypto-assets and DLT. This could hamper innovation. On 24 September 2020 the Commission therefore proposed a pilot regime for market infrastructures that wish to try to trade and settle transactions in financial instruments in crypto-asset form. The **PILOT** regime allows for exemptions from existing rules and allows regulators and companies to test innovative solutions utilising blockchains.

For other crypto-assets that do not qualify as “financial instruments” such as utility tokens or payment tokens, the Commission on 24 September proposed a specific new framework that would replace all other EU rules and national rules currently governing the issuance, trading and storing of such crypto assets. This **Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation - MiCA  - will support innovation while protecting consumers and the integrity of crypto-currency exchanges** (no insider trading, front running etc). The proposed regulation covers not only entities issuing crypto-assets but also firms providing services around these crypto-assets such as and firms  operating digital wallets, as well as cryptocurrency exchanges.

# Finland

The Finish Tax Authority, Vero Skatt, has issued instructions for the taxation of virtual currencies, including the bitcoin.  When transferred to another currency, the rules on taxation of capital gains apply.  When the currency is used as a form of payment for goods and services, it is treated as a trade, and the increase in value that the currency might have gained after it was obtained is taxable.  The sale of bitcoins at a loss in value compared to the original purchase price is not deductible under the Finish Income Taxation Act, because such a loss in value is not specifically described as deductible in the Act.

# France

Cryptocurrencies remain largely unregulated in France.  So far, only two ordinances containing provisions on blockchain technology have been issued, but their applicability remains very narrow.  However, the government has set up several fact-finding missions and is actively working to establish a regulatory framework. French regulatory authorities are generally wary of cryptocurrencies, due to their high volatility and unregulated nature, but appear enthusiastic about the underlying blockchain technology.  Additionally, French authorities have issued some limited guidance with regard to the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies, instructing that any profits from their sale is taxable, and that their value is to be taken into account when calculating the wealth tax.

Cryptocurrencies remain largely unregulated in France, with two ordinances on blockchain technology being the only legislative action taken so far.  However, the French government is actively studying the cryptocurrency phenomenon and moving towards establishing a regulatory regime.  Statements from various quarters of the French government show that while many are wary of cryptocurrencies, there appears to be a real enthusiasm for the underlying blockchain technology.

# Germany

On January 1, 2020, Germany joined a small but growing number of countries with a specific regulatory regime for crypto assets. ‘Goldplating’ the European requirements under the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), the German legislator reformed the national regulatory rules for crypto-related activities: The ‘Act on the Implementation of the Amendment Directive to the Fourth EU Money Laundering Directive’ (*Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Änderungsrichtlinie zur Vierten EU-Geldwäscherichtlinie*) (i) affects existing licensing requirements under the German Banking Act (*Kreditwesengesetz* – KWG) by defining a new category of financial instruments and (ii) additionally introduces a new licensing requirement for custody services

# Iceland

Although Iceland is home to some of the largest Bitcoin mining facilities in the world, the Icelandic government made the following decision on Bitcoin (released in 2013 but it’s seen to be a residual effect of legislation to address the 2008 crisis), “*It is prohibited to engage in foreign exchange trading with the electronic currency Bitcoin, according to the Icelandic Foreign Exchange Act. A written response from the Central Bank of Iceland to Morgunblaðið states that the Foreign Exchange Act specifies general restrictions on foreign exchange trading and capital movements between countries.*

These rules seemed to allow for Icelandic citizens to own bitcoin and allow for the mining of bitcoin in Iceland. What they're designed to do, however, is to stop the capital flight of funds (in the form of bitcoin) out of the country. This essentially means that bitcoin is not a currency according to Icelandic law.

# India

There appears to be no explicit legal framework that regulates, restricts, or bans bitcoins in India.  However, India’s central bank recently cautioned the public about the possible risks of cybersecurity attacks and money laundering related to the use of this virtual currency.  At this moment there is no crypto regulation in India. However, buying Bitcoin is absolutely legal in India. There is no law prohibiting Indians from buying/selling cryptocurrencies in India.

**But:** India will propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets, a senior government official told Reuters in a potential blow to millions of investors piling into the red-hot asset class.

# Indonesia

A spokesman for Bank Indonesia reportedly issued a statement on Bitcoin in December 2013, saying that “\[b\]itcoin is a potential payment method, but it’s different than ordinary currency. . . . It is not regulated by the central bank so there are risks. . . . At the moment, we’re studying bitcoin and we have no plan to issue a regulation on it.”

Indonesia’s commodity futures trading regulator, Bappebti, recently issued regulations that provide the legal framework for the trading of cryptoassets as commodities that can be subject to futures trading. The regulations contain requirements related to the approval of cryptoassets that can be traded, traders, exchanges, clearing houses, and storage providers. These include technical, structural, and security requirements, as well as requirements for entities to maintain certain levels of paid-up and closing capital. Exchanges are also subject to anti-money laundering obligations.

It appears that, despite these regulatory developments, Bank Indonesia continues to prohibit the use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment in the country. In addition, financial services institutions regulated by the Financial Services Authority appear to be prohibited from engaging in activities related to cryptocurrencies.

# Ireland

There is no specific cryptocurrency regulation in Ireland, but there is also no specific prohibition in Ireland on any activities related to cryptocurrency.

The investors who want to open a company in Ireland in this industry will be required to register for taxation with the Irish Revenue for capital gains (just like in the case of any other legal entity operating in this country) and with Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) for Anti-Money Laundering purposes.

The CBI (Central Bank of Ireland) is the competent authority in Ireland for the regulation of financial services including electronic money, payment services and securities law.

# Israel

In accordance with regulations issued in 2016, virtual currency is considered a “financial asset” in Israel, for which the provision of financial services requires a license. As a financial asset, trade in virtual currency is subject to capital gains taxation.

In 2014 the Bank of Israel (Israel’s central bank), together with several regulatory agencies, issued a warning about the dangers associated with the use of virtual currency, including bitcoin. In a statement made by the Bank in January 2018 it clarified that it does not recognize virtual currencies as actual currencies, but rather as a financial asset. Although virtual currencies are not recognized as actual currency by the Bank of Israel, the Israel Tax Authority has proposed that the use of virtual currencies should be considered as a “means of virtual payment” and subject to taxation.

The legitimacy of a bank’s refusal to provide banking services to a company that trades in bitcoin is currently under review by the Israeli Supreme Court. The Court has issued a temporary injunction against the bank’s complete blockage of the company’s activities in the account.

# Italy

Italy is one of the few countries in the world where cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies are regulated at the legislative level. In 2017, Legislative Act № 90 was issued, according to which service providers in the cryptocurrency market are classified as ordinary currency exchange operators. In other words, we can say that this document equates cryptocurrency with traditional currency. In addition, this Act directs the Ministry of Finance and Economy to issue a decree that would regulate the mechanism of operations with cryptocurrency, the work on which was completed on February 2, 2018. In it, the Italian government expressed the opinion that cryptocurrencies are the most suitable instrument among others for laundering funds obtained by criminal means and the financing of terrorism, in connection with which legal regulation should make it impossible to use them for criminal purposes. The regulation gives the following definition of cryptocurrency: it is a virtual currency used as a medium of exchange for goods or services. At the same time, cryptocurrency is not issued by the central bank and is in no way correlated with other currencies, therefore, it is not a means of payment.

# Japan

Since April 2017, cryptocurrency exchange businesses operating in Japan have been regulated by the Payment Services Act.  Cryptocurrency exchange businesses must be registered, keep records, take security measures, and take measures to protect customers, among other things. Cryptocurrency exchanges are also subject to money laundering regulations.

# Malaysia

In January 2019, the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) issued an order that sets out the characteristics of “digital currency” and “digital tokens” that are prescribed as being securities for the purposes of Malaysia’s securities law. It subsequently issued amendments to its recognized market guidelines, which now include a framework for operators of digital asset platforms to be approved by the SC as recognized market operators. This includes requirements related to an entity’s structure and governance, risk management processes, client asset protection, transparency, and market integrity.

In March 2019, the SC published a consultation paper on its proposed approach to regulating initial coin offerings (ICOs). This approach would include approval of the ICO by the SC based on various criteria and the registration of a disclosure document that meets certain requirements.

Digital currency exchanges were previously made subject to Malaysia’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism system, which is overseen by the central bank. The Inland Revenue Board has also previously indicated that income earned through cryptocurrency trading is subject to the Income Tax Act 1967, although it has not yet issued any specific guidance on this issue.

# Malta

Malta has taken a very progressive approach to cryptocurrencies, positioning itself as a global leader in crypto regulation.

While cryptocurrencies are not legal tender, they are recognized by the government as “a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value”. Malta has no specific cryptocurrency tax legislation, nor is VAT currently applicable to transactions exchanging fiat currency for crypto.

**Cryptocurrencies:** Not legal tender**Cryptocurrency exchanges:** Legal, regulated under the VFA Act

Cryptocurrency exchanges are legal in Malta and, in 2018, the Maltese government introduced landmark legislation to define a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and address AML/CFT concerns. The legislation comprised of three separate bills which set a global precedent by establishing a regulatory regime applicable to crypto exchanges, ICOs, brokers, wallet providers, advisers, and asset managers.

The three bills are:

· Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act

· Innovative Technological Arrangement and Services Act

· Virtual Financial Asset Act

Netherlands

For retailinvestors there are no regulations for owning cryptocurrency.

As of May 21 (2020), the implementation of EU's 5th anti-money laundering Directive obliges providers of cryptocurrency exchanges and/or wallets to register themselves in the Netherlands. Such registration depends among others on having adequate procedures and measures of compliance with EU and Dutch sanctions laws in place, effectively making sanctions compliance more important than ever for crypto service providers in the Netherlands.

# New Zealand

New Zealand currently does not have specific legislation related to cryptocurrencies. Guidance provided by the Financial Markets Authority states that various activities related to cryptocurrencies could be considered financial services, which are subject to the “fair dealing” requirements in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. Other laws may also be applicable if the entity involved is based in New Zealand and services are offered to retail clients. In addition, if the tokens offered to retail investors in New Zealand are considered financial products under the Act (including securities, derivatives, or interests in managed investment schemes), further licensing, governance, and disclosure requirements would apply. Whether a token is a particular type of financial product will depend on its individual characteristics.

Where no financial product or financial service is involved, communications related to offers of cryptocurrencies are subject to the fair dealing requirements in the Fair Trading Act 1986.

Cryptocurrency exchanges appear to be considered “money changers” that are subject to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2009.

Cryptocurrency is treated as property for purposes of income tax legislation. Where a person acquires cryptocurrency for the purpose of disposal, the proceeds from selling it are taxable.

# Norway

Norway requires everyone who offers a marketplace for cryptocurrencies or a wallet to register with the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority. It has implemented the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, and in its implementing legislation specifically provides that anti-money laundering requirements also apply in relation to cryptocurrency transactions.

Norway taxes cryptoassets depending on their nature either as capital property income, other income (mined income), or business income (mined income on a larger scale). The sale of cryptocurrencies is not subject to value-added tax.  

# Poland

At present there are no precise regulations on the taxation of cryptocurrency in Poland. In the future, however, taxes will be paid on profits generated by virtual currencies. The government has tabled a legislative proposal to this effect. Due to the lack of regulations so far, the income of persons trading in crypto currencies could even be taxed at the rate of 32 percent, so many companies trading in virtual currency have relocated their activities to other countries. Since January 2019, revenues from cryptocurrency trading have been allocated according to revenues from cash capital (EStG-PL) or revenues from investment income (KStG-PL). The income from the sale of virtual currency against payment is taxed at 19 percent.

# Portugal

There are no specific laws in Portugal regarding virtual assets, cryptocurrency exchanges, e-wallets &amp; virtual asset operators. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s no regulation in the market of virtual asset

# Russia

On July 31, 2020, the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, signed Federal Law No. 259-FZ on Digital Financial Assets and Digital Currencies. This law regulates relations concerning the issuance, recording, and circulation of digital financial assets (DFAs). (Federal Law No. 259-FZ, art.1, §§ 1, 2 &amp; 3.)

Under the new law, DFAs are digital rights that can be viewed as analogues of issued securities but placed through a blockchain. DFAs include monetary claims, the ability to exercise rights to securities (including the rights to demand their transfer), and the right to participate in the capital of non-public stock companies. (Art. 1, § 2.) The law also considers Security (Utility) Tokens to be digital financial assets and requires that they be treated as such.

Among other provisions, the law defined digital currency as a digital code used as a means of payment and as a savings tool (an investment). (Art. 3.) However, residents of the Russian Federation are not allowed to receive digital currencies as payment for goods, work, or services. (Art. 14, § 5.) In addition, the law prohibits distributing any information about possible settlements in digital currencies; offering and accepting digital currency as a payment for transferred goods, rendered work, or services; or using any other method of paying in digital currency. According to the law, digital currency is not legal tender for payments in Russia, and the Russian ruble remains the only official monetary unit. (Art. 14, § 7.)

The law prohibits exchange operations with cryptocurrency on the territory of the Russian Federation, and makes judicial protection of claims related to such operations and/or transactions possible only if the digital currency possessions or transactions were declared in accordance with this law. (Art. 14, § 6.) Most of the provisions of the law will take effect on January 1, 2021.

# Singapore

In Singapore, cryptocurrency exchanges and trading are legal, and the city-state has taken a friendlier position on the issue than regional neighbors.

Although cryptocurrencies are not considered a legal tender, Singapore’s tax authority treats Bitcoins as ‘goods’ and so applies Goods and Services Tax (Singapore’s version of Value Added Tax).

Slovenia

At present, Slovenia treats cryptocurrencies as virtual currencies, which means that they are neither recognized as financial instruments nor monetary assets under the Slovenian Law on Payment Services and Systems. For the purposes of anti-money laundering regulations, Slovenia has a vague definition of a cryptocurrency, which represents a “digital form of a value, not being issued or backed by a central bank or any other public authority and is not necessarily linked to an officially recognized fiat currency. In the absence of legally recognized status as a currency or monetary asset, cryptocurrencies are accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange, which can be transferred, stored and exchanged electronically.”  

The country’s officials have deemed that it is legal to own or use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

# Spain

There is no specific regulation for cryptocurrencies in Spain. They are only not treated as legal tender, as this is exclusively reserved for the euro as the national currency.According to Spanish law, virtual currency cannot be considered either as a financial instrument (promissory note, derivative, etc.) or as a currency (domestic or foreign). In some cases, however, they can be treated as securities in the case of a public offer, or as goods or commodities if they are traded individually.

To the extent that they can be regarded as securities, STOs may fall under the requirements of the prospectus file of the Spanish Stock Market Act (LMV), as the definition of financial instruments and tradable securities is very broad (Article 2 LMV). The Spanish Government may add new types of securities on its own initiative without the need to amend the law if agreed under EU law.

# South Korea

On 5 March 2020, South Korea passed an amendment to the Act on the Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information. It will come into effect in March 2021 and extend AML/CTF rules to virtual asset service providers. How can you prepare for the changes? Let’s take a look at some important aspects.

Who is affected

The new law covers the activity of virtual asset service providers (VASP) who are involved in the following business activities:

· the selling or buying of cryptocurrencies

· crypto-to-crypto exchanges

· the transferring of cryptocurrencies

· the storage or management of virtual assets

These activities mainly relate to cryptocurrency exchanges, custodian wallet providers and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) projects.

# Sweden

There is no cryptocurrency-specific regulation in Sweden. However, the Finansinspektionen, Sweden’s Financial Supervisory Authority, is of the opinion that bitcoins are subject to its authority, as trade in bitcoins (i.e., offering a site where bitcoins can be bought and sold similar to an exchange) is a financial service and thus subject to mandatory reporting requirements. Furthermore, the Riksbank, Swedish Central Bank, has ruled that “bitcoins are not money.” The announcement explained that cryptocurrencies are not seen by Sweden as equivalent to traditional currencies, referencing a new financial report on cryptocurrencies written by the Central Bank of Sweden staff (March 2018).

# Taiwan

So far no Taiwanese laws or regulations have been promulgated or amended to formally regulate “virtual currencies” or “cryptocurrencies”; therefore, currently, virtual currencies/cryptocurrencies cannot be considered “legal tender”, “currencies” or a generally accepted “medium of exchange” in Taiwan. Further, currently there exists no required licence in Taiwan for (a) operating the services of exchange between virtual currencies or virtual currencies with fi at currencies, or (b) acting as a “money transmitter” and the like in Taiwan.

# Thailand

Although cryptocurrencies are not a lawful currency, and do not have legal tender status in Thailand, there was a case in 2018 in which a Thai fintech company successfully raised funds from the public by using digital tokens, and Thai laws and regulations had not been enacted to govern such activities at the time. This development with respect to cryptocurrencies and digital tokens could have potentially affected both the general public and financial stability, causing the Royal Enactment on Digital Asset Businesses BE 2561 (REDA), 2018, to be promulgated, which has been effective from 14 May 2018 onward, and aims to regulate the offering of digital assets and businesses undertaking digital asset-related activities in order to be equipped to facilitate and support the technological innovations driving the economy and society, including protecting against any schemes designed for deceiving the general public.

# Turkey

Currently, the BDDK has provided an indication that Cryptocurrency does not fall within the scope of Law no. 6439 on Payment Securities Settlement Systems, Payment Services, and Electronic Money Institutions. There is currently no legislation that specifically refers to Cryptocurrency and therefore it is not entirely accurate to declare this type of business activity is lawful or unlawful in Turkey. Cryptocurrency is not recognized under Turkish law however they are utilized in Cryptocurrency Activities in practice.

# United Kingdom

UK cryptocurrencies regulations allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies – but due to recent regulatory moves by the UK’s financial regulatory, the FCA, trading of cryptocurrency derivatives are banned.

Cryptocurrency Regulations in the UK Key Takeaways;

· Cryptocurrencies not classed as legal tender

· VASPs apply to FCA for licence (e-money as the exception)

· Taxes based on activities, entities &amp; tokens

· Ban on derivatives offering

· FCA, Treasury &amp; BoE make up Cryptoassets Taskforce

· 8 Cryptoasset Market ‘Actors’

· FCA responsible for AML/CFT of cryptoassets

Regulations on UK VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) have been created so as to not stifle innovation whilst maintaining the integrity of the wider financial system. To operate in the United Kingdom, crypto exchanges need to register with the Financial Conduct Authority – unless they have applied for an e-money licence.

UK-based VASPs must additionally adhere to a number of compliance rules. Those include regulations around KYC (Know-Your-Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and CFT (Combatting the Financing of Terrorism).

# United States

The U.S. maintains a generally positive outlook on the use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, though few formal rules have actually been introduced. Most of the regulatory discussion surrounding blockchain has been at the agency level, including the Department of Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) — all of which hold differ in their definitions of ""cryptocurrency,"" as well as their stances on how regulation should be applied. 

While FinCEN does not consider cryptocurrency to be legal tender, it does consider exchanges as money transmitters subject to their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, the IRS has begun considering cryptocurrencies property, and has issued tax guidance accordingly. 

In June 2015, New York became the first state in the U.S. to regulate virtual currency companies through state agency rulemaking. As of 2019, 32 states have introduced legislation accepting or promoting the use of Bitcoin and blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT), while a few have already passed them into law. Some of these states have also established task forces to study the technology's use further.  

Bitcoin took a major step in 2017, when it was granted the same financial safeguards as traditional assets. The FTC gave cryptocurrency trading platform operator LedgerX approval to become the first federally regulated digital currency options exchange and clearinghouse in the U.S.

Additionally, in June 2019, SEC-registered clearing and execution company Apex Clearing launched a trading platform for brokers-dealers and financial advisors to help their clients trade the four major cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin - through its subsidiary Apex Crypto.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-dollar-general-signet-jewelers-petco-more.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 futures hit by another jump in Treasury yields

&gt; * Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 futures fell Thursday as the 10-year Treasury yield surged to a 14-month high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq reversed steep losses Wednesday as Treasury yields came off their highs of the day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell soothed market concerns about higher policy interest rates anytime soon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the 33,000 level for the first time ever. The S&amp;P 500 also closed at a record high. Dow futures were steady Thursday.

&gt; * While raising its outlook for economic growth and inflation, the Fed cut its unemployment rate forecast to 4.5% this year. The unemployment rate was 6.2% in February. In another hint about the jobs picture, set for release 8:30 a.m. ET, economists expect 700,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down from the prior week’s 712,000 initial jobless claims.

*****

&gt; # 2. Bond traders continue to battle the Fed on rates

&gt; * Despite Fed assurances that near zero rates likely won’t rise through 2023, the 10-year Treasury yield Thursday touched 1.74%, a high back to January 2020, as traders continued to battle central bankers on rates. The rapid climb in the benchmark yield, which started this year under 1%, has been a drag on high growth stocks, many of which are tech stocks on the Nasdaq, as higher rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. In addition to releasing projections Wednesday afternoon after its two-day March meeting, the Fed left rates and its asset purchase program unchanged.

*****

&gt; # 3. Top Biden officials and Chinese diplomats set to meet

&gt; * America’s top diplomat early Thursday pressed China to use its “tremendous influence” to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear program, hours after reclusive Pyongyang vowed to ignore any U.S. overtures to resume negotiations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at the end of security talks with South Korea in Seoul.

&gt; * Blinken will meet senior Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska, on his way back to Washington later Thursday. Ties between the world’s two largest economies have been torn for years and the Biden administration has yet to signal whether it’s ready or willing to back down from the hardline stance taken under former President Donald Trump.

*****

&gt; # 4. House to vote on two immigration bills, including one for ‘Dreamers’

&gt; * The House was set to vote Thursday on a bill to give so-called Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. as kids, full legal status and a chance for citizenship. A second measure would do the same for immigrant farm workers. Both measures seemed certain to pass. When similar versions of the bills passed the House in 2019, seven Republicans voted for the Dreamers bill and 34 backed the farm workers measure. However, GOP support is expected to plummet this time as the party rallies behind demands for tougher restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.

*****

&gt; # 5. Federal April 15 tax-filing day delayed until May 17

&gt; * The federal April 15 tax-filing day has been postponed about a month. Taxpayers can also delay payment of any money owed the IRS until May 17. However, the extended deadline applies only to federal income returns and taxes, meaning that taxpayers will need to check to see if due dates for state taxes have been changed. Not all states follow the same filing schedule as the federal government. Calls to delay Tax Day intensified after passage of the latest Covid relief plan, which tasks the IRS with sending another round of direct payments at the same time it usually processes tax returns and refunds.

Our current mortgage loan is at $240,000. Our interest rate is 4.25% and we're aiming for at least 1% lower (and similar loan fees).
2. We're 80% sure we would not sell this house even if we purchased another. We currently rent out a sectioned portion of our house, so renting out the entire home would be our most likely situation. Between my wife and I, we predict if all goes as planned we should make $120,000 per year once I'm out of grad school (in 15 months) with about $35K in debt. 

I guess my real question is, how hard would it be for us to buy a pricier home (in a better area) without selling our current one and simply renting it out for the remainder of its mortgage? Or what may be some things I am not thinking about that play a big role in this decision?",finance

stocks,"The intrinsic value of stocks, pt 1","Hi guys,

I wanted to say thanks to u/shortyafter for [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7ppir/really_surprised_by_all_the_misinformation_on_here/), were he was talking about how it's wrong to say that stocks have 'no intrinsic value and it's totally abstract and a popularity contest'; but then what is their intrinsic value and how do we decide their value?

Let's start with clarifying what is a share: we can define a share as a small piece of the company, if you own a share, that means you are a co-owner of the company.

So if you want to know what should be the price of a share you have to apply the formula:

price of a share=  market cap/number of share

The number of shares is a public information, but what about the market cap?

The market cap is usually calculated based using the Net Cash Flow of the company, that once again is a public information available in the Financial Statements, the interest rate i, and the growth of the NCF g:

Market Cap= NCF/(i-g)

Now this is really the basic, and sorry if I missed something or used the wrong terms (I did not study this in English), this was just to give an idea that no matter what the market thinks and how popular is a company, if a company is able to produce a positive Cash Flow, it will always have an intrinsic value in the long term.

Let's say I made investment income from short-term capital gains between January 1st and March 31st 2021. No taxes were withheld, so I'm looking into making Estimated Tax Payments.

My questions are:

1. Should I spread my tax payments for those realized gains across the four quarters, or should all tax payments for those gains be made for Q1 (by ~~July 15~~ May 17th for Federal, by April 15 for NC)?
2. Can I file my 2020 tax return before March 31st without adding my 2021 Q1 estimated tax payment, and then make estimated my tax payments afterward?

Any help is much appreciated!,finance
personalfinance,Looking for advice on my next steps for financial planning.,"I have been loosely following the Dave Ramsey method for about a year now. At the beginning of this, I had all my credit cards maxed, a couple thousand in collections, a ring payment, a new car payment, a credit score in the 500s and no savings. Despite 2020 being a hellish year for most everyone, I was fortunate enough to keep my job, receive the stimulus payments, and a student loan relief payment through my job. As such, I’m now in a position where I have no collections, about $3500 in savings (and $3500 in my checking account), and with the receipt of my tax refund I will have no more credit card debt at all. My credit score is also now above 700. I’m very proud of my progress in a year, but now I’m unsure of what to do next.


I have a couple scenarios in my head, and just need some guidance on where to go next. My savings goal is $5000 in my savings account. My current budget had me paying $250 per paycheck on my debts, which will now be freed up to save/allocate in more helpful ways. 


Here’s my current debt situation in a nutshell: my car has 23k left on it, 5.74% loan, $439 payment per month. It’s a terrible loan, I’m upside down, but I needed a reliable care for my commute after my old car died unexpectedly. And was in a desperate situation. I also have about $2200 in medical bills. But they are not accruing any interest and are on a payment plan. I have an HSA that I plan to use to pay them once my biggest expense comes to fruition in July/August (I’m pregnant).  Plus my deductible has now been met for my insurance. And my student loans, I have them on autopay, and use the money I received from work to pay those. My federal are on deferment.


My goals in the future are: buy a house (this one first and SOON), build my emergency fund to $10k, and potentially refinance my car?


I’m thinking, if I refinance my car to lower the interest rate by about half, then continue to make my current payment on it, plus extra, I will be able to be NOT upside down quite quickly. But this option will slow down my savings rate for my emergency fund. Alternatively,  I could focus on saving and reach my savings goal and then focus on paying down my car. 


We have a down payment saved for the house, even though we will be using a VA loan and won’t need one. I am already saving for retirement. 


Am I doing this right/making smart choices? Am I missing something I should be thinking about? Thanks in advance for the advice!",finance

personalfinance,Planning to buy a house within 12-15 months. Options to maximize our pre-approval and down payment.,"As the title says, my wife and I are planning to purchase a house as early as the end of next January through next June. Due to some nicely timed investments, an unexpected bonus, and stimulus, our savings has grown pretty considerably in the past few weeks. As such, I am trying to figure how best to utilize these additional funds. Apologies if my formatting sucks, I am on mobile.

1. Keep the money in savings/invested very conservatively. This options gives us some additional income coming in and helps build a bigger down payment for the house.

2. Pay off my wife's car. We currently owe about $10,000 on it, monthly payments are $230 and interest rate is 3.5%. This would give us the ability to save more or snowball her payment into my car payment. It would also lower our debt to income ratio to give us a larger pre-approval. Downside to me would be not having as much in savings to work with.

3. Continue paying down the car as normal and add to our savings (about $1,000 a month) and when we decide to start looking for our house, determine if paying off the car is a better option or having the money for the down payment. I like this idea but it means paying interest on a loan that we might just pay off anyway. I am also not sure how far in advance we would need to pay off the car for it to help us with the pre-approval.

Last year I bought a used car for about 11k and with an interest rate of 14.15% (I know it's absolutely insane). My credit has had a lot of issues over the years, mainly due to medical debt and cosigning on my mom's car after my dad passed away. Money got tight and she missed a few payments before I took it over. In the months since I bought my car, I've paid off her car and have had a medical collection fall off my report, raising my score a lot.

Bank of America approved me for refinance for $9300 for 60 months at 6.89% (I know not great but way better). At the time, my 10 day payoff was around $10,700. And I have 64 months left on the loan. I used my stimulus check the day it came in and now my payoff is $9297.69, so I can refinance. Right now I pay $238.22 per month, which is not an issue at all. I made a little over $57k last year in a low col state and I make yearly raises and potentially monthly bonuses. I can afford the payment, but I don't know if it's worth it to refinance. Would it hurt my score to refinance? I'm not rich by any means, but is it worth the savings? The calculator I used says I'll save around $2k

personalfinance,Savings and Student Loans,"Hello everyone, I am a recent college grad with a large sum of debt.

I have been/currently live with my parents for the last 2 years and will most likely be living with them another year as I search for a house/pay off my loans.

Currently I have around $50,000 in private loans with a 4.2 interest rate, and $41,000 in federal. My income is about $49,000 but with stipends and extra work I make about $62,000.

I have a savings account with about $28,000 that I’ve been trying to save for the down payment of a house. I also have a Roth IRA with about $2,000 invested.

I am wondering what I should do. Would it be wiser for me to take a majority of the money in my savings to pay off a large chunk of my private loans? I know many people say that you should wait to be out of debt before trying to buy a house, but to me being 24 I really would like to move out of my parents place sooner than later and with the money I have saved it would be cheaper for me to buy a house rather then rent monthly (lower monthly payments). What do you think I should do? I should be eligible for PSLF due to being an educator, but the privates will be the hardest for me to get rid of. I was think take half of my savings to max out my Roth and then pay off as much of the privates as I can, or save up to around $30,000 then put all of the rest of my paychecks towards my loans so if I found a decent house I could make an offer right away.

I could also be very wrong with all of these plans.",finance

“There were tons of promises made about what the future was going to look like. Those promises came true between 2000 and 2010. Largely, they came true,” he said. “But the tech sector gave you negative absolute returns for a decade.”

“I don’t think too many tech investors today are prepared for negative absolute returns for three, five or 10 years,” he said.

“If the nominal economy is getting stronger, you want stocks that are going to be very sensitive to that improvement in nominal economy,” Bernstein said. “That outlook for the next several years is probably going to favor cyclicals over more secular growers.”

Bitcoin,Potential BTC Crash Scenario From a Crypto Noob,"Hi guys thanks for entertaining this question.   


I've been into crypto recently holding decent percentages of BTC and ETH in my portfolio. As I continue to delve deeper into the world, now trying to trade off the currency's price action, I stumbled onto certain facts:  


1. Many exchanges peg their crypto against USDT. I mean USDT at this point is just USD to us and most people just do swaps but its basically using ur dollar to buy crypto. Its the most widely accepted way to swap for all the coins out there. Make sense.  

2. USDT is sketch however. From what I read:    
""**BUSD** is regulated and audited. They ensure that every **BUSD** is backed 1:1 by a physical dollar stored in FDIC-insured US banks. **USDT** is not audited and has had security breaches and lawsuits in the past. They don't guarantee a physical dollar backs every **USDT** and the money that does back it is stored in offshore banks.""  
Now I'm not trying to promote BUSD, but if this is the case, I think y'all know what I am getting at.  
(TL;DR)  
**WHATS STOPPING THE PEOPLE FROM TETHER FROM JUST PRINTING INFINITE USDT AND PUMPING ALL THE COINS OUT THERE TO EVENTUALLY CRASH THE VALUE OF ALL THE COINS INCLUDING BTC?** Say everyone wants to cash out their crypto into fiat (understandably) for their various uses which obviously fiat is still better for. Would there be a case where people try to go back to the paper trail and realise that they've been fed air this whole time?

After 3 years I could reevaluate and see where interest rates are, and I will have earned some money along the way.

The biggest disadvantage I can see is that there's a fairly large early withdrawal penalty, which admittedly isn't the best feature for an emergency fund, but might be a risk worth taking in exchange for the higher interest if I don't need it.

I know annuities aren't recommended for retirement income but this is something different, just wondering if I'm missing anything major. I'm also considering other alternatives like corporate bonds.",finance
Bitcoin,Seeking Yield Amid a Global Debt Bubble,"The Real Vision Crypto Interview: Jason Leibowitz, CEO and co-founder of [LeboBTC Ledger Group (LLG)](https://www.lebobtc.com), joins Ash Bennington, Real Vision senior editor, to discuss #Bitcoin custody solutions, growing interest in Bitcoin from traditional investors, and the global debt bubble. As central banks worldwide are engaging in loose monetary policy in an attempt to blunt the economic effects of the pandemic, Leibowitz shares that many of his clients understand the global macro story—as a result, people are increasingly interested in Bitcoin. In an era of historically low bond rates, he reiterates how this has spurred many investors to reallocate their portfolios in new assets as they are pushed out the risk curve seeking yield. Leibowitz explains the importance of self-custody of Bitcoin, but recognizes the difficulty of onboarding new people who are unfamiliar with how the new technology works. With the global debt bubble growing from drastic QE efforts and concerns over increasing debt on the Fed’s balance sheet, Leibowitz says that holding dollars in your portfolio, especially for corporate treasurers, is like holding a melting ice cube. Filmed on March 11, 2021.

Key Learnings: Traditional investors are becoming more attracted to assets such as Bitcoin as the global debt bubble grows, central banks continue to engage in quantitative easing and suppress rates, and currency debasement risk increases. Self-custody of Bitcoin is important to reduce custodian risks and costs, but can be difficult for people new to the technology.

I'm in my mid-twenties about to start my MBA in the fall, which is \~$111K the first year. I have about $56K in cash saved and \~$52K in retirement (401k). I'm considering opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard (kicking myself I didn't do this earlier), and maxing out the $6K in contribution for 2020 and $6K for 2021. I will be quitting my job in July 2021.

However, I had always thought I'd max out the cash I pay for school to lessen the amount in loans I take out. I'm leaning towards federal loans (first $20.5K @ 4.3%, 1.062% origination and Grad Plus @ 5.3%, 4.3% origination for the rest). If I max out on Roth contributions, I may have to take out more in loans (given that was cash I had thought I'd set aside for paying for school). I know another option is to convert the 401K to a Roth during school but that has extra tax implications - so does it make sense to do that then, vs opening one now?

Generally, any advice on investing the money in a Roth IRA vs using the cash for school? If a Roth IRA, I was thinking of investing in VTI or something similar - is this sound thinking?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 18, 2021","Stocks fell Thursday after reaching record highs a day earlier as the Treasury yields rose again, igniting another heavy pullback in tech stocks. Moreover, a new report also showed US first-time unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.44% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

In prior years, most employees who required child/dependent care would be best-off choosing the dependent care FSA if they had that option, since the child and dependent care credit phased down to 20% of costs up to $3k ($6k if two or more kids) pretty rapidly - if your family income was greater than $43,000/yr, then the most this credit could provide was $1,200 if you had 2+ kids or $600 if you had 1.

This year, it's all different, due to the legislation that was passed by Congress and signed into law last week.

# Dependent Care FSA Changes

In previous years, companies could allow you to defer up to $5,000 per year for dependent care. This has been **increased** to $10,500. Note that companies / benefits administrators are not legally required to allow you to increase your deferral, but it appears that many will make this happen between now and May.

# Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit Changes

Here is a table that outlines the changes:

&amp;#x200B;

|2020 Family Income|2020 Max Benefit (double this for 2+ kids)|2021 Family Income|2021 Max Benefit|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|&lt;$15k|35% of $3,000 in expenses, or $1,050|&lt;$125k|50% of $8,000 in expenses, or $4,000|
|$15k to $43k|Reduce by 1% for every $2,000 in income over $15k|$125k to $185k|Reduce by 1% for every $2,000 in income over $125k|
|\&gt;$43k|20% of $3,000 in expenses, or $600|\&gt;$185k|20% of $8,000 in expenses, or $1,600|

# How do I choose?

First of all, there are some things to know:

1. The Dependent Care FSA is a **tax deduction**, meaning that a dollar you defer to that account is a dollar not counted toward your taxable income. How much that deduction is worth depends on how much you earn - the more you earn, the more the deduction is worth. The deduction counts against the income used to calculate federal income tax, Social Security tax, Medicare tax, and, depending on state/local laws, possibly also your state and local tax.
   1. For example, if you life in Pennsylvania, DCFSA doesn't count toward state income tax but does count toward local income taxes. If you are in the 10% federal bracket and defer $1,000, then you save $1,000 x (10% federal income tax + 6.2% Social Security tax + 1.45% Medicare tax + 3.07% state income tax) --&gt; $1,000 x 20.72% = $207.20 in total taxes
2. The Child &amp; Dependent Care Credit is a **tax credit**, allowing you to reduce a percentage of your dependent care expenses, based on your income.
3. If you defer money into a DCFSA, you need to exclude that from whatever you use to calculate your Child &amp; Dependent Care Credit.
   1. For example, you chose to defer $1,000 into your DCFSA for 2021. You have two children in day care, and it costs a total of $20,000 this year. The most you can use to calculate your credit is $16,000, but you need to exclude the $1,000 you deferred into your DCFSA, so the most you can use is $15,000.
4. Because DCFSA money reduces your AGI, there are some counterbalances - your reduced AGI might make you eligible for a higher percent credit, but you're eligible to claim a lower level of expenses against which that credit counts.

Here is where things are *super* dependent on your income. If your income is going to be less than $125,000 (particularly if you're single), then you are almost certainly better off by *not* taking advantage of any of the additional DCFSA amounts you can defer from your paycheck. If your income is going to be more than $185,000, then you are almost certainly better off by maxing out your DCFSA. If you're somewhere in the middle, it really depends on your specific scenario.

I did some basic scenario planning in Excel, and it appears that the cutoff for AGI is in the neighborhood of $160,000 if you have 2+ kids, regardless of whether you're single, MFJ, or head of household. If you earn more than $160k/yr, it probably makes sense to contribute more to your DCFSA, and if you earn less, it probably makes sense to leave your DCFSA alone.

If you have 1 kid, then it's even more complex; in that instance, the cutoffs differ by income level:

* Single - $62,250
* Head of Household - $82,250
* MFJ - $115,500

It's all massively confusing, but the Child &amp; Dependent Care credit has been made so much more valuable to higher-income families this year that it is a worthwhile question to consider, and you need to think about it earlier in the year. Adding to the complexity is that the decision to contribute more isn't an easy yes or no. For example, in some situations it might be to your benefit to contribute an added $1,000 or less OR $4,000 or more, but not in between, so if your total child care expenses fall below $10,500, there are even more challenging decisions to make regarding exactly how much to defer to the DCFSA.

Would love if someone who knows a thing or two about taxes to chime in and either confirm or totally reject this post!

personalfinance,Fiancé and I want to refinance and purchased our home about 2 years ago. How do you decide between a 15-year or 30-year? Info in comments,"So we’re very fortunate to buy a home from the parents of a neighbor by my mother who passed away. They wanted to get rid of it quick and without hassle and we were able to get in for 225k, about 15 under market at the time with no realtor or anything. It was a very wonderful first home buying experience and we are very grateful.

Wanting to take advantage of these rates before they continue to rise, we looked into refinancing. Here’s our current break down:

-We owe 207k on our current 30-year at 4% but are roughly at 80k in equity gained. Mortgage is currently 1369 but we pay 1600

-Was offered with 30 year loan at 3ish (assuming 3.25 at the highest) at an estimate of about 1175 per month IF equity is used to pay off PMI (taxes/insurance included)

-Was also quoted a 15 year loan at about 2.65 at an estimate of about 1600 per month IF equity is used to pay off PMI (insurance and taxes included)


Now me and my Fiancé are not wealthy people, but we’re frivolous with spending and are excellent at saving money or buying only what we need and utilizing second hand items so we are never hurt. We have no over head debt, both our cars are paid for in cash and we even go as far as resale a doing side gigs/work for extra income.

Aside from the general “what if” scenarios of what if your job is lost, or the world ends, or a baby comes....why would I not do the 15-year mortgage if it’s roughly what I’m paying now and it’s all handled out of equity?

I do understand that those “what if’s” are good things to go by and should absolutely be evaluated but I feel really stuck on the 15. I’ll obviously be taking about this with my spouse as well for her opinion but I genuinely have no idea other than the basic mind set of “I pay less now, more for me now, but pay more later or “pay more now, less for me now, but pay less overall”

Am I overthinking or dumbing this down?

Another thing is I want to take advantage of my absurd equity before there’s a correction because I don’t think houses tend to gain 100k in value in 2 years for nothing but I do believe whatever correction may happen on the near future will rebound overall.

TLDR: 30 year mortgage or 15 year mortgage, why, why not, any advice, or any stories or reasonings on deciding. If you currently pay what you could pay on 15 year at a lower interest rate, would you switch on that principle alone?",finance

stocks,"Where are those who were around for the 2008 ""crash"" and do you remember the recovery sentiment?","I do not claim to be a bear or a bull in this market. I am just along for the ride but some of the feel I get from the media and the public remind me a lot of the 2008 crisis. Well more so the recovery from the crisis. I was probably the age of the average reddit user trading today when it happened. FYI it was much harder to get into trading (and expensive) back then... make sure to appreciate the time you are living in! 

What I remember was that when the fed stepped in and started handing out money everyone was dropping the word ""hyperinflation."" It was the first time I had heard of it and I had to figure out what it meant.

They also cut interest rates in half and the theme was ""it is only a matter of time before they came back."" I bought a house in 2011 and my loan officer was pushing me to hurry before interest rates went higher. 

They started this ""quantitative easing"" for the stock market where the government dumped money in so it would move up ""artificially."" This is how it was explained to me at the time and why people started talking about the bubble building that was going to ""pop"" in the stock market as it recovered to it's ""pre-crisis"" levels. 

When I think back to the ""sentiment"" of the financial crisis I see a lot of the same things today but it is all compressed into a much shorter time frame now. It also has this ""double down"" feel. Interest rates didn't ever recover and were cut in half yet again during the covid crisis. The fed is printing far more money then they did back then (though the bail outs were huge). I don't think they ever really stopped (someone else can clarify) injecting money into the economy. I also would like to note that inflation didn't ""get out of control"" but it sure seems things are much more expensive even though the numbers they follow don't show that. 

TL;DR These are the things that come to my mind from watching CNBC everyday after work during the financial crisis. The worries of then seem to be similar to the worries of today but they didn't actually play out back then. At the same time it seems we never got ""back to where we were"" when you consider the fed's involvement after 2009. They seem to be perpetually stuck injecting money and keeping rates low. Whenever they try to step away the market throws a tantrum and they come back. Can anyone else make some comparisons as to how this time is different or possibly the same?

I am wanting to put down $12,000 and my current car is worth about $8,000 on the market or about $4,750 on a trade-in. It still runs and is fully paid off, but I am at that point in my life where I am wanting something a bit nicer and faster. My credit is 760ish and my only debt is a mortgage. I still plan on having 6 months of expenses in savings as an emergency fund. I have a stable job with a good level of job security. I have about $800 going into savings at the end of every month after taxes, 401K deductions, and all expenses are paid.  I have not shopped for rates yet as I am wanting to get my standing of where I am at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking at two different cars as possibly my next car, so I am wanting some input as to which would be the best short and long-term financial move.

&amp;#x200B;

Car A:

Car A is a few year old used Lexus with a market value of 28K-31K, but it has already taken its depreciation. Using other Lexus cars as a point of reference, it would be safe to say that after 5 years it would be worth around 20K-24K depending on wear and tear, but the used car market is often unpredictable. Used car interest rates appear to be around 3%-4% for a 60 month loan, but I have not shopped for one yet since I am not ready to buy yet. Interest paid over the life of the loan appears to be between $750-950 depending on the rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Car B:

Car B is a brand new Honda Civic Type R. MSRP on a this is right at 38K. Used for this model is not an option since it holds it's value extremely well and used options are only about 1K-2K less for a car with 10K+ miles on it. The hike in the interest rate from going used would almost match the difference in cost difference between new and used. Used models of this car are still selling for 34K with 35k miles on them, but this is a forever car to me so resale doesn't matter as much to me, but I want to be protected should something happen and I need to sell the car. New interest rates appear to be around 2%-2.5% for 60 months and I would be between $950-$1,300 in interest paid for the life of the loan.

Of course, with government jobs the openings are few and far between, especially in this economy, and especially when I already live in a huge tech area where labor supply is high.

One area of interest is cyber security/cyber crime. A lot of my current analysis work already overlaps with some of the tasks (Plus I have some prior experience as a park ranger where I did LE but without ability to make arrests since that required police academy training). However, I keep seeing that almost every position posted REQUIRES that you be POST certified at the time of the application and that you upload your certification.

Why do you need to be a POLICE OFFICER for a computer/tech job if you aren't actually making contact and arresting suspects? I'm actually going to send them an email to ask why this is required since the post doesn't mention actual interaction with suspects, but because I keep seeing it so often I want to know if this is common.

personalfinance,Buy a truck? Wait? Attempting to build a country house in the future.,"I have a general finance question and I thought about going to a financial advisor but thought I'd post here first. 

I got married 12 days ago and my wife and I bought a car for her on our honeymoon. The total loan amount is shy of $30,000 and I don't know the *exact* interest rate as of yet since the bank hasn't mailed up all the info yet. Monthly payments are $533 and we budgeted $1,000 a month for our car payments. She wanted a new car so she can preserve the Mustang her parents bought her in high school. 

I want to buy a truck now, we live in rural Georgia so this is a bit of a necessity for doing things around the house and hauling stuff off as well. The quote they gave us is $470-489/month which makes us a little over budget but it's no apparent problem. 

We want to start buying a parcel of land and start building a home about 6 months from now or when I've made 6 monthly payments on her car so my credit looks the best when we go to the banks. Making 6 payments on a vehicle loan would look great on my credit history since my credit score is 752, my line of credit is 2 years old and I've only used my credit card and taken out a jewelry loan. 

To get you to the point, would it be best to go ahead and buy a truck for me or wait until a later date? The rate is really good for the truck and I test drove it today. Real nice ride for the money. 

Second, how would I look to a mortgage company with one vehicle loan vs 2 vehicle loans? Both would have 6 months of on time payments by that time. 

My wife and I are both registered nurses. 
Income before taxes is a little over $8,000/month. We would have the money to make a $1,200/month mortgage as well as the $1,000+/month vehicle payments. This is just a matter of how we would look to the banks and what would make us more likely to get approved for a mortgage (to build a house).

CryptoCurrency,Strange times indeed...,"We are in a particularly weird time in the history of crypto. The broader markets are largely tied to BTC. So when it goes up or down, most of the alts follow suit. This is not all that new, but what is new is just how dependent on more “traditional” market forces, the price swings of BTC have become. 5 years ago BTC didn’t really care about what The Fed was doing or what T-Bills and Bonds were up to. So now because BTC is seen largely as a store of value and inflation hedge, many of the altcoins are swinging because of the exact same coattail effects even if those projects have nothing to do with those market and financial forces. It’s an odd relationship, but nevertheless quite important to recognize.

Furthermore, the crypto landscape has become so diversified that different sector are coming in hot in different waves for different reasons. 5 months ago it was BTC then ETH then the altcoins sorta followed (with huge gains % wise). Now they’ve been largely quiet in the last month while the exchanges and swaps have taken over like Binance, CDC, Uni etc... but in the meantime, the NFT space has obviously exploded and most of the projects that had exploded in January and February have sat mainly dormant.

I don’t have the answers, but if you’re doing any sort of trading, these mini-trends are quite interesting. They’re like a school of fish moving from one sector of crypto to the next, running prices sky high and then moving onto the next idea. Meanwhile, the vast majority of them are beholden to standard financial world metrics of the macroeconomy because of their implicit ties to BTC.

This is not even referencing the fact that DeFi maximalists are in the throes of conflict with the large scale continued embrace of traditional centralized finance like the credit card companies, the brokerage houses, and the hedge funds. Every dollar that pours in is great, but it feels like it’s only breeding more centralization. 

The thing we wanted all along has become what we hate. Sorta. Our favorite band got too popular and now there’s nothing we can do about the fans who “just don’t get it.”

Anyway, I think it’s quite intriguing to see the market forces pushing and pulling in quite conflicting directions. Fortunately, I believe that in the next 5 or 6 months, most bets will sort of equalize. I think these waves will continue and that there is still a TON of money to be made. Especially if you diversify into a variety of projects.

personalfinance,How the *&amp;!% am I ever going to afford a house?,"I’m in my mid 20’s with a master’s degree living at home and essentially been saving 80% of my paycheck the past 9 months since I’ve graduated in order to pay off student loans and add to my savings. 

About a month ago I earned enough money to pay off all my student loans, however due to the current forbearance on fed loans and the possibility of a portion of loans being forgiven, I haven’t actually made any payments. I have no other debt. 

I really want to move out of my parents house, and I’d much rather buy than rent. But the housing market in my state is absolutely insane. Home prices have gone up 25% on average since last year. People are bidding +50k over asking prices. 

I have anxiety about not only saving enough for a down payment but also the necessary emergency fund that comes with owning a home. I’ve been told it’s crucial to have 6 months of income saved before living on your own. My question is.... how the actual f$!&amp; do people afford all this??? I thought I made decent money going into the field I’m in now, but now I’m doubting everything. this is all plausible if I continued staying at home to save, but I want to be independent. I’ve been doing long distance with my bf on the other side of state for a year and half now and it’s really affecting our relationship.

Just feeling really discouraged, not necessarily looking for any advice just wanted to get this off my chest. Sorry for the rant.",finance
personalfinance,Home refinance going on 6 freakin' months. Normal or not?,"I started a refinance with Loan Cabin back in September because they had a really good rate offer. Communication with them has been spotty and then I find out two months ago my loan officer was no longer working for the company. My rate lock expired back in November and they've said nothing about it. I understand companies that offer very low rates just get more applications for home buyers and refinancing and that the duration to close has been compounded by the pandemic, but this is ridiculous. And now interest rates are rising again and I've already gone all in with this lender. Everything I've read online says expect upwards of 90 days to close, but 6 months is absurd and I'm feeling like Loan Cabin dropped the ball somewhere. Anyone else experienced such a long wait for refinancing?",finance
personalfinance,recovery rebate credit??,"hi everyone 

i filed with turbotax already for my 2020, and i’ve already received my federal/state refunds as well as my third stimulus 

the thing is, i never received the first 2 so i qualified for the recovery rebate credit and its written on my tax forms that i am eligible for the whole 1,800, but i still have not received it! 

what should i do? i called turbotax a few days ago and the lady was also very confused and said that i should’ve received it at the same time i got my federal return, and if i didn’t then i need to amend my taxes. 

any suggestions?? :/",finance
gaming,Competitiv Games without Teams,"Heya,

Are there any competitiv games out there with an active ranked playerbase (not league of legends active, but enough to consistently find games in less than like 10 mins) but which aren't team based and aren't fighting, strategy or battle royal games? The only competitiv games I know of and which aren't team based are Starcraft, 2d Fighting games (smash, tekken, etc) and battle royales...

I am just really fed up with toxic teammates right now but I really enjoy the competitive aspect... Aaaand I really don't enjoy strategy, fighting and battle royales enough to invest alot of time in it.",technology
cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 03.19.2021,"Good Morning Cardanoverse!

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

Also, there’s now an audio version available for anyone interested: [https://youtu.be/L1vZvQu1cs8](https://youtu.be/L1vZvQu1cs8)

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Coinbase Pro did actually happen yesterday morning. Congratulations everyone. It’s been a long road and it was beautiful watching those initial candles build on the chart after all these years. [https://pro.coinbase.com/](https://pro.coinbase.com/)
2. The Crypto Time Traveler mentioned last week (Item 49) has apparently left us and now gone back to the future. It definitely adds a touch of realism when they actually leave. [https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2/status/1371492636884865029](https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2/status/1371492636884865029)
3. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity. He specifically mentioned Atala Prism. There was talk of the digital identity being able to be linked to wallets, payment systems, and property. He also reasserted that the deals on the table in Africa would bring “millions of users” into the Cardano ecosystem.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8)
4. If you haven’t seen it in the past, the Atala Prism website has a demo that works with the mobile app showing how the identity solution (along with academic credentialing, health insurance, and proof of employment) would run on Cardano.  [https://www.atalaprism.io/](https://www.atalaprism.io/)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying "" Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

2. Famed crypto enthusiast and billionaire Mike Novogratz asks the Cardano world ""Can anyone make a real bull case for [$ADA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=cashtag_click)? Does anyone build on it? Use it? Why is market cap so high? Should it be a funding asset? It’s one of the few cryptos I haven’t traded in my life.""

8. Charles will be speaking at the Blockchain Africa Conference this week which may or may not give us more clues as to the African Bird announcement. [https://blockchainafrica.co/](https://blockchainafrica.co/)
9. SingularityNet collaboration with Cardano going down. How else is Skynet gonna pay the Terminators?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ) [https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos)
10. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
11. ~~What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?~~ [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1) RETIRED!
12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh.
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)
14. Charles claimed Elon was trolling Cardano with “meta for k” on twitter. Can anyone argue one way or another on this? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1364350825271685122](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1364350825271685122)

16. Possible Soulja Boy Cardano collab on NFT. Maybe Soulja Boy could be best brohs with Charles and Stephen Wolfram broh? [https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907](https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907)
17. ~~Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?~~ RETIRED!
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. ~~Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark.~~ (Retired: he finally got it) Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. ~~Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?~~ RETIRED!
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years.
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

35. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have a hairline that is even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.
36. Cardano reached 550k wallets in half the time it took BTC [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1369933366368362496](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1369933366368362496)
37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1369961368946946053](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1369961368946946053)
39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum). This is one of those nice articles where the British guy pleasantly reads it to you if you want. Use this one to convince all your friends you are the ultimate blockchain expert:  “listen Kyle...the shortcoming of UTXO accounting is....” [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/)

45. Cardano uses a tiny fraction of the energy some other top-ten blockchains use.   This factoid alone should allow you to hook up with eco-obsessed nature people. [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875)
46. Now you can drive your drinking buddies crazy with your ADA obsession without even saying a word!  [https://twitter.com/KenzieByrne6/status/1370566690073935872](https://twitter.com/KenzieByrne6/status/1370566690073935872)
47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

63. We get another People of Input Output Global video.  This one features Dan Friedman. He currently lives in Japan.  But, the interview starts off with some very interesting stories about his youth in 1980s Kiev, Ukraine.  His speaking and story-telling style is similar to the captain in a 1990s buddy cop movie (in a good way). Very interesting and compelling guy.

personalfinance,Keep money in savings or pay it towards credit card debt?,"I have about $7000 in credit card debt and about $3000 in savings at the moment. I'm paying about $700 a month towards the credit card and am on track to have it paid off by December. The card's interest rate is 10.99% and my monthly expenses come to about $2000 a month, give or take. I'm on the fence over whether to put some or all of the $3000, which is functioning as an emergency fund, towards me credit card debt or continue to keep it as an emergency fund. I'm paid weekly and put $25-50 a week into the savings account. My goal once the credit card debt is paid off is to start putting that $700 a month towards saving for a down payment on a house, which should net me about $13,000 per year after my annual bonus is factored in, and I hope to be ready to start looking within the next 3-4 years.

personalfinance,Is lease-to-own a vehicle cheaper?,"I'm looking at purchasing a new vehicle. It is a plug-in hybrid that gets a federal tax credit of $4,502. My spouse and I do not make enough to benefit from this tax credit since a lot of our income is non-taxable. I've read that if you lease a vehicle from a dealer that they get the tax credit and will also be willing to take that tax credit amount off the purchase/ lease price of the vehicle since they get it back the following year on their taxes.

If I were to lease the vehicle initially with the intent to purchase it after the lease is up, would that work out? Is there something I'm missing here? Are there any drawbacks to this? Please help me understand this better.

To clarify, I want to lease a vehicle with the intent to purchase it at the end of the lease so that I can have the dealer take off the tax credit amount from the top end of the vehicle's price tag to get a cheaper vehicle.",finance

Bitcoin,Website Reviews to Earn Bitcoin Interest,"For those users who started using bitcoin several years ago, there are now lots of lending options that just didn't exist pre-2017. All assume US-citizen and not a New York state resident (weird rules for NY residents). Here's my review of several of them:

1) Nexo - basic interest is 5% for a 30-day commitment not to withdraw. I like Nexo a lot, the platform is really easy to navigate and they pay consistent interests on all their cryptocurrency (unlike others below). 

2) Celsius - interest of 6.2% (limit 2 btc, then 4%). Great platform, but wavering interest rates is annoying.  Their App UX/UI also looks like a casino (I'm not a fan, but functionally it works fine). I did think I was signing my life away when I tried to take a loan, whereas Nexo's felt super simple and streamlined.

3) Blockfi.  6% on first 2.5BTC, 3% after. Great app. Not much else to say, they are solid and I believe have a pending partnership with Fidelity.

4) Voyager. 6.25%, no limit.  They are a legitimate publicly traded Canadian company.  Their interest rates may vary and used to be closer to 5%.

5) Hodlnaut.  6.2%, no limit. Singaporean start up with strong backers. Have great rates on other coins too like Eth. I love their interest accrued updates in real time and they're clear on weekly payment schedule.

6) Vauld. 7% with 30 day no withdrawl.  Also a Singaporean start-up.  Good app, high interest rate.

Also here's an aggregator site that was really helpful for me in comparing interest rates (not 100% accurate but close). https://loanscan.io/ Click on crypto at the top and sort on BTC.

I've tried to open a dispute with Fedex saying it was Incorrect Account with reason of No Knowledge of Shipment and put ""fraudulent"" in the comment (they really only give you 21 characters in your dispute comments), however, they denied my disputes. The addresses, both To and From, for these shipments are nowhere near what my address on my account is. I opened another set of disputes this morning.

personalfinance,I got a scam call immediately after trying to contact Turbo Tax.,"*SEE EDIT*

So I never received the US stimulus checks number 2 or 3. I suspect this is because I owed money on my taxes instead of the other way around. 

I usually fill out my taxes myself, but back in 2016 I used Turbo Tax because I was just fed up and too tired to do it myself.

Anyway, they did a fine job that year, so I figured I'd bite the bullet and pay for some help because I really could use those stimulus checks.

I read that if you missed the second stimulus check, that they would return it to you via a tax refund. I tried to call Turbo Tax to ask some questions about that. They have a system where you enter your number and they will call you in ""5 minutes"". I waited a minute or so and got a call from an 800 number. 

Picked it up and it's an Indian guy who asked me to share my screen. 

I immediately hung up, reported the number, virus scanned my computer, and changed my passwords. That number tried to call me back, then I got a call from a different number. 

I don't know if one of the second calls was legit, or if it was just another scammer trying to call back, but either way, I am not doing that again.

My questions are:

1. How did the scammers know I was contacting Turbo Tax? I detected no viruses on my devices, nor any security breaches from strange IP addresses. Is it a security problem with Turbo Tax?



2. How can I safely contact someone for help? I'm willing to pay for a secure service, but now I'm afraid to even try the live chatboxes for help. 

Thank you.


Edit: I contacted their customer support line (which I felt was more secure).

They informed me that there *is* in fact a protocol in which they will ask you to share your screen, but it is optional. The agent is supposed to verify your information first, then ask about that option, but my ""agent"" immediately asked me to share my screen.

I am still highly suspect, and I think sharing your screen for any reason is extremely dangerous. 

I cannot be 100% sure if it was or was not a scam, but I did get an answer to my 2020 tax return stimulus check situation without giving any personal data. 

I will consider this resolved for now. Thank you.",finance

A few other notes. I do plan to make a ""catch up"" payment to our loans, which we have not had to pay and are not accumulating interest right now. I plan to dedicate about $20k to that payment, which will reduce our debt to $170k. I hesitate to snowball too much here because I am somewhat risk averse. Our payment plan is to pay off the loans in 6 years out of the 10 year repayment time (no plans for forbearance or forgiveness programs). On the retirement side, I target 20% of gross income saved per year (including employer match). 

Any thoughts about my situation? Would it be a bad idea to take on a mortgage with a $1700/month payment (~315k house with 15k down)? We would qualify for a ""doctors loan"" which typically require only a 0-3% down payment and no PMI, with a slight interest rate increase.",finance

ex: Do I just add box 1 from my W2 and box 1 from my 1098-T? Or do I subtract box 2 from box 1 on my W2 then add? Then I assume I add box 1 from my 1099-INT since interest gained from my savings account goes into AGI. 

I'm sorry for the plethora of questions. I really do not want to pay a fine or go to jail for not doing taxes right at the age of 19... I also don't know if I even have to file because I think I calculated AGI wrong for the IRS tool to check if I have to file.",finance

stocks,On RED DAYS: Take a moment and think GREEN. Mental Health is critical.,"Hey Reddit - **just sending some good vibes, love, and true positivity your way on a Friday**. This past week has been very tough for a lot of people as the Fed chose not to extend the bank leverage ratio and bond yields have been rising.  It's a tricky game they're playing, and a lot of investors, particularly in tech have been burned, myself included.

As I look at my portfolio, a lot of the winnings earlier in the year with innovation, tech, and EV have literally disappeared in the past 4 days. All I've seen lately are negative posts in the red, and questions about what's happening in the future.  I put a bunch of money in innovation ETFs like ARKK, and have been killed over the past little while.

Like many of you, sometimes I suffer from mental health issues, and weeks like the past few can be devastating. You should know, there is **NOTHING WRONG with closing your brokerage accounts** for a day or two. I typically check about 10-20x a day, and its clearly not healthy. When you're up it seems great, but it really has a negative effect on me.  I'm forcing myself to work out, to get outside, get some sun, and focus onw what really matters in life.

If anyone needs to chat - by all means shoot me a note. Until then - enjoy your Friday. Love the ones close to you. Try your best to view this in perspective - life is so much more than the value of your portfolio. And so are you.

personalfinance,How to temporarily protect future home-buying funds?,"In this crazy market frenzy we decided to sell our small home and rent a larger house for 1-2 years.

While we mull the decision to continue living in the city or not, buying a ready-to-move-in home vs. a renovation vs. new construction... we have a six-figure sum of cash sitting in a BofA savings account... which I KNOW is about the dumbest place it can be.

We will need to access chunks of this money in the near future once we decide on our new direction, so I don't want the cash tied up in anything where we can't access it. I also am afraid that depreciation will eat away out the chunk if left in a regular savings account.

My thoughts are that I could transfer the money into my eTrade account, where I manage my Roth IRA, and divy up the cash into several index funds (like Bankrate's top five for 2021?) and as we need chunks for property purchase, etc, then I could just pull money from the least-earning funds first.

personalfinance,How do I receive my U.S. (state and federal) tax returns internationally,"Last year, I worked as a research intern in South Carolina. Naturally, I have to file for my tax returns, but there's an issue. The bank account I used in the U.S. has been closed down and I'm currently in the U.K. and have no way of opening another one.

Knowing this, what are my options in terms of receiving the money. From what I know I can:

A: Have a friend in the U.S. that could potentially receive the tax return through their bank account, but I'm not sure how legal that is.

B: Have it wired to my U.K. bank account or have them mailed to me. I'm concerned about how easy it will be to cash the cheque here and that it may lost in the mail as it needs to be internationally shipped. U.K. bank account also don't have routing numbers. Apparently, state tax can't even be wired or mailed internationally (correct me if I'm wrong).

2) Celsius - interest of 6.2% (limit 2 btc, then 4%). Great platform, but wavering interest rates is annoying. Their App UX/UI also looks like a casino (I'm not a fan, but functionally it works fine). I did think I was signing my life away when I tried to take a loan, whereas Nexo's felt super simple and streamlined.

3) Blockfi. 6% on first 2.5BTC, 3% after. Great app. Not much else to say, they are solid and I believe have a pending partnership with Fidelity.

4) Voyager. 6.25%, no limit. They are a legitimate publicly traded Canadian company. Their interest rates may vary and used to be closer to 5%.

5) Hodlnaut. 6.2%, no limit. Singaporean start up with strong backers. Have great rates on other coins too like Eth. I love their interest accrued updates in real time and they're clear on weekly payment schedule.

6) Vauld. 7% with 30 day no withdrawl. Also a Singaporean start-up. Good app, high interest rate.

personalfinance,$90K windfall. How do I make it work for me without gambling it?,"I had a tiny little bitcoin investment that grew into $90K. Pretty proud of it.
But now I'm at the point where I'm suddenly very anxious about it just disappearing.
Some facts:

Age 30. Married. No kids. Just refinanced our first home to a 2.6% interest rate for 15 years. Excellent credit.
Live in SE US.
Own 1 car, the other is 9 months from being paid off.
No credit card debt.
$100K in student loans combined, but I'm really not concerned with getting those paid. On track to get most forgiven with the non-profit deal. 
Income: 101K combined annual.
Current cash savings: 8K.
Current investments: just the 90K in crypto + retirement fund with maximum employer matching.
Anticipated expenses: about 10K in fertility treatments next year.

I want to see this money grow. I'm tempted to keep betting on crypto, because I really am confident in its future. But the bigger the number gets the more I get really anxious about having it in something so volatile.
Should I put it in a crypto index fund? Take out half in cash savings just to hold it? Should I do a stock index fund?

Any perspectives are appreciated.",finance
solar,Thoughts on storage batteries?,"Hello,

I'm planning to go solar this year.  Currently it seems like Tesla is my best option, and I plan to purchase the 8.16 kw system.

What I'm torn on is whether to buy a powerwall as well.  The powerwall would bring me from about 50% self powered to nearly 100%.  My only hesitation is that with wider adoption of solar and electric vehicles I expect the prices of batteries to decrease significantly in the future.  I can't decide if I should take advantage of the federal incentives now while they're still around or hold off and wait for price drops.

I know that any responses will just be speculation, but I'm interested in hearing the thoughts of others.

Edit: I appreciate all of the responses, but my question isn't if a battery is a good investment for energy savings in a net metering state.  My question is if you've already decided that you're going to purchase a battery if now is a good time to buy.

I'm less concerned with paying the absolute lowest cost for energy and more concerned with cutting my grid usage to the lowest possible levels while also having a power source during hurricane season.  However, I have to balance that with my own financials needs, so if there's a high likelihood of battery prices dropping substantially in the short term then it makes more sense to wait.",energy

personalfinance,New college grad making &gt;80k. Where do I invest?,"Fresh college grad started a new job as a software engineer. My goal is to retire lean by 40

I wish to do this with a combination of real estate and dividend stocks.

Income:

* 79k annually salary
* 5k annual side hustle

Debts:

* 47k Federal student loans (currently 0% APR)
* 23k Private student loans (refinanced @ 3.06% APR)
* 16k Car Loan @ 1.75% APR

Assets:

* \~5k Savings account
* 3k Dividend stocks
* 3k Bitcoin/Eth

Monthly Expenses:

* $2500 for all living expenses including vehicle loan
* $250 Private loans
* $0 federal loans (This will be around $500)

Currently this leaves me with around $1250/month to invest or pay off debt

My goal is to use an FHA loan to purchase my first multifamily with little down and house hack ASAP.

While house hacking will definitely give me much better ROI than paying off my low interest debt I am concerned my high DTI will stop me from getting a house mortgage. In addition; my credit score is around 730, I am fairly confident I can get this above 750 by paying off some of my newest federal loans and closing out those accounts. Paying off federal loans before private loans seems like a bad choice however.

I have also considered simply investing the excess into good dividend stocks and waiting out the housing market for a couple years. This equates to around 5% annual ROI on the investment while paying the minimum on my low interest loans.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

For everyone who is saying my expectations are far too grand, consider this. In a conservative estimation I can expect around 5% salary growth annually over the next 10 years. It is not unreasonable to see even well over 200k before that 10 year mark. This is based on averages in my company which may actually be under the market average.

While I am aware my goal is overambitious I wanted to make a plan for this and put myself on the best path possible to have options sooner rather than wait it out. This is a matter of giving myself options and maximizing my gains over the next 15 years.

Also yes, I am taking my employers 401k match and maxing my HSA, I just feel putting more into any IRA account is pointless if I have any hope of retiring early. 

Some people are telling me to pay off my loans as soon as possible simply so I can reduce debt. Frankly I feel like this is just down to a fear of being over leveraged but it seems to me like a waste of my money (only 3% returns at best). I am certainly open to alternate ideas and not having a looming debt payment may certainly reduce some level of stress but the real question is ""is this optimal?"".",finance
stocks,Federal Reserve's dovish state of mind puts quality assets at risk,"Hello guys.

Of course I haven’t written this piece, copied from SAXO BANK platform. 

I tried to post the 3 charts as well, but don’t know how, I am sure you can find them. 

I am not knowledgeable enough to understand as to how serious this is or not? Hope you understand this better than me. 




By maintaining monetary policies easy but letting long-term yields free to move, the Federal Reserve gives support to lower quality credits while putting quality at risk. We are heading towards an unprecedented duration event that will weight on high duration assets, which in the bond market are concentrated within the investment-grade corporate space. The US investment grade (IG) corporate bond sector is heading to the worst quarter since 1981, with the utilities and communications sectors being more exposed to rising interest rates than others. The technology sector, which saw stellar valuations in the stock market last year, is characterized by a duration of eight and a half years, which matches the US IG average.
The market doesn't care about the Federal Reserve's dovish state of mind. The Fed said it itself: the economic outlook is improving substantially with inflation destined to rise together with the country's GDP, while the labour market gets stronger. Nevertheless, the central bank decided to stand still and continue with its accommodative monetary policy. This decision leaves the market with the
ONLY OPTION TO TAKE THE SITUATION INTO ITS OWN HANDS AND DUMPING TREASURIES
that will inevitably lose value.

The steeping of the US yield curve resumed this morning with the curve's belly and the benchmark 10-year yields rising faster than long-term US Treasuries. The big issue is that if economic forecasts and inflation expectations continue to rise, r
ATES WILL NOT STABILIZE UNTIL THE FEDERAL RESERVE DECIDES TO INTERVENE AND ENGAGE IN THE INFAMOUS YIELD CURVE CONTROL (YCC)
. In our view, YCC will be unavoidable because, although the market can function with higher rates now, the higher they go, the more the pain that will be inflicted on those assets with historically high durations.

The market is talking about 10-year yields hitting 2%; however, if the Federal Reserve continues to keep watching, they might rise much further. The Fed has been able to maintain easy financial conditions by keeping real rates negative. However, they will not stay negative forever. In normal circumstances, nominal yields should price over the breakeven rate. It means that if inflation expectations continue to rise, we inevitably will see 10-year yields rising above 2.3%.

A BROAD CROSS-ASSET SELLOFF MIGHT SPARK FROM HIGH-GRADE CREDITS  RATHER THAN JUNK

Yesterday’s FOMC meeting and today’s selloff in sovereigns reinforce our belief that
WE ARE WITNESSING A HISTORICAL DURATION EVENT
.
The investment-grade corporate bond market will fall faster than junk within this context because of its sensibility to higher duration. Indeed, while the average duration within junk is around three and a half years, the investment-grade bond space carries a duration of more than 8 years. Duration within quality credits has recently increased dramatically: in the past two years, duration has increased by one year and a half. To put things into context: it took four years after the global financial crisis for the duration to increase by as much.

18_03_AS2
If we put Treasuries into the equation, we would see that in 2013 amid the Taper Tantrum, 10-year yields rose by 130 basis points; however, investment-grade corporate bonds fell only by 2%. This year Investment-grade corporate bonds have fallen already by 3.36%, the most in forty years, with 10-year yields rising only by nearly 85bps showing that
DURATION IS A BIGGER THREAT THAN CREDIT QUALITY
. Indeed, by
MAINTAINING MONETARY POLICIES EASY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE GIVES SUPPORT TO LOWER QUALITY CREDITS ON ONE HAND. ON THE OTHER, BY LETTING LONG-TERM YIELDS MOVE FREELY WHILE INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ARE RISING, THE CENTRAL BANK PUTS QUALITY AT RISK.
And who sits on quality? Everybody, more in particular real money with long-term strategies such as insurances and pension funds. And again, it is deja-vu: we might be headed towards another Global Financial Crisis?

18_03_AS3
As the yield curve continues to steepen will be essential to limit interest rate sensitivity. It will be interesting to know that the sectors that carry the highest duration are the communication and utility sectors whose duration is well above 10 years. The technology sector is within the US IG average, with around eight years and a half in duration. For those looking for quality while reducing duration sensibly, high-grade financials provide 6 years duration, almost half than that offered by the communications and utility sectors.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 19, 2021","Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow (DIA) falling while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) recovered from heavy losses yesterday. Market participants continue to focus on rising Treasury yields and the FOMC’s comments earlier this week. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem and if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds, and that continued \[Thursday\].” It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was 5 years ago. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 0.6% in March to date and is holding onto a year-to-date gain of just 1.8%, after surging by 44% in 2020.

Despite headwinds in the market and the expectation for some volatility in the near-term, given the Fed’s accommodative monetary stance, the pace of vaccinations, additional fiscal stimulus, strong growth in EPS, and the impending reopening of the economy, our longterm thesis remains bullish

My HR department stated that due to my claimed allowance, no federal taxes will be withheld...but that doesn't make sense to me. Especially when on my first check using the W4 with the high allowance, I had $134 federal taxes withheld. This number matched the estimated bi-weekly deduction on the IRS calculator.

**Competition**

There are competitors in the field of AR glasses, but none come close to the size that Vuzix has as Vuzix is a field leader. Most competitors sell inferior products (either heavier/thicker, provide inadequate support, or use inferior technology). Vuzix is also a market leader in revenue for AR glasses. 

This is a very niche environment that few have been able to enter, so Vuzix has a strong grasp on future growth.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VUZI/analysis/

**Risks**

Although not likely, they can dilute their shares again if needed. They are currently sitting on over $40 million in cash, so they won’t need to, but it is definitely a possibility in the future.

As Vuzix is not a startup and is still cash flow negative by a large margin, they need to improve their scalability and increase profits to be seen as a viable company for future investors.

As Vuzix has not made a profit, rising interest rates could hurt them when they need to take out loans to maintain business (not likely as they have plenty of cash on hand).

**Technical Analysis**

This is my own analysis, so take with however much salt you like.

Vuzi has been on an explosive uptrend the last few days after having been beaten the past few weeks. They have maintained themselves in the upper BB for quite some time (although it is widening), and their 10 EMA and 20 EMA has held very steadily. The MACD signal line crossed mid-February signalling a buy and it has maintained a healthy divergence. Their recent price action increase has them slightly overbought, but not necessarily a sell (at least not to me). 

Current support and resistance around $29.50, $25, $23.80, $21, and $19 (although will most likely not be maintained). More realistic support and resistance around $26, $22, $21, $19.50, $18, and $15.50.

Another thing I noticed is their volume fluctuation on drastic green days vs drastic red days. Drastic green day volume typically has twice the volume of normal and high red days, but red days have a much steeper price change on lower volume. Not sure what to make of that. Maybe people are holding? Maybe the volume is being diluted across multiple days? Not sure.

My buy range is between $18 and $23 (this does not mean it will reach these prices again, and does not mean it will rebound once it does). My current rating is a hold until (if) it reaches these prices again.

**Final Thoughts/TL;DR**

Vuzix is a long-term buy for me, but not at the current price. AR glasses are the future, and I believe they are able to establish themselves in this niche sector. Their products, although not revolutionary, are far beyond the competition and provide excellent ROI for the companies that utilize them. Once they're able to scale up, they will be worth much more than they are now.

I have a current rating of hold until (if) it reaches my buy range of $18-$23 where I plan to buy more. I do believe a pullback from the recent jump is due, but not necessarily guaranteed. I strongly believe in this company and its experienced and well-vested board to increase revenue and push the company into a multi-billion dollar state compared to its current valuation of around $1 billion.

I currently hold 25 shares at $23.50 that I’ve been holding for a month (talk about bad timing) as a means to include it into my portfolio and continuously check the price.",finance

NFT,NFT Woes,"NFT Woes...... I have an artist friend who is thinking about getting one the NFT bandwagon.... so I decided to learn about it... and decided that I'd create my own NFT to test and learn about the processes... here is my tale of woe and a cautionary tale ....

I did a bunch of reading and then decided on Bitbuy (an exchange in Canada -because US f'ng exchanges don't deal with cdn banks... sigh...)  to purchase ETH (ETH is for paying the Gas fees and hold the finished NFT tokens) 

Then I created a wallet (Metamask) free.. woo hoo,

Back to BitBuy... paid Bitbuy $100cdn and got ""ETH"" in my ""Bitbuy"" wallet...  not real ETH as you can't do shit with it.... So now you have to 'move' the ETH from the exchange (Bitbuy or other shitstick) and into a wallet, just so you can actually buy shit with it, or in my case pay the 'Gas' fees for creating a NFT..... this I get, the computing cost of creating a NFT is a tonne of computing time (well not really anymore with all the massive mining facilities - they just keep the prices sky high when it's actually costing them less and less every generation of hardware updates... sigh... bloody bankers...)

So now to put the newly purchased ETH into my wallet and WAIT... Minimum ETH transfer limit... So... FM.. buy $150 more ETH (That's $250cdn now)  for my Bitbuy 'wallet' (not actually a wallet).... so now I have enough to meet their 'Minimum"" transfer limit and go to transfer the ETH (that I supposedly own - not really because the exchange charges gas fees on withdrawal) ...  to my new Metamask wallet (because I cannot pay Nifty Gateway or Rarible or anyone else for that matter with a bloody Bitbuy wallet) and guess what, more f'ing fees....

So now we are putting money into my wallet, and guess what, the exchange charges you to 'withdraw' the ETH that you paid them for... (so they are selling ETH that has not been minted, but charging you to mint it as it is withdrawn...  kinda seems sketchy that they are selling you shit they don't have and arbitrarily charge for the withdrawal depending on what they say are the minting/gas fees....  So that...

Withdrawal fees... $40cdn, sigh... So the $250 cdn is now really just $210cdn...  but wait it gets better...

Over to Rarible...  (ya I got suckered in by the BS reviews and outright lies...Finding the very very small print buried helms deep in the site only when it was too late)

So I create a 'membership' on Rarible, jumped through all their f'ing hoops, setup the account 2 or three times (cause their site is Shite....uploads don't f'n work, graphics don't show properly, or don't upload at all... they're not paying their webmaster enough...)

So, onto creating my first shiny new NFT... upload the pic, go though all the steps of describing it, adding categories and what not, and guess what, it fails, not once, but f'ing twice...  third time's a charm I guess....  (I'm just too stupid to connect - shitty site - shitty site owners...  DOH!)

So metamask wallet in hand and here we go... Create the NFT... and guess what... GAS fees...Another $60cdn pesos dummy...and then other handling 'fees'  so up to now it's $115cdn to create a single f'ing NFT..  oh well, its an education.. press on...

So now I go to the Rarible page from another browser, and look for my freshly minted piece of art for sale.. and hot damn, it's not there....I'm not there, anywhere...  search by exact name, no go, search by key words or description, and no go.. just not there... so I figured that there is a delay.. so come back  tomorrow...

Well, a couple of days later I search for my new NFT and WFT no where to be found...  signed into Rarible and there it is, but not listed..  so I start researching on Reddit and other places (cause its not f'ing talked about on the actual site (twats) and GUESS WHAT....these shitsticks are gonna 'decide' if they will show your art for sale or NOT.. jump through more hoops, and now a week later, still no listing.... WTF.

So I've paid over $100cdn to get a NFT and the shitsticks aren't even listing it for sale, or even searchable for that matter... because I ... 'don't fit in their Club' 

I paid their overpriced fees and gas, and then I find out that the 'community' has to decide whether or NOT  to allow my membership to even be shown on Rarible... (cannot search for it, not in any listing) The only way that I can share it with others is with the exact address of my listing...  WTF...  

So, more reading...and even more f'n reading... geez this is getting to be a real PITA... aar...so then I go to Opensea... and low and behold Opensea can 'see' your rarible items....once you've linked your account and wallet....

And guess what, if I search for the title/artist/description ""anything"" and there it is in all its glory ON OPENSEA, but NOT rarible... wtf Rarible....

So I start reading Opensea...  and now because the shitsticks on Rarible won't sell my piece, over to Opensea...  well I go to put it ""On Sale""   MORE F'N FEES, this time $115 cdn... f me sideways... this shit is f'ed...  $250cdn for ONE f'n NFT... damn.

Then if it gets sold, they want a percentage...  F me...

So now I have a very expensive original art NFT that I cannot sell anywhere cause it's gonna cost me even more f'n money just to post it for sale.... F$%$!!!!!!!!

This whole process has given me a very bad taste for NFT's, exchanges, curators and the whole lot of these F stains... it's either outright lies, deception, omissions, or deeply buried very obscure 'rules' available on the forums and not on the actual sites.... add to it shitty website that barely work....no communications what so ever (they just don't answer)... Just shovel in the money suckers...  

Another 'consumer good' for the suckers.... Digital Tokens of ownership of a Digital token...  

So, for me...  I'll buy the print from the artist, meet them, talk with them, and have something to hang on my wall and F this NFT crap.... 

As for MOST of the NFT's that I've seen on all these sites, really, you want me to pay for a ""token of ownership of a token' that says I own something that some shitstick stole from the web and turned into a NFT..., well, I've seen 5 year olds create better art before naptime in kindergarten.

Don't get me wrong, there are some amazing artists out there making art in the physical and digital worlds, and Maybe NFT's are a way for an digital Artist to ""Own"" his own creations, and if that is so then I feel for them..... 

For you real artists out there considering jumping on the NFT bandwagon....  ETH 2 is coming... so there's that....  but you should NOT believe ANYTHING ANY website says.... they all lie in one way or another cause they want your money...  

Find a wizard, someone you know, someone you trust...someone waaaayyy smarter than me to create and manage and curate your NFT's for you, cause that's the only way that you'll see anything from the effort....  It's like the difference between a handyman (you) and a professional and experienced electrician wiring your house. if you do it the house burns down, if the professional does it, your children are safe... Luck.

PS: anyone want to buy a NAK original NFT (1 of 10)?

CryptoCurrency,Anyone else considering or already moving more of their market positions and fiat to high interest crypto holdings?,"Seems like there are so many high interest paying exchanges and high staking rewards that moving more fiat into these makes a lot of sense for a long hold.  Also the stock market is a hot mess recently and seems at least as up and down as crypto.l the last month or so. Not saying crypto hasn’t been without wild swings as well. Has anyone else been going through this transition or thinking about just parking money on exchanges/wallets?  

Even fiat parity coins like USDC can earn 8%+. Seems silly to park capital in the bank for 0.6%.  

However let’s talk about custody. Is 2FA good enough for managing withdrawals?  I am not convinced.  Staking in wallets with security seems pretty good but seems to generally have lower rates for increased security.  I get that the interest rates may come with risk, but to some degree how much security is “enough” security?  I am sure there will be a lot of “not your keys not your coin” comments... but hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people are already doing this so how much risk is worth the high returns?

I recently purchased a new couch from a furniture store using a synchrony CC. I selected the promotional option of 36 month financing at 9.99% APR. This was just to obtain a low monthly minimum payment for the time being until some other debts are paid off and I can finish this bill up. The plan was to pay it off in about 14 months or so.

It’s only been 3 months since I purchased it. I was charged interest on the first month afterward that was not 9.99% of the purchase price, the second month that interest rate went up by about $1.60 in price.

From what I gathered. The interest should be the same every month correct? Could someone help explain this to me a bit more? I will be calling them on Monday to go over things but would like to understand this a bit better before then.",finance

investing,Fed Lets Break for Banks Expire but Opens Door to Future Changes,"The Federal Reserve said on Friday that it would not extend a temporary exemption of a rule that dictates the amount of capital banks must keep in reserve, a loss for big banks and their lobbyists, who had been pushing to extend the relief beyond its March 31 expiration.

At the same time, the Fed opened the door to future tweaks to the regulation if changes are deemed necessary to keeping essential markets functioning smoothly. Banks are required to keep easy-to-access money on hand based on the size of their assets, a requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio, the design of which they have long opposed.

The Fed introduced the regulatory change last year. It has allowed banks to exclude both their holdings of Treasury securities and their reserves — which are deposits at the Fed — when calculating the leverage ratio.

The goal of the change was to make it easier for the financial institutions to absorb government bonds and reserves and still continue lending. Otherwise, banks might have stopped such activities to avoid increasing their assets and hitting the leverage cap, which would mean having to raise capital — a move that would be costly for them. But it also lowered bank capital requirements, which drew criticism.
As a result, the debate over whether to extend the exemptions was a heated one.

Bank lobbyists and some market analysts argued that the Fed needed to keep the exemption in place to prevent banks from pulling back from lending and their critical role as both buyers and sellers of government bonds. But lawmakers and researchers who favor stricter bank oversight argued that the exemption would chip away at the protective cash buffer that banks had built up in the wake of the financial crisis, leaving them less prepared to handle shocks.

The Fed took a middle road: It ended the exemption but opened the door to future changes to how the leverage ratio is calibrated. The goal is to keep capital levels stable, but also to make sure that growth in government securities and reserves on bank balance sheets — a natural side effect of government spending and the Fed’s own policies — does not prod banks to pull back.

“Because of recent growth in the supply of central bank reserves and the issuance of Treasury securities, the Board may need to address the current design and calibration of the S.L.R. over time,” the Fed said in its release. It added that the goal would be “to prevent strains from developing that could both constrain economic growth and undermine financial stability.”

The Fed said it would “shortly seek comment” on measures to adjust the leverage ratio and would make sure that any changes “do not erode” bank capital requirements.

“The devil’s going to be in the details,” said Jeremy Kress, a former Fed regulator who teaches at the University of Michigan. “I want to make sure any changes the Fed makes to the supplementary leverage ratio doesn’t undermine the overall strength of bank capital requirements.”

The temporary exemption had cut banks’ required capital by an estimated $76 billion at the holding company level, although in practice other regulatory requirements lessened that impact. Critics had warned that lowering bank capital requirements could leave the financial system more vulnerable.

That is why the Fed was adamant in April, when it introduced the exemption, that the change would not be permanent.

“We gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily — it’s temporary relief — by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the leverage ratio,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a July 2020 news conference. He noted that “many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief.”

Other banking regulators, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, took longer to sign on to the Fed’s exemption, but eventually did.

Even though the exemption had been a tough sell in the first place, persistent worries over Treasury market functioning had raised the possibility that the Fed might keep it in place.

The government has been issuing huge amounts of debt to fund pandemic relief packages, pumping Treasury bonds into the market. At the same time, reserves are exploding as the Fed buys bonds and the Treasury Department spends down a cash pile it amassed last year. The combination risks filling up bank balance sheets. The fear is that banks will pull back as a result.

That’s because the supplementary leverage ratio measures a bank’s capital — the money it can most easily tap to make through times of trouble — against what regulators call its “leverage exposure.” That measure counts both its on-balance sheet assets, like Treasurys, and exposures that do not appear on a bank’s balance sheet but may generate income.
If banks fail to keep capital on hand that matches with their assets, they are restricted from making payouts to shareholders and handing executives optional bonuses.

Banks desperately want to avoid crossing that line. So if there is any danger that they might breach it, they stop taking on assets to make sure that they stay within their boundaries — which can mean that they stop making loans or taking deposits, which count on their balance sheets as “assets.”

Alternatively, banks can pay out less capital to make sure their ratio stays in line. That means smaller dividends or fewer share buybacks, both of which bolster bank stock prices and, in the process, pay for their executives.

The Financial Services Forum, which represents the chief executives of the largest banks, has argued that the temporary exemption should be rolled off more slowly and not end abruptly on March 31. Representatives from the group have been lobbying lawmakers on the issue over the past year, based on federal disclosures. And the trade group — along with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association — sent a letter to Fed officials asking for the exemptions to be extended.

“Allowing the temporary modification to leverage requirements to expire all at once is problematic and risks undermining the goals that the temporary modification are intended to achieve,” Sean Campbell, head of policy research at the forum, wrote in a post this year.

Some banks have themselves pushed for officials to extend the exemption.

“This adjustment for cash and Treasury should either be made permanent or, at a minimum, be extended,” Jennifer A. Piepszak, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said on the bank’s fourth-quarter earnings call.

Ms. Piepszak added that if the exemption for reserves was not extended, the supplementary leverage ratio would become binding and “impact the pace of capital return.” She has separately warned that the bank might have to turn away deposits.
Prominent Democrats have had little patience for such arguments.

“To the extent there are concerns about banks’ ability to accept customer deposits and absorb reserves due to leverage requirements, regulators should suspend bank capital distributions,” Senators Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown, both powerful Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to Fed leadership.

Banks and their lobbying groups had little to say about the Fed’s move to kill the exemption. The eight largest banks have enough capital to cover their leverage ratios.

“A few weeks ago, it seemed like the consensus was that they would do an extension,” said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha. He added that the Fed’s thinking might have been: “The banks were in solid enough shape to absorb this,  they were going to have to end this some time, and this seemed like a good time to do it.”

12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh. 
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)

19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam!

20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?

28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

personalfinance,Need help figuring out how to manage debt that will eventually be $600 more than I make in a month,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

So I am 28 and should be on the cusp of having my financial life together, but an extended period of manic instability in the mental health department as well as getting involved in a lifestyle I could not support and should not have been living has brought me here to beg some sage advice. Based on my rather crude quick excel math I’m about 24 months or 2 years from complete financial ruin. That is a decent amount of time but I just don’t know what to do to get the course moving in the right direction so that in 24 months I’m not basically giving up and having to declare chapter 7 or 13. I can go into the bad choices if that’s something that is deemed relevant, but I’ll break down the money part below. In short I should’ve been seeing a mental health professional during college and grad school but instead chose to spend all my money (including loan excess paid to me) on certain types of relationships that were fun for the moment but have left me in a worse spot socially, mentally, and financially in the end. I am now seeing a mental health professional and am in a more centered mental place, which is when I realized I had really messed up and needed to figure out how to get things on track. Currently I’m using my HSA to pay for the mental health stuff which at the rate I’m seeing someone I should never have to pay out of pocket for.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I made a lot of dumb choices because mental health wasn’t a priority and should’ve been.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition I am looking into a second job/overnight job but it’s difficult as I have to travel across the state for my main job periodically which involves overnight stays.

&amp;#x200B;

Credit score as of last night: 680

&amp;#x200B;

Current Assets/Money Monthly bring home: \~$2,300 (this is all i have coming in)

&amp;#x200B;

Total amount of savings available currently: $12,000 (I have $26,000 in retirement that i currently have $11,000 out in loans on)

&amp;#x200B;

I have about $700 invested in some stocks right

&amp;#x200B;

Current Monthly Expenses/liabilities/the bad stuff

&amp;#x200B;

Contribution to apartment expenses: $700 (This cannot be reduced or changed in any way)

&amp;#x200B;

Quality of life spending (hulu/disney+/netflix, etc): $70

&amp;#x200B;

Current credit card minimum payment: $225 (\~$8,200 balance)

&amp;#x200B;

Car loan: $440 ( $28,000 remaining. current value based on google: \~$20,000)

&amp;#x200B;

Car Insurance:$98

&amp;#x200B;

Personal loan 1 ( 21.65%- 58 payment remaining-$21,450 total remaining ): $598

&amp;#x200B;

Personal Loan 2 (14.99%- 57 months remaining-$19,400  total remaining ): $479

&amp;#x200B;

Total: $2,608/month

&amp;#x200B;

Upcoming expense: Student loan: I’m estimating about $200 a month (slated for June repayment but working to get it pushed back to september with the federal hold for covid)

&amp;#x200B;

Including this I’m at $2,808 a month with no budgeted amount for food or gas. Probably around $2,900- $3,000 with those.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a credit card I could do a cash advance on for $6,000 but that just seems like a bandaid that won’t even begin to bridge the gap. I have no real assets other than the car which is currently worth less than the loan on it.

&amp;#x200B;

In short I would appreciate all advice and help as I legitimately don’t have any idea what to do if I can manage to find a second job. I guess my plan as of now (if i can't find a decent second job) would be to either take out another consolidation loan in about 22 months to combine the current 2 or throw in the hat with a chapter 13 preferably or 7 if I must.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!

Forex,"If I close a position then re-open it, do I get charged two days' worth of interest or one?","My understanding is that if I have a position open, I get charged a minimum of one days' margin interest, even if I don't hold the position for the entire day --- 1/360th of the annual rate.

So, if I hold a position worth $10,000  at a 3.60% interest rate for 1 minute, I must pay .01% of $10,000, or $1.

But suppose after I close that $10,000 position, two minutes later I reopen another $10,000 position which I then close 4 minutes later.

Do I get charged $1 because I borrowed a maximum of $10,000 that day, or do I get charged $2 because I took out two $10,000 positions for a grand total of 5 minutes?

Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Start contributing to SIMPLE IRA 6 months before leaving a job?,"I am leaving my current job in 6 months to work for a different company. My current employer offers SIMPLE IRA and a match of up to 3%, but I never contributed to it.

I am now in a position to invest 15% of my income (86K per year) on a monthly basis. The issue is, I've been researching brokerages and I am most comfortable with vanguard, but my employer uses fedelity. 

Should I just open a vanguard account, invest in Total Stock Market Index until I get the new job and start putting money in whatever employee plan they'll have until max then go back to invest in the taxable vanguard account or is it still worth it to get the 6 months worth of match with my current employer?

personalfinance,"Transmission failed and now I'm screwed, what do I do?","SO, It's been a hell of a week to have my car I just put $500 of the stimmy money into suddenly have the transmission fail. I'm now out of a vehicle and need advice before I make a dumb financial decision.   
About me:  
I'm 22 next month  
My Credit Score is about 580 (I know, things are bad)  
My Car that I still owe $4000 on just had its transmission fail. It would cost about $3k to fix, so don't know what to do. I make payments of $165 every 2 weeks, and I never missed a payment. I was on my own when I was 17, and needed a car so when I turned 18 in the summer of 2017 I saved up a bit of money for a car, about $2k with a $800 trade in junker I got for free. I was 18 with no credit history and no cosigner so I was really hard pressed to find a place that would sell me something, I ended up buying a 2011 Chevy for $13k, at a 25% interest rate, starting at about $360 in payments monthly. Financially, I've been paycheck to paycheck for years, and have had to sink a lot of money into this car even for repairs, so I have very little in savings. This car just quit out unexpectedly and I still owe $4k on it.   
The best plan I can think of with my current situation is to just double down on being fucked for a while and consolidate my debt with a loan. My finances are as follows:  
I make $15 an hour, and pay \~22% in taxes.   
I make on average $1872 a month.   
 I currently pay:  
 $336 a month on the car, plus $105 in insurance  
$630 in rent (Split a 2 bedroom)  
$190 ($95 per paycheck) towards a loan I had to take out to fix my car last winter, total amount of $1293 left at also a high interest rate.   
$120 on my phone bill  
$70 electricity  
\~$100 towards my Credit Cards (Discover at $1000/1500. Capital One at $492/500)  
All together as costs, that's about $1550/1872 that I have to spend. I spend the other \~$300 on the oddities, like gas, food, and tiny luxuries like streaming services (Spotify Youtube etc.)   
Right now I'm at a loss for ideas. The best thing I can think of is to take out a $6-8k loan for debt consolidations and try and lump some of those payments together and go carless for the summer. I've seen offers online I've searched up go along the lines of $6,500 loan at a 24.49% APR, that would be $187/mo for 5 years. It'd end up being a $6,500 loan with $4793 in interest and fees, assuming I pay it off as slow as possible (not the plan).   
I would take the $6,500 and put it towards the rest of my car loan, $4k, completely ending that payment and would go without a car for a while. That right there would take away about $500 in costs per month in my car payment and insurance, which after 8 months assuming I could actually save as much as I'm hoping to, thats $4k saved. I would take the additional $2500 from the loan and apply $1230 of it to pay off the first emergency loan I took, as well as paying off both credit cards. Those costs together would be $300 saved per month by just having those bills taken care of. At $187 a month, consolidating everything would save me around $550 a month.   
My plan after that would be to spend the spring and summer commuting to work by bike instead. I don't actually live too far from work, and with the pandemic, I don't go anywhere but work anyways, so all I'm really losing is the convenience. I have a roommate who works with me who can drive me when I need to on bad weather so I figure by spending the next few months without a car and living very very frugally, I can save up money to get something in the fall/winter. I also figure that paying off my credit cards and loans would improve my credit, although I know opening a new loan would impact it, I feel like consolidating is a good idea here because I'm sol otherwise. I don't see the point in continuing to pay $360 a month for a car that doesn't run, and I don't know how I could ever save up if I kept on doing it. Any advice would be helpful, I don't know if this would ruin my life but right now it seems like a lifejacket to a man whos arms are tired.",finance

CryptoMarkets,"Rocket Pool [RPL] about to launch, making Eth 2.0 staking a breeze","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pt4z9le3j5o61.jpg?width=790&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caeb4962fc0df25c68a49c361f89c34173085390

Interested in catching the next big legit Project before lift off? Give this post a read. I will lay down my own research and opinion on why Rocket Pool is about to pull off a similiar ascent as uniswap.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.rocketpool.net/](https://www.rocketpool.net/)

[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rocket-pool/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rocket-pool/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do we need Rocket Pool?**

* Staking your Ethereum on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain is still painstakingly annoying.
* you require a minimum of 32 Eth to stake at all (close to $60,000 as of writing). You are not stuffed with Ether? too bad...
* your 32 Eth deposit will be locked up until transition to Eth 2.0 is completed. You want to be able to sell them in a few months time? too bad, will have to wait till Eth 2.0 transition is complete...
* Rewards currently hover arround 7% APY. you want to earn more? not happening unless the amount of nodes drops.
* got more than 32 Eth but less than 64? you will only be able to stake 32...
* your exchange offers to stake your Eth for you? great idea, locking funds up for 1 year+ on an exchange never did no harm!

&amp;#x200B;

**So how does it work?**

In short, The Rocket Pool Ecosystem will allow you through allready fully functioning, beta tested and audited smart contracts to stake without the need to run a node by combining smaller stakes and assigning them to node operators in the Ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

**What are the benefits?**

* everyone can stake as little as 0.01 Eth
* People who want to run a node can do so by staking as little as 16 of their own Eth, while the rest gets filled with smaller stakes from others. Node operators will have a small participation in the staking rewards of the filled up stake earning them a higher yield than running conventional validator nodes.
* By staking your Eth via Rocket Pool you will recieve rEth during the staking period in equal amount to your stake. rEth is redeemable for an equal amount of normal Eth + the accumulated staking rewards and can be traded while staking, removing the downside of your funds beeing locked.
* The Ecosystem Token ""RPL"" can be staked alongside your ETH, increasing the incentive of node operators to not act maliciously even further by increasing their stake and in parallel generating additional staking rewards making rocket pool staking even more profitable.
* Staking via Rocket Pool does not compromise on decentralisation in any form like we see with Exchange staking or cloud staking services running node farms that can result in major slashing if multiple nodes go offline at once.

&amp;#x200B;

Rocket Pool is not an ambitious dream. This Project is as legit as it gets and has been in developement since early 2017, going from a proof of concept over multiple alphas, betas and audits to a upcoming launch on mainnet late Q1/early Q2 2021. Accordingly the RPL Token has allready started its first moves upwards while still sitting at just arround 150 million market cap.

bonds,Do you accept buying bloody bonds?,"Do you think that a credit institution should guarantee that the money invested by its clients is not used to finance terrorism or dictatorial regimes? In 2021, there are already enough high-yield instruments for an investor to choose whether his interest will be smeared with blood or not.

Why am I doing this? Now many large banks and funds continue to buy government bonds of countries where governments violate human rights, torture and murder of civilians are practiced.

Of course, money does not smell, but they work quite noisily. Here, for example, is how interest rates on bonds sound in Belarus, the center of Europe.

I urge you to think three times whether you are investing in a bloody business or whether your bank is buying the bonds of countries with a dictatorial regime, such as Belarus, Russia, Venezuela or Myanmar.

However, the website states it is fixed rate and will be re-adjusted as early as May of this year in concordance with CPI-U. Since we know inflation on goods/services is occurring, I assume that means if I wait until May that the fixed rate of an I-Bond will be worth more than 1%?

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 22nd, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a source of market volatility as Powell and others speak in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/fed-could-be-source-of-volatility-as-powell-speaks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve could remain a source of angst for markets in the week ahead, with chairman Jerome Powell scheduled to testify twice before Congress and more than a dozen other Fed speeches expected.
*****
&gt; The bond market’s reaction to the central bank this past week was unusually volatile.
*****
&gt; Though the market was initially steady after the two-day Fed meeting and Powell’s briefing Wednesday, Thursday came with a big selloff in bonds and spiking rates. Traders reacted to the fact that the central bank is willing to let inflation and the economy run hot while the job market recovers.
*****
&gt; In the approaching week, bond market professionals will be watching Powell and other member of the Fed for further cues.
*****
&gt; “This is bonds’ — I wouldn’t call it day in the sun — it’s more like day in the tornado,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. “Clearly the bond market is the one the equity market is watching right now, and normally that’s not the case.”
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower on the week, with the Dow off about 0.5% and the S&amp;P 500, down 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.8% for the week.
*****
&gt; The Russell 2000, however, was hit the hardest, losing close to 3% for the week.
*****
&gt; Yields ratcheted higher as the market sold off. Bond yields move inversely to price.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts mortgages and other loans, rose as high as 1.75% Thursday, a move of more than 10 basis points in less than a day. It was at 1.72% Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; “The bond move has been huge, and it’s starting to scare people,” said Schumacher.
*****
&gt; “There’s been this question hanging out there for awhile: How much of an increase in yield can some of the higher octane stocks take?” he asked. “There’s no magic number, but as we speak, the 10-year is up 80 basis points this year. It’s incredible.”
*****
&gt; # Powell speaks
*****
&gt; Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday before Congressional committees along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Covid relief efforts and the economy.
*****
&gt; He also speaks on central bank innovation at a Bank for International Settlements event Monday morning.
*****
&gt; Other central bank speakers this week include Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and New York Fed President John Williams.
*****
&gt; # Inflation and the Fed
&gt; There is also some key data.
*****
&gt; Important releases include the personal consumption and expenditure data on Friday, which includes the PCE deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Core PCE inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.5% in January.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve this past week took no action at its two-day meeting, but it did present new economic projections including a forecast of 6.5% for gross domestic product this year. The central bank’s forecast now shows PCE inflation going to 2.4% this year, but falling to 2% next year.
*****
&gt; The majority of Fed officials did not see any interest rate hikes through 2023.
*****
&gt; Powell reiterated that the Fed sees just a temporary pickup in inflation this year because of the base effects against last year’s numbers when prices fell.
*****
&gt; The central bank will target an average range of inflation around 2%, so that number could exceed that threshold for some time. It’s a change to the Fed’s ground rules, which makes the bond market nervous.
*****
&gt; Normally, the Fed would hike interest rates if inflation flared up to avoid an overheating economy and avert a bust cycle.
*****
&gt; “For the bond market, and the Fed, there is a communications problem and there’s a consensus problem. There can’t not be tension,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
&gt; “They will be trying to clarify the Fed’s message, but without a consensus on what those numbers and guardrails mean, it will be hard,” she said. “They will be explaining themselves as economists, and they’ll be speaking a different language than the bond market speaks.”
*****
&gt; Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, expects the bond market could be more volatile than stocks, and inflation would be problematic for both.
*****
&gt; At some point, he expects there could be a 10% stock market correction, and inflation or a sharp move in bond yields could be a trigger.
*****
&gt; “The market is trying to make sense of what could be perceived as a disconnect, between their economic projections and the Fed’s dual mandate of unemployment and inflation,” said Grohowski.
*****
&gt; “Yet, they’re committed to keep short rates on hold until the end of 2023,” he said. “That’s what the market is struggling with. I think it’s unsettling to me to hear words like ‘overshoot.’”
*****
&gt; Grohowski expects what he calls the ‘great rotation’ from tech and growth stocks into cyclicals and value to continue. Growth and tech have been most sensitive to rising rates, and the Nasdaq has corrected more than 10%.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re in the sixth or seventh inning of a nine-inning game. It’s not over, but I think we’ve seen the lion’s share of the great rotation out of growth, into value,” said Grohowski. He said that view depends on the 10-year not rising much above 1.75%.
*****
&gt; Grohowski is concerned by the Fed’s willingness to let inflation overshoot because inflation is a negative for stocks.
*****
&gt; Supply chain issues are a concern. He pointed to Nike’s comments Thursday that its sales were hurt by port congestion, and also the shortage of semiconductors, which is impacting automobile production.
*****
&gt; “Inflation expectations are troublesome for P/E [price-earnings] ratios,” Grohowski said. The [stock] market is trading at 22 times our estimate for this year’s earnings.”
*****
&gt; He said the market is having difficulty reconciling the lack of any forecasted interest rate hikes versus the strength of the Fed’s economic forecast.
*****
&gt; “If you ask me what I lose sleep over? ...It’s too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing is being too accommodative,” Grohowski said.
*****
&gt; # Bond market direction
&gt; Schumacher said there’s a chance the bond market could steady in the next couple of weeks, even if yields tick up.
*****
&gt; He said corporate pension funds appear likely to reallocate capital into bonds before the end of the quarter March 31, and that could be supportive. Also as the Japanese fiscal year is set to begin, there could also be new buying in U.S. Treasurys because on a currency adjusted basis U.S. debt looks very cheap, Schumacher said.
*****
He is also watching Treasury auctions in the coming week.
*****
The Treasury auctions $60 billion 2-year notes Tuesday; $61 billion 5-year notes Wednesday, and $62 billion 7-year notes Thursday.
*****
In particular, Schumacher is watching the 7-year auction, which drew poor demand last month.

&gt; # The Bull Market Is About To Turn One
*****
&gt; “The stock market is a giant distraction to the business of investing.” Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard
*****
&gt; First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Saint Patrick’s Day! We’ve had a lot of green out there over the past year and here’s to some more today and over the rest of 2021.
*****
&gt; One year ago yesterday was one of the worst days in the history of the stock market, with the Dow losing 12.9%, the fourth worst day ever. In fact, only the ’29 crash, the ’87 crash, and the day after trading starting (after being halted for multiple months) in the midst of World War I in December 1915 were worse.
*****
&gt; As the great Jack Bogle explained above, sometimes stock market volatility distracts us from our long-term goals. Many investors panicked and sold this time a year ago, only to see stocks soar higher, while bonds struggled and cash didn’t do anything. One of the most important takeaways from 2020 for long-term investors: it is important to have a plan in place before the skies turn dark.
*****
&gt; As this current bull market nears the one-year anniversary of the March 23, 2020 lows, there will be a lot of reflection on how far we’ve come and where we could be going. The bottom line is the economy is recovering at a record pace, stocks are at all-time highs, and we’ll have the NCAA Tournament this year. Those are three things to be very grateful for.
*****
&gt; So what happens now is the logical question? “The good news is previous bull markets have never been lower during the second year of their existence,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although it won’t be an easy ride, investors need to remember that history is on the bulls’ side, as this bull market is still just an infant and continued gains are quite likely.”
*****
&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the previous six bull markets since World War II all saw gains during their second year. The average bull market was up 43% one year in and up to 61% two years off the lows. It is worth noting that the current bull market is up close to 75%, making it the strongest start to a new bull market ever, besting the start to the 2009 bull market. But be aware, that bull was up 68% one year off the lows, but up 94% two years off the lows. In other words, strong gains continued (the green line below).

&gt; # Solid Global Growth Outlook but Multi-Speed
*****
&gt; Last week we reviewed updated global economic growth forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), highlighting the significant increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the United States this year. Clearly the Federal Reserve (Fed) 2021 is reading from the same playbook because they did the same thing yesterday.
*****
&gt; Here we look into another set of OECD data points but this time its global leading indicators. As we have noted with the US version from the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, we believe these indicators can provide useful insight into where economies may be headed in the near term.
*****
&gt; As you can see in our LPL Chart of the Day, leading indicators in Asia and the United States are pointing to better growth than in Europe. The global growth outlook is no doubt improving, but the recovery is multi-speed.
*****
&gt; “Global growth should continue to steadily rise as economies reopen and vaccines are deployed, consistent with the message from global leading indicators” according to LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “When we peel back the onion, we see a stronger picture in the United States and Asia, while Europe is more of a mixed bag. That reflects frustratingly slow vaccine distribution in the Eurozone.”
*****
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**
*****
&gt; “The level of these indicators provide a valuable comparison across countries and regions. We also like to look at the momentum of these indicators to identify areas where the picture is getting better. On the chart below, you can see that the strongest momentum is found in Asia, particularly India and China, and the United States. Meanwhile, Japan is holding its own.
*****
&gt; On the flip side, the growth outlook in most European economies has stalled, particularly in the United Kingdom. While the paused rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine is part of the problem across Europe, we expect a strong vaccine program in the UK to help turn its economy around soon despite the country’s below-average LEI level and deteriorating momentum.
*****
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**
*****
&gt; We continue to recommend investors focus their regional allocations on the United States and the Asia-heavy emerging markets. Global LEI data and the pace of vaccine distribution reinforce that positioning, as the global but multi-speed economic recovery from the pandemic continues.
*****
&gt; More risk tolerant investors may want to consider a tactical allocation to Japan, where appropriate, given the country’s relative success containing COVID-19 and bold stimulus efforts.

*****

&gt; # Leading Indicators Remain Stubbornly Tepid
*****
&gt; In almost every direction we turn, we see optimism mounting over a mid-2021 economic reacceleration. Unfortunately, it seems we will have to wait at least another month for that optimism to make their way into leading economic indicators in a major way.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, March 18, the Conference Board released its February 2021 report detailing the latest reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special ettention to the LEI, as it has a forward looking tilt to it. The index grew for the tenth month in a row, up 0.2% month over month in February, a decrease from January’s 0.5% pace.
*****
&gt; While this print still suggests future economic growth ahead, it fell short of expectations that had begun to price in an economic reacceleration on the back of improving vaccination trends. The Conference Board did make special note that factors which may prove to be transient, such as bad weather and related supply chain disruptions, did affect several component indexes. Moreover, it stated that the recently passed $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, a similarly large economic growth factor to vaccine progress, was likely not yet fully priced into the LEI’s value.
*****
&gt; Six of the ten components grew in February, while three declined and one remained flat. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread led the way among positive contributors. Building permits, average weekly manufacturing hours, and average consumer expectations for business conditions detracted from the composite’s growth, while manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft held steady.
*****
&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, despite some small head fakes, the monthly change in the index has generally sloped downward since its initial bounce off of the 2020 lows. This signals the index has been increasing at a decreasing rate, as COVID-19 mitigation measures have prevented a full-fledged resurgence. We expect this trendline to turn meaningfully upward once a durable reopening begins to gain traction.
*****
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-picture-3.19.21.png?ssl=1))**
*****
&gt; “In recent months, financial markets have been agressively pricing in a strong second leg to this economic recovery,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We are still waiting for much of the economic data to confirm the move, but believe it should not be far off given the extremely promising vaccination trends and large fiscal package that was just recently passed. We think it is a matter of when there is a surge in US GDP growth, and not if there will be a surge.”
*****
&gt; We continue to believe that vaccinations are the key to a sustained recovery and distribution trends have been truly remarkable recently. The most at-risk segment of the population is largely vaccinated already and at this point, more people in the United States have been vaccinated than have contracted the virus. We now have three vaccines approved for emergency use authorization, and President Biden projects that we will have enough vaccine supply for every adult American by late spring. Furthermore, we have increased confirmation that vaccines appear to be effective at preventing transmission as well as symptoms. While growth of variant strains does present a risk, we believe the overwhelming majority of evidence points toward a promising second leg of this economic recovery, which we believe justifies a tilt toward cyclical opportunities over defensive investments in portfolios.

This may get into sticky aspects of legal tender law, etc. But seriously, is there any verbiage addressing the blobby, sometimes indistinct historic nature of the ""US Dollar""? Is the Treasury only and ever (at least involving modern issuances) required to settle matured securities in Federal Reserve Notes? **In the event (regardless of its likelihood) the Federal Reserve Note became obsolete or abolished... exactly what would the US Treasury be obligated to pay out to note bearers demanding their settlement?**

I'll talk about _blockchains_ since it's the most popular distributed ledger.

What these techniques to accomplish is:

* Data distributed on a peer-to-peer network across multiple sites and entities.
* The nodes are synchronized and agree on a shared state of the data using a consensus mechanism.
* The consensus must be byzantine fault tolerant, i.e. a few unidentified bad actors cannot convince other nodes that their state is correct.

&gt; Please leave a comment if there is a mistake.
&gt; I don't know much about blockchain, cryptography, or economy.

I hope it is useful, at least it helped me to settle down things.

## Bitcoin – First generation (PoW)

The original proof-of-concept of _a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System_ using a **blockchain**
with **proof-of-work** consensus.
**Launched in 2009**.

In [Proof of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work):

1. All nodes compete to _mine_ the next block.
2. When a block is found, the new block it is communicated to the rest of the network.
   All other 10,000 nodes are easily convinced it is the next block, and they discard their attempts to find the block.
3. The miner is rewarded with the _creation of new tokens_, as well as the _transaction fees_ that senders were willing to pay.
4. Iterate.


### Pro Bitcoin

* Very well know.
  For many people, cryptocurrency is Bitcoin.
  There are [300,000 transactions per day](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/btc/charts).
* Proven by time.
  It's the first cryptocurrency, described in 2008.
* Some argue that its limited supply makes it _electronic gold_.
  It has an inflation of 1.80% per year which progressively diminish to zero (around 2140).
* An attack would need 50% of the computer power.
  (The four major mining pools have more than 50% of the hash power).

### Con Bitcoin

* Block time: 10 minutes.
  The protocol adjusts the mining difficulty so that blocks are created every 10 minutes on average.
  Most actors consider a block is final after it has been followed by 2 subsequent blocks.
  Hence, block validation is extremely slow by design.
* Limited throughput. For the same reason, Bitcoin is limited to 4 Transactions per seconds.
* Extreme energy consumption with proof of work consensus.
  One transaction one bitcoin [consumes 100,000](https://www.statista.com/statistics/881541/bitcoin-energy-consumption-transaction-comparison-visa/) more energy than a transaction on the VISA payment system.
* No features, except token transfer. No smart contracts.
* The protocol is slow to evolve.
  The last modification is [BIP-152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki) (which improved network traffic between nodes) in 2016.
* The limited supply makes it inappropriate to use as a currency in a growing economy.
* High price volatility: 0.742 in the last 3 years (vs 0.14 for gold).
  Some argue it makes it inappropriate to store value.

## Ethereum – Second generation (PoW with smart contracts)

The blockchain platform that democratized **Smart Contracts**,
which allow the execution of an immutable code (the contract) to read or record information on the blockchain, in a decentralised manner and with no need to trust intermediators. **Launched in 2015**.


### Pro Ethereum

* Blocks are completed in 13 seconds.
* Smart contracts can run on the Ethereum virtual machine.
* Very rich ecosystem.
  There are 2M smart contracts.
  There are [350,000 different tokens](https://www.coindesk.com/what-is-the-erc-20-ethereum-standard).
  There are 1,700+ [dapps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/), or decentralise application using smart contracts.
  The most popular, [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/), allows to exchange any token against any other and is used by
  [542,000 MAU](https://www.dapp.com/app/uniswap-v2) (monthly active users).
* Very active community of Smart contracts developers.
  Smart-contracts are written in a variant of JavaScript called _Solidity_.
* The [protocol evolves](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc) regularly.
  For instance [EIP-3156](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156#implementation) added Flash Loans to the protocol in November 2020.
* The community welcomes layer-2 solutions such as [Polygon](https://polygon.technology) to improve scalability, throughput and reduce costs.
* The core protocol will evolve to [ETH 2](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/) by end of 2021, and will use [proof-of-stake consensus](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp).
* The inflation is 1.58% per year.

### Con Ethereum

* Extreme energy consumption with _proof of work_ consensus.
* Right now, the network is saturated.
  The transaction fees have increased and around $20.
  The execution of a contract can cost [several hundreds dollars](https://crypto.com/defi/dashboard/gas-fees).
* Solidity has been the source of vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## EOS – Third generation (DPoS)

**Launched in 2018** after a record $4 billion ICO.

**Delegated Proof of Stake** was invented in 2014 as another consensus mechanism. In [Delegated Proof of Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake#Delegated_Proof-of-Stake):

1. The nodes mine blocks exactly like in proof-of-work.
   However, instead of competing with each other, *21 nodes are elected*.
2. The election is based on the vote of all account holders,
   who are hence _delegating_ to the node of their choice.


### Pro EOS

* Proof-of-stake drastically reduces the waste of compute power (although it is still higher than a centralized system)
* Block time 0.5s
* There are several additional features, such as role-based permissions and the ability to freeze applications (which is useful if a bug is detected).
* There are [400+ dApps](https://www.dapp.com/dapps/eos).
  The main one is [Newdex](https://newdex.io/), a decentralized exchange.
  I like [Everipedia](https://everipedia.org/).
  And [Voice](https://www.voice.com/) has the ambition to be a new social network.
* The EOS Virtual Machine is a [Web Assembly (WASM)](https://webassembly.org/) engine
  that make it possible to debug, quickly compile, and optimize smart contracts,
  with a [large choice of programming languages](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs), such as
  C, Java, JavaScript, .net, Rust, Swift. 
* [Block.one](https://block.one/), the company that implemented EOS, raised $4 billions in the ICO (initial coin offering).
  They still have a large treasury of Bitcoins.
* The inflation is 2.13% per year.

### Con EOS

* Stakeholders' attention cannot span across many nodes.
  Hence DPoS must limited the number of elected nodes, so that the votes can be well informed.
  Some have concerns that 21 super nodes in EOS makes the system not fully decentralized.
  The analogy could be that representative democracy is not really democracy.
* The amount which is staked cannot be spent.
* Rumores that Chinese nodes felt under-represented in the EOS community, and started buying votes.
  Vitalik critized the [Plutocracy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/03/28/plutocracy.html) that DPoS leads to.
* **Dan Larimer**, the inventor of DPoS, started the first implementation on BitShares, then moved to Steem, then moved to EOS, and just [moved to yet another blockchain project](https://github.com/bytemaster/clarion/discussions/2).
* The project seems to have lost momentum.

### Read more about EOS

* [Blocks.io](https://bloks.io/) Shows the block producers in real time.
* [EOS whitepaper](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md) by **Dan Larimer**
* [EOS consensus…](https://developers.eos.io/welcome/latest/protocol/consensus_protocol)
* dPoS is also used by
  [Tron](https://tron.network/),
  [Steem](https://steem.com/),
  [Ark](https://ark.io/),
  Bitshares.
  However, there are small variants in the protocol: Once elected, EOS block producers have equal power ; in other DPoS models, voting power is proportional to the number of votes given by delegators.

## Cosmos – Blockchain of blockchains

With the development of many blockchains, Cosmos aims to be the framework and central blockchain. **Launched in 2019**.

Cosmos uses DPoS.

### Pro

* Block time: 7 seconds
* Seriously reduces the effort needed to create a blockchain.
  The hardest part is creating a community.
* Successful and very [rich ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps).
  Cosmos is used by the [Binance Chain](https://docs.binance.org/guides/intro.html),
  the [crypto.org chain](https://crypto.org/),
  [Kava](https://www.kava.io/),
  [Terra](https://terra.money/),
  [chai finance](https://chai.finance/),
  etc.
* Each of these generated blockchain is sovereign and chooses how many super nodes validate the chain.
* The _Cosmos hub_ is the central blockchain that allows the passing of standardized messages across these other blockchains.
  That's a simple and efficient design.
* Programmed in [go](https://golang.org)
  and uses [protocol buffers](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/core/encoding.html).
  I like the use of Google battle-tested and open-source technologies.
* Instead of smart contracts, the philosophy of Cosmos is to build
  [application-specific blockchains](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/intro/why-app-specific.html).  
* Smart contracts can be added with a [dedicated Wasm module](https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-the-launch-of-cosmwasm-cc426ab88e12).

## Binance Chain

Binance is (one of?) the largest exchange in the world.
They created their own public blockchain, *Binance Chain* using Cosmos, with the [Biance DEX](https://www.binance.org/en/trade/TWT-8C2_BNB) decentralized exchange.


## Binance Smart Chain

However, Binance also wanted a chain with smart contracts, and as mentioned above, Cosmos does not support smart contracts. 
To that effect, they started a second blockchain, *Binance Smart Chain (BSC)*,
forked from Ethereum (the go-ethereum implementation), but where the consensus mechanism as been replaced by [proof-of-stake authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake), borrowing the implementation of Cosmos (Tendermit core).

### Pro BSC

* Block time: 5 seconds.
* Technologically efficient. Fast and cheap transactions, and smart contracts.
* Dynamic ecosystem pushed by Binance.

### Con BSC

* The degree of decentralization is unclear.
  *Please leave a comment if you have data.*

## Tezos - Third+ generation

**Launched in 2018**.

I talked about DPoS because it's easy to understand.
Tezos aims to be a pure (non delegated) proof of stake:

1. Any node in the network can be randomly selected to produce the next block.
   Its chances are higher with a higher stake.
2. Users who don't want to run a node themselves can delegate their stake, and receive most of the mining reward.


### Pro Tezos

* A ""pure"" Proof of stake where any validator node (named **baker**) can be selected.
* **Liquid delegation**. Delegation is just a transfer of voting right, but does freeze the token in the wallet.
* **On-Chain governance**. Stakeholders can vote to modify the protocol.
* **Self-amendment**. The network to be upgraded without hard fork.
* **Formal verification** of smart contracts, using a dedicated machine code.
* Smart contracts can be written in [several programming languages](https://tezos.com/developer-portal)
* A [decent ecosystem](https://tezosprojects.com) including a few USD stablecoins, an exchange, a NFT marketplace, etc.
* Tezos is a candidate blockchain to host the European Central Bank digital euro.
* The core is written in OCaml, a functional programming language that I like.

### Con Tezos

* OCaml is not a popular language, which is a barrier to adoption.
* There was a huge debacle with the money raised from the ICO.
* The inflation is 9.2% per year.
* Not hyped as much as Cardano.

## Cardano – Third+ generation

**Launched in 2017** (and still work in progress on core features).

Let's go back to the top of the market capitaliaztion with Cardano,
founded by **Charles Hokinson** who previously worked on Ethereum and co-founded Bitshares.

Cardano is very similar to Tezos.

Cardano's roadmap has the following [eras](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/):

* Byron. Foundation. Launched in September 2017 .
* Shelley. Decentralisation and staking. Done in July 2020 (Expected to be completed end of Q2 2018).
* Goguen. Smart contracts. Still WIP. **Cardano still doesn't have smart contracts**.
* Basho. Scalability. WIP.
* Voltaire. Gouvernance. WIP.

### Pro Cardano

* **Liquid staking**. A user can delegate its wallet, and still use it normally. 
* The project has a well-thought **cryptoeconomics** designed on the learnings of issues on DPoS.
* The project has strong momentum today.
* Scalability solution named **Hydra** is on the roadmap.
* The inflation is 2.14% per year.
* Charles Hokinson has clear leadership and is very close to the users.
  He has a general vision, not only how the technology is built, but also on the impact of blockchain on societies, such identity and voting.

### Con Cardano

* Block time: 20 seconds (protocol parameter that may be changed).
* The project is very late on its [initial roadmap](https://np.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/7a5tsq/cardano_roadmap/).
* The [core implementation](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node) is in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/intro.html) which is not the most popular programming language.
  I see a strong barrier of adaption for developers.
* Marlowe is a [domain-specific language for writing financial contracts](https://alpha.marlowe.iohkdev.io/tutorial/index.html#actus-marlowe). 
  I don't find it particularly intuitive.
* There are broad and bragging claims such as
  _Cardano is the first platform to evolve out of scientific philosophy based on discovery, peer review, and cryptographic research._
  I didn't take the time to verify the claim, and I'm curious to see how it compares to Ethereum, Cosmos, Algorand or Hedera.
* Charles Hokinson has clear leadership, and it's unclear how the project would evolve if he stops.

## Stellar - Federated consensus

Stellar targets financial transactions.

Their consensus is **Federated Byzantine Agreement**.
In a blockchain, all nodes trust the same longest chain. 
In contrast, in FBA, participants take their decisions based on groups of nodes they trust. 

### Pro Stellar

* It makes sense and reflects how humans take decisions in the real life.
* Block transaction and finality is fast and inexpensive.
  I love it for transaction between exchanges.
* It's very easy to create a token on Stellar. For instance, [USDC](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/USDC-GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN-1?filter=payments) is also offered on Stellar, it's not just an ERC-20 token.
* Stellar has a built-in Exchange, and the native XLM token is used to transparently swap currencies in transfers.
* There is interest from financial institutions.
* FBA requires nodes to reveal their identity.

### Con Stellar

* FBA requires nodes to reveal their identity.
* Both and address and a MEMO are needed to send Stellar to an Central Exchange.
* On paper, having anchors is great. In practice, I couldn't find how to use any with Euro. There are [€31 emitted](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/EURB-GBAE3QPNCXL37BUWHR4HC3SWDQV4FIX3VENFAINBLITB7XWP5LYPV57V-1) with the EURB stablecoin. With all the [buzz](https://www.google.com/search?q=eurb+stablecoin) they received, I think it was an extremely cheap marketing campaign.
* Similarly, [I don't see how a Swiss Franc anchor](https://np.reddit.com/r/Stellar/comments/m5ws60/xlm_as_a_universal_coin/gr3qx4f/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) could be put in place, except by the SNB itself.
* The inflation is 16% per year.

## Nano

Nano has another interesting approach to solve the Byzantine Generals Problem.
Instead of a common blockchain where miners decide what transactions are part of the next block, Nano uses Direct Acyclic Graphs:

* There are super nodes who are responsible for the common ledger.
* Each wallet has its own blockchain.
  When Alice sends money to Bob, she writes a Send block in her blockchain, Bob writes a Receive block in his blockchain.
* Each super node checks that the Send block is valid. When 50% voting power confirms the block, it is added to the common ledger.
* This allows to Receive block to be valid, which in turn is added to the common ledger.
* The development team distributed 95% of tokens and kept only 5% for themselves.

### Pro Nano

* This process is very fast, and takes typically 0.2 seconds.
* It is also very efficient, and transactions are free for the users and there is no financial reward for the nodes.

### Con Nano

* Since transfers are free, there is a risk of a [DoS attack](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/recent-dos-nano-network-attack-and-v21-3-fixes-97b9b7297f9).
* No smart contracts.
* Nano wants to be a peer-to-peer payment system and could technically replace the Credit cards.
  But I think end users want stablecoins, and Nano protocol only supports the NANO native coin.
* The development team is small and the protocol is doesn't protect against all attack vectors.
* The inlfation is 0%. I don't think this can work in real life economy.

## And other interesting approaches

### Monero

There is a paradox that Bitcoin became popular with darkweb markets like _Silk Road_
because everything on the Bitcoin  blockchain is transparent.

Monero protects privacy in several ways:
* [Stealth addresses](https://youtu.be/bWst278J8NA?t=28) which is new one-time public address compatible with an existing secret key. It anonymises the recipient.
* and [Ring signatures](https://youtu.be/zHN_B_H_fCs?t=9) which is a simple technique to anonymise the sender. (The analogy is that when a check is claimed for a bank account the recorded transaction doesn't show if the husband or the wife signed the check).

### Zcash

Zcash also addresses the need for anonymity.
Zcash relies on very modern algorithmic technique **zk-SNARK** proof to record transactions in an anonymous way.
I find this cryptographic algorithm much more fascinating than Ring signatures.


### Mina

Mina also uses uses zk-SNARK, but it a completely novel way.
The proof of the blockchain chain is a zk-SNARK, which means that the proof of the blockchain remains in a 22kB block.

The actual content of the blockchain is saved in an archived, which can be distributed easily and cheaply outside the blockchain.


### IOTA

The IOTA ledger is a DAG and is constructed like a family tree:
Each transaction has its own node which must point to 2 existing parent nodes.
The trust given to a node is the number of direct and indirect descendant – hence the older nodes are more trusted.

Like Nano, this architecture allows scalability and feeless transactions.

As of today, the network is not decentralised, and a Coordinator operated by the foundation protects the network from compute attack.
[Decentralisation is planned](https://coordicide.iota.org/) in Q4 2021.

stocks,"Treasury Bonds, why should we care?","I’m going to start with a very brief overview of Bonds and how they in turn affect stocks. Then I will pose some questions for discussion as I do not fully understand how this will affect the market. 

When you buy Bonds you are buying US Government debt. The Yield is how much interest the Bond pays. Yield is determined by supply and demand of the Bonds. When the Pandemic hit people apparently flocked to Bonds because they are a safe investment and this buying drove down the Bond Yield. The Bond Yield causes other interest rates (mortgages, loans, credit cards) to follow its rise or fall. Since the Yield went down so did interest rates, this caused a boom in the stock market (along with stimulus) because business could borrow money for less. 

Currently, Bonds have been selling off which increases the Yield. This increases interest rates making businesses dependent on cheap lending, like Tech, to fall in price. Bonds are selling off because people are expecting inflation to increase with a hotter economy and it doesn’t make sense to have money tied to low yield bonds when inflation is greater than the Bond Yield. 

So now the stock market is going through a period of volatility because of the Bond sell off and uncertainty about inflation. To ease this uncertainty investors have wanted the Fed to announce Yield Curve Control (YCC). Basically, the Fed buys Bonds to keep the Yield at a desired rate. So far it looks like the Fed isn’t worried about the rates right now and want to see more sustainable economic growth before doing anything with rates. 

Questions for discussion:
Why would the markets react poorly to rising Yield? I get that it’s more expensive to finance debt but won’t the Bond sellers most likely move money into the stock market?

The Fed wants inflation, and inflation fears have driven a Bond sell off. If the Fed gets their inflation target and it doesn’t go out of control than shouldn’t markets calm down? I see no reason the Fed would loose control, they have so many more tools than they ever have before. 

If the market is doomed to be stifled because of all this where is a good place to move money? Obviously all stocks won’t suck and many have already started the rotation into value and emerging markets.",finance

personalfinance,Is rental property worth it?,"My mother (78) lives in another state but also owns a 1/1 condo in my city and lives here a few months out of the year. There's no mortgage, and she says her combined costs of ownership are approx $8K-$10K per year. That's HOA fees, insurance, and property taxes. The condo was bought in 1997 for $75K, and I think it could easily be sold for $250K or more today. We're in Austin, where property taxes are insane and the housing market is too hot for most buyers right now.

She is thinking of giving the condo to me so that I can have rental income. She would then rent an apartment here instead of living in the condo. This is all her idea. Five years ago I would have jumped at the opportunity, but my first reaction was that I think she's off her rocker. 

Honestly, if she gave me the condo I'd want to sell it and invest the cash. I'm 51, single parent, currently unemployed and living frugally off an inheritance since Nov. 2020. I'll go back to work when kiddo is back in a classroom. I have 21 years in a state pension plan to support my retirement when I get there. If I go back to work at the state instead of private sector I'll be able to resume contributions. I opened a Roth last year and have maxed my contributions for 2020 and 2021. My very old federal student loan debt is approx $5K and I'm waiting to see if the feds are going to cancel it. 


I'm not doing terribly but I can definitely use the money that property is worth. I don't think I can get more than $1500 rent for it. It's old construction, a ""charming"" vintage property with age-related issues. But selling it would be a little bit of a heartbreaker for all of us. I know my son has hopes that he'll get to live there in his young adulthood. I lived there through grad school, it was rental income for my mother for several years, and my son and I lived there while his father and I were divorcing. The property is enmeshed in all of our memories. If I told my mother that I'd be inclined to sell it, she quite possibly would change her mind.


I'm going to tell her we both need to think about this for a long time. I'm also going to take her to visit some apartments.  I think she's tripping if she thinks she's going to find a nice $1000 apartment near me. Maybe I'm wrong. 

Impressions or thoughts?",finance
investing,Financial Market Pessimism,"Financial Market Pessimism

I have a pessimistic view on the current investment climate for the reasons below. Please change my mind.

1. US stocks are expensive. This means they are expected to have lower returns going forward. International stocks look like a better value, but their correlation with US equities has been increasing and may not offer the same diversification benefit they once had. Time will tell on this aspect.

2. The US stock market is being propped up by the largest sustained quantitative easing effort ever. If the FED steps off the gas just a little (by raising rates a tiny fraction of a percent) the market will lose its pacifier and become unstable. Look at all the volatility being blamed on increasing bond yields lately. Just imagine if rates are actually raised 25 basis points sometime in the next few years. 

3. The FED is about out of ammunition if another economic disaster hits. If the economy is bad, the FED cuts rates. Rates are at historic lows, and the economy is recovering. If we get hit with another recession and rates haven’t been increased, what is the FED going to do? Take them negative? That would be a disaster for anyone holding cash or people who are in late stage retirement at the time. It penalizes saving and incentivizes spending. That’s not something people like to do during a recession. Better start printing more checks or buying up assets (smh).

4. Bond yields are too low to bother with right now, and it is reasonable to expect them to climb as they have been doing. Who wants to buy bonds with a low yield with the expectation that the yield will increase? No one. Suppose yields fall, you may make some gains with price appreciation, but the yield is still awful! 

5. Housing prices have soared very quickly. Sure rates are good, but the market is getting expensive and rent collection will still be difficult for many people.

6. Digital monetary forms of exchange cannot be reasonably valued and is pure speculation. Maybe they’ll do well, maybe not. And which ones? It’s not a sure fire thing and should be seen as gambling / speculation and not investing.

7. Precious metals seem to do best when the economy is a dumpster fire. Once the recovery begins and things settle down, they start to lose value as money moves back into stocks. They seem best as a hedge against economic surprises, but not a good asset to just buy and hold long term.

8. Oil and natural gas prices can be easily manipulated by governments and should be avoided.

9. High yield savings accounts and money markets yield next to nothing today but it’s still the safest place to park your money. Inflation will eat away at it over time though but it’s less than watching it all evaporate if a risky investment doesn’t pan out well.

In sum, stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, cash, and digital monetary forms of exchange all have glaring issues to me without much positive going for them. Am I wrong? I’m not the most well versed with the world of investing, but from a rudimentary perspective, it doesn’t look good. You take out low interest rates and the stimulus and you’ll see how fragile this market is. 

Despite my concerns, I’m still buying shares in VTWAX every month because that’s my plan, and I’m staying with it.",finance
personalfinance,Recently Married Couple Looking for Feedback on our Budget (in preparation for a move and potential unemployment),"Hi,   
We are a recently married couple in our mid twenties (24 and 27). We are are relatively new to the personal finance world (as in we used to lived paycheck to paycheck, no saving any money, and are now trying to change this and be more responsible). We are tryin to get some of our finances in order and to see where we can improve, change...  I have read many posts here, and have been using a budget template I found in one of the post here. We are hoping to get some feedback on how to tackle our outstanding loans, prepare for a move, and for potential loss of income.  


I will be graduating law school in May so my income should  increase soon. However, our biggest worry  is the fact that I don't know when I will receive my work authorization and therefore when I will be allowed to start working. It's a bit complicated but I am an international student, so I am currently allowed to work on campus through my F-1 visa which I do. However, once I graduate on May 15, and until Immigration Services issues me a work authorization -- which I requested back in November 2020 -- I won't be able to work. It could take as long as a year (but I could very well receive it tomorrow). This means that in the word case scenario I wouldn't be able to work between May and November 2021.   
Because of that, and because we will be moving in August, we want to make sure that we don't fall behind on anything and that our budget is ok..  


Our current income is as follow:

* Him: $2000/month
* Me: $1000/month  


Current bills per month:

* Rent (water included): $640
* School Payement Plan: $425 (last payment is on May 20th) 
* Personal Loan: $420 (Balance: $16,200; Interest Rate: 13%)
* Car Loan: $175 (Balance: $5,500, APR: 5%)
* Electricity: \~$50
* Phones: $100
* Internet: $54
* Car Insurance: $50
* Netflix: $15
* And then we have food, gas, etc.. . We try to put at least $100 in saving but some month are a bit more complicated than others.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a bit over $2000 in saving right now.   
I will add that we should be receiving some money eventually because of a recent family death, though we don't want to rely on it in our financial planning as there is too much uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of this.   


Do you have any recommendation with what we could improve, what we should be doing differently etc?

defi,Anchor protocol - Stablecoin 'fixed' earning on Terra (recent launch),"Just thought I would share some recent info about the launch of Anchor Protocol by Terra labs (LUNA, MIR etc), a really interesting and extremely well backed algorithmic stablecoin ecosystem. 


I will spare the details over Terra itself, to keep it simple, if you don't know - Terra Dollars (UST) are a stablecoin developed by Terraform labs and backed by their crypto asset LUNA. The terra system is being used by 2.5m people in Korea and other asian countries (mainly Korea to date), for e-commerce through apps such as Chai. It recently passed $1.3bn in market cap and is fast becoming one of the bigger stablecoins. 


___


Onto the interesting part (or interesting for the purposes of stablecoin earnings), Terra have very recently launched Anchor Protocol - 

https://anchorprotocol.com/ 


https://app.anchorprotocol.com/gov





Anchor is a lending and borrowing platform based on UST. Currently their is an anc-ust pool, but the two most interesting components for me re:


- Collateralised loans - you can mint LUNA to bLUNA and take out a loan in UST against this - and EARN 300% + for doing so. You can then simply hold that loan in ust in your wallet - so it can be repaid in times of sudden price fluctuations or use it to do things such as: buy more luna, mint it and add to your collateral position and take out more ust &gt; repeat a few times. Or use your ust to enter the anc-ust liquidity pool, then take out anc from your earnings from the loan (ust earnings are paid in anc for this) and sell it to luna - mint it to bluna and add it to compound your liquidity pool earnings. (there are a million other ways to use that money of course)


- stable 20% earnings - on your stablecoin, deposit ust and you will receive 20% stable interest rate, automatically compounding and this rate will not diminish over time. It is currently slightly above at 22% since the protocol just launched and it is trying to stabilise. This is huge.


- bLUNA is the first collateralised asset to be added - however bATOM, bSOL and others are being added.


- Fees on ANC are v.low - 0.5UST per transaction as it is built on cosmos tendermint 

&amp;nbsp;

- **Bonus** if you are a luna holder (and staker) - you will receive anc weekly airdrops and mir airdrops for 2 years and 40 more weeks respectively and your involvement in the ecosystem - creating demand for UST automatically works to shrink the supply of the underlying asset. Essentially by engaging in anchor you are squeezing the supply on your own asset to drive up the price. The airdrops will only continue as a luna holder (from ecosystem growth) - but i don't want to turn this into a post about luna, just wanted to share a little context. 


To those uninitiated in terra this is why LUNA has been one of the very best performing assets since the start of 2021 - it has an incredibly well thought out design, and the demand for UST shot up from MIR, Anchor is yet to even really be accounted for.


Terra has got ahead of the game by creating organic demand outside of crypto for their stablecoin first before then focusing on drawing cryptomarket demand. I seriously recommend looking into this, even if it is just for the stablecoin earnings on anchor (rather than luna itself)

I hope people find this helpful - i am currently farming anchor with my BLUNA and UST borrowings and it has been very fruitful (of course borrowing earnings will go down over time) and will be moving my stablecoin portion of my portfolio over to anchor and slowly adding to it over the coming months as a way to earn money and hedge against crypto volatility and risk as the bull run continues. Thanks guys, first time coming over to the sub today so thought I would try to bring something I have found useful.",cryptocurrency

Below is what I read:

What about when you are shopping for a loan?

When you are shopping for a new loan, such as for a home or a car, your information may be sent to multiple lenders to try to find you the best rates and loan terms. You will see a separate inquiry on your credit report from each of these lenders, but your credit score won't be penalized for each one. Most credit scores will count multiple inquires for mortgage or auto loans as one if they are made within a certain period of time (14-30 days). Some scores do the same for other types of lending.

I have the following options in mind

a. All at once with 50% in general market VOO , 30% in a mix of dividend and value stocks, 20% in corporate bonds

b. Dollar cost averaging in the general mkt VOO over 1 yr i.e. ~8.4% every month. Start with ~92% in bluechip gold/silver mines/corporate bonds which will pay me slightly better than bank savings rate and gradually reallocate to market over the year

c. Allocate all at once equally weighted between sector based etfs

I tried to use portfoliovisualizer but i am not sure results are really valid because of the way tech has completely outperformed the market. 

I look forward to your opinions on the above or any other option that you may have

CryptoMarkets,"Savix, Easy DeFi For Everyone","“Will the Bitcoin bubble burst as it had done last time?”, many people might ask themselves when looking at the incredible gains in value the flagship of cryptocurrencies has realized within the last weeks.  In fact the dynamic growth momentum most digital currencies have been able to create recently reminds of the situation the digital money had seen in 2017/2018. But many details seem to be different this time. It seems to be realistic that Bitcoin can break through the barrier of 100.000 USD value per coin this year. Will 2021 finally be the year when Bitcoin and its family of crypto tokens arrive at the masses? Will we all eventually get our share of this new economy, distributing back to the public the humongous profits the financial industry is making year by year? And how can normal citizens participate practically?

# Why the bulls run differently in 2021

A big problem back in 2018 had been missing working products. The value of digital currencies had mostly been created by a mixture of pure speculation about rising demands and the fear of missing out (FOMO). Although these dynamics still have effect many new use cases have been established since then, not just in theory, but in practice. Whereas in 2017/18 a competition of fantastic ideas had been carried out by competing digital tokens, it is a competition of working products that is dominating the world of digital assets in the current bull-run.

# DeFi: An attempt to democratize banking

The most creative and productive area of these new digital products is called “Decentralized Finance” (DeFi). Under this term use cases of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications are summarized, which aim to allow anyone to participate in financial activity without the involvement of centralized institutions like banks, investment funds, insurance companies or stock exchanges. Already in 2020 the profits realized by investments in centralized finance products have been exceeding those generated by Bitcoin by far. And this trend seems to be stabilizing in 2021.

With decentralized finance products everybody can earn fees for giving out credits to others, providing liquidity to emerging markets or by investing in other innovative finance products. DeFi offers tools to finally fulfill one of the promises cryptocurrencies made, to bank the unbanked and beyond this to democratize the banking system as such. But in fact, it is mostly the young, tech-savvy and often nerdy intellectual part of the population, which is actually willing and capable of profiting from the new financial chances DeFi can offer. Before being able to participate in the game of decentralized finance, one has to collect and evaluate information on products, information that is often rapidly changing and full of technical details. Then decisions have to be made taking into account economic questions as well, such as weighing up profit chances for financial risks involved. Last but not least, the procedures to finally invest money into the new world of DeFi products can be quite complicated, often creating obstacles too high to overcome for many of us.

# Mass-adoption with “Easy DeFi For Everyone”

The Europe-based start-up Savix promises to lower these barriers. “Easy DeFi For Everyone” has been chosen as its mission statement for very good reasons. The Savix token will yield predictable interest rates on investments automatically without any need for technological decisions or complicated procedures. You can simply buy Savix tokens and keep them to receive your returns (Staking). The analogy to a classic savings book is obvious, hence the name Savix reminds of it. Moreover Savix will offer a simple and easy-to-use online dashboard for predefined DeFi products, which puts additional investment opportunities in the hands of its users with the ease of a single click. These one-click investments can be realized by reducing complex technological processes by predefined setups, which are optimized for the majority of everyday investors. Again the analogy to predefined and well-selected financial products of consumer banks is obvious. But this time it is all of us who can participate in the fees and profits of these products, which will not flow into high bonuses of CFOs or luxurious corporate buildings, but into the pockets of the people who invest their money into the decentralized financial system.

# The Savix Token

The Savix (SVX) token has got a double function within the Savix ecosystem:

SVX tokens create predictable regular interests generated by its protocol embedded staking mechanism. Savix tokens are the DeFi answer to traditional savings accounts since they embody the option to receive rewards which are regular and predictable as classical fiat savings once used to be. Additionally the flexibility of letting all SVX tokens unlocked while participating in the staking system offers the potential to use SVX tokens as collateral for other DeFi investments at the same time. Rewards from staking and DeFi investments can be compounded.

This double nature of SVX tokens leads to the exceptional concept of multiple streams of passive income made possible. Savix tokens offer some unique investment features, which can hardly be found elsewhere in this composition: 85% APY in the first year, very scarce supply of 100,000 tokens at maximum, long term development potential due to the flexibility to integrate new emerging DeFi products, big growth potential due to a broad target group of non tech-savvy users. All smart contracts have been externally audited, of course. Savix offers a ready-to-run product, which has not always been self-evident within the realm of cryptocurrencies.

# Conclusion

There seems to be hope for a more democratic alternative to the existing world of institutional finance. Savix might play its part in it. Maybe the time has come. Don’t miss the DeFi train departing. It might be on track this time.

solar,Help evaluating my Solar System,"Hi everyone, 

I wanted to know if you all could give me advice about my solar system - specifically whether I bought too small of a system. I went live on 9/10/20 with the system I purchased through a local installer, details as follows:

Location: Orange County, California

Installer: Altair , 17 panels

System Panels: Panasonic VBHN325KA03 (x 17)

Inverters: Enphase IQ7x  (x 17)

Production Est is 8905 kWh per year

Electricity: SDGE, was on TOU now on Net Metering

I purchased the system (cost = $14079 before tax credit of $3660) and financed through Nuvision Federal @ 4.99% with a 12 year term @ 130.78 per mo)

I am including a spreadsheet showing my energy use prior to installation and since, as well as production and total monthly payments. My main question is whether I really need a bigger system and need to add panels or not. We are using more energy probably now because we added a second refrigerator and added another adult to the household. 

Thanks in advance for any advice, criticisms or other thoughts.

personalfinance,I'm starting to think about buying a house with my wife and pulled my credit(yikes) and just need some help or guidance or kind words,"So, I just got married last November and my wife and I have been talking about buying a house. Although, I just pulled my credit and it's awful. 


I make $ 85k/year and my wife makes $95k/year


She has around $40k in savings I had $13k in savings(more on that later)

I have a retirement with $22k and already took a loan against it, which I paid off for school. 

My wife and I both have a credit card with around $2k each limits and $0 balance. My wife has $0 debt, our vehicle is paid off. 

Now for my nightmare (all of which is my own fault). I've never pulled my credit, stupid I know. So, after we got married and started talking about buying a house I pulled my credit(credit karma) and I have a trans union score of 589 and a equifax score of 719. My jaw dropped. My monthly bills include $60- phone, $1100-rent, around $20-netflix and audible and $200- Private student loan with a principal of around $8500. What I didn't know... Is that I had two federal student loans in default for over a decade! One just under $13k the other just over $40k. How didn't I know? My father offered to pay my federal loans and did for some time then just stopped, why I never got a call or mail I truly have no clue. I haven't confronted my dad, it's not his obligation and he's got some medical stuff going on. What I did do was pay the $13k loan immediately (bye bye savings). 


So now I don't know what to do. My wife and I are trying to have a baby, in fact, she may already be pregnant, we planned on being able to buy a house and thought it wouldn't be a problem. We currently live in a very tiny 1 bedroom in a congested apartment building. I genuinely have had some pretty self destructive thoughts recently I don't know what to do. I'm embarrassed, angry and feel broken.

What can I do?

Thank you all

TLDR: I am looking to buy a house and have a $40k student loan in default and just paid another $13k loan off.

EDIT: Wow, thank you all so much for the feedback. It's been a huge relief to feel like I have options. I have been really scarily on edge since all this came about. It kills me to think I may have a baby on the way and could not provide a shelter.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"All the hacks,scams and stuff you should be aware of!","This post is an elaborate and long one. I always try to make a TL;DR for all posts I make but I request you to read all of this one.

# Because, 

# We never know how, why and when our future self might get the best out of us.

In crypto sphere, be your own bank and easy trading is a double edged sword. There's no customer care or blocking spending cards/wallets and other support. Which makes it a good target for any kind of attackers. With all kinds of malicious things happening to holders, I'd like to make a list here.

I would categorise these into 3 types. **Greed, Hacks and Stupidity.**

# 1. Greed

This is a consequence of human mentality and FOMO. I believe greed results in more scams than others. Types of greed scams are...

1. **Giveaways :** These are events where a scammer asks you to send him some amount of crypto and says they will send back double or more. It's never coming to you, never ever believe these promises even if the sender/attacker is seemingly legit or even Elon Musk lol.

2. **Ponzi Schemes :** These are detectable in crypto space by abnormal APY(interest) rates. They offer you staking rewards abnormally higher than rivals and market standards. They also offer you levels and tiers and bonuses if your referrals get in too. Never trust these..If you wanna go down the rabbit hole, look up Bitconnect.

3. **Pump and Dump :** Pump and dump is a situation where a group of early buyers try to get in more newbies and then try to drive the price up. They often create these so called ""VIP"" groups and invite people as if they're lucky. Once the price reached their target(it pumped), they exit sell huge bags(dump) at the cost of newcomer's money.

# 2. Hacks

These are result of some clever people putting their skills at work of stealing/scamming your crypto.

1. **Fake Wallets :** There are often crypto wallets with unbelievable similarity to original ones. They also have bots commenting it's very good and also decent upvotes on app stores. Once you install them and deposit your crypto/enter your seed then consider the crypto gone. They will instantly suck up your crypto to their wallets and you can do nothing but report the app.    **Solution** :  Look for legit developer names and app rankings or visit the legit website directly to download the wallet. For geeks, verify the checksum if available.

2.  **Address Malware :** These are often programs that are injected into your computer when you visit/download some free software or play those free games. What they do is download a program onto your computer. When you copy your deposit address from somewhere like an exchange, the malware overwrites your clipboard with the hacker's crypto address.  When you paste the address on the send address, you are sending it to a hacker.                                    **Solution :** Double or Triple check the address you pasted before clicking send.

3. **Phishing Scams :** These are hacks where a malicious website or URL shows up in your chat or emails. Which might look legit but isn't. Hackers take advantage of unicode characters and set up websites whose URL is same as the original and the UI of the website will be same too. Once you try to login and enter your credentials, hackers will take those credentials and log in to your account and can steal your funds or even worse, transfer tainted BTC to your wallet and sell.                                                  **Solution :** Check URL security and if possible, certificates. Use 2FA, preferably an app rather than an SMS 2FA(In case of sim swaps).

# 3. Stupidity

These are a result of pure stupidity or incompetence from the holder's side.

1. **Seed storage methods :**  Almost all of wallets when displaying seed ask the holder to write their seed and chuck it away at some safe place. But, people being stupid, store it as a screenshot or save it as an email draft or in cloud/something in a digital form. This is a huge compromise and you may lose your crypto if you risk to do this. All the glory of ""Crypto"" in cryptocurrency is lost if you as a holder don't make the effort to safeguard your wallets or finances.                       **Solution :** Write it down in physical form in copies, laminate the paper, store those at individual trusted places safely and if your funds are huge, then get a safe.

2. **Not using 2FA :** 2FA these days is almost becoming the norm as email verification was 5/10 years ago. By not using 2FA you are just a sitting duck waiting for some hacker to get your credentials and login. It is as simple as scanning a barcode in an app. Make it your priority.                                     
**Solution :** Please enable 2FA and preferably an app based as SMS based are vulnerable to SIM Swap.

3. **Revealing your holdings :** We all can admit that sometimes we are excited by our gains and want to flex them over our friends and have a "" Told you so"" moment. It isn't worth it. However trustworthy your friend might be, the people he shares the news with might not be so trustworthy. It is always better to assume the worse and every person has a 0 they fall at. Some fall at 1000$ and some at 10,000$. Your gains might become a potential target for the greedy. **Solution :** Never reveal your crypto to anyone, if you already did then go for boating today.

That's it people, I think I mentioned all the general scams. If anyone thinks I missed another prominent one, I'd be glad to edit and include here.",cryptocurrency

Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?~~ [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1) RETIRED!
12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh. 
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)

19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam!

20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.

27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

74. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity.

79. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months.

XRP,Money transfer per year using swift,"If you're just trying to understand the volume of electronic transactions generally to an order of magnitude, it's in the quadrillions of dollars per year. According to this document from the US Treasury, SWIFT handles about $5 trillion per day, or given about 250 business days per year, about $1.25 quadrillion dollars a year.

Similarly, CHIPS handles about $400 trillion per year, and Fedwire handles around $900 trillion per year (most of both of these arise out of SWIFT messages). These transactions make up a large fraction of electronic transactions in the world, so it's safe to assume that the global total isn't much more than a few quadrillion dollars a year.

SWIFT payment message volumes are usually around 11.5 million per day, giving an average payment size of around $45,000— though if one considers the structure of the payments system, it's evident that there's a very wide distribution of payments sizes, so this average isn't particularly representative.1

personalfinance,Grad School Federal Loans or Pay-Off?,"Hello!

My fiancee and I are both finishing our master's degree this summer. We don't yet share our finances and accounts, but we do share costs for rent, utilities, food, etc. I have no loans from undergrad, but she has around 80K in private loans and another 30K in federal loans. Her plan for grad school this summer was to take out another federal loan to pay for it and save cash for our wedding in over a year. However, I almost have enough money saved to pay for both of our final summer of masters' schooling (13K all together.) We both have full-time teaching jobs (combined income \~105K/year.)

Which direction should I go? She thinks I should also take out a loan also to keep the liquid cash, but my family has always encouraged me to pay things off as fast as I can and have as little debt as possible. Paying for both of our schooling this summer would mean that our debt is not increasing... but would mean that I'd have to rebuild savings in-time to pay for our wedding. Buying a house in a few years is going to give me an aneurysm.

Sorry if I've not posted this correctly or with enough details - I haven't made any posts like this before.

I’m currently a 1099 contracted individual working in the wealth management industry where I’ve been a year and a half now and I’ve got that whole system figured out. Have a business checking account &amp; debit card for business expenses, use QB Self-Employed, made a pretty solid tax projection worksheet that proved to be accurate in 2020 and I pay taxes as I go (quarterlies) to fed + state. 

I’m considering DoorDash’ing 5-6 hrs/week to start to see if it’s worth it and want to know what I should be considering from an accounting perspective. While I’d be a “contracted” individual for two companies, I’m wondering how I should go about the accounting aspects for this second job. Do I need another QBSE account to keep track of DD exclusively? Any considerations would be helpful! And yes, I’m already a little skeptical of DD’s ability to be a viable source of additional income..

personalfinance,18 year old with 80k and a few questions - any advice?,"Hey internet strangers,

Firstly, thank you so much for taking the time to read my post! I'm a high school senior and I was lucky enough to win a full scholarship (including fees/room and board) for a great state university, so my entire education is paid for.

My parents have generously offered to give me the entire sum of my college fund (around 70k) to spend while I've also saved 15k from my part time job over the past three years. I'm going to spend 5k on whatever/fun money, and I'd like to invest all of the other 80k to (hopefully) have enough to not worry about retirement. I've read through the wiki, and I have a few other questions

1. Should I take out student loans?
   1. Although I don't need them, my logic is that the interest rate it would cost is lower than any potential gains I'd receive through investing the sum. I'm just trying to understand if I have blinders on and why this may be a bad decision.
2. Should I consider investing in real estate?
   1. Because I'd have to pay for housing for the next four years anyway, I'm considering putting a down payment on a house (my parents are willing to take out the mortgage in their name, though I'd be the one paying for everything after university), living in a basement suite, and renting out the actual house parts (or living in one bedroom and renting out the others).
   2. I'd love another opinion on if this is a good idea!
3. How much money, if any, should I keep and not invest?
   1. In the wiki, it mentions that if you're a student you should consider not investing because you may need this money in the future. For reference, I plan on working internships/a part time job in year 2-4 of university and use this as a ""transition/just in case"" fund. In my opinion, I shouldn't really require any additional saving funds beyond this, but I'd love another viewpoint!
      1. Speaking of working, is the payoff from working during the year vs having more time to enjoy the university experience worth it? I will do internships in the summer either way, but I'm just curious about the year itself.
4. Do you have any other advice? This could be about anything from tips to keep in mind in university to anything else!

Thank you again!!",finance
personalfinance,[California] Just got my first ever full time job. First paycheck on Friday had 20% taxes withheld. What gives?,"My annual salary is $44,000.
I get paid 2x per month so the numbers below constitute one half of a month (one roughly 2-week pay period)

I work remotely for a company based out of Colorado

Total pay before any other deductions was $1580.
Total taxes were $310- including Federal, CO State, and something called ""OASDI""
I also had another $300 taken out for a 401(k) contribution 
So my take home after this was something like $970

Next month my benefits start which will cost $364/month

Then my take home for working a 40 hour week will be around $600 twice a month?!!? That's like, barely enough for rent.

When I was an independent contractor I paid 20% of my income for the ""self employment tax"", and sure okay I didn't have benefits but I always thought the outrageously high tax rate would go down when I became an employee again

Any ideas? Do I have my withholdings set too high?!! Saving for retirement is of topmost priority to me, I actually have a self directed IRA which I would like to ideally add $500/month to but it's seeming like that is gonna be impossible.

Thank you

Edit: okay so I think I miscalculated. If benefits are $364 per month then that's $364/2 = $182 per bimonthly paycheck. So $970 - $182 = $788 per half month... um..

Edit 2: would love any perspective on how I have things set up (not just taxes). Is $364/month a lot for vision, dental, health, lawyer on retainer and Hsa contributions?",finance
CryptoCurrency,STPT Use Case and Forecast,"“The great revolution in the history of man, past, present and future, is the revolution of those determined to be free.”
- John F. Kennedy 

Today we begin yet another transformation towards a brighter future. Through all the struggles of the way things used to be, I see a brighter future lighting the way for all of us, no matter the race or creed. I offer a direction that you can control. An idea that has not been available to human civilization for a long time. The perceived flagrant idea of self governance and control from the bottom up, not the other way around. Today we look at how the STP network envelops this ideology and leads us to a brighter future for all. The long existent chapter of a monopolistic view on wealth distribution can finally come to a close. The Standard Tokenization Protocol is one of the protagonists of this story, and we are watching this happen in real time. Let me walk you through this idea right now. 

The Standard Tokenization Protocol (STP) defines a revolutionary platform hitherto missing from the blockchain ecosystem. STP has devised an open-sourced standard designed from a principle of trustless asset management and record keeping available not only on the Polkadot infrastructure, but also other blockchain platforms as well as assets off-chain. They give the user the ability to compile any asset from any medium and create a trustless security token creation platform. This guarantees that assets representing the security token’s valueship are present, no matter the medium. The result is an opportunity to invest in something either previously unavailable or lacking a tantamount level of security. We can thank the blockchain for such a possibility. STP is seamlessly leveraging and executing this idea with a high level of precision and offers an opportunity like none before it. The very idea hinges upon the notion of ‘synthetic asset’.

The idea of a synthetic asset is not new. CoinTelegraph explains that “a ‘synthetic asset’ refers to a mix of assets that have the same value as another asset. Traditionally, synthetics combine various derivative products - options, futures or swaps - that simulate an underlying asset - stocks, bonds, commodities, indexes, currencies or interest rates.” Several other entities have their way of achieving this through many different formulations. These current formulas do not lend themselves to a decentralized principle, nor do they offer much to the average investor in terms of trust or the flexibility to become something more than just a glorified “stable coin”. STP disrupts this paradigm by rejecting the current narrative. This inverted idea is that it cannot be improved upon and must only be duplicated. Obviously investors in blockchain have the lens to see the bigger picture and realize that the S&amp;P 500 and a handful of tech stocks are going to be the golden future of our financial system. 

Why can’t we decide what our gold standard will be? What happened to letting the market decide what is a valuable indicator for the health of our financial systems? Who said we have to accept what we’re given and that we have to continue playing by their rules? Who made those decisions, anyway? Now that we have the privilege and resources to construct our own economic future and track the pulse ourselves, we can focus our intentions and potential forward. Lest we forgive or forget the moneyed few responsible for our (many) common and shared woes, observe that some have already transposed this oppressive and undignified problem onto the blockchain. They toxify our ecosystem with the same old-money ideologies. I am proud to say that STP, from its core, defies this idea wholly and enthusiastically and allows us all to pave the future for a new financial structure already at our doorstep. Whoever declares that they can fulfil the betterment of all society without input from the people is not truly operating for your benefit. 

I admit, however, that I do not offer any other solution besides advocacy for the working class and collaboration with those that conform to our outlook on how things should be. I back this token not only for its revolutionary protocol, but also for its ability to add more depth to the blockchain ecosystem and its ability to leverage our community for the benefit of our community. By supporting a financial counter-culture, we ensure that governments and other entities cannot dictate how we can provide a better future for ourselves and our families.

personalfinance,Mortgage Pre Approval Thoughts and Advice please,"My wife and I are looking to buy a new home soon and I have a few questions. We sold our house 1 month ago and moved to a rental property to use the equity to pay off debt and improve our financial situation. We are looking to have a new house built. We are looking at different places ranging from $360k to $425k. At this time we have paid off all of our credit card debt (except 1 Rooms to Go revolving credit account that has a $2100 balance $5000 limit but its 0% interest @ $44 a month) our overall credit utilization is well under 10% with 42% on that individual account(should I throw $700 at it to drop it below 30%?). I have $6500 in federal student loans left $260/month payment, my wife has a car loan $9200 balance $411/month and a personal loan that has a $19,000 balance $561/month payment.... Our normal joint gross income is $150k/yr (right now she is earning more due to bonuses and extra shifts as she's a respiratory therapist and covid is working her extra, but I figure its best to figure things on the normal non covid pay of $150k joint).... 

So with all that being said our DTI should be about 10-11% both of our lowest fico scores are about 725, though both still show some cc debt that has been paid off and another loan that was paid off that hasn't refreshed yet. So I'm assuming our scores will tick up a few more points.... I  just found today that apparently my wife missed a medical lab bill and it has been posted as in collections on her credit report as of the 19th , its only $150 and I will be paying it off in the morning, but I guess the damage is done there... I'm pretty upset about that cause she's not very organized and we have no problems paying a $150 bill.... I have just recently taken over handling all of our finances (we were just married in Oct and we each generally handled bills separately before. I'm hoping that wont hang us too badly with a lender if I show that its paid, she has one other late payment shown on her history from last year where she forgot a cc payment too but otherwise no black marks on her history. I myself have 0 late payments/collections or other neg reports. We are waiting to apply for a pre approval next month once she receives the payout on another bonus from work. This should also give enough time for our credit report to update and remove all debts we have paid off.  When we apply we will have about $38k in cash. 

So we have 725 or better Credit scores, $150k income, 11% DTI and $38k in cash. Stable jobs 7.5 years with my employer and job not affected by covid, and shes about 10yrs in her field and 3.5 years with her current hospital. We are going to apply for a loan from Navy Federal, so no PMI. Their conventional loan requires 5% down. We are not military so no VA loan available for us but we do have an account with Navy Fed because of family.  Do you think  we should be able to get approved for $425k? If we sign to have a house built it wont be done for 10-12 months.  With our current bills we are saving about $3500-4k a month so we will have more to put down on the house before getting the actual mortgage too. I know the pre approval is only going to be interested in the current available cash. If we get pre approved with what we have then Ill probably just direct the next few months of saving toward paying off the 19k personal loan since its got a higher interest rate.  I'm just a little stressed over everything, I'm pessimistic and always think the worst. Any re assurance is helpful. Any guidance or tips to ensure that we get the approval would be great. I know ideal circumstance would probably be to use our cash to pay off our remaining debt then save more and apply later but since we want a house built that will be yet another year from the point  of approval so If I can get approval now Id like to get the process started.  Thanks for any and all input.",finance
business,Cathie Wood: Inflation vs Deflationary forces,"In a recent video, Cathie goes back in time to the end of 2016 - Early 2017.

Quantitative easing was on its way out and the FED was going to start raising the interest rates. The market was very nervous...

Trump won the election and the odds of a cyclical burst increased because of his promise to cut taxes and that's exactly what happened!

In the beginning the equity market was very nervous around the idea that interest rates would be going up. When Trump was elected - value stock took off just like they're getting off now - responding to this idea that economy is developing ahead of steam so the value stocks have taken off.

If you look at year to date: energy stocks are up 27%, financial stocks 11%, tech stock 1% and health stocks are actually down. So basically traditional value stocks are having a nice run! So right now we are in a 2016 like scenario, value stocks are up and growth strategy stocks are down (Take ARK ETFs as a perfect example)

Cathie thinks this is great because the bull market is broadening out to other sectors and this - can only be a good thing for ""disruptive innovation"" stocks investors.

What would be negative instead? It would be a negative thing if the bull market continues to narrow and only innovation strategy worked, because that's what happened with the .com tech bubble in 2000. (And we all know how bad the consequences have been).

Cathie actually likes the fear that ARK is experiencing and that there's a reality check, in terms of the speculative moves that have taken place within the innovation space.

What happened post Q4 2016 after the market had broadened out? Well… 2017 was a fantastic year for the equity market in general with cyclical value and growth.  And she believes we're now moving towards a similar scenario.

Now let's find out what Cathie's said on Bitcoin being speculative, not sustainable, not environment friendly and heavily used for illicit activities. With a lot of respect Cathie says that Janet Yellen doesn't understand the crypto space, simply because it's not her main focus.

Regarding the environmental issue: comparing the energy required for BTC mining to the energy required to mine gold you can clearly see that the first is a fraction of the latter. It's an infamous comparison in favor of BTC. Further think about the energy consumption for a bitcoin transaction to the ones of the traditional financial banking system. It's a fraction and the comparison is again ridiculous in favor of BTC. 

She also reports what an FBI agent told her. According to him BTC is the best thing that happened to the FBI, because they've tons of cryptographers who are able to break codes and figure out illicit activities and they've been able to track and arrest many criminals following the transactions to their wallets. BTC blockchain is so transparent based on IP tracking and IP pattern recognition, that it becomes a useful tool against crime.

Talking about BTC she admits it is speculative, but we can see trillions of dollars in use cases. So it's very important to be supportive of those who are evolving this ecosystem and think about ways to help the community (such as developers) to secure the blockchain tech. Regarding the time of 10 minutes for a transaction… it could seem a lot compared to smart contracts based blockchains but you have to consider that it is a compromise because of the higher security of Bitcoin. And the high fees for a single transaction are nothing if you compare them with the ones of the traditional banking system.

Cathie makes few considerations on inflation and that the monetary policy ease throughout the world, is going to ignite inflation. ARK thinks there are 2 major deflationary forces evolving in the global economy and that these are going to be in a duelling match with each other. Good vs bad deflation. Good deflation has to do with technologically enabled innovation. It's deflationary by nature, it rides down cost curves and production times.So the industry gains efficiency and productivity at the same time.

* Take as an example the Electric Vehicle space. ARK analysts found out that deflation rate is 28% for every cumulative doubling in the number of units produced. We're at 2.2M units EVS right now and it's not going take long to double these numbers.
* In DNA sequencing space it's a 40% for every cumulative doubling and we're at a very low base there as well. But those low bases are going to move up pretty quickly. And according to ARK forecasts… EVs sales will move from 2.2M to 40M (almost a 20x increase) in the next 5 years. And sales will only begin to impact economic statistics as they scale in the next few years.

Concluding with Cathie's warning about what she defines as disruptive innovation.She says that it is going to cause creative destruction in the traditional world order:

* Robotics
* AI
* Blockchain
* DNA sequencing

And these are going to converge: autonomous vehicle are going to be robots, energy storage will be electric and AI will be everywhere.It's a combinatorial, multiplicative, compounding effect. Think about these as if they were waves crashing in the ocean and think about companies as ships navigating. There will be some ships that get elevated but others that go dip. The energy liberated in the crashes/convergence will be revolutionary at the base of the entire world and this is what she defines the powerful good deflationary forces. So when combined they produce a movement forward.

On the other hand the bad deflationary forces are associated to what just mentioned. The disintermediation and the disruption to the traditional world order is going to put lot of companies at risk. Companies that were thinking that nothing would ever change. Financial services, internal combustion engine automobile, rails and all the suppliers around. Ray Dalio, Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks have warned many times the investors on this bad deflation.

So we can conclude that these 2 forces will be very powerful and will have huge effects in the next few years.

Bitcoin,My thesis on why Bitcoin will continue exponential growth this year please provide critique,"**Bitcoin and the Global Stagflation Crisis of 2022/2023**

Written **21-March-2021**

TL;DR Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency is the only major fixed supply commodity, and there is a global stagflation crisis(which has never happened before) coming within the next year or two. Bitcoin will keep its exponential growth in value.

**Background:**

Inflation and low interest rates incentivize two things: borrowing and spending.

Low interest rates incentivize borrowing and spending because it makes it cost less to borrow and makes it more viable to leverage for profits by acquiring assets.

Inflation incentivizes borrowing because money borrowed now is worth more than the debt paid later since the debt loses value over time, and incentivizes acquiring assets that won’t devalue overtime unlike the underlying asset

**Scenario:**

The recent stimulus package just passed by the Biden administration is a nearly $2 Trillion package in total doubling the stimulus package passed by the Trump administration. The first stimulus package focused more and corporations and small businesses, leading to a package that infused a lot of money into the economy while not really affecting the consumer price index used to measure inflation. This most recent stimulus package is more focused on giving the people money to boost the economy and will affect the consumer price index significantly. Inflation numbers are hidden in the CPI due to equities and real estate not being included which have both been pumped into a massive bubble for the past couple of years. Even though the CPI shows there is no inherent rise in inflation, a common indicator of inflation is a shortage in supply caused by more buying pressure in the form of newly created money. The list for commodities and products currently in a supply shortage is massive. The list is as follows:

semiconductors/autos, headphones/game consoles, plastics, steel/aluminum, coolers/drinkware, sofas, boats, seafood, meat/dairy, roller skates, fitness equipment, garden furniture, hot tubs/baths

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vz6z4xpukfo61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cecbcb7ffd1aa6255772f5ea69b396086e3c8547

This report by Goldman Sachs global investment research shows a large disruption in the supply chain, most likely caused by inflation.

This leads to the everything bubble(specifically real estate and equities), which is the finding that nearly every asset under the sun has gained a tremendous amount of value within the last several years. The bond market is starting to notice this trend and is in a massive sell off causing a spike in long term treasury bond yields. The fed is working to artificially lower the the long term treasury yield by continuing to buy debt. Jerome Powell has recently stated that the federal reserve is in the process of buying $80 billion in treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage backed securities. Which will keep the stock market to continue rising as well as the housing market. Many in the bond market are afraid of these recent actions and continue to try and liquidate their positions to flee to assets that will not devalue like the dollar. This has caused a lot of volatility in the last several weeks in the market. Jerome Powell has gone on the news to try and calm the market down. In summary, he has stated that the economy is not doing well in many sectors as unemployment is still in high numbers especially in the African American and Hispanic demographics and this is his number one priority. He says that the fed does not plan to raise rates any time soon until this problem can be fixed. So everyone knows inflation is coming, but his response? He stated that this inflation is transitory and will only affect the United States for a short amount of time. He expressed that inflation levels moderately above 2% for some time is an appropriate action. Another question is how much does ""moderately above"" mean, and how much is ""for some time""? I believe that he believes that he can fix this economy through monetary policy. I trust that he will continue to print money until the cows come home, because there are multiple incentives for inflation right now. One obvious incentive as stated before is stimulating the economy, but another hidden incentive is lowering the national debt. Rising inflation devalues the tremendous debt that the United States holds and I think this is a major underlying factor to keep inflation at high levels for a long time. So where does all this end?

**Tinfoil hat theory:**

The end is coming for this massive bull run, but it has two outcomes. A continued rise of fear in the bond market raises bond yields to a point that the United States cannot reasonably control the interest rate without absolutely destroying the dollar. Another end scenario is the end of the global pandemic itself, when most of the population is vaccinated and the economy is starting to look healthy again causing the stimulus to end . In the pandemic many companies have struggled and lead to a massive amount of corporate debt being created. The size of the corporate bond market in the U.S. has ballooned to $10.5 trillion dollars and a significant portion of this debt is linked to zombie companies(look up the definition of zombie company if unfamiliar). If rates rise it will create a domino effect of killing the current zombie companies while also adding more to the list. A raise in rates will also kill the housing market bubble. As borrowing becomes more expensive, less buying pressure will cause real estate prices to fall leaving many new homeowners left holding the bag. This will also cause these new home owners to possibly sell their homes to buy a more valuable home for the same price as their current home further lowering the real estate market. Also as rates rise, the cash flows of many companies start to look very unappealing leading to a massive sell off in the stock market.

With these two outcomes, they are heavily leading to a stagflation crisis for the United States, but this is still looking at the small picture. The actual big picture of this is that all of these events are not localized to the United States and almost every country in the world is doing this in some form. **What we are looking at is a global stagflation crisis which has never happened before**. For future outlook, there are two countries of focus on specifically Japan and China. Japan is probably the most famous example of stagflation and how it affected their economy. In the 1980’s we saw a massive rise in the Nikkei 225(Japanese market index). In the late 1980’s is when the stagflation crisis hit Japan and they did not recover from their equity values until as of recently. Which has taken 40 years to recover. One thing to consider is if they actually recovered or not? I believe that they just reset the clock on stagflation as they, like all other countries in the world, tried printing their way out of the coronavirus problem, causing a possible stagflation round 2 for japan.

Picture of Nikkei 225 below:

I believe China can be a good indicator of the future of America’s economic market, because they arguably got hit just as hard, they are also in the same bubble scenario that most countries are in, have similar economic size, and are ahead in the coronavirus recovery cycle. Recently Beijing is set to “tighten credit policy, particularly in the property sector, as evidence that economic growth has reached its peak and is set to decline”, and “Chinese economic analyst think that United States will maintain its loose monetary policy until at least the end of 2023 to support its economic recovery and labour market have reinforced concerns in Beijing as it tries to reduce the risk of domestic asset bubbles by gradually tapering off stimulus policies enacted last year”

This is the beginning of a financial crisis the world has never seen before and I think marks the beginning for bitcoin becoming a currency for the world.

Bitcoin is a limited asset. Before bitcoin there was no major fixed supply asset. The closest thing to compare bitcoin to is gold as a store of value. Gold is inherently a terrible store of value due to the constant dilution of value caused by a yearly increase in global available supply. A common argument for Bitcoin is that it has no intrinsic value, which is objectively false. Robert Metcalfe who is an early pioneer to starting the internet and co-inventing the ethernet, is a prominent figure who received the 2003 Marconi award for promulgating what is known as Metcalfe's Law. Metcalfe’s law states that the value/utility of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected nodes/users of the system. Before this year I would have argued that Bitcoin was a risky investment, but the network now has a lot of support and is quickly growing in functionality. Investing in Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream as people like Kevin O’Leary publicly stating that he allocates 3% of his portfolio to bitcoin, many companies like Tesla are starting to acquire Bitcoin, Many fintechs like Paypal are starting to utilize bitcoin, Bitcoin is starting to look more attractive to big banks as they acquire cryptocurrency assets and exchanges like the Bank of New York Mellon, and last but not least exchange traded funds centered around bitcoin are being created and coming to the stock market. The more people that invest in bitcoin, the more the value grows exponentially and the more viable it becomes. It is argued that bitcoin looks like a bubble and is part of the everything bubble, but I only think that is partially true. As every nation's currency lowers in value, bitcoin starts looking more and more attractive as a hedge, and the more people investing in bitcoin, the more the value and safety of bitcoin as an investment increases. I think it is safe to say that bitcoin will easily double in value before the end of the year.

personalfinance,"30 Year Old Living in Dallas, mismanaged my finances and feeling stuck. Looking for advice on how to budget and generate passive income.","About me: 30 year old female living in Downtown Dallas.

Hello everyone. I feel very stuck at the moment. I have had a decent paying job since I was 23 and don't have much to show for it at 30. Throughout my twenties I did not save much money and figured at some point I would be in a serious relationship and finances would be a lot easier to manage. I have pretty much been single my entire life and realize I cannot count on dual income anytime soon, if ever.  My short term goal is to figure out how to start generating income outside of my salaried job through purchasing real estate and renting, or other investments. I'm looking for advice on what you would do in my current situation and how you would manage my finances to set yourself up for short term and long term financial growth.

I'm a little embarrassed about my spending habits, which I will get into shortly, but I do want to maintain some of my current lifestyle because it does bring me joy (however I do realize that I need to cut back and will take that advice).

Income:

Pretax Annual Income: **117k** base, **10k** bonus, \~**4k** additional random (overtime, awards, etc)

401k contribution: **8%** annually, my company contributes **10%** annually

HSA contribution: **3k** annually

Credit Score: 820 (always pay credit card bills off every month, no credit card debt)

&amp;#x200B;

Assets:

401k: **150k** (is this decent at 30? not enough? I have no idea where I'm at with this)

HSA: **6k** (should I continue to contribute?)

Savings: **17k**

Other investments: **13k** (I have done an awful job at trying to invest in the stock market and have lost 5k recently, can liquidate immediately. 8k is with a financial advisor and I contribute 500 to this account monthly, 5k is with me, I originally had 10k)

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly  Income vs. Monthly Expenses:

After Tax Monthly Income (base salary only): **$6,080.** I get paid weekly at 1520, most months that is 6,080, some months that comes out to 7,600. I like to calculate based on the 6,080 number.

Rent: **2,300** (I live in downtown in a nice apartment, not sure if I can find a place and feel comfortable for less than 1900 but I understand I may need to reevaluate this)

Car Payment: **416** (5 year loan on a 2018 VW Tiguan, loan expires November 2023, 5.5% Interest rate which I do not understand why it's so high as my credit score is very good, **12k** to pay off the loan)

Car Insurance: **120**

Phone bill: **120**

Internet: **120**

Utilities: **100**

**Total: $3,176**

Non Essential Monthly Expenses:

Food: \~**1,000**........ Alright I KNOW this is atrocious but I am lumping in groceries, restaurants, drinks, uber eats etc. I am absolutely AWFUL at cooking and do not know how to cook for myself to make it taste good/healthy/and not to let it go bad. I feel completely hopeless to managing this number.

Beauty: **350** (This number can't change for what I see at the moment, this encompasses lash extensions, makeup, botox some months, hair treatments other months.... I need this to feel good about myself)

**Total: 1,350**

**Grand Total: 4,526**

This means I have **1,554** left over for miscellaneous purchases and contributing to savings. This \~1500 dollars gets completely gobbled up each month with traveling, gifts, clothing, household needs, etc. and the 500 I contribute to the investment account with my financial advisor.

My bonus is now going straight to savings. My recent bonus I received was \~6k after taxes and I receive these every March.

I know I need to make some changes. My question to you all is if you were in my situation how would you manage my finances in order to start saving more and make steps to generate passive income. Can I buy a house with 10k down now to rent out? Other ideas on how to invest my money? Cut costs? Pay off my car?

I realize my lifestyle may be very different than most and it is quite obvious I could cut back in certain areas such as rent and have an extra 1k a month but I can't cut back that dramatically and sacrifice my comfort especially now that I am working from home. I'd be interested in how you would manage my finances if you were you and if you were me.

I sincerely appreciate any help or advice you can give. I want to make changes but I just have no idea how to manage it.

EDIT: I know that I am not at all in a bad situation and am better set up than average. However I know that I can do a lot better with my current situation, I do not want to work forever. I'd like to generate income elsewhere so that I can quit my job/retire sooner. For making this money for 7 years (starting at 80k and slowly made my way to 117k) and only having 30k saved is not at all where I should be. My friends who make much less than me have MUCH more saved than I do.",finance
economy,Interest Rates Can Never Normalize In The untied States (Japanification Is Inevitable),"Interest on the national debt is currently \~$400 billion dollars with record low interest rates. We're also adding $3 trillion dollars to the debt each year (projections for 2021 are closer to 2.26 trillion).

If interest rates normalized to 5% (which is the historical average going back 140 years, it's averaged 6.8% if you average back only 60 years) and we added $20 trillion dollars more in debt  (which would happen in under a decade at current rates). We would owe $1 trillion in interest on that newly issued debt, on top of all of the existing debt being rolled over at the higher rate (even if you argue they don't have to roll over the debt, (which they do. but even if they didn't), the first point of adding $1 trillion in interest expense on top of the existing $400 billion still stands. 

'

Our current federal government only takes in $3.5 trillion in revenue. Meaning we would only have $2.1 trillion left to spend. Now some people might say, ""well the government can increase tax revenue, correct?"" That's true, but the government has a history of increasing taxes and spending more money, not less. Meaning if we're going on the historical trend, we assume that the government will tax and spend more, not spend less to pay off the debt.

Some may also say, well over those 10 years (in this hypothetical situation where rates go to the 5% historical average, they've been much higher than that at many points historically as well) the tax revenue the federal government receives will increase. That's true, but not enough to cover the increased spending in my view.

Revenue in 2010 for the federal government was  $2.16 trillion (noticing I'm picking a year that the revenue is bottomed out, so this is actually a rosier prediction because the revenue had nowhere to go but up after the 08' crash). We collect $3.5 trillion 10 years later. Meaning in 10 years the federal revenue increased roughly \~60%.

Let's assume that happens again (it won't because again the growth form 2010 in revenue to 2020 was driven by one of if not thee the larges expansion in history due to completely bottoming out, but let's just give us the benefit of the doubt).

So revenue goes form 3.5T to 5.6T by 2030. Okay, so we owe $1.4 trillion in interest (that's a low ball figure assuming we owe 5% on existing debt, if we double our debt, which we nearly will over the next decade, this number would be twice as high) on the debt and have $4.2 trillion left to spend on expenditures. The problem is social security currently is eating up 1.1 trillion today. By 2028 it will be $1.6 trillion. That reduces left over federal revenue down to $2.6T. Medicare/Medicaid by 2028 will be eating away $2.6T. Meaning now we're at breakeven. The military will be eating away $800 billion, so now we're $800 billion in the hole. Take out federal pensions, food and agriculture subsidies, waste/fraud, and classified programs, and we're adding $2 trillions.

&amp;#x200B;

Take in mind, that growth in revenue won't happen. Taxes are already nearing their limits in my view. Even if you confiscated 100% of every billionaire in the countries assets, you wouldn't finance the government for more than 8 months. Meaning you can't 1% your way out. Even if you spread it out over 10 years the revenue just isn't there in my view (correct me if I'm wrong in the comments, but my math on the revenue side I'm pretty sure is correct. Even if you agree we're not nearing the limits of taxation, the scenario above assumed we will have another decade of the greatest economic expansion in the last 50 years. I don't believe that personally. I think revenue will go up maybe 40%. Which makes the deficit go up to $2.7 trillion per year by 2030. And that's assuming we only owe 5% interest on $20 trillion. We will have \~$50 trillion by 2030, but I wanted to give us a lot of wiggle room just to make my point clear.

Essentially, we will monetize the debt using the federal reserve. Or we will default. There's no other way.

Or we decrease spending, but there's no political will for that.

Sorry, Japanification and low growth here we come!

I know some will argue the population is the reason Japan has low growth, true. But a big part also is the debt which requires resources to be reallocated non-productively.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? Pardon if my numbers wrong I'm a bit sleep deprived currently to be honest.

I still haven't got a refund, though. Nor have I received a direct deposit for the most recent $1200 stimulus check.

personalfinance,Mom accidentally claimed me as dependent-what to do?,"Mom accidentally claimed me as dependent- what should I do?

Hello,

I attempted to efile my taxes and was rejected. My mom reviewed her taxes and realized that TurboTax automatically claimed me as a dependent. 

I was a dependent in 2019, but not in 2020. I live on my own and have no financial support as of May 2019. She filled out and mailed a 1040x. I see that it can take up to 16 weeks (I would imagine it could be even more as it is paper and the pandemic). 

I have not received any stimulus checks during this pandemic. I was hoping to receive this as a credit on my tax return, but seeing as I was claimed as a dependent I am also missing out on the latest stimulus check, which I was counting on (my car recently broke down). Will I be able to receive this latest missing stimulus as a credit on my 2021 tax refund? Or am I SOL? 

Also, I am worried that if I mail my tax return it will cause even more confusion. What additional documents, if any, should I be including when I mail my tax documents to federal and state? When can I expect to receive my tax refund, and will it impact me filing next year? Should I just wait for my moms 1040x to be processed then attempt to efile the same return?

Thank you so much in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Financial planning assistance and purchasing a home due to rent increase this year.,"This is in California for rent in a HCOL area that’s quiet and safe. (Used to rent in ghetto) I pay 3,200 a month with 200 a month in utilities for a 3b 2ba with massive backyard. Lease is up in July. My landlord wants to increase to 3,500 or something along those lines. I paid all the rent myself during covid since I was the only one working but paid for it on my own for about two years before that. July will put myself at 5 years renting this house. It started off with roommates for a total of 2,900 a month and I took over the difference when they moved on and I got in a serious relationship. I get why he wants to increase rent on a home that could sell for 900k-1million. 

Recently I was pre-approved for a mortgage loan at 425k for a conventional loan at 3-10% down payment. 
Based on a base income of $72,506 for scheduled hours at my full time job alone. This number does not include missed lunches (an extra hour of pay) and involuntary overtime (happens in my line of work).

-I am looking in the 330k-390k range but will be adding a 75 mile commute each way with a $5 bridge toll compared to my 25 mile commute each with no toll. 

-My credit score across all bureaus is 760-800 and I have a credit limit of 36500 across my credit cards that I haven’t upped in a few years. My credit utilization is less than 3% a month detailed below. 

-I spend 600-1000 a month on utilities, food, dog food, maybe an occasional take out meal, but my biggest eater is gas. 

-I drive a 2015 Honda Civic and I have to fill up around 5 or 6 times a month at what is now 40 dollars a fill up.  The car is paid off. And I pay 190 a month for car insurance. Spotless driving record. 

-I made $95,000 last year due to a per diem job I enjoy as mainly a hobby and some overtime due to covid-19.

-my base pay will be 77k on January 1st, 2022 and it typically goes up 2-4% a year. 

-I put in 5% to my 401k to get my 100% match from my employer. I’ll be 100% vested middle of next year. 

-I have 30,000 saved up. Which is less than what I started with last year (32,000) despite the increase in income and from two major vet emergencies/surgery and what’s written below. 

-I also assisted my father in some mortgage payments so he continue to pay his mortgage through the pandemic so he wouldn’t have defer his payments. totaling (21,000 contribution). His mortgage will be paid off middle of 2022. I don’t regret this decision, I didn’t want him to pull from his 401k and affect his anticipated retirement which has been pushed to next year when he’s 70. He works in the hotel industry which is still shut down. Paying off the house is what was the “I can finally retire” for him. 

My fiancé’s employer shut down in March of last year and two weeks ago announced that they cannot reopen again. Her credit score across all bureaus is 800+ and has a single navy federal account with a 20,000 credit limit and about 12k left in savings. She was at 40,000 salary prior to the shut down. She is about to apply to nursing programs after retaking pre-requisite courses during the shut down. 

The loan officer says it shouldn’t be a problem to add her on. And since I’m already topped out for the best rates, it wouldn’t make a difference but maximize the total amount of loan if she gets a full time job to establish income. 

What’s worrying me is the cost of homeownership and increased costs of commuting and if I can do it on a single income. I want to be able to do it on my income alone. Part of a pride thing and I want my significant other to focus on schooling since the reason college didn’t work for me was I was a horrible student who preferred working. She graduated college with a 4.0 and has excellent organizational habits and is a great student. She has her bachelors already. Nursing jobs start at 40ish an hour for nursing homes and non traditional bedside jobs and much higher if you go work in the hospital. So the 2 years of her not working will pay off in the end. 


Even if I limit my per diem job to twice a month and one overtime shift a month I’ll make 97k this year. 

My fiancé’s vehicle is 16 years old Prius and our mechanic friend gave it about 2 or 3 years to go. Spent about 6k in major work in the last 2 years on it. 

I’m considering an electric vehicle due to an anticipated huge increase commuting and free electric vehicle charging at both places of employment. I already drive about 1100 miles a month mostly freeway and work 4 days a week at most (12 hours shifts). Having this car as a back up if the Prius kicks the bucket for good. 

I’m looking at a 2100-2700 monthly mortgage depending on purchase price, down payment, and HOA. (HOA is 99-485 across where I’m looking for houses)

Can this work? Are electric vehicles worth it especially if I get free charging at work that can get me back home while charging throughout the day. Any manufactures recommendation?

Should I just stay where I am and pay this new rent increase in July? I’m 34 and feel like I’ll be financially stuck in this area",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin: The greatest story ever told,"I first heard about bitcoin from a dear friend, in 2013 but I thought it would never catch up so I didn’t buy any.

I then started my bitcoin journey reading and learning on this subreddit in 2017, when btc surged past the previous ath of 1000 usd, and I started buying some with the cash I had available which wasn’t much.

At the time (in 2017) I still had a high time preference (fiat mentality) 

If bitcoin would’ve touched 30k back than i would’ve sold all my bitcoin to buy an expensive sport car.
I would’ve struggled to pay the gasoline for such a car and today I’d have no bitcoin.

Instead bitcoin crashed, I had to focus completely on my 9-5 job that doesn’t pay me much but it helped me stack some more sats during the 2019 bear market.

During the last couple of years my mind slowly changed and I started to learn how much bitcoin was actually worth.

Reading you guys here on Reddit but also on Twitter definitely helped a lot and I changed (the bitcoin standard is a great book by the way... thanks @saifedean).

Now I’m confident when I say that I’ll never sell my BTC for Fiat or for shallow cars or stuff I don’t really need.

The [Neo/Morpheus Meme](https://i.redd.it/3525lt9kvir01.jpg) was true after all.

I fully expect another bear market to happen and it will suck because my bitcoin stash will be worth significantly less at some point, but I accept that 100%

Bitcoin gave me hope, freedom and taught me how important savings are for my future, and the future of my kids, that I really want to have in the next few years.
That’s where I’ll probably end up spending my bitcoin.
Raising kids will be a great adventure and I understand now that, in the past, I really thought that I’d never could’ve afforded them.

That’s why my generation (millennials) have so few kids... we just learn this high time preference mentality that we will never be able to afford kids and so we might as well burn money on shallow stuff we don’t need....

Central banks convinced us that there is no future for us, that in the long run we are all dead anyways, so we should just party and spend money until it’s over.

They are destroying our world and we are not even fighting because people don’t even realize what’s going on.

I hope bitcoin will succeed... I really do. And I’ll just go down with the ship if it comes down to that.

I don’t freaking care about taking profits that don’t mean shit if they can print money indefinitely.

Hodl on folks, we have a good shot at this, and I hope many more people will wake up. 

I believe in Bitcoin, it can truly change the world, and I’m putting my money where my mouth is (80% of my net worth is in bitcoin) and I will never sell.

I wish I was a whale and if I was I would be pretty fed up with being blamed and I understand why. So as whales buy large amounts but seem to sell when it hits .06, why don’t we support them and ask to raise their sell limit to $1?

dogecoin,Cryptocurrency can bring back the Gold Standard,"As of today (Mar 21, 2021) 1 Bitcoin is roughly worth 1 Kilogram of gold. 1 Ethereum is roughly worth 1 ounce of gold. One Doge is roughly worth 1 milligram of gold. Coincidence? Perhaps. But if crypto can somehow become the everyday form of payment for transactions,  the Federal Reserve Notes would become obsolete and the only physical currency of value would be precious stones and precious metals(as it once was). Let's encourage businesses to open up to accepting crypto. Let's encourage non-profits to accept Doge, and let's actually donate. If we can maximize our everyday expenses to crypto favored entities, we won't need the dollar. Banks will be forced to become what they were originally built for. To store our valuables, like gold, silver, diamonds. Now, you can't go to Chase to exchange dollars for silver or gold. You can't bring your gold to them to store either. We have become slave to the lender.

# What’s New for Developers 🛠

* [**Chainlink Keepers can now be used on Kovan testnet!**](https://docs.chain.link/docs/kovan-keeper-network-beta)

The Chainlink Keeper network aims to provide options for smart contracts to outsource regular maintenance tasks (harvesting, liquidating, rebase etc) in a trust minimized (decentralized) manner. Check out the documentation and [get started here](https://docs.chain.link/docs/kovan-keeper-network-beta). 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Data Provider Node Oracles**
   * [**Kraken Rates Oracle Node**](https://docs.chain.link/docs/kraken-rates-oracle-node#config)**:** This Chainlink has a dedicated connection to [Kraken's Prices](https://blog.cfbenchmarks.com/rest-api/) API. Note: The Kraken Rates Oracle Node should not be used in place of data.chain.link feeds if there is any TVL on your dapp. The better use of this feed is if you are building a prediction market that needs the price of X at a certain date in time. 
   * [**TheRunDown Oracle Node**](https://docs.chain.link/docs/therundown-oracle-node)**:** TheRundown is the leading platform for real-time odds from the most popular sportsbooks, sports and markets.
   * [**DNS Ownership Oracle**](https://docs.chain.link/docs/dns-ownership-oracle)**:** This oracle checks Google’s DNS service to determine if a given domain is owned by a given blockchain address.
   * [**Tiingo EOD Stock Price Oracle**](https://docs.chain.link/docs/tiingo-eod-stock-price-oracle)**:** Tiingo consists of a data research and analytics arm, a news aggregator, and a professional suite of APIs. With coverage of over 65,000 Equities and ETFs, the Tiingo End of Day Stock Price oracle gives you access to one of the most expansive data sets available for US &amp; Chinese markets. Our stock price data is decentralized across at least 3 data sources on average for each price feed. This means if any one of them goes down, you keep going.
   * [**GeoDB Oracle Node**](https://docs.chain.link/docs/geodb-oracle-node)**:** GeoDB is a decentralized Big Data ecosystem that compensates data providers who share data and makes data affordable and trusted for data consumers. This oracle, given a location, radius around it, and time duration, returns the number of [GeoCash](https://docs.geodb.com/geocash-1/geocash) Users in that area during that time.
   * [**WatchSignals Luxury Watch Price Oracle**](https://docs.chain.link/docs/watchsignals)**:** WatchSignals is the industry leader in market research on luxury watch prices. As a service provided by data-driven platform Zapevo, WatchSignals gathers luxury watch prices from trusted marketplaces, shows serial numbers and collector database information, presents certificates of authenticity, and provides long-term appraisal data. This oracle, given a reference number, returns the average price for a specific model of a luxury watch.

   * It’s an unfortunate reality that scams are widespread in the crypto space. It’s easy for somebody to set up a scam website, spin up a fake “Official Giveaway” social channel, or impersonate a trusted community member. It’s impossible to shut every one of these down in time to have no one be affected. Chainlink advocate, Eric Jaurena, wrote a blog for the general community about common scams, phishing attempts and fundamental principles to follow to stay safe in the wild west of crypto.

personalfinance,Buying a house in a HCOL area,"My wife (28) and I (30) are looking for advice on purchasing a home in a hcol area. For some background, we make $165k a year (also a 15k bonus a year) and are looking for condos or houses in the 550-650k range.
This is a bit above the standard 3x yearly salary range suggestion for how much house to afford. But in our area, there are no options below that price point.
I have 30k in student loans and my wife has 20k in student loans (rates are less than 5%). Besides that we have no other debts. 
We plan to put 10% down for the house. The low interest rates right now is why we are looking to buy sooner rather than waiting and saving more/paying off more student loans first. 
Does buying a house in the near future make sense with our current situation? I would love to hear some thoughts and feedback. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Student loan refinancing. Will I qualify?,"Hello. I recently graduated in December and I am seriously considering refinancing my student loans. I have private loans with discover and Sallie mae. I have roughly 43k in student loan debt with very high interest rates (ranging from 9-11%). Obviously if I could go back, I would work on finding loans with lower interest rates, but I guess I was naive and not worrying about that 4 years ago (dumb of me, I know). I have looked into earnest and put in my information and with a soft inquiry, it gave me a rate of 4.5% on a 15-year repayment plan. I was able to acquire a job and am making around 38k a year. (Job is not salaried, so I have the chance to make more with overtime). My credit score is at 730. My question is, do you think I would qualify for a loan refinance without a co-signer? I am worried that my debt to income ratio and lack of credit history (about 2 and a half years) might restrict me from qualifying at this moment. Any advice would be appreciated! Thank you!",finance
Forex,Dollar Falls As Hopes Dashed,"The Bank of England maintained their policy stance at the latest committee meeting. Currently, the total asset purchasing target stands at 895 billion pounds with the Bank Rate remaining at 0.1%. The choice to leave rates unchanged despite surging bond yields, indicates the bank sees the surge as a rise in optimism, in light of improving growth conditions. 

The Fed maintained an ultra-dovish tone at its latest monetary policy meeting, indicating that rates are unlikely to rise until 2023. Market participants were preparing for a tightening of policy given signs of a faster than expected economic recovery. Despite this, the Fed removed an emergency support measure provided to the banks during the crisis, called the supplementary leverage ratio, which established lower capital requirements. The move is not expected to impact the Treasury market according to Fed officials. Retail sales plummeted 3% in February after climbing almost 8% in the previous month. The fall was unexpected and driven by unusually bad weather, with sales expected to recover in March as a new round of stimulus checks is released by the government. 

China’s two speed recovery appears to be resolving as retail sales figures show a climb of 33.8% in February, when compared with the previous year. A recovery had been largely driven by exports and the industrial sector; however, Lunar New Year celebrations have seen a spike in consumer demand.",finance

We are looking to purchase in the next 18 months and I understand we have a risk of this being a negative investment, but I’m also not sure if even the conservative potential of 10% is worth it on, say, a $2500 profit.

4. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).

19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains.

21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. ~~Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?~~ RETIRED!
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years.
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum). This is one of those nice articles where the British guy pleasantly reads it to you if you want. Use this one to convince all your friends you are the ultimate blockchain expert:  “listen Kyle...the shortcoming of UTXO accounting is....” [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/)

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

79. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months.

personalfinance,Selling and Buying a house... Dump it all into down payment or 20% and invest?,"I'm sorry if this is more suited for /r/investing, please let me know if it's better suited there, but....

My current position:

* Just signed a contract to sell my house for $670k with no concessions
* Owe $395k mortgage.
* Also signed a contract to buy a custom home for $735k, to be delivered in October, calculated with a 3.5% interest rate (i have 800+ credit but who knows where the market will be in 8 months, so [aim high, willis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeiqG5lD5Xk), aim high.)

In the sale of my home, figuring in my agent fees (2.8% to buyer's agent, 1.7% to my agent, bless his heart) as well as title, escrow notary, transfer tax, I should end up pocketing around 90k. Further, I'll be living rent-free, mostly bills-free with a family until November, and should stack an additional 60k or so, so at the time of purchase I should have around 140k over the 20% I plan to put down. I will need a little bit for landscaping and furnishings, but do I pump up my down payment or dump the surplus into a brokerage account? (do note i've already maxed my 401k and ira-&gt;roth, and HSA this year, emergency fund is secured).

So my question, what do I need to know in order to figure out if its a wiser decision to invest that surplus or lower my mortgage amount. I don't plan on selling this new place any time soon (read: several years), but who knows where life leads, right? So, what's the formula here? Is it simply just calculating growth on that investment vs interest paid over the same time, or what?

CryptoCurrency,How to HODL - Nexo Finance Review 2021,"# Overview

[Nexo.io](http://nexo.io/) is a centralised platform similar to BlockFi and Celsius Network where you can deposit cryptocurrencies and also fiat (only Nexo) in return for very healthy and lucrative interest rates. In this short review, I discuss the Nexo model and how it provides the perfect bridge for the average person between the standard financial system we have and the cryptocurrency space.

In order to reach the top rates (not to say the base rates are bad!), you have to hold a certain amount of their native NEXO token and also get your interest paid out in those tokens. But we'll discuss this later.

Nexo boasts some pretty big numbers:

* Up to 12% interest paid out for fiat/stablecoins, up to 8% for crypto
* 18 cryptocurrencies supported
* $5B+ in assets under management
* 1M+ Nexo Users
* Available in 200 jurisdictions
* $375M insurance on all custodial assets

But is it all legit?

How secure are they really?

Can I trust them?

How can they offer such high rates?

## Advantages

Nexo's primary advantage is the interest rates it can offer. Currently speaking, they have just introduced a flexible/fixed term savings model, where you can choose to lock in your assets for an additional rate.

The new crypto rates:

[https:\/\/nexo.io\/blog\/earn-on-crypto-and-fiat-welcomes-high-yield-fixed-terms-option](https://preview.redd.it/4rxij569mko61.png?width=2246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0e6f243ed256a7807aad107ffcd7142dbf4b085)

It's clear to see that these rates comfortably better any of those offered by banks or institutions in the regular financial system.

Next, the ability to deposit fiat (GBP, EUR) is unparalleled for me as a feature on Nexo. I love it. Now you can choose to lock in your fiat for 3 month periods at a time for the premium rates, but at the bare minimum, you can still earn a 4% compounding return!

The new fiat rates:

[https:\/\/nexo.io\/blog\/earn-on-crypto-and-fiat-welcomes-high-yield-fixed-terms-option](https://preview.redd.it/trvsdtvdmko61.png?width=2246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bb7cd7a7e470cf13d0d3068bf29ff8f9d593e10)

## Nexo Token

The NEXO token also provides a lot of benefits for Nexo users. Recently the Nexo team has added governance to the token, so customers will be able to vote on certain proposals, which is great as it means they'll be able to make their voice heard on key decisions.

The token itself also has value, so appreciation of the token price over time is also something to take into account. As the platform grows more and more, the price will only continue to rise.

[Nexo Token Price Movement](https://preview.redd.it/ia212vkpmko61.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87f9dfec96b1b1e719259a4bf5b52d9a6aa53c53)

For reference, competitor Celsius Network's CEL token:

[Celsius Token Price Movement](https://preview.redd.it/1miwp163nko61.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6efc5639058d1d5063e242b832ba2dc35c083b2)

Therefore, you can currently argue the NEXO token is **undervalued**.

Holding NEXO tokens also allows you to receive dividends based on the profits made by Nexo over the year. The dividends vary based on how many and how long you've had your tokens for.

Finally, Nexo also recently launched a $12M buyback program, where they repurchase tokens into an ""Investor Protection Reserve"", visible at this public address:

Nexo also allows you to take loans out against your crypto, and this is primarily how they make their money and sustain their lucrative rates currently. The website below details the stats for how much Nexo is lending month on month since it's inception.

[https://nexostatistics.com/loans/](https://nexostatistics.com/loans/)

Total Loans in 2018 - $19,938,473

Total Loans in 2019 - $132,901,185

Total Loans in 2020 - $722,791,553

But if we look at 2021 already...

January 2021 - $570,787,304

February 2021 - $926,248,722

March 2021 - $134,459,283

Total Loans in 2021 so far - $1,631,495,309

Writing this as of the morning of the 6th March, Nexo's loans for this month have already surpassed the entirety of loans given out in 2019.

The loans in 2021 so far have also surpassed all loans given out in 2018, 2019 and 2020 put together!

But why is this important? The important thing to note is that you can take loans out against your assets on Nexo, i.e collateralising the assets with a Loan-to-Value ratio for each.

**This means that you can essentially use your assets to borrow assets for everyday spending!**

The amount of loans increasing drastically is very bullish for Nexo indeed. Savvy investors getting in early perhaps to take advantage?

There are also other advantages, such as the security they have with BitGo, and there are plans to increase the current insured amount to $1B from $375M. I haven't even touched on the NEXO Card being rolled out in 2021 hopefully, with the ability to earn cashback!

## Disadvantages

Up until recently, Nexo offered free, unlimited withdrawals. Unfortunately, Nexo has now limited the number of withdrawals based on your loyalty level.

The updated withdrawals are: 

[https://nexo.io/blog/update-free-withdrawals-are-back-borrowing-minimums-are-just-50](https://nexo.io/blog/update-free-withdrawals-are-back-borrowing-minimums-are-just-50)

Base - 1 free withdrawal

Silver - 2 free withdrawals

Gold - 3 free withdrawals

Platinum - 5 free withdrawals

Competitor Celsius Network currently still offers free, unlimited withdrawals at the time of speaking.

The reasoning from Nexo was due to the ongoing Ethereum gas fee issue plaguing the entire space. Simply put, the gas fees Nexo was paying out are eating too much into profits, which are ultimately linked to dividends paid out for all NEXO token holders once a year. It may be temporary until EIP-1559 is implemented in July, however the Nexo community is not happy with this decision.

Next, one obvious downside is that you cannot access the highest interest rates without holding the native NEXO token. Despite the benefits of holding the token in my opinion, this can be seen as a negative for some.

Some are also not happy with the new flexible/fixed term system implemented today. Alongside the withdrawal capping, many feel this restricts the movement of their funds even further and they retain less and less control over their assets as well.

And leading on from this, the elephant in the room is communication.

Nexo's biggest flaw for me and many is the way they communicate their decisions with the community. Currently it feels like it is 1 step forward, 2 steps back.

The beginning of AMAs with Antoni Trenchev (Co-Founder) each month was hugely welcomed by all associated with Nexo. However less than a week later, Nexo decided to implement a new flexible/fixed term savings model with no forewarning.

Customers were not given a grace period from which the new change would take place, which led to large amounts of dis-satisfaction on the Nexo Reddit page. It was disappointing to see.

It has been theorised that since Nexo are in the process of acquiring banking licenses in the US and UK. Regulatory bodies may have told them to implement a system where their revenue is more stable. The fixed term deposits means that there is a more stable supply of profit for Nexo in the eyes of regulators. This is definitely plausible, and most customers would've understood. Another possible explanation is that the rates are simply not sustainable as more and more customers jump onto the platform.

In order for Nexo to thrive, this decision may have been necessary. But that doesn't negate the fact that customers should be alerted promptly, not finding out through a forum such as Reddit when the changes are already live on the platform.

Due to this, many people did sell their tokens, and the price briefly took a nose dive before recovering back and stabilising. The best thing would've been to implement the change on the 1st April, with a suitable blog post on the website maybe to explain why the changes were being made.

In future, Nexo can definitely improve on the marketing and communicative procedures before rolling out large scale changes to the platform.

## Personal Experience

I have only been with Nexo since December 2020, so my experience is limited to only a few months. On the whole, the experience thus far has been of a mixed nature. There are some great features on Nexo, such as amazing interest rates for GBP and the token itself. I expect strong growth for the token itself and the Nexo platform in 2021, as demonstrated by the numbers above. However, the poor communication from the team regarding important announcements does not instil trust, and in an industry where there are so many scams prevalent, it only heightens fear in users.

Some features I'd love to see:

1. Ability to view portfolio and account balances in different currencies (GBP, EUR) instead of the standard USD option currently.
2. Address whitelisting for withdrawals to increase security.
3. Implement a standard referral scheme to invite friends and family.
4. Ability to choose whether to take interest in the same currency or NEXO, not either as it is currently is. E.g, receive BTC interest for the BTC deposited, but receive NEXO for the GBP deposited.
5. Increase the speed of the rollout of the NEXO Card for customers.
6. Allow API integration for exchanges/personal finance apps such as YNAB.
7. Provide clear notice of big upcoming changes to the platform.

## Final Word

Best case scenario - NEXO token hits $10 in late 2021 and the platform has reverted back to their [\#FeeFree](https://www.thefiscalstudent.com/home/hashtags/FeeFree) model and also added several new features.

Worst case scenario - Nexo rug-pulls everything and runs for the hills. This is unlikely to happen but still possible unfortunately.

Nexo, similar to the crypto space in general, has strong promise to be a great long-term platform and project however lacks maturity and is experiencing teething problems during this cycle's bull-run.

Only time will tell whether keeping assets on Nexo was worth it or not.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Can I get a Mortgage if I own a company instead of receiving a salary?,"Hi, I am thinking about buying a house. Context:

I am the partial owner of a multi-million dollar company. My brother bought a house years ago, we are still in our 20s so we've shared it since then with my other brother, and it's been really fun, but now I am getting more serious with my girlfriend and I am thinking about buying my own and living there with her. Especially now that interest rates are low, although prices high.

Is this straightforward possible or do I need to put some of my financial papers in order first? Our company is a clearly established LLC with clear percentages between us.

Although the company makes good money we usually re-invest and I usually take out only about 300K per year. Although I have my own personal account, I've usually taken my expenses straight from the company bank. 

Yup, you might be wondering, how can they make millions and not know those basic things: you are right, our ignorance keeps biting us in the ass. So, anyone has an idea here about how to proceed? Thanks very much.",finance

*****

&gt; # 1. Nasdaq futures rise as 10-year Treasury yield retreats

&gt; * The Nasdaq on Monday was set to build on Friday’s nearly 0.8% increase as the 10-year Treasury yield started the new week retreating from last week’s 14-month high. The rapid rise in Treasury yields this year have been pressuring growth stocks, many of them tech names, tech stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500, which lost ground Friday, joined the Nasdaq in negative territory for the week. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 last closed at record highs Wednesday, while the Nasdaq last closed at a record in February.

&gt; # 2. AstraZeneca vaccine found to be 79% effective in U.S. trial

&gt; * AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine was 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness, according to data published Monday from a 32,000-plus person Phase 3 trial in the U.S. The two-shot vaccine also showed a 100% efficacy in preventing severe disease and hospitalization. AstraZeneca plans to file with the FDA for emergency use authorization in April. The U.S. trial data comes as a number of European nations temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine following reports of blood clots. AstraZeneca said in a release Monday that an independent board identified no safety concerns related to its inoculation.

&gt; # 3. Covid cases are rising in 21 states as governors relax restrictions

&gt; * Even as the pace of vaccinations accelerates in the U.S., Covid cases are increasing in 21 states and highly infectious variants are spreading as governors relax restrictions on businesses. Public health officials warn that while roughly 2.5 million people around the country are receiving shots every day, infection levels have plateaued this month. Nationwide, new infections are holding around 54,000 on average in the past seven days. That’s a dramatic drop from January’s peak. While deaths are much lower as well, an average of 1,000 people were still dying from Covid each day over the past seven days.

&gt; # 4. Canadian Pacific Railway to buy Kansas City Southern

&gt; * Canadian Pacific Railway has agreed to buy Kansas City Southern for $25 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. The combination would create the first rail network connecting the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. Following Sunday’s announcement, shares of Kansas City Southern rose about 17% in the premarket, while shares of Canadian Pacific Railway dropped about 2.5%. The deal comes as hopes that U.S.-Mexico trade will pick up now that Joe Biden replaced Donald Trump as U.S. president.

&gt; # 5. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest sees Tesla reaching $3,000 per share by 2025

&gt; * Shares of Tesla rose 4% in Monday’s premarket after Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest made a long-awaited, bold call, projecting the Elon Musk-led electric auto maker would more than quadruple by 2025. Last year, Ark Invest estimated Tesla would hit $1,400 adjusted for its five-for-one stock split by 2024. The firm now sees the stock reaching $3,000 per share by 2025 in its base case, and reaching $4,000 per share in its bull case. Wood’s bear case still sees hit hitting $1,500 by 2025. Tesla, which closed at $654 per share Friday, soared 665% in the past 12 months. However, the stock over the past month and year-to-date hit a rough patch.

personalfinance,Avoiding 401k penalty on early withdraw for home down payment,"Say you had a very large 401k balance, but no liquid assets and wanted to buy a house. I am seeing 2 immediate issues with the withdrawal:

1: Withdraw will be taxable income. No dodging this. So a large withdrawal (say 50k+) would result in getting hammered in higher income brackets. Person in question is already in the 22% bracket, so I assume any withdraw would get hit with 22% or more fed tax alone.

2: early withdraw penalty. This one is less clear and is the main reason for the post. It looks like a hardship withdraw for primary residence is allowed if you don't have other sources of assets. Person in question has a house with some equity in it, but it is unclear if current equity would qualify as 'other sources of assets'.
Additionally, it is also unclear if this would avoid the 10% penalty since from my searches on the IRS, I dont see home purchase as a valid reason for early withdrawal.

This guy I know asked me about the tax implications of large withdraw (I am guessing 100k range) from a 401k to build a house. I know he would have to pay 22%+ fed tax, but unsure if he would have to pay the additional 10% penalty. 

Looking for guidance/links to something that would clearly lay out this situation... lots of dumb online articles that dance around the issue without really setting a conclusion other than 'you may have to pay 10% penalty...'.

What bears don't understand is the very real possibility of bubble recoveries.

Just a few years ago, one currency-related bubble hyped hard and crashed hard.  Guess what?  It's back, folks!

Just a couple of years ago, the pot stock bubble hyped hard and crashed hard.  Guess what?  It's back, folks!

The Tesla and other EV bears are saying that *now* is the time for the stock to crash 80%.

This morning, Cathie Wood gave a $3,000 price target for Tesla (TSLA) to hit by 2025.

Reality is probably in between both of these two arguments.

I think Tesla can hit $3,000 *before* 2025.

I also think that the stock and other hyped EV stocks *will* crash 80% afterwards.

I also think that the stock and other hyped EV stocks will recover and break past pre-crash levels within just a couple of years after their crashes.

Why is that?

Tesla and other hyped EV stocks are not Cisco (CSCO).  They are not up against 6% yields on 10-year US treasuries.  Bond yields have trended downward for decades.  Despite the howling and screaming of conservative bond vigilantes, negative interest rates could come by the time the economy takes the next big hit.

CryptoCurrency,Video shows Interest Rates 30 year History &amp; Why it's good for Crypto,"[Interest Rate Yield Curve over 30 years](https://reddit.com/link/maoffh/video/cbbqcioo6lo61/player)

This video is fascinating. It might be difficult to understand at first so let me try to explain what you're looking at a little bit.

There is a basic theory, that an inverted curve (where the left end points up) is a strong sign that economists have used to predict a coming recession, like what you see in 2000, '06/'07 or '19/'20.

What does an inverted curve mean?

In a nutshell, it means short term interest rates are higher than long term interest rates. (not very common)

Normally, long term bonds should pay a higher rate than short term because you are agreeing to let them hold your money for a longer time and therefore they should have to pay you more for it.

When short term interest rates go up higher it means that people are selling their short term bonds. Which indicates that people are moving their money to longer term bonds/ safer investments in the name of preserving their capital.

Theoretically a healthy yield curve is steep, going up from left to right, showing that investors are buying short term bonds because they are expecting good investment opportunities in the near term.

This is good for crypto markets because it shows that a recession isn't going to happen soon. The yield curve was inverted in late 2019 and early 2020 and we saw the Covid happen which propelled us into a recession (black Thursday).

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Inverted line bad, steep line good. The current curve is mostly neutral right now. This isn't bad news for crypto. It may be good news for crypto because we aren't on the edge of an inverted curve like we were before the Covid pandemic started last year. Now with the fed pumping massive money into the economy, it seems that assets outside of fiat are going to be worth holding until inflation comes down.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin is 'more a substitute for gold than the dollar' — Fed Chair Powell,,cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Biweekly vs monthly mortgage with different interest rate offered by bank,"Hello. I need some input. I’m applying for a mortgage with a bank and they are offering 3.25 interest on a traditional 30 year fixed mortgage or
3.125 on a biweekly payment schedule.

This is for a loan of 268,000. 
Difference is 18.29 per month, 219.48 per year or 26,906 over the course of the loan.
Biweekly will pay off the loan in 26 years and 4 months vs 30 with the monthly loan. 

This is for a coop in nyc and my first purchase and I don’t see myself living here for 30 years. 

It makes sense in my mind to set an automatic payment and do the biweekly because I’m getting a lower interest rate. 
Pros and cons for each?

investing,JP MORGAN May Soon Turn Away Deposits from Institutions,"Article from Bloomberg.  

You don’t need to feel too sorry for Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest in the world by trading and fee revenue. But it’s easy to see why he might be miffed at the Federal Reserve at the moment. 

On March 19, the Fed [announced](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm) that a temporary regulatory break for banks will expire as scheduled on March 31. Dimon had told investment analysts in January that if the break went away, his bank would have a financial incentive to turn away deposits, as it has done in the past (for large institutional deposits, that is; the bank still likes retail deposits, which tend to be sticky and produce other banking business).

Here’s a snippet from the Jan. 15 earnings call as I transcribed it from Bloomberg’s recording:

*Dimon*  
*Remember, we were able to reduce deposits $200 billion within like months last time.*

*Jennifer Piepszak, chief financial officer*  
*Yeah.*

*Dimon*  
*But we don't want to do it. It’s very customer unfriendly to say, “Please take your deposits elsewhere ….”*

It’s common for Jamie Dimon to complain about “gold-plated” banking regulation, but in this case he seems to have a point. A Fed regulation that makes it unprofitable for banks to take in deposits—when taking in deposits has always been a key function of banks—is a bit hard to justify.

How we got to this point is complicated but interesting. The old style of bank regulation was to limit the leverage of banks. It was analogous to how banks themselves require homebuyers to have some skin in the game. Homebuyers have to put in some of their own money so the mortgage loan  they get is smaller than the value of the house they’re purchasing. That way if the homeowner stops making payments, the bank can seize the house, sell it, and get back what it lent. Similarly, under simple leverage regulation, banks had to show that the value of their assets (such as the loans they make and cash in the vault) was substantially greater than their liabilities (such as the deposits they take in, which is money they owe to the depositors). Roughly speaking, the excess of assets over liabilities was called capital.

But that simple system failed. Banks can make more money by going big on risky assets like high-interest loans than by investing in safe, low-yielding stuff like Treasury securities. And as long as regulators treated all assets alike, it made sense to load up on risky ones. But risky assets are more likely to go bust, so regulators wisely started taking the safety of different assets into account. It was a big improvement but not perfect: Some banks understated the riskiness of their assets, which became a problem in the global financial crisis of 2008-09. For instance, some banks loaded up on the debt of their national governments because it was given a zero risk-weighting, when in fact it was highly risky.

The new system is belt and suspenders. The belt is risk-weighted capital regulation, under which riskier assets require a bank to have more capital against them, while very safe assets require little or none. There’s also a backup system—the suspenders—where all assets are treated alike, just as in the old days. This is called the supplementary leverage ratio. It was agreed to by a wide range of nations under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements and took effect in 2018. The SLR is meant to deal with situations where a bank has loads of assets that aren’t as safe as they’re said to be.

The suspenders are supposed to hang loose most of the time while the belt does the real work of holding up the pants, so to speak. In last year’s Covid-19 recession, though, banks suddenly got flooded with more assets than they could handle. The Fed bought Treasuries to drive down interest rates and paid for them by creating reserves, which show up as assets on banks’ balance sheets. Businesses drew down lines of credit and deposited the proceeds in banks. Consumers’ bank accounts were swollen by government relief checks. Demand for consumer and business loans was weak so banks stashed most of the incoming money in Treasury securities or left it in cash. (Funds from customers are both an asset to the bank, because they can invest the money, and a liability, because they have to return it some day.) 

Suddenly the suspenders weren’t so loose anymore. Without even trying, banks had acquired a lot more assets on their balance sheet. Most were super-safe, but the supplementary leverage ratio applied equally to every dollar of them, regardless of their safety.   


Realizing there was a problem, the Federal Reserve and other federal bank regulators in May 2020 exempted Treasuries and reserves at the Fed from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio. Not permanently, but through March 31, 2021. It said the exemption “will provide flexibility to certain depository institutions to expand their balance sheets in order to provide credit to households and businesses in light of the challenges arising from the coronavirus response.”

This year banks lobbied vigorously for the exemption to be extended or even made permanent but, as mentioned above, on March 19 the Fed said without explanation that the exemption would end at the end of this month.

What happens now? Nothing right away. Banks have more capital than they need so they won’t have to shed assets starting April 1. Zoltan Pozsar, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote in a [note](https://plus.credit-suisse.com/rpc4/ravDocView?docid=V7qjPE2AN-VHSK) to clients on March 16, ahead of the Fed announcement, that “Neither the Fed nor the market should fear mayhem if the exemption expires.” One key reason, he said, is that the major banks won’t be affected by the expiring exemption because they never opted into it in the first place for their operating subsidiaries. And, he wrote, 90% of the currently exempt Treasuries and Fed reserves are being held at the operating subsidiary level. 

In the longer run, though, there could be problems. Pozsar wasn’t quite as blithe when he discussed the supplementary leverage ratio on the Odd Lots podcast [aired](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2021-03-03/zoltan-pozsar-on-what-just-happened-in-treasuries-podcast?sref=AMvrlaMu) by Bloomberg on March 3. If banks like JPMorgan Chase push away institutional deposits by charging fees or putting on negative interest rates, the money will spill into money market funds, he predicted. But money market funds won’t have any good place to put the money either, he said. If they pour into Treasury bills, they could push the bill yields negative. But money market funds can’t afford to earn negative returns because they promise to pay back investors 100 cents on the dollar.

Pozsar said the Fed system could assist by allowing money market funds to stash more money with it through overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York did just that two weeks later, [announcing](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/opolicy/operating_policy_210317) on March 17 that it would allow each of its counterparties to do overnight reverse repos of $80 billion a day, up from $30 billion previously. Pozsar, who used to work for the New York Fed, [called](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-17/powell-stays-silent-on-extending-fed-s-capital-relief-for-banks?sref=AMvrlaMu) that “foaming the runway” for the March 31 expiration of the supplementary leverage ratio exemption.

In 2014, when the supplementary leverage ratio was under discussion, Fed staff predicted \[[PDF](https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/open-board-meeting-transcript-20140409.pdf)\] that the impact of the enhanced version of the ratio on the biggest banks would be modest because, after all, the Fed was about to start shrinking its balance sheet. In reality the balance sheet is bigger than ever now and still growing. As the Fed continues to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds and pays for them with reserves, banks’ assets will continue to swell and eventually the supplementary leverage ratio could become the “binding constraint” on the banks’ behavior; the suspenders will become tight. That would be a return to the bad old days. 

Some of the resistance to keeping the leverage exemption in place past March 31 is based on concerns that banks need bigger safety buffers. That’s a legitimate concern. But the question of how much capital banks need is separate from the question of how those capital levels should be determined. There area actually four ways of setting capital—risk-weighted capital, supplementary leverage ratio, post-stress estimate of risk-weighted capital, and post-stress estimate of supplementary leverage ratio. That ends up causing confusion and treating banks differently when they’re engaged in the same activities.

It’s “not clear you can fix the gaming of one rule by adding more rules,” says a 2017 presentation \[[PDF](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/6a_stein.pdf)\] by Robin Greenwood, Sam Hanson, Jeremy Stein, and Adi Sunderam of Harvard University and the National Bureau of Economic Research for a *Brookings Papers on Economic Activity* conference. Their preference: A single standard that takes into account stressful scenarios and is “generally more sensitive to the kinds of data that you wouldn’t want to bake into a hard rule.”

The Fed may end up having more to say about this.",finance

In getting a seller's permit, apparently I also got a ""Sales &amp; Use tax"" account. Because this account was created, Wisconsin expects me to make an annual sales tax return. I didn't know this. I didn't think I had to do anything because eBay and Facebook already collects sales tax.

So now I have a bill from the Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue for $651.66 ($500 estimated tax + $6.66 at 18% interest/year + $125 25% negligence penalty + $20 late filing fee).

Bitcoin,Bitcoin tied to USD vs Gold/Silver,"We all know that one of the biggest advantages to crypto currency is stability (in theory) because the currency can't be created from thin air and devalue the wealth of savers.

With this are we seeing manipulating of bitcoin as a result?

In my opinion a bitcoin/gold or bitcoin/silver index could be helpful as it would tie bitcoin to something with intrinsic value as opposed to paper money.  With that said I'm sure there is huge manipulating going on in both of those markets as well. I think we can all agree that some sort of reset where a digital dollar will be pushed upon us is coming. My fear is it being tied to nothing of real value once again so it can be manipulated for another 100 years.  Any thoughts on this?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Should I leave my current job for a 50% raise, but less time off and an unknown workplace culture?","Hi PF,

Throwaway account due to personal info.

I \[29 M\] am an early-career professional working at an NGO research institute in a MCOL+ area. I have been working here for \~1 year since graduating with my master’s degree (earth sciences). Needless to say, despite generally being satisfied with my job, it has been a challenging time to move to a new place and start working with a new team. In this position, I have occasionally struggled with the isolation of remote work, but more so have been overwhelmed by the pervasive academic culture in which people live and breathe their research (and work very long hours). I enjoy my work, but I am not a PhD scientist (which limits my opportunities here) and have other interests in the world besides research. Anyways, because of these reasons, I started casually looking for new opportunities a few months back, including with the federal government and in the private sector. I have received offers within both sectors, but due to location preferences at the moment (not wanting to move right now), I have decided to either stay at my current employer or find a position locally, probably in the private sector.

Today I received the first job offer that I am seriously considering. It is with a consulting group that is quite specialized and does the type of work I am interested in (and doing now) though it may be less exciting and certainly less novel than what I do now. However, it pays very well for the field and my experience level. Though excited by this opportunity, I also feel conflicted and am concerned that I’m falling prey to visions of greener pastures that may not actually be greener- and stepping into an equally as work-oriented group of people. I know I have it good now, but I really feel like the research institute workplace environment (where I am now) is not for me, particularly without a PhD. 

Here are my details:

**Current Job**    

* **Salary: mid-$50,000/year** (increasing to mid/upper-$60,000 in another year)
* **Time off:** 20 days (increasing to **25 days** one year from now); 9 holidays
* **Sick time:** 20 days
* **401k match:** 10%
* **Parental leave:** 3 months

**New Job Offer**

* **Salary:** **mid-$80,000** (\~50% raise!)
* **Time off:** 15 days; 10 holidays
* **Sick time:** None
* **401k match:** 2% (after 2 year vesting period)
* **Parental leave:** None
* **Other:** 100% Employer paid premiums

First off, the pay bump for the new position is huge. I was expecting an offer of $75k- and was really taken aback by their offer. Due to personal circumstances, namely my longtime girlfriend \[28 F\] going back to school and other life goals, this pay raise is very appealing. Also, a 50% raise feels ridiculous to turn down. However, I also really value a good work-life balance and time off, particularly because we don’t live near either of our families but enjoy spending time with both of them. I worry I am trading my flexible work schedule now (lots of PTO- especially after one more year) for a larger salary but less personal time and more deadline pressure (it is consulting after all...) all the while doing work that is likely less interesting than what I do now (though maybe less stressful).  I am hopeful a post-COVID hybrid work schedule in this new position could allow for temporary weeks-long remote work stints allowing for summer visits to family many states away (TBD), despite only having three weeks of vacation time.

Here are my other important financial details:

* **401K:** $20,000
* **Roth IRA:** $40,000
* **Taxable Investments:** $150,000 (I will admit, this is in BTC- but is the ""house’s money"" at this point)
* **Emergency Fund:** $5,000
* **Federal Student Loans**: $27,000
* **Partner's finances:** My GF does not have any appreciable retirement savings but does have $30k set aside for an e-fund/grad school

In all likelihood, my partner and I will probably get married in 2022-2023, and hopefully buy a house thereafter, and kids are definitely happening somewhere after that. I feel like the pay raise now would allow us to aggressively increase our rate of savings in the near-term for goals such as a wedding, a house down payment, and retirement. We are comfortable living well below our means, and saving now ahead of other life commitments (kids) feels all the more important- particularly because my partner will likely enter the workforce with a low starting salary ($40-50k), and not for another two years due to grad school. She may have some student loans ($10-20k) on the other side- but maybe not thanks to family generosity.

Longer-term, I could imagine working with this consulting group and socking it away for 2-5+ years (maybe longer!) before deciding to move closer to family and finding a less demanding job (maybe with the gov’t) that gives me greater life flexibility. But being able to max out a 401k etc. for 5 years and have a 20-30 year time horizon for compound interest to do it's magic could really set us up nicely before re-centering family.

What does the PF magic eight ball say?

**TL;DR**

Should I stay at my current job or take a new job for more money? I make $55k-ish now with 20 days of vacation, 20 days of sick time, and other amazing benefits, but I don’t enjoy the workplace research culture and feel that long-term opportunities are limited. I received a job offer today at a consulting firm doing similar work with more growth potential, though it may be less exciting work. The salary is a significant 50% raise ($85k-ish), but with less PTO (15 days) and fewer benefits- and an unknown workplace culture that could still place value on workaholics.",finance

Inspired by the fact that biological creatures attend to multiple modalities at the same time, DeepMind releases its new Perceiver model. Based on the Transformer architecture, the Perceiver makes no assumptions on the modality of the input data and also solves the long-standing quadratic bottleneck problem. This is achieved by having a latent low-dimensional Transformer, where the input data is fed multiple times via cross-attention. The Perceiver's weights can also be shared across layers, making it very similar to an RNN. Perceivers achieve competitive performance on ImageNet and state-of-the-art on other modalities, all while making no architectural adjustments to input data.

Why WOOD? 

* Exposure to companies that produce forest products, agricultural products, and paper and packaging products.
* Targeted access to timber &amp; forestry stocks from around the world
* Use to express a global sector view
* Directly affected by lumber futures

Why not lumber futures? 

* Lumber futures have never attracted the level of volume and OI for a successful futures contract. I have traded various futures ranging from agricultural to energy and lumber is a nightmare for liquidity. You'd buy and be stuck in your position essentially so opening a position in the WOOD ETF is a much safer bet. 

Now that we have the ""Whys"" out of the way, let's get into a brief discussion on lumber markets.

As the work environment has changed to remote and people are leaving urban areas, we are seeing a demand spike for new homes which is increasing the requirements for wood. 
   * Record low interest rates are providing support for new construction and existing homes. We also know that Jerome ""Print Money, Honey"" Powell is taking us into the low interest rate promise land until 2023. 
* Home Improvement and Mill Closures
   * Obviously people are spending more time on projects at home given they are at home more often these days. Sales at Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) have pushed both companies to record highs in late 2020. This trend will continue into the Spring as people look to add onto their homes outside with the better weather.
   * Lumber mills across the country, and even Canada, have closed down or limited production of wood products since Q42020. Increased demand and very low supply levels have created a perfect storm for bullish lumber futures. 
* Market Sentiment
   * Admittedly, I am going to be in this play because I am a direct end user of pallets. I am constantly being updated, sometimes daily but definitely weekly, on the price of lumber. Some of the quotes from the supplier are as follows:
      * ""We are going to get to a point where it's not about the price we/you are going to have to pay, it's going to be about can we even buy it - regardless of the price we/you have to pay."" - March 5, 2021
      * ""White hot demand and nothing to buy. It's not a matter of price at this point. The market is a runaway freight train. Not much else I can say"" - March 12, 2021
      * ""Wish we had better news to deliver but this market is something no one has seen before. My opinion is we will see prices in this range for 90 days, AT LEAST"" - March 21, 2021
      * ""At this point, would plan on this tight supply and high pricing to stand for at least 90 days as I see little hope for relief and demand is extremely strong. Where is additional supply even going to come from?? Very concerned"" - March 22, 2021

Continued Catalysts for Lumber Futures

* Agricultural season is starting up in California which will push demand up even more. California accounts for almost 14% of cash receipts in the US for agriculture. They have a LOT of demand for lumber via pallets. 
* Mills continue to struggle with inventory levels on tight supply. Given that a good portion of mills have closed down with no plans to reopen until COVID is settled, I continue to see issues on the supply side.
* Mills have strong order files through end of April and feel little pressure to discount prices at this point. Current pricing makes it difficult to ""stock up"" on inventory due to credit restraints so it's forcing people to continue to step in on a weekly basis to cover their needs as orders/business comes their way. This keeps buyers going back to the mills to purchase which enables mills to hold their price as material continues to be gobbled up. It's a VICIOUS cycle. 
* Improved weather will cause more people to purchase lumber as they begin Spring/Summer projects.
* Infrastructure rebuilding under Biden Administration. 

Bearish Case:

* My primary bear case is based on the rollout of COVID vaccines which would allow for a return to a more normal lifestyle. The vaccine could lead to a slowdown in housing construction and demand. Those who have been vaccinated could move or stay in cities where steel is the dominant choice for construction. 
* US &amp; Canadian Mills that have shutdown due to COVID start to come online which would add a large supply to the market. This would completely kill my thesis.

I wish I would have taken a position back in November 2020 when the writing was on the wall but I think there is still juice left to squeeze based on market conditions. Potential upside would be \~30% over the course of 4-6 months. It could go higher but that is a conservative estimate.

personalfinance,Refinancing Advice,"I am considering refinancing my home. My current loan is 55k, with an interest rate of 10.9% over 21 years. I have lived in the home for 2 years and my credit score has increased a great deal since living here (currently 757).

Some other pertinent information, I live in a manufactured home. We own the land our home is situated on, we have city water and a septic system.

I have gotten a quote from a company who says that I need to hire an engineer to come out and assess my porches since they are bolted to frame of my house. They said I also need to have someone come out to assess my septic system, which could costs thousands in fees to have someone come out.

Is this considered part of the closing fees? Is this standard for a refinance? I would be saving, $130 per. month with a new rate of ~3.75% interest. I would just like to hear from others who have been in this situation before. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",finance

stocks,Tomorrow's bond auction,"Good article below on potential paths for this week's bond auction.

Pro: poor situation in Europe will increase demand for the bonds, lowering yield

Con: removal of bank SLR rule will lower banks interest in purchasing bonds, lowering demand from banks, increasing yield

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on what will happen? Article from the street:

&amp;#x200B;

U.S. Treasury yields ticked lower Monday, providing early support for tech stocks that could extend throughout the week as the government looks to unload nearly $330 billion in new debt onto a cautious and unsteady bond market.

&amp;#x200B;

Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired the country's central bank chief, Naci Agba, over the weekend, just days after he had approved an 200 basis point interest rate hike designed to blunt the impact of inflation in the struggling economy. 

&amp;#x200B;

""The new political interference from Erdogan, who has long railed against hiking interest rates because he thinks they cause inflation, send the lira into a tailspin on fears that international investors will pull their money from the country on concerns of new rate cuts the would undermine the orthodox “'bitter medicine' of further interest rate hikes to stabilize and strengthen the currency,"" said Saxo Bank strategists. ""The country is already low on reserves and could, in extremis have to implement capital controls if capital flight, whether domestic or foreign, becomes a deepening problem.""

&amp;#x200B;

The move sent the Turkish lira down 15% against the U.S. dollar, the steepest decline in nearly three years, and triggered a rush to safe-have assets in Europe and elsewhere, including U.S. Treasury bonds, with benchmark 10-year notes falling to 1.68% from the 1.75% peak, the highest since January 2020, they reached during the height of last -week's sell off.

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, much of what Governor Agba said with respect to rate hikes -- which he linked to shift in global investor appetite, loose central bank policies around the world, rising commodity prices and near-term inflation risks -- are concerns that have triggered the longest rise in U.S. Treasury bond yields in eight years and corresponding pullback in tech and growth stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

Further upward pressure followed last week when the Federal Reserve, fresh off its March policy meeting that pledge to keep rates at record lows for at least the next two years -- even as the economy looks set to grow at its fastest pace since 1984 -- ended a capital break for domestic banks that could lead to further Treasury bond sales, and thus higher yields, in the months ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally, that would have investors exceedingly nervous heading into a hectic week of bond auctions, which includes a $60 billion sale of benchmark 2-year notes on Tuesday and another $62 billion in 7-year notes on Thursday, as inflation signals hot up and deficit hawks renew their criticisms of the Biden Administration's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Act.

&amp;#x200B;

Turkey's brewing currency crisis, however, alongside the sputtering vaccine rollout efforts in Europe that are likely to delay the region's post-pandemic re-opening, are likely to boost demand from international investors for the U.S. assets on sale this week, keeping prices high and borrowing costs low.

&amp;#x200B;

A $38 billion sale of benchmark 10-year notes earlier this month, in fact, drew solid international demand, with foreign investors taking up 57% of the overall total. 

&amp;#x200B;

That said, analysts at JPMorgan caution that the Fed's removal of the SLR benefit, just as primary dealers are likely needed to take-up a greater share of the $209 billion in coupon paper on sale this week, could lead to another leg higher in Treasury yields -- and corresponding pressures on U.S. stocks -- in the days ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

""While valuations are supportive of increased demand from foreign investors ... foreign demand alone is unlikely to stabilize Treasury yields,"" JPMorgan said. ""Moreover, over the very near term, liquidity conditions lend upside risk to yields ahead of (this) week’s supply process.""",finance
CryptoCurrency,What you need to know about Decentralized Finance (DeFi),"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kyaxvk1wgmo61.jpg?width=1728&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abae97caa7ab3061563dc9244998936e1ec74c10

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone,

After my post on Inflation and Cryptocurrency, I received a lot of requests asking me to analyze other areas of the Crypto market. I figured that I would tackle Decentralized Finance and the two major areas of crypto functionality within DeFi.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?**

The internet isn't any one thing, its a beautiful and incredibly elaborate series of connections between servers. Everything on the internet needs to be stored somewhere, traditionally that meant stored either on a personal computer, a personal server, or as a small part of a massive server farm hosted by a tech company. The issue with this setup is that the owner of the server, if left unrestricted, can determine exactly what is hosted on their hardware. This fear of potential and real censorship has led the push towards a decentralized internet hosted on a trustless foundation. A system that is secure.

This idea has spread throughout the niches of the internet economy. The target of the system is decentralized finance, or how to commodify the internet to allow for a decentralized flow of money.  There are two main areas that this overlays with crypto, the first, like Bitcoin, a currency, is primarily an asset, the second, like Ethereum, is primarily a platform for functionality.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jbpafpnenlo61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bbf11f05e009be7dd05a4aa9a9ef698a4bef61e

Before we get started, let me quickly run-through some factors that I used to determine the Fundamental Analysis and subsequent Technical Analysis.

**Fundamental Analysis:**

Fundamental Analysis is attempting to put an accurate price on a item based upon an objective calculation of its worth. This is normally a nebulous number that roughly correlates to its in-kind purchase power if transferred to a universally traded currency. It answers the question of, given the ability to buy its competitors, what is the value of this good in a fair market setting. Fundamental Analysis generally seeks to answer whether the current price is overvalued or undervalued.

Some Fundamental Analysis include:

* Market Cap:
   * Current Price x number of coins
* 24 hour Trading Volume:
   * How much coin is being exchanged
* Inflation Rate:
   * How many new coins are likely to be introduced

Best sources for Fundamental Analysis data: [https://research.binance.com/en/projects](https://research.binance.com/en/projects)

**Technical Analysis:**

Technical Analysis is to Fundamental Analysis as a crystal ball is to a NYSE ticker quote. Technical Analysis is the attempt to predict the market value of an item given all the outside factors that influence it. A technical analysis is generally done when historic numbers are used to predict future trends. Correlation analysis, candlestick patterns, and social media references are ways analysts assess a coins technicals. Technical analysis generally seeks to predict the future price of a coin.

&amp;#x200B;

**The White Paper**

This, often overlooked, gem is the thesis behind the coin. This is the coin's reason for being and the market space that it intends on owning. A coin with an undefined white paper is a coin with an undefined answer, namely to the question, what makes you so special?

It contains:

* The type of system
   * POS, POW, etc
* The coin's answer the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (how a coin proofs consensus of trust in an imperfect environment)
* Tokenomics of the coin
   * How coins can be received or distributed
* The coin's ""why?""

**Valuation and Bubbles**

A bubble can occur when there is a deviation between the Fundamental Analysis, what something should be worth based upon its own merits, and the Technical Analysis, where the market places the item's worth based upon outside factors. The idea of a bubble occurring is driven largely by projected future value and real future value. Both types of analysis seek to explain the market evaluation of an item.

A quick word on bubbles and bitcoins. This hits on tokenomics, or the inherent value of the coin based on its function as a store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange. A coin's risk can be determined by its degree of usability, valuations, inflation rate of the coin, information surrounding the design team, and volume of fees (indicating a rough level of willingness for people to trade coin for other currency).

**Two major System Types:**

**Proof of Work (POW):** The basis for traditional Cryptocurrency, where a complex equation is solved, providing the equation solver with a unit of currency. The currency gains intrinsic value through the value of the expended energy used to complete the equation. Thus, the tie between energy and currency allows the valuation of the currency.

Examples: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH)

Pros:

* The first, and most tested, way to ensure decentralized control over a currency.
* POW provides incentives for miners to behave well and creates a system to settle transactions.

Cons:

* The process wastes resources, which is unscalable with the current dominance of fossil fuels in our energy production.
* The transaction time increases as the system seeks to prevent against double spending through verifying against “double spending”
* Subject to 51% attacks\*
   * Miners can technically control 51% of the currencies computational value
* This allows them to effectively re-write node history and secure bitcoins from other miners, controlling supply

**Proof of Stake (POS):** The newer version of POW, favoring efficiency over whole-chain verification. Ouroboro’s Genesis-based POS relies on actors providing collateral to verify reduction of tradable coins in the marketplace. Traditionally, verification was performed through a reduced version of POW, where a portion of the blockchain is recorded and used to verify that the owners had not spent the stake. A second method of verification involves creating a lag time between when the currency being un-staked and the ability to spend the coins.

Examples: Zilliqa (ZIL), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT)

Pros:

* More environmentally friendly
* Reduces latency when compared to POW
* The required code to obtain the currency can be dynamic, allowing for scalable security

Cons:

* Environmental pollution, latency, and security varies by the coins design
* No consensus on how the system is verified
* Requires users to trust the system as a whole and does not allow for selecting verifiers

&amp;#x200B;

So lets get to it:

**The industry leader:**

**Ethereum (ETH) - March 22**

Functionality: **DeFi Platform**

Network: **Ethereum**

Cryptocurrency: **Ether**

Market Cap:  **$203.87B**

* 115.15 million out of No specified Limit

Transaction Count:  **1.21M**

Average 24 hour transaction fee: $[**16.07**](https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum)

Tech: **Proof of Work (ETH). Proof of Stake (ETH 2.0)**

Oversite: Decentralized

&amp;#x200B;

Ethereum is the prototypical alt coin. Second only in Market Cap to Bitcoin, but with an amazingly versatile and proven functionality that bridges the gap between currency and utility. It was launched as a type of global computer that allows platforms to build upon it, utilizing its computational capacity for their business functionality. It was made to scale the blockchain technology, and its done a great job so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Utilizing smart contract technology that triggers when the outlined terms are met, ETH's smart contract functions as a decentralized broker that eliminates the need for traditional financial middlemen.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

* Gradually shifting to ETH 2.0
* Much of current DeFi system is based upon Ethereum network
* Does not have a similar DeFi coin that can compete in adoptability
   * Offhandedly referred to as the ""worlds computer"" due to its ubiquity in its market
* Strong backing from institutions
* Proof of concept and proof of team

Cons:

* Incredibly high fees when compared to competing POS coins
* Scalability issues with ETH 1.0
   * ETH 2.0 fixes this with the shift to POS
* Low Latency
   * Due to the limited number of transactions allowed per second the system is bottlenecked
      * ETH 2.0 fixes this by expanding
* Skepticism regarding its ability to shift to POS
   * Upgrading is more difficult than creating from scratch due to transition time and ecosystem

&amp;#x200B;

**The competition:**

**Ripple (XRP) - March 22**

Functionality: **Currency (Unit of exchange)**

Network: **Ripple**

Cryptocurrency: **Ripple**

Market Cap:  [25.3 B](https://www.coinbase.com/price/xrp)

* 45,000,000,000 in circulation out of Hard Cap of 100,000,000,000

Transactions:

* Transaction Count:  **1.11M**
* Average 24 hour transaction fee  $[0.000609](https://www.coindesk.com/price/xrp)

Tech:  XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol

Oversite: Centralized by Ripple

&amp;#x200B;

Ripple was founded 2004 by Ryan Fugger. Ripple Protocol, outlined in [Ripple’s 2018 Whitepaper](https://ripple.com/files/ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdf), describes its model for using the Byzantine Agreement system in conjunction with decentralized trust.

XRP was started by the folks at Ripple, and finished through open source collaboration. As a coin, XRP does not achieve a traditional system wide consensus and is instead powered by a ledger based consensus. These ledgers are, in part, managed by the company itself through their [verification system](https://ripple.com/xrp/). Ripple has done a commendable job diversifying their ledger owners, referred to as Unique Node Lists(UNL). Ripple has an extensive [list of partners](https://ripple.com/customers/) who have adopted their tech, and are growing at an impressive rate. XRP supports a number of functionalities including: Payment channels, escrows, deposit authorizations, a decentralized exchange, amendments, and invariant checking.

Pros:

* Oldest coin between the three ETH competitors
* Managed by a team that has successfully transitioned to a new whitepaper
* The system does not require system wide-consensus, allowing for lower latency
* Developed within an ecosystem that is currently growing

Cons:

* Master list system for node selection does not give XRL owners full control of their trusted nodes, unlike XLM
* Attached to the Ripple scandal, and a for-profit company
* Similar in benefits to XLM, but lacks extra security features seen through the FBA

&amp;#x200B;

**Stellar Lumens (XLM) - March 22**

Functionality: **Currency (Unit of exchange)**

Network: **Stellar**

Cryptocurrency: **Lumens**

Market Cap:  [9.09 B](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/)

* **22,648,880,607** in circulation out of Hard Cap of  **50,001,806,812**

Transactions:

* Transaction Count:   **4.49M**
* Average 24 hour transaction fee **$0.000013**

Tech:  Stellar Consensus Protocol

Oversite: Decentralized nodes

&amp;#x200B;

Stellar, was founded by Jed McCaleb, a co-founder of an earlier coin, Ripple. The Stellar White-Paper explains the reasoning for the currency and the market gap it seeks to fill. Stellar seeks to create a word wide financial network, ensured through a Stellar consensus protocol (SCP) built around a decentralized trust model called the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). Through implementing its decentralized trust model, SCP, the Stellar system seeks to ensure:

* Decentralized Control
   * No gatekeeping or barrier to entry for consensus
* Low latency
   * Faster processing through spreading work over decentralized nodes
* Flexible Trust
   * User determined nodes, providing security based upon users predetermined trusted nodes.
* Asymptotic Security
   * Flexible digital signatures and hash families allowing for scaling for security

Technicals:

Unlike competitors, XLM seeks to fix POW’s latency, trust, and security problems through their SCP model. It’s worth noting that XLM’s SCP model was built before [Ouroboro’s Genesis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243848).

XLM allows individual users to select trusted nodes, separating them from Ripple’s earlier attempt to create master sheets with trusted nodes. Rather than individually selected by users, the master sheets employed by ripple ended up transferring the byzantine system of authority from ripple to the sheet owners, leading to sheet owners maintaining control over the term “trusted nodes” within Ripple.

The XLM model diverges from the decentralize admission Ripple attempted in an important way, rather than relying master node lists that are editable, FBA relies on a consensus between decentralized nodes. Turning different nodes into individual owner’s elected officials that verify transactions for them. Thereby allowing for a decentralized consensus along with all the benefits of the Byzantine Agreement. This change, according to XLM, allows their model to create the decentralized consensus that achieves their goals of decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security.

Pros:

* Its tech is consumer focused and better (regarding fees and latency) than current market leaders BTC and RPL
* Highest transaction count of all coins surveyed
* Historic ties to ADA and similar functionality *may* indicate an undervaluation of the currency

Cons:

* Smaller market cap to XRP, paired with historic growth ties to XRP may make relative growth more difficult, leading to relative real growth losses to XRP
* Its tech puts the security onus on the owner
* Smallest exchange $ volume of the coins surveyed
   * May indicate growth is more retail than enterprise

**Cardano (ADA) - March 22**

Functionality: **DeFi Platform**

Network: **Cardano**

Cryptocurrency: **Cardano**

Market Cap: **32.62**

* **31,948,309,441**  in circulation out of Hard Cap of  **45,000,000,000**

Transactions:

Tech: Stellar Consensus Protocol

Oversite: Decentralized nodes

&amp;#x200B;

Cardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of Ethereum, and was launched in 2017. The main goal of Cardano was to solve Bitcoin’s speed and rigidity, while also addressing Caradano’s stated issues with Ethereum’s scalability and safety.

Technicals:

Cardano, unlike Bitcoin, uses a Proof of Stake (POS) rather than Proof of Work (POW). This difference rewards the first rather than the most powerful, a system known as [Ouroboros Genesis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243848), where miners can rejoin their chain and continue where they ended. The goal of POS through Ouroboros was to reduce the amount of energy needed compared to BTC and ETH, which both use POW.

Secondly, like ETH’s ecosystem, the second layer of the Cardano is a layer similar to ETH, enabling using the system for smart contracts and applications. Cardano’s POS and computation layer, when combined, offer the benefits of BTC’s security and ETH’s functionality.

Pros:

* POS tech that connects security, reduced latency, efficiency, and scalability
* Not reliant on ETH's current market
   * Target market is [developing world friendly](https://why.cardano.org/en/introduction/what-it-the-point-of-all-of-it/)
* Similar to ETH, ADA has a secondary layer to its code allowing for it to function as a software platform
* You can end staking whenever you like, with no end period
* Likelihood that ADA will be completed before ETH 2.0 is fully implemented

Cons:

* Viability after proposed ETH 2.0 in question
   * Considering the adoption of ETH, and its proven value, ADA is unlikely to unseat
* Historic tie between ADA:XLM:XRP *may* indicate an overvaluation
* Number of transactions is smaller when compared to ETH

**Final Thoughts**

World Computer:

DeFi has a lot of room for multiple coins. The current enterprise space is littered with blockchain tech supported by the largest tech giants. Unlike ETH, these ecosystems are unlikely to be as secure and are limited by the security of its founder. This security also comes in the form of potential censorship, either by the company or through regulation.

For this reason, its likely that the blockchain functionality through a decentralized currency has real utility. In that light, the functionality allowed through the adoption of ETH and ADA is here to stay. Between the two, there is enough space to support both coins, especially as the ADA model seeks to promote exchanges in developing countries. However, the transition to ETH 2.0 presents an incredible opportunity to reduce ETH's marketshare. ADA's superior latency and fees, paired with its proposed functionality will make ETH's competition market share based. The release of ADA's second tier is likely to come before ETH 2.0 is fully implemented. The impending switch to the POS model will likely keep many ETH users on the ETH network, but the high fees may cause newer adopters to prefer ADA's system.

Either way, ETH has something that ADA does not, a fully functioning system, while ADA does not have a scalability problem and is likely to arrive on market as a full POS. They are both likely to increase in value, as neither coin is the other's Deus Ex Machina.

&amp;#x200B;

Currency:

In regards to utility, Ripple and Stellar are likely to continue their battle as a secondary exchange. Ripple, with their recent scandals attached to their network, has an uphill battle to regain trust. Stellar has the advantage in number of transactions, which can largely be attributed to the reduced fee structure. XRP, while supported by Ripple, is not a humanitarian effort, and the efforts to commercialize the coin has landed them in hot water with the FEC.

Ripple's profit seeking nature gives it a higher likelihood of price growth, as they have little incentive to act in the best interest of the system as a whole. Stellar, while a non-profit, is more likely to seek out adoption regardless of the price. This lack of accountability to Ripple owners gives Stellar the ability to plan long term and sacrifice short term gains for long term strategy.

Between the two currencies, I foresee a split in effectiveness. XRP will most likely bring the most profit from holding in the short term. The adoption rate of XLM will continue to surpass XRP and will eventually allow for continued compounded growth. The latency and reduced fees of XLM will entice retail investors, while XRP, over the long term, will most likely attempt another white paper pivot towards hosting on its functionality rather than facilitating exchange.

personalfinance,Can I create a ROTH IRA account? and should I even contribute?,"For context, I'm a college student (will graduate this year). I know that you can only contribute to a Roth IRA on earned income. I  have a part time job right now that pays $500 a month ($6000 a year), and will have a internship this summer that will net about $11,000 after taxes (while still working the part time job). Is it legal for me to open up an Roth IRA account?

I'm looking into opening one with Vanguard or Charles Schwab.

If so, is it even wise for me to invest in one right now? or should I keep padding up my savings?

Budget: $500/month

Taxes: I put about $75 a month away for taxes (they're not automatically taken out, I will pay a lump sum come tax time).

Donations: $50

which leaves about $375/month for expenses.  I have literally no other expenses (live at home), so I could easily save about $275 of that money a month.

But is it even worth contributing to a Roth IRA right now (assuming that I can?)

I will have a little under $20k in student loans once I graduate (all federal), and about $6,000 in savings right now. I'm going into a pretty nice paying field, so I should land a job that will allow me to pay off those loans aggressively and I plan to live at home.

personalfinance,"18 months into home ownership and we’ve decided we have to sell, but haven’t decided when. Trying to take everything into consideration.","We are a foreign family living in America. In December 2019 we bought a single family home (20% down) in a suburb with the intent we would spend about 3-5 years here. With covid-19 everything with work has switched to virtual and we have found out that it will remain virtual permanently. This means we don’t even need to be in the USA any longer for me to work, and the whole family wants to go back to our home country.

Our house, which was walking distance to everything (we have kids and can’t drive), is now walking distance to a ton of closed businesses, and as a germaphobe with a minor heart complication and currently unqualified to get a vaccine, I won’t be going to the mall or the playground any time in at least the next year.

We are set up to return in December (easy to push back later) and have people who we can stay with here, so we can sell the house at any point in the next 6 months, but want to try to make the best decision as to when to sell.

A few things we are taking into consideration right now:

1. In October it will be 2 years, I understand the tax will be lower

2. We paid $600,000 for the house, our exact model (it’s a planned neighborhood, there’s only 5 or 6 models) had sold twice since December, for $725,000 and $730,000. There’s nothing available in town right now and a line of people waiting to make offers.

3. I understand interest rate has just gone up, and the moratorium on evictions is lifted in July.

The decision ultimately is, do we sell the place right now and potentially pay more tax, (no idea how much more it would be though), or wait until October and run the risk of a price drop, and is there anything I’m failing to consider.",finance

Bitcoin,Bitcoin discussion by FED Chairman and Euro Central Bankers,"[https://youtu.be/d8pRg1xBrjc](https://youtu.be/d8pRg1xBrjc)

I found this video discussion very interesting. My 7 takeaways are:

 

1. The FED and Euro Central Bankers are **not at all concerned** about Bitcoin being used as a gold substitute or store of value. They would only be concerned if it was used for everyday payments.
2.  Global Stablecoins (Libra) will be ""subject to the highest level of regulatory oversight"". ie, will probably never get off the ground.
3.  It is not currently legal in USA or Eurozone for the FED/central bank to issue a CBDC - it would need a law change.
4.  All major central banks are working on CBDCs. The FED is intentionally going slow. They see no need to be first.
5.  The FED thinks it is holding the free world together due to its management of the USD. (hubris extremis) 
6.  The Euro banker guy made the point that a stable coin (eg USDT/tether say) is only safe/secure/riskless if/when it is backed 100% by the sovereign currency, so when/if the original currency becomes programmable via a CBDC, then the utility of the original stable coin reduces. (this misses the point completely to my mind, especially since any future CBDC is likely to be pretty retarded) 
7.  I love it when FED Chairperson Powell says ""bitcoin is highly volatile, and therefore not really useful as a store of value"". lol.  I think the bitcoin owners sitting on USD$1Trillion of volatile wealth might somewhat disagree.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 22, 2021","Stocks rose on Monday, following a volatile week, with technology stocks leading the pack looking to reclaim lost ground. After leading the market higher in 2020, tech stocks have largely been under pressure following a sharp rise in Treasury yields. Banks, industrials, and other reopening stock underperformed, giving back some recent gains, but looking ahead, we expect the rotation out of tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks to continue as the economy continues to gradually open back up.

After jumping to one-year highs last week, the 10 year Treasury yield retreated to hover slightly below 1.7% (1.68% at the time of writing). The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores the increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher last year and into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from economic reopening. The energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&amp;P 500, outperforming tech and growth stocks in 2021. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Last week, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. 

Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds.”

personalfinance,Financing a toy,"I typically have a personal rule where I don’t finance my toys(typically motorcycles) but I came across something that caught my eye. I don’t have the money for it out of pocket and not sure that I want to pass it up since it’s a pretty good deal. 

The toy I’m talking about is a car. The specific car is a 2005 lotus that has a salvage title. Car things aside I’m asking about opinions on financing a toy. [Here’s about what my budget looks like as I sit right now.](https://imgur.com/DRknN8E) All expenses are over estimated and anything I’d be earning is underestimated. So realistically this is worst case. I’m not driving near as much as I would without COVID either so plenty of expenses are quire low. I just paid off my student loans so my savings is pretty low but I have $2.5k in a vacation fund and another $3k in a savings. I know that I have the stimulus still coming my way as well as $2.5k in tax returns and a signing bonus of $5k minus taxes. 

The car is listed at $25k. With $5k(possibly more) down and a 48 month payment at 4%(guess on personal loan 740 ish credit) monthly payments would be $452 according to a loan calculator. I think I can put more down and will maybe get better than 4%(not entirely sure haven’t done any loans besides student loans). Is this an unreasonable thing to seek out? 

My daily driver is an older car that just keeps running and I have no reason to replace it right now. It’s honestly paid for itself in company mileage. I would keep both cars as well as a motorcycle on my insurance. I have the means to fix things myself and keep expenses low on it. I was looking at a newer car to replace that but I kind of like it. 

I plan to keep budgeting as I currently do and probably throwing extra at this loan to pay it off quicker. I’m maxing out my Roth and 401k company match and right now not paying my leftover federal student loan since it’s at 0%(loan is only $5k) so I’m keeping more of my paycheck than shown right now. 

I have plenty of budget space left over for anything that pops up. Realistically I should be working on building a better buffer savings but I’m going to continue to build on that as time goes on. Why else is this a horrible idea that I shouldn’t do? 

P.S. not sure exactly what to flare as so let me know if I should change.",finance

personalfinance,ETF's vs Paying of PMI,"I bought a home in September 2019 for $55,000 (FHA loan 3.5% down) with a PMI payment of $31.12 a month. I have enough money in savings to make a lump sum mortgage payment of $8826.61 to remove the PMI from my mortgage payment. I have determined that I would need only an ROI of 4.23% on my $8826.61 to make more than $31.12 a month in returns. However, this does not consider the principal reduction on the mortgage itself (3.875% interest rate). Does this mean that I am actually paying an effective interest rate of 8.105% on the $8826.61 of my mortgage? In this case I think I would be better off removing the PMI payment from my mortgage than investing in ETF's. 

The remaining total balance of the loan is $51,726.61. I also have a three month emergency fund and a stable job throughout the pandemic.",finance

We live in OC, CA. Around the 10:30PM this last Saturday, my wife, who was 10 weeks pregnant, started to have a miscarriage and the pain for her was unbearable. So like any loving husband who hates seeing their significant other in that much pain, I took her in to the nearest emergency room. It was sort of an intense situation and I didn't have time to check whether we ended with an out of network doctor for the visit but 16 hours later, a couple IV bags, bloodwork, and a ultra sound later, we're out of the hospital. At this point, its starting to set in that we might be getting a large bill because I couldn't locate the doctor on the paper work in our Cigna PPO network. I think the idea of ""networks"" is really fucked up but that's beside the point.

What are my options at this point? Will they allow a payment plan with a low interest rate?

I already feel like this is going to be a shitload of debt that we won't be able to dig ourselves out of.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the support. It is much appreciated. My wife is doing fine health-wise but will need time to heal emotionally.

CryptoCurrency,How are stablecoins financially feasible and sustainable?,"While I understand how normal cryptocurrencies work, I am struggling to wrap my head around stable coins. For instance, take USDC and the consortium managing it. Clearly, this consortium is not the FED, so they cannot just mint new USDC, given that 1 USDC must always be backed by 1 USD in their reserves. But I am struggling to understand who finances the whole thing.


Imagine there are 100 USDC on the market backed by 100 USD. Since USDCs have to be backed 1-1 by USD, if I own 1 USDC I can go up to the consortium and ask them to convert it into 1 USD (that is, I sell them my 1 USDC for 1 USD). The consortium will be out of 1 USD, and they won’t be able to resell that 1 USDC, since it would not be backed by 1 USD (there are 100 USDC but only 99 USD). The only option is then to “destroy” it, and we’re then left with 99 USD and 99 USDC. This process is repeated until there are no more USDC, and the consortium has depleted its USD reserves. What kind of investor would then want to finance the USDC consortium? I know they are audited and all, so I imagine I am getting something wrong with the whole convertibility thing and I would really appreciate if someone could shed light on it. Thanks!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Passive income bump has opened up bucket list/life opportunities,"I got a decent bump in passive income (VA disability) recently. It is now $1,679 per month (was $879). This has opened up a few pathways to complete some bucket list/life goals I've been wanting to do. Because of the raise in disability, I'm living well under my means now, which means I can throw money to my car, school, save it, spend it, etc. Just a little unsure which order to do it in as far as finances go.

There are four things I would like to do:

1- Pay off my car as fast as humanly possible. Payoff amount is $17,887. 31 months left on the loan with 8.7% interest rate. Monthly payments are $468. I could afford to pay twice the payment monthly (and more if I was a hermit...which I'm totally ok with).

2- Buy a used van/camper with cash and take a year long road trip while I live off my disability. To be able to afford this, paying the car off is a must. The road trip would be going to and hiking/camping in most of the major National Parks in the US (minus Alaska and Hawaii).

3- Hike the Appalachian Trail. My thought was to do the road trip and end it near the southern terminus and start the hike right away.

4- Finish school. I have an AA and would only need to take 4-6 semesters of school to get a bachelors.

I'm looking for some general advice, for someone to give me a good reason to do them in a specific order, or maybe point out something I have overlooked or misjudged. I have a good job now and think if I told them about the road trip/trail they'd hire me back on after I was done. I rent an apartment. I could do things together like take online courses while being a nomad (if that's possible). Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,CareCredit (Synchrony) how are payments applied?,"I have a CareCredit account I used to partially finance my ""who rescued who?"" main guy's chemo (RIP), and since then I used it to remove some growths from my rescue mutt one of which had ulcerated (benign thank the deities). Before anyone jumps on me for it, it was an ""any port in the storm"" situation, I know the interest rate sucks, blah blah. I'm paying it off (from maxed out to 50% of my available balance in a year, not the best but not the worst).

I'm paying significantly (2x+) more than the minimum.

I wasn't able to get all of my guy's chemo paid off in the promotional periods (which were all six months, and kept adding up faster than I could pay them down), so I have a balance  to which interest is applied every month.

My mutt's growths incurred two charges, one for about $400 for lab work etc with a 6 month promotional period, and about $1,000 for the surgery and biopsy (1 year no interest).

I can't make heads or tails from the statements how my payments are being applied. Like, say I pay $300. If you subtract interest (will the first bit of the payment go 100% to the monthly incurred interest?), the remaining balances aren't reduced by the remaining amount of the payment.

The first of the mutt's promotional amounts dropped off a couple of months ago (paid); the second is hanging around with $800 or so still due. The promo period expires in November; it may be a silly game, but I just want to make sure I'm paying enough monthly so that, at least on that most recent purchase, I don't end up paying any interest. (Yeah, I'd love to pay it off entirely, or always pay say $1000/month, but I wouldn't have financed medical care for my dogs if that was something I could just do ...)

Anyone know the formula(e) that determines how payments are applied in a mixed promo/non-promo/interest scenario like this?

\*\*Edit:\*\* Looking at my own ledger, the balance is going down by exactly $payment - $interest every month, so it does appear they're paying the interest-accrued-that-month first, then applying the rest of the payment to the balance. Now, if I could only figure out how they're allocating that ""rest of the payment"" (how much to the promotional amount, vs. the ""regular"" balance)...",finance

Yes - Fiat holdings are guaranteed to lose value, Bitcoin is sound money, therefore I want to hold my cash in sound money. This is where the idea of ""not holding fiat"" comes from.

However, does this ONLY refer to not holding fiat in a savings account? Or does this extend to investments in assets usually denominated in fiat.

For example, if I am holding a portfolio of stocks worth X dollars, is this still ""saving in fiat"" according to the Bitcoin community?

Or, does ""holding fiat"" exclusively mean cash in a checking/savings account? (Or maybe holding bonds as well since the real interest rates on those things are also crap?)",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Tax Refund Help,"I believe that I am not getting the full refund that I should but I can't figure out what to do about it. I have very simple taxes, no dependents, investments (other than 401k), mortgage, large donations, etc.  Therefore, I do my taxes myself for free through TurboTax or FreeTaxUSA.

My 2017 refund was $1,325 federal, for 2018 it was $264, for 2019 I owed $24.  I have not filed for 2020 yet but TurboTax says $230 (I have gone through all the steps just not filed). I have had the same job since November 2017 just making a few thousand more each year.

I input all my information into the IRA tax withholding estimator which tells me my refund for next year should be $2,017. I expect to make a few thousand more this year than last but that shouldn't result in such a huge difference in refund.

Is this worth having a professional do my taxes, at least so they can explain to me exactly why I get whatever refund I get?",finance

personalfinance,"How ""bad"" in putting down less than 20% on a home really?","**How ""bad"" is\* putting down less than 20% on a home really?**

Wife and I have had a plan to wait 3-5 more years to buy a home with 20% down and are currently renting. We'd rather not wait, but we can if it makes sense financially.

However, both sides of our family think we're bonkers to not buy ASAP with 5% down and stop ""wasting"" money on rent. Had a couple lucky family members' homes double in value over the last 4-6 years.

Considering PMI and the higher interest rate it looks like we would pay an extra $120k-$140k over the life of the 30yr mortgage if we were to buy with 5% down vs 20%. Are we overthinking it? Is that peanuts? Doesn't feel like peanuts.

They're even suggesting we borrow against our retirement accounts. Which seems like a big ""no"" to me.

Hard to feel confident on a plan when it's coming at us from both sides... so why not listen to the advice of internet strangers? :P

Possibly relevant info:

* We have a 6 month e-fund we won't dip into for home purchase
* We plan on living in the same area, rent or buy, for at least the next 10-15 years
* First baby on the way
* We're slightly behind on retirement savings and prioritizing that. Which is why we need as much as 5 yrs to save for the 20% down payment.

Appreciate any feedback.

Edit:

* 5% down will be about $2200/month - could do it if we sacrifice retirement contribution a bit.
* 20% down will be about $1600/month - Likely wouldn't need to cut back on retirement savings.
* The above accounts for mortgage, home insurance, PMI, tax, HOA, and about 1% annual maintenance costs. Kind of a salad, but it's what I have in front of me if that's useful.
* My wife does not have a reliable income. So we do rely almost exclusively on one income. Bit more of a risk.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone for commenting!

My conclusion is that we should try to accelerate our buying plans. Maybe get something in 2-3 years at 10% rather than waiting the full 5 for 20%. It sounds like PMI is more manageable than I originally thought. There also seems to be a concern for us waiting too long and seeing properties appreciate faster than our savings. 10% looks like a sweet spot for dropping PMI faster and getting lower interest rate while still not sacrificing our retirement savings too much.",finance

Bitcoin,New Login To Old Exchanges,"Prior note:  I have tried contacting the owners of the places I can't enter anymore.  They haven't answered in the past three days.  So, ""contact tech support"" is not helpful.

When I started messing with Bitcoin, I got on Coinbase like everyone else.  Built up to the highest tier of tradering and everything.  When Gemini came along, I figured what the heck and tried to join there too.  By this point, 2-factor authorization was a thing.

So, I got Authy and thought I set it up for Coinbase.  Before that, their computer called me whenever I logged in.  I say, ""I thought,"" because I can't find evidence of it now.

Meanwhile, I found it impossible to meet all the Gemini requirements.  Roughly 2018.  I had a username and password, and I get codes fed into Authy, but I was never able to reach the trading floor.

This week, I decided to see who I could still connect with besides Kraken.  Coinbase's 2FA recovery utterly failed in every configuration.  I get that Authy has been supplanted, but the SMS and phone recovery methods don't work either.  Texts don't arrive, calls don't come through, there's no code I can find to convert to Authenticator.

Gemini is worse.  I put in user name and password, and it responds that the account is closed.  It was never open!  I still get the code in my Authy, but never have a chance to enter it.

Security is nice, but I'd like to be able to buy and sell if I want without sending a wire transfer to Kraken.  (Nothing against Kraken; I'd just rather not pay $16-30 per transaction, or have to find time to go to the bank to set things up.)

personalfinance,First time home loan,"So I am looking into getting my first home (in Iowa) and I have options in my financing. I am completely unaware of anything in this area and am looking for some help.

I have been preapproved through a couple lenders and am not sure where to go with all of this.

First lenders pre approval:

First mortgage                   $49,360.00  (30 year at 4.5%)

Second mortgage             $12,340.00  (15 year at 4.75%)

Housing expense             $543.77 total both loans w/ taxes and insurance

Amount due at closing estimated at $30.88.

95% option

First mortgage                   $58,615.00 (30 year at 3.125%)

Down payment                 $3085.00

Housing expense             $480.00 (payment w/ MI insurance)

Amount due at closing estimated at $3115.88

Second lenders pre approval:

Interest rate is 3.00% as of right now.  Your projected monthly payment would be about $470, and estimated closing costs are $2,000. Subject to PMI. LTV - 96.921%

\~3k take home monthly. I do have some money to put down and am willing to put money down if that makes the most sense. If I could make sure I have enough to furnish a new home comfortably once purchased, that would be amazing as well. I also don't know about how the insurance and any other monthly costs will add up. The home I am looking at is in a 100 year flood zone.

I am just looking for some sort of clue into which way to lean and which one will keep my monthly out of pocket as low as possible while getting myself the best deal.

Any advice in this would be greatly appreciated as I'm looking forward to this big step into adulthood (finally).",finance

My hold up is worrying about not having enough savings in case something happens, such as an issue with my job (they've given no indication - its just that I'm new to it and have some doubts) or anything having to do with Covid. It may be strange to consider the savings issue because I'd still have around $8000 if I were to pay it off. I'm not saving for anything in particular, and at my current rate I'd be able to get back to $15,000+ in savings by end of June this year. As I'm typing this the answer does seem obvious but I'd still like some opinions. My only other debt would be student loans, and I do have monthly rent and all related bills.

Salary: $80,000 (before taxes)

Savings: About $15,000

Amount left on car loan: About $6900

Interest rate on car loan: 9.49% (yeah I know)

* I had made a larger payment in the past so the next payment due shows as June 2022.

personalfinance,Does it make sense in any circumstance to borrow from my Roth 401k for a bigger mortgage down payment?,"My Financial Picture:

* Monthly Take Home Pay: $3,600
* Debts: $0 (Paid off car and student loans)
* Roth 401k: $91,000
* HSA: $5,000
* Cash Saved For Down Payment: $70,000

Fiancee's Financial Picture:

* Gross Income: $65,000
* Monthly Take Home Pay: $3,200
* Debts: $6k student loans remaining (car paid)
* Roth IRA: $15,000
* 401k: $25,000
* Cash Saved For Down Payment: $15,000

Currently we are renting for $1,600 per month. I'm 32 years old, 4 years into my current tech career, and expecting some further income growth. We would like to be able to have a child, possibly just one, and still be able to travel.

So we are looking to buy and start our calculation with a monthly take home pay of $6,800. Assuming 3.1% interest rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage, if we budget 25% for monthly housing payment, that's $1,700 monthly which equates to a loan amount (price of house - 20% downpayment) of $400,000. However we would then be $15,000 short of the 20% down payment that we would like to make.

Does it make sense, in that circumstance, for me to borrow $15,000 from my Roth 401k in order for us to buy a house that, 1) is in a great neighborhood with lots of young families that is walkable to downtown and will continue appreciate in value, 2) has enough space that we can live comfortably in it for years to come, 3) lock in a great rate now on a home that we want to be in long term.

Does this approach make sense to take, or would it be better for us to keep renting and to save longer, or target a more affordable neighborhood which is further from downtown? I'm expecting the neighborhoods we like to continue appreciating quickly, and what if interest rates increase? Are there pitfalls that I am not considering here, or any traps to fall into?

Thanks so much in advance for your time and patiently explained advice. I'm a first gen college grad and first time home buyer, so I don't have much familiarity with this process and how to optimally strategize for our future.",finance

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

Also, there’s now a video version available for anyone interested: [https://youtu.be/TWHgKhxH9Sg](https://youtu.be/TWHgKhxH9Sg)

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. We are starting to see cracks in the psychological armor of the Ethereum crowd.  This anti-Cardano post was at 0 upvotes (at time of writing) while the fairly pro-Cardano response received triple figure upvotes.

2. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).

42. Novogratz follows up that he’s bearish for now but will jump on a call with Charles next week. [https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1370482108553105408](https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1370482108553105408)
43. Apparently the first $1200 stimulus check if invested in ADA would be $44,800 now.  [https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1369426234883645443/photo/1](https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1369426234883645443/photo/1)

45. Cardano uses a tiny fraction of the energy some other top-ten blockchains use.   This factoid alone should allow you to hook up with eco-obsessed nature people. [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875)

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

63. We get another People of Input Output Global video.  This one features Dan Friedman. He currently lives in Japan.  But, the interview starts off with some very interesting stories about his youth in 1980s Kiev, Ukraine.  His speaking and story-telling style is similar to the captain in a 1990s buddy cop movie (in a good way). Very interesting and compelling guy.

70. Perceptions are shifting on which platform will be #1 for smart contracts over the next decade. Here’s the biggest crypto youtuber asking his co-host if he’s losing faith in the traditional #1.

74. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity. He specifically mentioned Atala Prism. There was talk of the digital identity being able to be linked to wallets, payment systems, and property. He also reasserted that the deals on the table in Africa would bring “millions of users” into the Cardano ecosystem.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8)

79. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo)

90. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-tuesday-march-23.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. S&amp;P 500 set to drop on anniversary of stock bull market

&gt; * U.S. stock futures dropped Tuesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 broke two-session losing streaks. The Nasdaq logged a second straight session of gains, recovering about half of Thursday’s 3% decline. Tech stocks benefited over the past two sessions from the 10-year Treasury yield retreating from last week’s 14-month high. Tuesday marks one year since the Covid low in the stock market, which ended the fastest bear market ever and ushered in another bull market. The S&amp;P 500 has gained 76% since the March 23, 2020 close of 2,237. Over the past year, two presidents, Congress and the Federal Reserve put extraordinary fiscal and monetary policies in place to support the economy during the pandemic.

*****

&gt; # 2. Yellen, Powell to testify on Capitol Hill on economic recovery

&gt; * Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testify Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee on the economy at 12 p.m. ET. Yellen, who was Powell’s predecessor, said she sees both growth and possibly full employment next year. She credits President Joe Biden’s Covid relief package. For his part, Powell’s prepared remarks struck a cautiously optimism tone, saying the economy is “much improved” but the recovery is “far from complete.” Last week, after its March meeting, the Fed forecasted higher growth and inflation, while saying interest rates will likely remain near zero through 2023.

*****

&gt; # 3. U.S. officials: AstraZeneca may have included outdated data

&gt; * An independent group of U.S. health advisors said Tuesday that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information in its Covid vaccine trial results. The questions came one day after the U.K. drug maker said a late-stage trial in U.S. and in Latin America showed 79% efficacy for its two-shot regimen. The Data Safety Monitoring Board expressed concern about whether the material provided by AstraZeneca created an “incomplete view of the efficacy data.” AstraZeneca, which said Monday it planned to file for FDA emergency use authorization next month, did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

*****

&gt; # 4. Covid cases rise in parts of U.S. as some states relax restrictions

&gt; * New Covid cases are once again on the rise across more than half of the U.S., as health officials warn about reopening too soon and race to vaccinate more people before highly contagious strains become prevalent in the country. As of Sunday, the seven-day average of new cases rose by 5% or more in 27 states, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Across the U.S., the nation logged an average of 54,308 new cases per day over the past week, a 1% rise from the prior week after months of rapidly declining case numbers.

*****

&gt; # 5. Biden considers $3 trillion package for infrastructure

&gt; * Biden is assembling the next big White House priority, a $3 trillion infrastructure package. That would be on top of his recently signed $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus. The president met privately late Monday with Senate Democrats as Congress has already begun laying the groundwork with legislation for developing roads, hospitals and green energy systems as part of Biden’s “Build Back Better” campaign promise. While the goal is a bipartisan package, Democrats in Congress have signaled a willingness to go it alone if they’re blocked by Republicans.

personalfinance,Need help with which loan option to take,"I basically got 3 offers from main mortgage lender(i did shop around):

1. ARM5/6   2.5%

2. Pay 1 point (\~6k) for 3% fixed 30

3. No point for 3.25 fixed 30

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing 2 to 3 i ""save money"" after \~3 years if i choose 2 and roughly 30k. If i use 1 i could save tens thousands before the 6 year mark for the ARM. Even assuming normal conditions the new rate shouldnt be higher than 5 from recent trends. So worse case scenario is i pay 2.5% for 6 years then 5% for 24 years which would make me lose more money.

Another caveat is ARM can only have 60 days lock and the house i am moving in wont be done in \~august so the ARM rate may be higher or more expensive then....

In terms of long term planning, I would like to get a SFH in the future and 10 year mark would be ideal so ARM \*may\* be a good choice if I sell it. But if i rent it out then i was told i either need to bite whatever the interest rate comes or refinance into investment home or something....

The ones who established this correlation wanted more options to trade on based on the fluctuation of one or the other.

Bitcoin was created to get away from this kind of manipulation and price is purely based on the LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND and not the price of the 10 yr. that those in money want.

personalfinance,Transitioning a windfall into a solid FIRE plan -- should I seek a CFP?,"Throwaway here.

This year, my net worth increased substantially (+4MM after estimated taxes) from selling assets and running a business. The business may stop operating sometime within a year or so. I'm in my late 30s and want to explore planning into a FIRE lifestyle.

I already have a few brokerage accounts setup with index funds that I arbitrarily picked out many years ago. I have an HSA that I've been contributing to. I have some company retirement accounts. I'm single and still live at home.  


Some of the goals are:

\-to gain a modest passive income (4-5+%)

\-convert retirement plan options from a company 401(k) and SEP-IRA into a single consolidated individual account type

\-explore tax savings strategies

\-become a home owner in another state

\-retire within a year or so  


I've been reading the FAQ on and off as a starting point. I have some negligible knowledge on the topics in this subreddit and do have time to research more.

I don't want to burden my company's CPA with excessive personal finance questions or put him into a role he's not comfortable with.

As I understand, all CFP's are fiduciaries but will some be more of a sales person to push certain funds over others? I would want someone who is charging for their time by the hour and would be more valuable than my own time to research. I was looking at both local and out of state CFPs and was going to try a few consultations to gauge things. I think it might be best to for the CFP to be in the state I plan to move to, but I'm not sure if I even need one.

Basically, I'm hoping to find someone to take in the state of affairs of my financial situation, along with my goals and expectations, and basically guide me into a plan of what sorts of things I should be doing to adjust my overall financial plan. I also want to plan for death, but I suppose that would be another topic.

It would be nice to have someone to go to if I build a passive house, for example. There would likely be some federal incentives and whatnot to factor into my taxes. I think a regular CPA would be aware of these things though.  


And if I didn't go with a CFP, I would just do this:

More research into the retirement account types and discover how to consolidate them. Determine which retirement account vehicle would be most applicable for my unearned income situation. Plan out an updated portfolio that is less riskier but still affords an average 4-5% in income that I could draw out and pay the taxes on to live with.

Seek out a personal CPA for annual tax filings. Find a personal lawyer for misc. items like a will and life things that may come up.

Anyway, thank you all in advance. I'm going to keep reading and chugging along.",finance

MachineLearning,[D] Advanced Takeaways from fast.ai book,"I recently read the Fast AI deep learning [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50204643-deep-learning-for-coders-with-fastai-and-pytorch) and wanted to summarise some of the many advanced takeaways &amp; tricks I got from it.  I’m going to leave out the basic things because there’s enough posts about them, i’m just focusing on what I found new or special in the book.

I’ve also put the insights into a [deck](https://saveall.ai/shared/deck/140&amp;4&amp;3K3uXPazkg4) on save all to help you remember them over the long-term. I would **massively recommend using a spaced repetition app (video** [**explanation**](https://youtu.be/AD0aFdRCskQ)**) like anki or** [**save all**](https://saveall.ai/) **for the things you learn** otherwise you’ll just forget so much of what is important. Here’s the takeaways:

# Neural Network Training Fundamentals

* Always **start** an ML project by **producing simple baselines**
   * If is binary classification then could even be as simple as predicting the most common class in the training dataset
   * Other baselines: linear regression, random forest, boosting etc…
* Then you can **use your baseline to clean your data** by looking at the datapoints it gets most incorrect and checking to see if they are actually classified correctly in the data
* In general you can also **leverage your baselines** to **help debug** your models
   * e.g. if you make your neural network 1 layer then it should be able to match the performance of a linear regression baseline, if it doesn’t then you have a bug!
   * e.g. if adding a feature improves the performance of linear regression then it should probably also improve the performance of your neural net unless you have a bug!
* Hyperparameter optimisation can help a bit (especially for the learning rate) but in general there are default hyperparameters that can do quite well and so **closely** **optimising the hyperparameters should be one of the last things you try** rather than the first
* **If you know something** about the problem then try to **inject it as an inductive bias into the training process**
   * e.g. if some of your features are related in a sequential way then incorporate them into training separately using an RNN
   * e.g. if you know the output should only be between -3 and 3 then use sigmoid to design the final layer so that it forces the output of the network to be in this range

# Transfer Learning

* Always use transfer learning if you can by finding a model pre-trained for a similar task and then fine-tune that model for your particular task
   * e.g. see [huggingface](http://huggingface.co/) for help with this in NLP
* **Gradual unfreezing** and **discriminative learning rates** work well when fine-tuning a transfer learned model
   * **Gradual unfreezing** = freeze earlier layers and **train the later layers only**, then **gradually unfreeze** the earlier layers one by one
   * **Discriminative learning rates** = having **different learning rates per layer of your network** (usually **earlier** **layers** have **smaller learning rates** than later layers)

# Tricks to Deal with Overfitting

* **Best way** to deal with **overfitting** is by getting **more data**. **Exhaust this first** before you start regularising with other methods
* **Data augmentation** is really powerful and now possible with text as well as images:
   * **Image** data augmentation -  crop, pad, squish and resize images
   * **Text** data augmentation - negate words, replace words with similes, perturb word embeddings (nice github [repo](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) for this)
* **Mixup regularisation** = create new data by averaging together training datapoints
* **Backwards training (NLP only):** train an additional separate model that is **fed text backwards** and then **average the outputs** of your two models to get your final prediction

# Other Tricks to Improve Performance

* **Test time augmentation** = at test time, use the **average prediction** from many **augmented versions of the input** as your prediction rather than just the prediction from the true input
* **1 cycle training** = when you increase and reduce the learning rate throughout training in a circular fashion (usually makes a **huge difference)**
* **Learning rate finder algorithm** = algorithm that Fast AI provide to help you automatically discover roughly the best learning rate
* **Never use one-hot encodings,** use **embeddings** instead, even in **tabular data**!
* Using **AdamW** instead of **Adam** can help a little bit
* **Lower precision training** can help and on [pytorch lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) is just a simple flag you can set
* For **regression problems** if you know the **output should be within a range** then its good to use **sigmoid** to force the neural net output to be within this range
   * I.e. make the network output:  min\_value + sigmoid(output) \* (max\_value - min\_value)
* **Clustering** your features can help you **identify which ones are the most redundant** and then removing the can help performance
* **Label smoothing** = use 0.1 and 0.9 instead of 0 and 1 for label targets (can smoothen training)
* **Don’t dichotomise** your data, if your output is continuous then its better to train the network to predict continuous values rather than turning it into a classification problem
* **Progressive resizing** = train model on smaller resolution images first, then increase resolution gradually (can speed up training a lot)
* Strategically using **bottleneck layers** to force the network to form **more compact representations of the data** at different points can be helpful
* Try using **skip connections** as they can help smooth out the loss surface

personalfinance,Cash v. very low APR financing for car--which is better?,"The internet PF people are very strong on the position that borrowing money to buy a car is a terrible idea. Some articles refer to it as the one thing standing in the way of your wealth, and recommend buying a car outright with savings and then committing the saved car payment to investment.

I certainly see the logic of that but it seems to assume the following: (1) car loans charge high interest rates, so you're paying a ton to the lender; and (2) you're doing this to buy a car you couldn't otherwise afford.

But what about this: You're interested in a car that costs $35k. You have the savings to comfortably afford buying it outright. But you're also offered low (0.9%) or zero percent financing by the seller (or to be more accurate, by the finance arm of the car manufacturer). 

In this situation, it's less obvious to me that it's better to pay cash up front. It almost seems like the car company is getting the worse end of the deal. Especially at 0% but even at .9%, over the course of four or five years the buyer gets to use the capital to invest that they'd otherwise have forked over to the car company's finance arm. Looked at another way, this is basically just paying off the car in installments over 4-5 years, so you get to take advantage of the time-adjusted value of money.

This also assumes you do something smart with the saved payment. For example, if you put it away at 5% and then just pay off the car for no or trivial interest, aren't you making an arbitrage of 4% or so?

Debt 1: $7500 @ 5% ($250/month payment) 
Debt 2: $22000 @ 4.3% ($280/month payment) 
Debt 3: $13500 @ 6% ($350/month payment) 

Paying high interest first will squish a lot of Debt 3, which is great, and will reduce nicely the amount going to interest each month. However, I also feel like I see a substantial case for paying off Debt 1 in full, and instantly being able to throw more money at Debts 2/3. Debt 2 doesn't seem like the smartest in any school of thought.

investing,"Boston Federal Reserve, MIT to release digital dollar prototypes as soon as July","# Federal Reserve’s Digital Dollar Push Worries Wall Street

The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.

Wall Street is not thrilled.

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research &amp; Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&amp;#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&amp;#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

Bitcoin,Wall Street banks diverge in views on bitcoin boom -- FT,"Link: [https://www.ft.com/content/c3cb412e-e2b1-4837-a092-bcbc3eda81a1](https://www.ft.com/content/c3cb412e-e2b1-4837-a092-bcbc3eda81a1?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=7c8f09b9-9b61-4fbb-9430-9208a9e233c8#myft:notification:daily-email:content)

Story behind paywall, here's the full story:

&gt;Bitcoin is dividing opinion on Wall Street, with a rush of investment banks expressing widely divergent views on the cryptocurrency boom.   
&gt;  
&gt;The digital currency soared 300 per cent last year, and has roughly doubled in the opening weeks of 2021, taking its value to about $60,000. With an estimated 18.7m coins in circulation, that takes the overall value of the market to roughly $1.1tn — too big for investment banks to ignore.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the extra scrutiny from professional analysts is not creating a consensus about its place in financial markets, or whether it should even have one at all.   
&gt;  
&gt;Citigroup was one of the first big banks to explain its view. In a 108-page report released earlier this month, it said bitcoin “may be optimally positioned to become the preferred currency for global trade” — a prospect that [fired up](https://twitter.com/Scaramucci/status/1366383324084793344) prominent cryptocurrency bulls such as SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci.  
&gt;  
&gt;It noted concerns over capital efficiency, insurance and custody and the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, and concluded that “developments in the near term are likely to prove decisive as the currency balances at the tipping point of mainstream acceptance or a speculative implosion”.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since then, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley Wealth Management have also chimed in.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Total bitcoin returns this year are already among the highest in its short history and investors have noticed,” said Bank of America’s global commodity research team. But, the report highlighted serious concerns about the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, noting that bitcoin’s annual energy consumption rivals that of the Netherlands because of the energy intensive process of “mining” new coins.   
&gt;  
&gt;BofA analysts also said bitcoin was not a suitable hedge against rising inflation and its supply is controlled by a small collection of accounts, dubbed whales.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer and head of the global investment office at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, wrote in a report last week that cryptocurrencies are reaching the threshold of becoming an investable asset class.   
&gt;  
&gt;She said the evolving regulatory framework, improving liquidity conditions and growing interest from institutional investors have created conditions for cryptocurrencies to become part of mainstream institutional portfolios, similar to how gold markets emerged 45 years ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Our recommendation is that investors get educated and consider how and whether to get exposure to this bourgeoning asset class in their portfolio,” Shalett wrote.   
&gt;  
&gt;Others, such as Germany’s Commerzbank have deemed bitcoin not worthy of analyst coverage, describing it as a purely speculative asset. French asset manager Amundi also published its first paper on cryptocurrencies on Monday, with deputy chief investment officer Vincent Mortier warning of a possibly brutal price adjustment once major regulators set out rules for the space.   
&gt;  
&gt;Goldman Sachs restarted its digital currency trading desk in March, a month after Bank of New York Mellon announced it would offer cryptocurrency custody services to its asset management clients.   
&gt;  
&gt;The rally in bitcoin has been supported by the [growing interest](https://www.ft.com/content/c6463b9b-4fab-4376-a1b9-e7ec7847cfcf) from institutional investors. Some companies, prominently including Tesla, have also loaded up. US Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, meanwhile, said at an event on Monday that crypto assets are more for speculation than for payments.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Federal Reserves Chairmen Powell slams crypto,,cryptocurrency
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 23, 2021","Stocks pulled back Tuesday, extending the recent bout of volatility, as market participants considered commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Moreover, a rise in COVID-19 cases in Europe prompted a new lockdown in Germany. 

Market participants closely monitored remarks from both Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.”

While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market remains volatile, with Treasury yields rising once again in anticipation of strong economic recovery and inflationary fears that could cause the Fed to reign back sooner-than-expected. We think the fear is overblown, given the Fed’s consistency in this stance. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Early today, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.

CryptoCurrency,"$STIX, Chopsticks Protocol - Elastic (liquidity) Farming on BSC","$STIX is an autonomous compounding system integrated into each and every liquidity pool on PancakeSwap.  It leverages dynamic trades conducted on-chain to facilitate this.  
 
How? Sake Bombs.  Every pool has its own Sake Bomb, and each pool's Sake Bomb can be activated once every 24 hours.  This will initialize a mechanism to reward liquidity stakers in that respective pool:
 
1.  New STIX are minted in proportion to the amount of liquidity provided in that pool.

2.  Half of these STIX are traded against the pool to receive the opposing token, such that there is enough of each asset for the contract to provide additional liquidity on PancakeSwap.

3.  These assets are then redeemed for liquidity tokens on PancakeSwap and the resulting liquidity tokens redistributed to the liquidity providers of the pool on which Sake Bombs are called.  
 
Stakers naturally receive access to these tokens on a pro-rata basis as determined by their equity in each pool.  Anybody can call a Sake Bomb (for a TX fee) and whoever does so will get 5% of the freshly minted liquidity tokens for that 24-hour cycle as an added incentive.
 
Pools:  at the moment, there are only three pools:
CAKE/STIX
WBNB/STIX
SUSHI/STIX
 
Incentive to stake and hold:  withdrawals from a liquidity pool are hit with a 5% penalty.
 
APY:  the daily interest rate constant is 1.006591203088991587.  Compounded daily and under maximized liquidity conditions, this leads to a APY of 1100%.

Farming LP tokens is relatively new and the perpetual interest will lead to more gains as the price for either pair increases.  IL will not be a factor at this point (long term).  Additionally, the DeFi farming is only the start of the STIX ecosystem.  Developers are planning on incorporating a DEX, StixSwap, and NFTs.  Project is two days old and it is just getting started.

I’m arguing you’re guaranteed to ‘lose’ money because all interest rates are way below the current rate of inflation. Sure the quantity of dollars will stay the same or go up slightly, but the purchasing power of your dollars will go down. Only way to defeat this is to invest your money somewhere it might get a return greater than the rate of inflation. Roast me if I’m wrong but I think I’m right. Obviously, investing is risker than savings account, but at the cost of losing value over time.",finance

I initially went with the builder recommended loan office for the pre-qual because they would qualify me despite already having a home loan and if I choose them I get $5000 off the purchase price.

However, I'm open to shopping around and possibly changing loan types depending on interest rates and closing costs. At the moment, I'm leaning towards a VA loan because it doesn't have PMI, but it does have a lending fee of 1.65%. Do other loan types also have this type of fee?

The estimated value of my new home is already $50,000 more than what I locked into and I have an 800+ credit score with 0 debt (outside of my current mortgage) if that helps anything. I may have enough to go up to 10% down after this house sells.",finance

personalfinance,Help with owed taxes from a lawsuit and retirement savings,"Hoping I can get some help before I consult a tax-attorney! 

I received a settlement from a lawsuit with my former employer for unpaid wages and commissions. The company has since dissolved, and the settlement payment was paid into my attorney's trust account by their insurance. My attorney then took his percentage of the money, and cut me a check for the remaining amount. 

I understand that my former employer was supposed to issue me a 1099 and/or take taxes out of the awarded amount. I still haven't received a 1099, and now my attorney is asking me whether I want him to issue a 1099 for the amount they paid to me (settlement - attorney's fees) or if I want them to contact my former employer to get them to send me a 1099 for the full settlement amount. 

From my understanding, neither scenario would designate which portion of the settlement amount went towards attorney's fees or emotional distress. 

If I enter the full settlement amount into 1099-C miscellaneous income, I am bumped into a higher income bracket and end up owing almost $50k across federal and CA state tax. This would mean I netted $20k out of a $120k lawsuit after taxes and attorney costs. 

My tax situation is pretty basic aside from the settlement--I have a salaried job, no gains from investments to report, and no equity in a home or anything else.

To minimize the amount of taxes I owe:

1.) What should I do for the 1099 situation? Have my attorney send me one for my net awarded amount, or get a 1099 from the former employer (or their insurance) for the full settlement amount?

2.) Can I write my attorney's fees off as an above-the-line expense, and if so, how do I report the settlement amount (and for what amount) and report the expense? I am looking into using either TurboTax or H&amp;R Block. 

3.) I don't have the $50k to pay the taxes. I paid off debt, put some in investments, and put the rest in my employer-sponsored 401k and IRA with the settlement I got. When looking into an offer-in-compromise, it makes me report the amount I have in my 401k and based on that amount, it says I can sufficiently pay the full amount of taxes owed. Would I really have to withdraw my retirement savings and incur a penalty? I'd be left with nothing to my name. I've even contemplated cashing out that retirement account and putting it in my dad's business, and then reporting that I have no assets to the IRS. 

As you can tell, I am not well-off financially, so any advice here before I have to pay someone for help is so much appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Opportunity to flip a house with a price $80k under appraisal.,"I think I’ve come across a great option for my first investment property, it’s a bit of a strange situation and I’m curious how to best capitalize on it.

- The property was for sale by owner on Zillow, listed for $120k below the Zestimate. It’s priced at $109 a square foot. All the recently sold comps are at least $125. It’s 3,300 square feet so that’s about $50k below the worst comps right there. So I’m estimating the sale price is about $80k below it’s appraisal value.

- Why is this guy selling it for that low? I’m not sure. He seems kind, honest, and not too great with money. It seems like he needs the liquidity out of it and doesn’t want to wait. I’m a sure thing and he took it. Agreed to remove the listing and everything. The night he listed it he got an offer for $350k. We beat it at $360k. He told that group that it would be a bidding war and they backed out. At that point he took it off the market for us.

- So here’s what I’ve done. We like the place enough. But it has cat odor. So it would represent some work. We might be able to fix it up and move in, but for the sake of this post let’s assume our main interest is financial impact on net worth over time. Basically, is this a good investment and how should we maximize it? My biggest question is the value so I ordered an appraisal today independent of a mortgage. I hear that mortgage appraisals are heavily skewed towards the sale price so I just ate the cost of an independent appraisal that wouldn’t be biased. I get the results tomorrow. I also had a cleaning guy come and he said the cat smell could be addressed.

- So let’s say tomorrow I’m right. The sale price is $360k and the valuation is $80k higher at $440. This is an incredible opportunity... right? How should I best capture it? As I see it here are my options:

A) Buy it, fix the cat odor, sell it. It would be an investment property though so a worse interest rate and 20% down required. I’d have to pay income tax on the profits minus the costs to fix it up a bit. Any other tax considerations? While we hold it our debt load would be maxed so if a dream house popped up we couldn’t get it. But that seems to be the only downside besides the taxes.

B) We decide to move into it. Stay there 2 years and then sell it. We pay no taxes. Maximize the gains. But what if we decide we don’t like living there? Or can’t remove the cat smell completely? Can we get a loan as if it is a primary residence and not move in for a few months as we fix it? If so when does the 2 year clock start? When we buy it or when we move in? And if we decide to sell it in the first year what is the punishment for claiming it would be our primary residence? What about between 1 and 2 years? I’m not intending to do fraud here. We genuinely would intent to live there and only move out if it doesn’t work for us.

C) We could buy it and rent it out. There is a lot of tax considerations here. I think I understand most of them. Depreciation over 27.5 years. Reduce costs of fixes and mortgage interest etc. I don’t know that I’m as interested in this option as the thrust of this is more that there is $80k on the table to be made instantly and capturing that is more of my interest than setting up a long term rental. I could flip this one and do a rental elsewhere and it would be the same, the $80k is the real play.

A few other points. If we do go forward there will be an inspection and we can back out if we are missing something. I’m anticipating the appraisal tied to the mortgage will be closer to the sale price so I guess I wouldn’t trust it as much as the independent one? The house is in our neighborhood so moving there wouldn’t be a huge change. It was built in 1940 as a duplex. Converted to single unit in 2010. The guy says he’s put a total of $425k into it in the purchase price and improvements.

TLDR: I think I can flip a property and make $80k. Am I missing anything and how should I maximize tax implications?

Update: The appraisal came back for $468k. $108k over the purchase price. So we’re deciding to go for it. Sent the signed purchase agreement and just waiting for it to come back signed by the Seller!",finance
stocks,The market will be fine,"Today got a lot of people anxious because it was a fairly poor day, for no obvious reasons. Here is the best explanation i found: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/pension-funds-have-to-buy-bonds-to-rebalance-portfolios-and-that-might-be-good-for-stocks.html


In short, it looks like a lot of big pension funds sold a lot of stocks to buy bonds as their quarterly rebalancing. This explains why the Yields actually went down a lot while the rest of the market as a whole was tanking.


But if you noticed, one thing did well: FAANG. Why? because analysts expect the yields going down to help the large cap growth stocks.



But i think once the large funds are done rebalancing, people will buy back into the market for sure with the low yields, and we should see growth doing better.


I think the most important thing is to not panic and hold to our red positions... If the feds was able to save us from a massive covid crash, they can save us from a tiny dip that was caused by literally nothing lol

investing,It appears the recent move in the US 10-year Treasury yield from 1.2% to 1.7% had very little to do with inflation expectations.,"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/03/04/business/financial-markets/bonds-stock-japanese-economy-global-economy-u-s-treasuries/   
[March 4]    
&gt;Japanese funds sold a **record $34 billion of foreign bonds in the two weeks ended Feb. 26** as the nation’s fiscal year-end [on 31] March approaches — enough to cause reverberations in U.S. repurchase markets for 10-year Treasuries.
&gt;
What started out as a **re-balancing of books by Japanese funds** has added to the volatility in global markets, with Treasury yields rocketing to levels seen before the pandemic, as a vicious cycle unfolds as selling begets more sales. The dumping from Japan, one of the biggest owners of debt, triggers hedging by dealers on the other side of the trade, which in turn impacts crucial funding markets relying on bonds as collateral.  
  
***  
And from ""some other website that everyone loves to hate"" [March 24]:  
&gt;....observation was made this week by Morgan Stanley's chief rates strategist Matthew Hornbach, who over the weekend identified the origin, if not quite the identity, of the persistent seller of Treasurys over the past few months, who has sparked such a violent rout across not just the US rates space but also stocks and other core assets.
&gt;
As the following remarkable chart from Hornbach makes very clear, the cumulative downward price movement in Treasury futures has been concentrated in the Tokyo session. Furthermore, after a brief respite in the first week of March, selling in the Tokyo session accelerated dramatically ahead of the FOMC meeting and it continued afterward.  
&gt; 
Of course, the initial burst of Treasury futures selling - which appears to have originated out of Japan every time - would then have a domino effect on the rest of the world, and as Morgan Stanley notes, ""weak price action during the Tokyo session led to additional selling during the London session"" although to a lesser extent. As the next chart shows, since the start of the year, 85% of the cumulative decline in TY futures prices occurred in the overnight session, i.e., Japan is almost single-handedly responsible for the dump surge in yields this year!  
&gt; 
Why does this matter? Because if Morgan Stanley is right, and if the seemingly daily Treasury selling indeed originates out of Tokyo, there is finally good news for bond bulls: Hornbach writes that ""we have good reason to believe the selling from Japan won't last... into April."" That's because the fiscal year in Japan ends on March 31. ""At that point, liquidation of non-yen bond holdings should stop, if not reverse at some point in the April-June quarter.""",finance

What are some investment options if I decide to give up on the housing market? I have a big down payment saved. Do I just put that money into retirement accounts instead? Feeling a little blue and I like cultivating empowerment and choice in those places! Thank you!

Here's a little more info in case it's helpful!:

It seems somehow like my money is just losing value (is that even a thing?!) because the cost of houses just keeps moving out of reach and I can't catch up... I live in a fairly high cost of living area (not like SF but up there - the median cost of a home is over $500K with average of 5 days on the market). I have a lot of money saved for a down payment as I was wanting to put 20% down and that money is just sitting in a savings account with a 0.5% interest rate. My savings rate relative to my income is fairly high and even though I could put 20% down on an average priced house (if I could find one) I'm not sure I can get approved for the mortgage with my income (I'll be meeting with some lenders just to get an idea but based on online tools I would probably qualify for a loan that would put me more in the market for a condo which I'm not all that stoked on - I prefer to live where I'm renting!). Also, I'm not able to move right now. Thanks again!",finance

If a pandemic doesnt completely close the Disney parks for good honestly nothing well. They came out of this pandemic way better than they went into it. My only regret is not buying sooner. But i feel confident they are the type of long hold stock that someday my own kids will be buying and selling. 

Medium risk i went with Draftkings. Sports betting is a major industry and states continue to welcome and legalize betting. I chose medium risk cause if states ever decide to not legalize or somehow feds step in the stock absolutely could tank and never recover. But if this continue to open and legalize this really could 2x-4x over the next year or two. 

Square and Paypal in putting as high risk even though i feel they are lower to medium because of their digital money involvement. If the feds ever crackdown on it... it could tank them. However, i dont think they have much downside besides being a tech stock which as we saw tank hard.

Bitcoin,"This so called current ""BItcoin Bubble"" as per various media and experts doesn't actually exist.","I was considering just adding this to discussion thread but I think there has been some major fear mongering and in my opinion; outlandish predictions saying BTC hill hit $300,000 and then fall into a nuclear crypto winter taking a massive nose dive of the likes we saw in 2018 or worse.

Now for those of you who swear by the coin, I personally love it, but normally opt to hold alts like Eth and some defi types because of just how interesting the technology is and it is often financially more accessible with upswings that are more tailored to my investment preferences. I liken it to loving physical gold but holding mostly silver.

Again these concepts are nothing new, but what has been bothering me lately is these ""New wave btc bubble"" posts such as this: 

[Bitcoin could surge to $300,000 — but winter could last for years when the bubble bursts, says crypto entrepreneur](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/bitcoin-btc-may-hit-300000-but-bubble-could-burst-after-peak-bobby-lee.html?__twitter_impression=true&amp;recirc=taboolainternal)

I can say that after witnessing the recent surges and the volatility becoming semi-predictable and there may be notable and predictable patterns. These include which players enter the arena, who is spending on what, or even how someone of high significance tweeting gives tangible insight on how the BTC market will react. It seems evident to me.

Will BTC reach 300k anytime soon? Doubtful. 100k? Easily.  Are we in another bubble that will cause a massive crash like 2018? Extremely unlikely if not downright ridiculous unless BTC suddenly breaks or gets dethroned and rendered obsolete which again is next to nil. It has become too much of a standard already.

Now the reason I make the point of saying this isn't the typical ""bubble"" we have seen in the past with BTC, is because of the mass adoptions by almost all the big corporations and even government entities coming to realize there can actually exist a fine line of regulation yet very valuable and far more convenient and efficient uses for BTC by integration or in combination with fiat, than simply being a layman's hodling commodity dismissed via nonsense like blackmarket fear mongering. And Federal panic that their printers are going to stop suddenly and society will be enveloped in darkness and utter financial chaos will ensue. This is irrational and improbable. Besides its too late even if that had any remote basis in reality.

i believe the Feds are actually realizing they cant fight the expansion of BTC and crypto in general for that matter (I'll get to DeFi shortly). Feds have no choice as even banks are pressuring them to start taking cues from larger companies; and especially how payment providers are utilizing and integrating BTC on a global scale because we are now at that pivotal point - companies, e-commerce and private holders are also holding up a middle finger: 'no governing body can completely and effectively stop this technology as was a main point of its inception. Working as intended.'

This isn't a bubble, it is the cusp of global and mass adoption being accepted across almost all financial sectors with the standards being set by the tech and those who utilize it, the utilization is the very means of getting access to that control with no off switch and that is universal by design. Thus, I believe the value of BTC will gradually rise due to its ever increasing demand, usage and finity. Of course there are the outliers; we may see some usual ebbs and flows correlating to venture, integration and even potential future fork announcements, but BTCs nature and trajectory should theoretically keep it on a steady and organic rise in value through the foreseeable future.

Mining methods are already transitioning and mostly reserved to large data processing centres to even be substantually profitable, mass adoption is moving faster than we can even validate it. I am estimating new adoptions currently being made, around the globe, every minute of everyday. This could eventually include the Feds changing their tune to its allocation in a global fashion to acknowledge it as it was meant to be: a universal currency...just maybe.  

Within the next few years it will likely be considered abnormal for global businesses and e-commerce companies to not have at least some form of integration of BTC or they will be left in the dust, considering the possible increase in values of proprietary software and hardware systems alone, that allow for companies to tap into the blockchain seamlessly. Not to mention the lost revenues.

On the other hand this is also where I believe a ""parallel universe effect"" could have Bitcoin no longer being the single, be all and end all, leader of the pack. Ethereum's smart tech and the freedom of DeFi are becoming more attractive and accessible, thus leading to a choice scenario within universal adoption. You would have BTC as the grandfathered staple ""money"" and then a form of Eth and DeFi as the universal and attractive choice for specialized transactions. Both providing the baseline and premium options. I guess an analogy would be ""would you like to pay with cash, debit or credit?"" 

I am no expert on this stuff but as a career analyst I could see this being the ultimate outcome for global acceptances. What do you guys think about my opinions on this, is it flawed? And am I wrong to suggest there is no longer a bubble effect rather a stabilized adoption effect taking hold, meaning a future crash for BTC and ETH to be highly improbable?

Or maybe I forgot my meds today...",cryptocurrency

stocks,Dollar General to curb logistics costs by expanding private truck fleet,"Dive Brief:Dollar General is contending with continued high carrier rates and fuel costs, CFO John Garratt said during the company's earnings call Thursday. Increased costs are also stemming from discretionary bonuses for trucking employees, as well as for workers in distribution centers, Garratt said.To help mitigate transport costs, the company plans to further expand its private truck fleet, Garratt said. The private fleet accounted for more than 20% of outbound logistics at the end of last year, COO Jeff Owen said on the call.The retailer said the recent opening of its dry distribution center in Walton, Kentucky, is expected to help it reduce stem miles and, therefore, costs. It also plans to open two DG Fresh facilities this year, including a combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Nebraska, which Owen said should reduce stem miles over time.

Using Digitization To Solve Supply Chain DisruptionsDownload now

Dive Insight:

Pandemic-driven volume increases were responsible for a portion of the increases in transportation and distribution costs, Dollar General said. And buyers aren't expected to let up on spending any time soon.

""With another round of stimulus checks being mailed right now, we expect another large boost in consumer spending over the next few months,"" National Retail Federation Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement last week.

But high logistics costs can offset gains in sales. In a recent McKinsey survey of CPG companies, 80% said they did not expect transportation costs to decrease this year from 2020's elevated levels.

""We feel great about what we did this year, delivering 77 basis points of gross margin expansion,"" said Garratt. ""But we also, as I mentioned, are seeing in the near term higher distribution and transportation costs. So ... these will weigh in the near term.""

Increased volume, mixed with a shortage of trucks and people to drive them, have pushed up truckload rates. Volatility in the trucking market has prompted shippers to focus on procuring reliable carrier capacity.

For some shippers, that means diversification. For others, it means becoming a shipper of choice and leaning on dedicated services, or signing their fleets over to specialists in a conversion to manage capacity.

Dollar General's fleet-bulking strategy would allow it to more frequently skip the third-party pool. Demand surges have kept spot prices elevated.

The pandemic has also put pressure on efficient distribution, though large retailers have been reexamining their networks since before the coronavirus. Surging e-commerce volumes reinforced the need for more capacity.

United Natural Foods and Williams-Sonoma have invested in distribution expansions, with focuses on automation. Dollar General spent $1 billion in capital expenditures in 2020, including planned investments in distribution and transportation, the CFO said

Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.

As soon as July, officials at the [Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2972930Z:US) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said [James Cunha](https://www.bostonfed.org/people/bank/james-cunha.aspx), who leads the project for the Boston Fed.

A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.

Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like [Visa Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/V:US) and [Mastercard Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MA:US) are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.

“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for [Compass Point Research &amp; Trading LLC](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0211844D:US).

Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.

“The fire has been lit,” said [Josh Lipsky](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/josh-lipsky/), who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”

&amp;#x200B;

At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.

Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.

The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.

In video [remarks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/powell-says-central-bank-digital-currency-must-coexist-with-cash) last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”

Powell in a Bank for International Settlements panel on Monday [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/fed-s-powell-and-peers-aren-t-rushing-into-digital-currencies-kmkp6667) the Fed has “an obligation to be on the cutting edge of understanding the technological challenges” and the costs and benefits of a digital dollar but wouldn’t rush the project. Powell also said the Fed wouldn’t proceed without support from Congress, ideally in the form of legislation.

Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.

The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.

“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”

The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.

So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1025701D:US). Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.

“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the [American Bankers Association](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0321782Z:US).

The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.

Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.

Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.

Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.

Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.

“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a [Morgan Stanley](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MS:US) conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”

&amp;#x200B;

Other countries [are further along](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/central-banks-edge-toward-money-s-next-frontier-in-digital-world). China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.

Brown earlier this month sent a [letter](https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Reserve_%20Letter%2003012021.pdf) to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.

Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by [Facebook Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/FB:US) and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.

Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.

A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads [Coin Center](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1241579D:US), a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.

A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 03.24.2021,"Hey Everyone!

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

Also, there’s now a video version available for anyone interested: [https://youtu.be/JyAcje12TW0](https://youtu.be/JyAcje12TW0)

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. We now have a Backstreet Boy. Might not seem that important, until you notice he has 600k followers. Network effects...network effects. Thanks, Nick! [https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/1374347860834062340](https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/1374347860834062340) [https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/1374466486018842624](https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/1374466486018842624)
2. A guy tried to use Charles’s reaction to the King Soopers tragedy in Boulder to criticize Cardano. Charles told him to go f\*\*\* himself and then auctioned off the tweet with proceeds going to the families of the victims. The auction price quickly hit four figures and closed at $7k.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374207862646304773?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374207862646304773?s=u_a)
3. Thursday is Cardano 360 and Friday will be “Get ADA Day” as staking rewards for Epoch 255 close. Gonna be an action packed close to the week.  Enjoy!
4. Here was my favorite moonboi tweet of the last few days.  Old photo, but excellent captioning work here. [https://twitter.com/MaximilianXCIX/status/1373471841449304066](https://twitter.com/MaximilianXCIX/status/1373471841449304066)
5. Great new interview with Sebastien! In this one he explains a lot about the dApp Connector being built by Emurgo. As reported by a commenter in one of our earlier threads, it will work with Ergo first and then Cardano. A very interesting tidbit was Sebastien’s explanation of how the Emurgo dApp Connector will actually be safer than Metamask (which fills a similar role in the ETH ecosystem).  Very good info. Thanks to Sebastien and the Cardano Podcast! [https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY](https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying "" Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. Famed crypto enthusiast and billionaire Mike Novogratz asks the Cardano world ""Can anyone make a real bull case for [$ADA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=cashtag_click)? Does anyone build on it? Use it? Why is market cap so high? Should it be a funding asset? It’s one of the few cryptos I haven’t traded in my life.""

8. Charles will be speaking at the Blockchain Africa Conference this week which may or may not give us more clues as to the African Bird announcement. [https://blockchainafrica.co/](https://blockchainafrica.co/)
9. SingularityNet collaboration with Cardano going down. How else is Skynet gonna pay the Terminators?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ) [https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos)
10. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
11. ~~What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?~~ [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1) RETIRED!
12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh.
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)
14. Charles claimed Elon was trolling Cardano with “meta for k” on twitter. Can anyone argue one way or another on this? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1364350825271685122](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1364350825271685122)

18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. ~~Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark.~~ (Retired: he finally got it) Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. ~~Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?~~ RETIRED!
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years.
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

35. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have a hairline that is even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.
36. Cardano reached 550k wallets in half the time it took BTC [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1369933366368362496](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1369933366368362496)
37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum).

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

But, the interview starts off with some very interesting stories about his youth in 1980s Kiev, Ukraine.

74. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity.

79. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months.

90. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).

91. We are starting to see cracks in the psychological armor of the Ethereum crowd.  This anti-Cardano post was at 0 upvotes (at time of writing) while the fairly pro-Cardano response received triple figure upvotes.

92. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).

personalfinance,Looking for feedback on my whole life policy,"I have been subscribed to this sub for a while now and am grateful for all of the secondhand feedback I’ve received through these interactions, and figured it was time to get advice of my own.

I am 30 with a $300k whole life policy that I’ve owned for the last 3-4 years. I pay ~$250/month for it. I also have a $200k term life policy on my wife.

I make $100k/year while my wife is a stay-at-home mom to our two young children. We live in a low cost of living city and have been aggressively paying off debt the past couple years to the point where I only have my mortgage left to pay off (locked in 2.5% interest rate in Oct, so feeling good there),

All that being said, I have seen multiple comments in this sub that say not to carry whole life insurance. Should I cash it out and switch to term if it would better allow me to max out IRA contributions and/or begin adding to college funds?

Trying to identify pros/cons of making these moves as well as feedback on the process of cancelling the policy (if it makes sense to cancel), so any inputs would be welcome.

EDIT: Thanks for all the quick feedback from the group and appreciate the confirmation of the need to cancel the policy. As one user shared, I’m going to look into a replacement term life policy first before canceling. I should also add that you all have given me great insight into the need to increase my policy amount when I switch to term-life. $300k sounded like a lot of money when I was 26-27, but now not so much with my wife at home and 2 small children.",finance
personalfinance,Credit card debt has 0% interest. Should I pay off ASAP or save as much as I can?,"Hello, thank you for your help in advance. So I've got around £5000 on CC. Over the past year I've used long term 0% balance transfers to remove any interest costs.

In my mind, there is 0 cost to keeping these funds on the CC.

I have around £1000 a month to play with and I currently don't know if I should pay the minimum each month (ensuring its paid off prior to the offer running out) and save the remainder OR should I put the £1000 towards paying g off the debt and only start saving once the CC is paid off?

Would be good to understand where I'm best placed to place the funds being from the UK current saving account interest rates SUCK!

Truly, he was a visionary on his own.

A method whereby on the internet you can transfer funds from A to B, without A know B and B knowing A. The way in which i can take a $20 bill and hand it over to you and there is no record of where it came from. And you may get it without knowing who I am.”*

306k 30yrs @ 2.25% 
332k 30yrs @ 2.875% w/ 21k cash out to pay off some higher interest rate debt

Current mortgage is 301k remaining @ 3.375% with Guild Mortgage, a great lender from my experience, second VA loan with them. Purchased home in 2018, but the market is booming and comps in my neighborhood are going for around 400k, hence the cash out option. Guild is telling me that they can't match the rates from Rocket Mortgage and that they are a predatory lender, using the word ""vulture"". 

The only ""shady"" thing I've seen from Rocket is that they will not lock in the interest rate until after I sign all the documents in the application packet, even though I've been pre approved, is this normal? Also I cant find anyone else offering those low of rates, my wife also filled out a pre approval through Rocket and was told 3.875%, although we are both on the same loan currently. 

Two main questions, is Rocket mortgage legit and which loan is the better option?",finance

Investors grew concerned about Covid reopening plans as cases ticked higher in many U.S. states despite vaccinations. Germany and France are among the European nations tightening restrictions again as a new wave of infections sweeps a continent that’s seen a sluggish vaccine rollout. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Wednesday continued to back off last week’s 14-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 on Tuesday each lost nearly 1%, while the Nasdaq lost more than 1%.

&gt; # 2. Yellen, Powell set for Day 2 of economic testimony

&gt; * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are set to deliver a second day of economic testimony to lawmakers as required quarterly by the March 2020 Covid relief act. They will appear remotely before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET. On Tuesday, they told the House Financial Services Committee that elevated asset valuations in pockets of the markets are not reasons for alarm yet. Yellen and Powell also said they’re confident in the stability of the financial sector as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.

&gt; # 3. GameStop sinks after acknowledgement of possible share sale

&gt; * GameStop shares fell 12% in Wednesday’s premarket after the company acknowledged in a filing that it’s considering selling additional equity shares. The stock soared more than 2,400% in January’s Reddit-fueled trading frenzy before crashing. It mounted a comeback in late February and earlier this month on hopes for a digital transformation. However, shares in recent days moved lower. After the closing bell Tuesday, GameStop missed on the top and bottom lines with quarterly results. But it did see e-commerce sales jump 175% for the quarter. The company also named former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

&gt; # 4. Intel to build new chip plants; Amazon names new cloud chief

&gt; * Dow stock Intel rose about 4% in premarket trading after the company said late Tuesday it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Arizona. The announcement, coinciding with new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s first public remarks since taking over the job, signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing during industry shifts that have led competitors to increasingly separate chip design and chip fabrication.

&gt; * Incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, head of the company’s cloud business for the past 15 years, revealed his Amazon Web Services successor in a memo to employees. Adam Selipsky, a former Amazon executive and currently CEO of Salesforce-owned data-visualization software maker Tableau, was chosen to run the AWS division.

&gt; # 5. Elon Musk says people can now buy a Tesla with b/itcoin

&gt; * Elon Musk announced late Tuesday that it’s now possible to buy Tesla vehicles in the U.S. with b/itcoin. “You can now buy a Tesla with B/itcoin,” tweeted CEO Musk, who was also officially made the “Technoking of Tesla” this month. People outside the U.S. will be able to buy a Tesla with b/itcoin “later this year,” Musk said, without specifying which countries. The electric auto maker in February revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of b/itcoin. At the time, Tesla said it would soon start accepting the world’s biggest and most popular c/ryptocurrency as a form of payment.

financialindependence,Mind the GAAP: Caution When Using CAPE-based Valuations,"#Intro

The [Safe Withdrawal Rate Series](https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/) by /u/EarlyRetirementNow gets a ton of appropriate attention and praise on this subreddit for digging into the devilish details of retirement spending. One of the most popular take-aways from the series is the use of the bond tent. Perhaps a close second is [the idea of valuations-based withdrawals](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2017/08/30/the-ultimate-guide-to-safe-withdrawal-rates-part-18-flexibility-CAPE-Based-Rules/), most commonly using the Shiller CAPE. While both of these strategies have a sound rationale for why they should work, I believe the actual implementation for the common retiree leaves something to be desired and I question their general applicability in practice. I want to be explicit that **I am not ""anti-CAPE,""** I only want to raise awareness regarding some thorny problems when using the metric so those who plan to use it themselves know its potential limitations. To do so, I want to bring people's attention to one of the best short works in this perennial debate: [Fixing the Shiller CAPE](http://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2013/12/shiller/). The whole post is worth a careful read. Like [my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/lztg6e/risk_and_reward_in_shortterm_savings_bogleheads/), this is not my work but rather an attempt at a high-level summary of interesting and important work relevant to FIRE. Through these posts I hope to broaden horizons and increase exposure to some of the less-discussed topics in FIRE. 

***

# Conclusions

There are reasons to believe that the most commonly used Shiller CAPE metric is in need of adjustment in the modern era. As a result, those who believe in the continued prognostic value of CAPE (and especially those who will alter their retirement plans based on CAPE) should exercise extreme caution in using the metric. Not only may the *current* Shiller CAPE require adjustments for changes in GAAP and dividend payout ratios, it may require constant vigilance to identify *future* long term changes in market environments that may again alter the applicability of the metric. Importantly, these adjustments to CAPE were not widely identified in real time, raising the risk of only realizing one's mistake in hindsight. 

***

# CAPE in the modern era

The Shiller Cyclically-Adjusted Price-Earnings (CAPE) ratio is calculated by dividing an index’s inflation-adjusted price by the average of its inflation-adjusted annual earnings over the last 10 years. From around 1880 to 1990, the Shiller CAPE oscillated around an average value of around 15, but since 1990 the Shiller CAPE has only been below this historical average for *5 months out of the past 31 years*. Clearly, the metric is different now compared to its historical period. Why is this?

The author argues for at least three reasons why modern Shiller CAPE is not what it used to be:

## 1. Changes in how earnings are calculated per Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)

In short, the way earnings (the denominator) are calculated changed substantially in in 2001. In essence, if a company purchased another company and made a huge loss they would now be forced to book that loss all in one year as opposed to amortizing it over 40 years. As a result, reported earnings per new GAAP standards took a huge hit. [This chart](https://i0.wp.com/www.philosophicaleconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/reppf11.jpg) demonstrates the gap (no pun intended) that developed as a result. The author suggests using Pro-Forma CAPE calculations to allow for a more historical-methods-consistent analysis of where valuations are today. They do not suggest that Pro-Forma accounting is superior or more accurate, only that it is more historically consistent and makes comparison to the past more accurate.

## 2. Changes in dividend payout ratios

In short, companies that pay out relatively smaller dividends and relatively higher buybacks will mark a higher CAPE due to a higher share price even if their underlying fundamentals are exactly the same. This has been an increasingly common trend for US companies, and is now accepted to warp historical Shiller CAPE valuations to the point that [Shiller himself has offered an alternative CAPE](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm) to correct for modern dividend payout ratios. 

## 3. Changes in investing environments

In short, the prior oscillations in Shiller CAPE below the historical average have been secondary to three major environmental changes to the investing world: 1) war, 2) high inflation, and 3) financial crisis. [This chart](https://i1.wp.com/www.philosophicaleconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/shillercape1.jpg) shows those dips overlaid with those proposed environmental effects. The author asserts that even after adjusting for changes in GAAP and dividend payout ratios, modern CAPE may simply remain higher than historical norms because of a lower probability of any of these investing environments. As an editorial aside, I find this to be the weakest argument in the article, but this section is admitted by the author to be the most speculative and a ""slightly facetious"" taunt to the bears. 

***

# Recap 

* Although its historical predictive power has been strong, in the 23-year period from 1990 to 2013 the Shiller CAPE spent only 2% of the time below its historical average, and 98% of it above.
* It is clear, then, that the classic Shiller CAPE may be fundamentally different in the current era than it has been. Explanations vary from historical differences in accounting methods, dividend payout rates, interest rate regimes, and national/global calamities (or a lack thereof).
* **If using CAPE-based valuations to drive retirement spending decisions, care must be taken to consistently analyze the valuations metric for accuracy and generalizability.**",finance

Will your portfolio succeed before the bullmarket ends or will you fomo it all away?

Mini games such as:

personalfinance,Real estate or other investments - seeking general financial advice,"I am single, 37 years old, stable job making $140k/yr.

I have $170k in a 401k, $10k in an IRA, $20k in other investments and owe about $10k on a condo worth about $400k. No other debts. I consider myself frugal and my cost of living is pretty low. I easily have an extra $4k at the end of every month.

The thing is, my condo is not on the housing market. I purchased it through an affordable housing program with my employer and it will only appreciate in value with inflation (so far, it has appreciated at the rate of about 4%/yr).

Houses in my area are ridiculously priced. Modest homes are in the $800k to $1million range. The next town over has some desirable homes in the $500-800k range, but this would necessitate a 30-45 min commute.

I feel like current low interest rates have created an environment where debt is cheap, money is easily available and the housing market is insanely overpriced. Seriously, who is going to have the income to buy all these modest houses at $1million dollars once the interest rates go up?

So, I'm trying to figure out the best way to go forward. I'm comfortable in my condo but would really like a house. I'm thinking that if I wait, the housing market may go down in the next few years. All these unpaid mortgages from people being out of work from covid will go into default. Mortgage interest rates will go up but it won't be too bad for me as I should have around $500k available. On the other hand, housing prices may just continue to increase, getting further and further out of reach.

Should I buy a house now or wait? If I wait, what is the best thing to do with my excess income, being that the stock market forecast is mixed?

Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Is now really a great time to buy a house?,"Hello all!   


I am more than likely just venting that anything, so be forewarned. I am a young adult closing on my first house in about two weeks and starting to really feel the stress. I tried to do everything I could by the book, besides 20% as I live outside of D.C and that just feels impossible for someone in their 20s. I was able to secure a loan with 2.65% interest rate. When I first started looking a lot of family/friends were saying ""well there has never been a better time to buy"" now that I am going to closing everyone seems to have flipped. I pretty much can't tell someone that I bought a house without them saying ""Wow good luck. This market seems a lot like 2008"" or ""Man, sure hope you don't end up being upside down in a few months when the market bottoms out."" At the end of the day I am excited to have a new home for my gf and our pets. The house is well within my means and I am still able to save and have a healthy amount in 401k, but I still just have this fear because of all the comments I have been getting lately. I guess I am a little locked in under contract anyways, but was looking to hear some other people's experiences.    


If this is relevant for any opinions people may have -  It is a 10 acre plot that is about 35 minutes to DC without traffic, it is within 10 minutes to two major public transit stations. I see it as a solid investment because you can't build more land. Just need a sanity check I guess.

investing,Preferred shares ETF in Canada a quick comparison,"## Definition of preferred shares

When you own a share of a company. You are basically part of the business. You have the right to vote and participate in shareholders’ annual meeting. Your return will depend solely of the performance of the company in the stock market and its dividends. It’s rewarding but it’s also risky. Preferred shares are a bit different. You don’t get to vote and you have no ownership in the business. Your preferred share entitles you priority to dividends based on a percentage agreed upon in advance. The priority means the company needs to pay you first before paying the regular shareholders. In case of bankruptcy, you have first claim on the assets of the company. So, in essence, a preferred share is kind of hybrid product that shares certain characteristics of bonds (a bit of safety) and some of regular shares (potential for appreciation).

Investors can invest directly in preferred shares as they trade like stocks. Or, they can buy preferred shares ETF to achieve diversification and reduce risk.

A preferred share grants the holder a percentage return based on its par value. there are several risks associated with preferred shares:

* The issuer can decide not pay dividends in a particular year because of bad financial results. Unless you hold a cumulative right, you will not receive your dividends;
*  It's possible for preferred stocks to appreciate in market value based on positive company valuation, although this is a less common result than with commons stocks;
* Preferred shares are sensitive to interest rates. When interest rate are low, preferred shares are in demand because their dividend is much higher than other fixed income products. If interest rate rise, investors will turn to safer fixed income products such as bonds. This will impact negatively the price of the preferred share;
* An issuer of preferred shares can decide to recall his shares or offer the option to convert them to regular stocks anytime. Only 'Callable' Pref shares can be recalled by the issuer.

## What’s a preferred shares ETF

It’s basically ETFs that invest mainly in preferred shares. These ETFs are quite popular because they offer investors interesting yields with possibility of capital appreciation. Among all fixed income products, there’s no question that preferred shares usually offer the best return in comparison to bonds. This being said a preferred share carries more risk than owning a bond.

## [Methodology](https://wyzeinvestors.com/?p=708#Methodology)

I started by selecting all Fixed income ETFs offered in Canada. I considered in my comparison only ETFs that pay more than 3% dividend yield. I consider 3% a reasonable payout especially if it’s combined with an interesting capital appreciation. Most fixed income ETFs holders seek a regular dividend income. So, it’s an important condition.

Second step: I ranked these ETFs based on the past 52 weeks performance.

Third step: All ETFs in the list should have asset under management above 100 M. Generally speaking, the higher the AUM the better the liquidity because of the high volume of shares exchanging hands daily. This factor is important because investors should be able to buy and sell an ETF at a reasonable spread. The spread is the difference between the bid and the ask price. For liquid assets, the spread can be as little as 0.005$ while for low AUM ETFs the spread can easily reach 0.05$. If you buy 100 shares that’s 5$ cost in addition to the commission you’re paying to the broker.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 24, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 24, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) falling while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly rose as market participants continue to monitor the Treasury yield and the coronavirus situation in Europe. After hitting a 14-month high of 1.75%, the Treasury yield retreated to 1.616% at the time of writing. Many of the cyclical stocks that had led markets higher for much of the last three months underperformed, and the industrials, energy, and financials sectors lagged.

Market participants have also digested recent remarks from the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.” While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market continues to react sharply to these statements, even though they have largely been the same for months. 

After a slow start last year, the US’ vaccination efforts are starting to paint an increasingly encouraging picture, with roughly 70% of Americans 65 years and older receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, and coronavirus related deaths have dropped below 1,000 a day on average for the first time since early November, according to data compiled by the Associated Press. Also, dozens of states have thrown open vaccinations to all adults or are planning to do so in a matter of weeks. And the White House said 27 million doses of both the one-shot and two-shot vaccines will be distributed next week, more than three times the number when President Joe Biden took office two months ago, again according to the Associated Press. 

The rosy outlook in the US remains in stark crisis to the unfolding crisis in Europe, with many officials warning or talking about a “third-wave of the virus”. Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measures for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and a reduction in the availability of intensive-care units (ICUs). UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.

personalfinance,Losing my mind - 529 tax question,"I cannot figure this out and both TurboTax and FreeTaxUSA are not making it clear.  I contributed $2,500 to my 529 in MD, the MCIP specifically.  The state then contributed $500 for free since I filled out the application for it.  I know I cannot deduct the $2,500 from my state tax since I received the $500 contribution.  Here is where I get lost:

TurboTax lets you subtract the $500 from your state tax if it was added as part of your federal AGI.  FreeTaxUSA lets you subtract the $500 from state tax without even probing about the federal AGI part.  I did not add the $500 to my income for federal but I don't even know if I'm supposed to?  If I don't add the income I won't take the subtraction but I don't know if I'm supposed to add the $500 to my income?  I did not take a 529 distribution so I don't have a tax form.

**TLDR: Is the free $500 contribution by MD to my 529 supposed to be added to my income?  If so, I would then take the state subtraction, not the deduction.**",finance

CryptoMarkets,Bitcoin To Substitute Gold Says Fed Chairman Powell,,cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,bitcoin self custody vs trusted third party custody vs no custody,"A lot of conversation is going on about how so many new bitcoin ETFs are ready to flood the market. It looks like there is a good variety of products with bitcoin exposure to choose from. 

Now is a good time to think about what it all means and how you can safely add bitcoin to your portfolio and evaluate various choices you have.

**Bitcoin Self custody**- You own the keys and you take full responsibility for safety of your keys and any transactions you make with the bitcoin you control. Even though there are a lot of Desktop/Mobile wallets to choose from, many new users are slow to embrace Bitcoin Self Custody. This will eventually get easier if the popular mobile platforms use automated biometric verification systems to manage your keys. 

The best investment strategy with self custody is HODL for a long time and hope to profit from the increased bitcoin adoption and value.

**Trusted Third party custody** - There are many services that take control of your bitcoin in exchange for some future reward. Most of them are interest rate products and exchanges. Many users leave their bitcoin in third party exchanges because it is convenient for speculation.  

There is a counter party default risk here. The third party becomes a target for hackers because of concentration of a lot of coins at one place. Some of the products in the market have poor business practices and pricing models. When the price of bitcoin fluctuates some of these businesses could close down taking your bitcoin with them.

A good question to ask is how much risk are you willing to take? would you lend your bitcoin for a 3% interest, 30% interest .... or what is your reward expectation at which you will lend your bitcoin? There may be a suitable product for you in the market but know your risk before you give up the custody of your coin. If the price of bitcoin goes up rapidly, you can expect some of the third party custodians to disappear. Of it the price of bitcoin goes down rapidly, you can expect some of the lending business models fail with your bitcoin.

**No custody** - ETFs offer a no bitcoin custody option, where you trust a few institutions to manage all the bitcoin handling and you just buy/sell an ETF ticker on your traditional stock trading app. With popularity of bitcoin rising, this class of products are inevitable. ETF products offer convenience but also concentrate majority of crypto at a few places. This could lead to price of bitcoin to stabilize over a period of time just like gold and silver ETFs stabilize the price of the underlying precious metals. 

Some people might wonder whats the point of a bitcoin ETF if you can just have self custody of bitcoin very easily with a mobile app? And what do I own when I buy one of these bitcoin ETFs?.

When you buy a bitcoin ETF, you actually own an ""IOU bitcoin"" instead of the actual bitcoin. When multiple parties trade this ETF, they are actually trading ""IOU bitcoins"" instead of ""actual bitcoins"". 

The ETF issuer maintains a centralized ledger for the ""IOU bitcoins"" and makes sure their ""IOU bitcoins"" and ""actual bitcoins"" tally up just like precious metals ETFS have to make sure they have the custody of the equivalent weight of metal. But who verifies there are same number of IOU bitcoin and actual bitcoin in the system and at what cost? Here, you have to trust the system just works with bitcoin ETFs.

bitcoin network manages a distributed ledger of bitcoin ownership and transfer of bitcoin ownership. All of this is done by computers running bitcoin nodes with out you trusting anyone else for accuracy or functioning of the system. 

An ETF on the other hand needs a centralized ledger with trust in few people managing this ETF to make sure the the accounting adds up and the number of IOU bitcoins are not out of whack with actual circulating bitcoin. 

In future a bitcoin ETF could be replaced by an automated solution for trading IOU bitcoin with some guarantees like faster off network transactions and proof of available funds etc, until then the ETF products are here to stay. 

Should you trade a bitcoin ETF? 

In some cases, bitcoin ETF is the only option available to retirement accounts. In all other cases, own a bitcoin and learn to self custody it.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Did I get bad financial advice with my IRA rollover?,"I'm hoping someone here can ease the sinking feeling I've got in my stomach. 

**TL;DR - Do you have to pay taxes on IRA funds that you withdraw early, if they never touched your bank account?**

I left my last job at a small business about 1.5 years ago, where the only retirement plan offered was a simple IRA that was being very badly mismanaged by the people at our company and by the account manager. When I switched jobs and started working for a larger company, and opened a new 401k with them, I started researching how to roll over the IRA funds into my new retirement account so I could close out the other account and be done with it forever. After literally a year of talking to both financial parties and trying to figure out what the hell was necessary for this, I finally decided to say fuck it and just keep contributing to the 401k from square 1. 

However, I still wanted to move over the IRA funds, since I had tried to contact my account manager for several months with no reply at all, and I was getting fed up. Finally I decided to just call my credit union and ask about their simple IRA options and have them start the process of rolling the funds over. At least then, I figured, I would have some more control over it and some confidence that somebody was actually being a steward on my account.

For context, my IRA had about $8600 in it, and I'm in my late 20's. When things started to move with my credit union, my financial advisor told me that their investment arm had rejected the rollover because the account was underperforming. (I don't know enough about investing to understand fully what's going on and why they can't just withdraw and deposit the funds elsewhere, but that's a question for another day.)

Instead, the financial advisor from my credit union told me that the simplest thing to do would be to withdraw the funds from the old account (ask for a payout and close the account), forward the check on to the new institution, and open a new IRA entirely. Yay hooray, I thought! Easy enough. I did as she asked, pulled out the money, sent the check on, and now I have a brand new IRA with the new institution. 

But as I was thinking about it this week, I started to get a panicky feeling that I might owe taxes on this, since they did technically withdraw the funds to begin the new account. A quick Google this afternoon made my stomach drop through the floor. If I did the math right, at my income bracket (which is not very high), and if this counts as withdrawing funds early, I could owe somewhere in the neighborhood of $5k in taxes next year. More than half the account is even WORTH in the first place. 

Are there exemptions on the tax penalties if the funds aren't directly rolled over, but still never touch your account? I did not cash the check - it was literally only at my house for a day or two before I mailed it on again - but I am seriously stressed about this. I've lived paycheck to paycheck my entire adult life and was \*just\* starting to break that cycle this year. If I have to take out more goddamn debt to pay taxes.... aaaah. fuck. Help?

NFT,"Using a ""casket NFT"" to help save families money on funeral planning? Need help spitballing the seed of an idea","I'm a part owner an online DTC casket company. We design, manufacture, and sell high quality caskets to customers directly so they avoid paying 2-5x for a marked up one at the funeral home. There's an FTC federal law saying that funeral homes have to accept caskets that clients bring them, so anyone can buy online from us and save. We help out a ton of families just trying to afford the farewell they wish for their loved ones. 

Many of our clients want to pre-plan their own funerals, which is a smart way to negotiate everything up front with the funeral home and relieve their descendants of the burden of planning in a great rush at the time of their passing, where they often have to overpay. Clients ask us everyday if they can their casket in advance. However, 1) we can't sell in advance and hold the cash as it violates state laws about funeral planning, and 2) these pre-plans are often sold as complex insurance products with state-by-state laws and are not ideal for our needs.

Our proposal - sell an NFT for the price of a specific casket, that comes with the rights to exchange that token for that casket at the time of need. We could even ultimately ship the casket with the tokenID affixed to it, so it's traceable in a hypothetical situation the casket is ever unearthed (right?). 

This feels like...a seed of an idea. However, it's not quite right yet. I could use help with:

1 - spitballing on this idea. What's a better version of this thought? :) We could certainly design/build limited editions (here's a silly example: [https://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:503897](https://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:503897)), but not sure that's great either

BS: Well. You get physical paper messages of all types in your mailbox, right? We got these computers and this internet thing coming online...what if you recieved the messages electronically? And securely? Like a digital mailbox! 

Me: Sounds cool.   You know if I think this through... if this digital mailbox can receive messages it can just as easily send messages too. At all times. And I could send group messages or individual messages of any size to many people in a much more effective way than using the post office. Like electronic mail! Email! Maybe we could also- 

BS: No! Forget Email. This is a Digital Mailbox. Its designed to be like your actual mailbox but digitally for the internet 🙃 

Me: Could you further explain? Maybe I'm confused 

BS: Sure no problem. We receive mail today and the store of those messages is your physical mailbox. Well we're going to need a place to store our digital messages which we'll eventually receive from our friends, family, and colleagues over the internet. Its technology. It's the future. Its headed in that direction. 
The Digital Mailbox will be able to receive messages from people all over the world. And you'll be able to access that mailbox   5 times a day! 
Let's be honest people only go to their mailbox once a day. Twice maximum. Our technology will allow users to check the mail up to 5 times every 24 hours! You can't get that in real life because the post office closes by 5pm 🤷‍♂️

Otherwise the digital mailbox network would become too congested and break down if we allowed individuals to send many messages per day. The way we set it up is our current mail system and physical network of post offices will have the specific Letter Network software in place to scan the messages you drop off and they'll upload it to the Digital Mailbox network throughout the day and the recipient will see the message arrive in their digital mailbox safe and sound. Our modern post office delivers physical messages once per day. With Digital Mailbox and the Letter Network they'll be ""delivering"" your messages up to 5 times per day! Isn't that awesome! 

Me: uh...yeah. The receiving of messages seems cool and interesting...But I feel we could do better with the sending of messages side of things... 

BS: Huh? 
Besides the Letter Network, sending of messages can be solved by ""side solutions"" like a facsimile (fax) machine, or a person can type their message on their word processor and utilize their printer to print it out and take their message to the post office or a private mail carrier such as FedEx. Those large private businesses, in addition to having a robust physical message delivery system in place, will now also have custodial Letter Network software designating them as ""digital letter carriers"" and those ""digital letter carriers"" will be able to send your important digital messages to your digital mailbox 🙃 

Me: This is getting complicated. At first you started off by saying family, friends, and colleagues will be sending/receiving digital messages for storage. To receive you have to send, no? 

BS: I know what I started off saying but the sending part just won't work. But look we're creating a big opportunity for innovation in the Letter Network!

personalfinance,18% down with PMI but lower interest rate,"I just got preapproved for a mortgage, looking at a 700k home. My lender Movement Mortgage was going over the different options available once I put in a offer and go into escrow. For the standard 20% down my rate would be 3.375%. The lender said I could technically put a little less down, like 18%, and although I would have PMI that payment would only be about ~$50/month and fall off in a couple years AND I would get a rate of 3.25%. Plus I guess I can tax deduct my PMI payments. Does it make financial sense to pay PMI for a couple years to save 0.125%? 


P.S. I just got an approval from Loan Depot for 3.125% but I have heard much better reviews from Movement compared to some negative ones about Loan Depot. Is Loan Depot a serviceable and timely lender? Should I just go with the lowest rate possible which is with Loan Depot?",finance
personalfinance,heads up: some tax software now updated to handle unemployment exclusion,"I just saw that [FreeTaxUSA posted](https://www.freetaxusa.com/stimulus.jsp):

I would guess that others have been, or will very soon be updated as well. Happy filing!",finance
Bitcoin,Is the price of bitcoin related to the stock market? Is that why bitcoin price fell today?,"As someone watching total stock market prices and bitcoin prices I can’t help but think they’re correlated! Why would they be correlated though? The stock market fell because the fed said something investors didn’t like, but why the heck would the crypto sphere care about the fed’s remarks? 

Why the heck did bitcoin fall today even with the Tesla adoption? Strange.

Any insights are much appreciated!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Roommate drove over some debris on the freeway. Truck sustained damage. The insurance company covered the repair, but is now hiking up his premium a lot. What can he do to prevent this?","Los Angeles, California.

Hello. About 2 months ago, my roommate (a very kind man who I am trying to help) was driving on the freeway when a piece of debris on the road caused severe damage to his truck. He informed his auto insurance (I think, Metlife) who gave him money for the repair. 

However, surprise surprise, the insurance company now is hiking up his yearly rate by $4000. He keeps complaining that the insurance company essentially loaned him money at 1000% interest rate (probably a hyperbole), and if he had known this would be the case, he would have just paid for the repairs himself since he has some savings.

He is reasonably frustrated (debris on the free way is an ""act of god"") and considering going liability-only because of the new yearly rate is too high for him. He has a phone call scheduled with his auto insurance company tomorrow to try to make his case/air his grivances. He has shopped for other insurance options, but the cost is the same as his new rate.

Just to be fair and give you the full picture, he was involved in a small fender-bender 2 months prior to the freeway incident. So technically, he had 2 claims in the same quarter, which doesn't help his case, but still.

**What are some good strategies for him to try to keep his old insurance rate? What can he try in this situation?**

Your tips here might help a very nice person who had a bit of bad luck and deserves better. Thanks!",finance

stocks,"I love Jefferies - the company, the CEO, the stock (JEF)","Jefferies (JEF) is an investment banking and financial services company which I discovered in Q1 because I wanted to play the sector rotation which became very distinct around Mid-February when growth and tech stocks began their free-fall whereas financials and other cyclicals just kept ascending. The run-up in cyclicals has been sharp in the past months but my investment thesis is that they still have much room to grow if macro-economists are right about record GDP growth rates for the US, inflation or no inflation.

Jefferies is one company that has rebounded very strongly from their pandemic lows, beating analyst expectations for 5 out of 5 quarters by delivering record earnings each time - and this includes Q1 2021 with the announcement just out yesterday.

I believe that only such a person would be able to come up with posts such as these: [https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783](https://jefferies.com/Letters/Pages/2783) ""10 Random musings from a boomer who has been in the Financial World for three decades"".

When the news came up about the Fed removing capital requirement concessions given to banks due to Covid (in my mind, it likely meant lower earnings growth), I discarded most of my us banking stocks and was seriously considering taking profits on Jefferies too but I opted not to in the end because earnings were due soon and I had great confidence that they would not disappoint. That faith has since been repaid and I couldn't be happier 😄. I almost feel like putting more money into JEF but that would be violating my portfolio diversification rules.

Going forwards, I expect a gradual slowdown in growth rates (it would be incredible if they could keep up such immense rates of quarterly growth) but Jefferies still looks like a promising play that gets bolstered by the recovery and growth of the US economy. Cyclicals (except maybe airlines who are sitting on a mountain of debt) are my defensive/safe haven stocks for the time being while the speculative growth stocks sort themselves out (i don't feel the correction is quite done yet). Of course, only time will tell if my strategy works out well.

&amp;#x200B;

\#My opinion is influenced by JEF's performance through Q1 2021 and prior quarters, as well as being a recovery play. Their GME price target of $175 published yesterday is a non-factor. I actually feel that price is within the realm of possibility but only if they can successfully revolutionize their online offerings to challenge major incumbents such as Steam/Valve. That probably requires at least a 1 year timeframe and serious monetization of the goodwill GME has acquired. I'm all for retail investors but this does not suit my risk profile nor investment horizon unless GME falls back to $50 a share.",finance

personalfinance,Have the ability to pay off a significant amount of debt while in grad school. Should I?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a full-time grad/full-time employed 27 year old single no kids still with parents and I am thinking of paying of some debt with the 35k a year income I have been saving working from home. I don’t own a car anymore since my insurance company paid me off after a no fault accident. I only have basic expenses rent food and have been saving a lot of my income during these last few months while in school. I’m not sure how I should tackle my debt which is:

- $2000 Chase Credit Card 27% interest. Been mostly making payments toward this balance. Was thinking of paying it off all at once or in $500 chunks.
- $200 Amazon Credit Card. Probably will handle this next payment.
- $900 Best Buy Credit Card no interest for 18 months (bought a new stove for my family.
- $6000 student loan 5% been paying interest payments during my time in school
- I also have federal student loans but they haven’t been incurring interest or payment required at all since the beginning of COVID which is when I started my program. Won’t start paying these amounts till at least September 

I have the leeway to pay the chase cards right now but I’m not sure if I should be tackling my student loans more aggressively. I also was looking into setting up an IRA account since I’ve been looking to retirement. Felt like this past year was a wake up call to start being more financially secure. Any insight would be great.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Dethroning the government,"Throughout the whole crypto movement, some people made it rich. Ain’t it amazing to think how these people made so much money out of thin air?

*The hardest part of understanding crypto is that the governments has been systematically defrauding us for over 100 years.*

Whether it is the king BTC himself, or a memecoin like Doge, we are all part of this community, that stands at a new era.

These days we hear on a regular basis of governemet bans on cryptocurrency. The justification typically hinges on a belief that cryptocurrency leads to bad things:

1. Leads to widespread tax evasion
2. Facilitates criminal activity (because of anonymity)
3. Interferes with a nation’s ability to control its own monetary policy
4. Reduces liquidity of (government-backed) national currency
5. Causes a deflationary economy. People will delay spending and stop investing
6. Causes citizens to lose faith in their own government

**Is this true or false?**

1. This is a myth as governments are not impaired in their ability to tax, spend or enforce tax collection. It is a myth based on the unfamiliarity, experience and lack of knowledge of crypto.

2. Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous and not anonymous in contrast to what people believe. It is quite easy for anyone who uses bitcoin, to follow the paper—oops—cryptotrail through VPNs and mixers, all the way until it is spend on a Tesla.

3. And 4 are true. Loss of control over monetary policy is a very different thing than losing control over fiscal policy. You want your kids to be born into a nation that purchases our government bonds? Decoupling a country from its currency is a really good thing. It promotes economic growth and is necessary for continued well-being, poverty reduction, upholding public fonds and even for environmental improvements. Current environmental impact and resource of many national economies and their global sum is unsustainable. 

5. This is just a trick. Since when is a capped money supply encouraging people to save for big expanses and retirement a bad thing!? We know deflation is associated with recession, war, unemployment and a loss of liquidity and investment. However, this is not true when we are speaking of a capped-but-divisible money supply. The cryptomachine in general cannot go brrrrr.

6. The exact opposite happens. We establish a trust between citizens and the government through crypto. Because crypto incentives the government to share its balance, like any individual or corporation. Every dollar that is spend, must be validated. Countries like Greece, Venezuela, Zimbabwe can no longer press the printing press, cause no creditor wants to lend money to a country that cannot pay back the money. No fear for elected officials that run a country to endless debts anymore. Remember the blockchain is open and available to any person.

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 03.25.2021,"Hey Everyone!

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

Check out the daily youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/4oOrWCXWa4M](https://youtu.be/4oOrWCXWa4M)

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Today is Cardano 360 day!!!!  Watch it at the link below at 10:30AM Pacific, 17:30 GMT, 18:30 CET.  This is the live monthly streaming show from IOHK.  Watch this one. Hopefully we’ll get a target date for Alonzo.  That’ll tell us when we get smart contracts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg)
2. Looks like the Cardano 360 show may highlight how Cardano will not experience some of the shortcomings that leading blockchains have in the past (like the time that bitcoin accidentally issued 184 billion BTC in one block).  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1374783084881608706](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1374783084881608706)
3. Catalyst Fund 5 will have a $2MM total budget! Included will be a very interesting $50k Metadata challenge in Fund 5.  Metadata can be used to prove the existence of a certain document or event to third parties without necessarily revealing the data contained therein. This means you can do cool things on the blockchain without using smart contracts as in the prior New Balance anti-counterfeiting and Beefchain traceability Cardano projects.The winners of this challenge are actually going to be incubated and supported by the IOHK Metadata team! People waiting for Goguen and smart contracts are definitely sleeping on what can be done with metadata on Cardano today.

4. There is a Catalyst Dashboard available that gives you all the stats on the current projects in Cardano’s multi-million dollar decentralized innovation fund (the world’s biggest).

5. Charles says they are going to end up spending $15-30MM this year on research and they will hire 100-200 people. That’s an investment in the future of the ecosystem! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying "" Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. ~~Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?~~ RETIRED!
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years.
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

35. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have a hairline that is even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.
36. Cardano reached 550k wallets in half the time it took BTC [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1369933366368362496](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1369933366368362496)
37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum). This is one of those nice articles where the British guy pleasantly reads it to you if you want. Use this one to convince all your friends you are the ultimate blockchain expert:  “listen Kyle...the shortcoming of UTXO accounting is....” [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/)

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

74. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity. He specifically mentioned Atala Prism. There was talk of the digital identity being able to be linked to wallets, payment systems, and property. He also reasserted that the deals on the table in Africa would bring “millions of users” into the Cardano ecosystem.

79. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months.

90. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).

91. We are starting to see cracks in the psychological armor of the Ethereum crowd.  This anti-Cardano post was at 0 upvotes (at time of writing) while the fairly pro-Cardano response received triple figure upvotes.

92. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).

96. A guy tried to use Charles’s reaction to the King Soopers tragedy in Boulder to criticize Cardano. Charles told him to go f\*\*\* himself and then auctioned off the tweet with proceeds going to the families of the victims. The auction price quickly hit four figures and closed at $7k.

99. Great new interview with Sebastien! In this one he explains a lot about the dApp Connector being built by Emurgo. As reported by a commenter in one of our earlier threads, it will work with Ergo first and then Cardano. A very interesting tidbit was Sebastien’s explanation of how the Emurgo dApp Connector will actually be safer than Metamask (which fills a similar role in the ETH ecosystem).  Very good info. Thanks to Sebastien and the Cardano Podcast! [https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY](https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY)

If I do opt for the higher amount, I would have the 1850$ in my savings to help cushion some of the payments, proposing there's any issues in the future of paying it back.

btc,Forget email. Digital mailbox is what you need! worth a read.,"1980s BlockStream: I got it! ""Digital Mailbox!"" 


Me: Hmm. Interesting. Tell me more. 


BS: Well. You get physical paper messages of all types in your mailbox, right? We got these computers and this internet thing coming online...what if you recieved the messages electronically? And securely? Like a digital mailbox! 


Me: Sounds cool.   You know if I think this through... if this digital mailbox can receive messages it can just as easily send messages too. At all times. And I could send group messages or individual messages of any size to many people in a much more effective way than using the post office. Like electronic mail! Email! Maybe we could also-


BS: No! Forget Email. This is a Digital Mailbox. Its designed to be like your actual mailbox but digitally for the internet 🙃 


Me: Could you further explain? Maybe I'm confused 


BS: Sure no problem. We receive mail today and the store of those messages is your physical mailbox. Well we're going to need a place to store our digital messages which we'll eventually receive from our friends, family, and colleagues over the internet. Its technology. It's the future. Its headed in that direction. The Digital Mailbox will be able to receive messages from people all over the world. And you'll be able to access that mailbox   5 times a day! Let's be honest people only go to their mailbox once a day. Twice maximum. Our technology will allow users to check the mail up to 5 times every 24 hours! You can't get that in real life because the post office closes by 5pm 🤷‍♂️ 


Me: I...see. So tell me again why I couldn't send a message with this same technology? 


BS: Too cumbersome and expensive for the network.  Also does your mailbox send mail? No it receives it. 


Me: But I can place a letter inside my own mailbox and lift the stick thingy and the mail man will collect it the next day and mail it to where it needs to go? 


BS: Yes and that can still be done today. Digital Mailbox doesn't interfere with that🙃 


Me: Yeah but if digital mailbox can receive messages why can't it also-- 


BS: Its a store of messages. Meant to hold all the messages you receive from the internet. That's what its designed for. A different technology and network ""on top of"" the Digital Mailbox will do the sending - The Letter Network. Otherwise the digital mailbox network would become too congested and break down if we allowed individuals to send many messages per day. The way we set it up is our current mail system and physical network of post offices will have the specific Letter Network software in place to scan the messages you drop off and they'll upload it to the Digital Mailbox network throughout the day and the recipient will see the message arrive in their digital mailbox safe and sound. Our modern post office delivers physical messages once per day. With Digital Mailbox and the Letter Network they'll be ""delivering"" your messages up to 5 times per day! Isn't that awesome! 


Me: uh...yeah. The receiving of messages seems cool and interesting...But I feel we could do better with the sending of messages side of things... 


BS: Huh? Besides the Letter Network, sending of messages can be solved by ""side solutions"" like a facsimile (fax) machine, or a person can type their message on their word processor and utilize their printer to print it out and take their message to the post office or a private mail carrier such as FedEx. Those large private businesses, in addition to having a robust physical message delivery system in place, will now also have custodial Letter Network software designating them as ""digital letter carriers"" and those ""digital letter carriers"" will be able to send your important digital messages to your digital mailbox 🙃 


Me: This is getting complicated. At first you started off by saying family, friends, and colleagues will be sending/receiving digital messages for storage. To receive you have to send, no? 


BS: I know what I started off saying but the sending part just won't work. But look we're creating a big opportunity for innovation in the Letter Network!

personalfinance,Need help adjusting W4 after losing a source of Income.,"Married, filing jointly. 
Went from a 2 income household to a single income household. Would like to adjust so that I get more income in pocket. 
Florida has no income tax. 
Make $2000/week without tax. 
Normally get paid $1430.2 each week. 
But would like to make $1676. 
Employer takes $242.24 in federal tax every week.
$201.5 is taken out pre-tax for health insurance. 

I tried the IRS calculator twice, adjusting return to zero, turned in form to employer twice and each time my paycheck was still $1430.20, so I did something wrong. None of my family knows how to help. My HR person doesn't know how the form works either. 

I'm only 24, so if each 4a-4c line can be explained that would be helpful so I can figure out this stuff in the future. 
TIA!!!!

Edit: 
First time I filled out the form I click married filed jointly, two incomes with his income ending the week he actually quit his job. I filled in in our paycheck info, what we paid on federal per paycheck and ytd. I ended up with a form pre-filled that said $1 on line 4c after I adjusted for a $0 tax return.

CryptoCurrency,Why Bitcoin or a similar form of cryptocurrency will win over Fiat in the long run.,"Bitcoin or a similar form of cryptocurrency will eventually replace government fiat as the preferred means
of exchange. I'll use the term Bitcoin loosely here to refer to any such cryptocurrency that accomplishes that
goal. I'm going to construct the argument in four pieces.


First, Why bitcoin is good money.
Second, Why Fiat is bad money. 
Third, Why gold or other forms of market-based money are insufficient.
Fourth, why bitcoin will win.


1. Why is Bitcoin good money?


As we all know mankind has used many different things as money. Money's come and go and the adoption of one monetary standard over another is the rule rather than the exception throughout history. But a society's choice of money is not arbitrary. There are certain attributes of money which seem preferable to others. Gold scores highly on these attributes which is why it has remained an indelible monetary standard for millennia. To assess bitcoins likelihood of assuming the monetary throne for the next period of human history, one must first understand its attributes:

First I'll point out that Bitcoin possesses all the attributes not
only of good money but of supremely good money. It is not marginally better than alternatives rather it is in its own
league entirely. Bitcoin is provably scarce. There are only 21
million of them and there can never be more. I can tell you exactly how many there will be tomorrow, the answer is

18,663,975. 

I can tell you the supply a year from now and ten years
from now. Let's see any Central Bank attempt such a feat. And yet while scarce, bitcoin is easily divisible. One Bitcoin
can be cut into 100 million pieces and recombined at will. In terms of divisibility, bitcoin wins hands down over both fiat and gold. 

Bitcoin is also durable. A bitcoin exists as a ledger entry backed up on thousands of computers around the world. Certainly if the internet went down you'd be unable
to use bitcoin but that is also true of your credit cards, PayPal, banks in any other form of modern money.

Bitcoin is fungible each bitcoin is worth the same as every other it is recognizable. Every Bitcoin wallet can quickly attest whether bitcoin is legitimate or not. Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited unlike with gold. It cannot be filled with tungsten.

And as one of its greatest attributes bitcoin is highly portable. You can send it anywhere on earth for very little cost. It moves across borders with ease. It has no concept of borders. It has no weight, it has no smell and has
no physical body that can be blocked or apprehended. Indeed it is the only form of money today which can be moved at distance without trusting a third party. It is the only money that doesn't require permission from an overseer. Therefore it is the only money appropriate for free people. 

Finally, Bitcoin also possesses an important attribute which will one day be seen as critical for good money

 ""Programmability"". 

Bitcoin can be programmed to enable all
kinds of economic activity often without a middleman, escrow agent, or human arbitration of any kind. This programability without having to trust anyone is impossible with fiat. And in a digital age, will come to be one of its most important advantages. 



Next let's discuss

2. Why fiat is bad money?


Why should we care about cryptocurrencies and their attributes when we already have Fiat. Fiat works pretty well right? 

It's got pyramids and government buildings printed on it so you know it's valuable. Also it is backed by paper. Paper can be burned if you're cold in winter. Here is it's intrinsic value. Try that with gold.

But a skeptical observer should know that fiat money is
an absolute scam and something altogether inappropriate for an ethical market-based society. As I like to say
you cannot have a free market when the most important good money itself is centrally planned and controlled.

Fiat money and a market economy are mutually
exclusive concepts like oil and water. They can certainly be mixed up together when enough force is applied but they will naturally separate and dispel one another over time. 

Indeed the average lifespan of fiat is less than 50 years.
The US dollar only became fiat in 1971, that's less than the length of William Shatner's career and as it happens, he announced that he has started to mine bitcoins as well.

Regardless when examining at specific properties as money, most ways Fiat is unimpressive. 
First, it is not scarce it is systematically created out of thin air with no limit on supply nor can supply even be known. They are willed into existence by politicians and banks
because printing money enriches the printer at the expense of the public who holds the previously printed money. The
phenomenon is known as inflation or currency debasement.

Fiat also struggles with durability. Your fiat will only last so long as your bank permits and even then it slowly loses
its value. A melting ice cube.

Your bank can destroy your fiat with the click of a button. 
Ask a Cypriot, ask an Argentinean how durable Fiat is.

With fiat, you were ever dependent on a third party with your
wealth. Is that an attribute of money that you find attractive?

Some people are comfortable with it because they trust
their government but requiring trust in politicians seems a poor foundation upon which to build a prosperous society.

Finally, fiat is not nearly as portable as bitcoin.

Try to send an international wire right now. You can't
because it's after 5 o'clock! How quaint is that you can try tomorrow morning, as long as it's not Sunday because apparently God doesn't want you to use the financial system on the Sabbath. But even when successful you'll discover it
takes 3 to 5 days for your wire to arrive. You often have to physically go to the bank to do this. You have to fill
out a form on paper while someone making $15 an hour takes that info and types it back into a computer. 

Why do people put up with this nonsense? Indeed it is faster to attach cash to an anvil and FedEx it to Tokyo than it is to send an international wire.

Do you really think that that system is going to out-compete Bitcoin in an open marketplace? And you can only send Fiat if you have permission. 

Try to send it to a family member in Russia. You'll be censored. Want to donate to relief effort perhaps in Venezuela? Too bad, you'll be censored. 
Are you sending a suspicious amount? Your payment will be
blocked and you better get ready for questioning or outright confiscation. Yep, the Orwellian nanny state is alive and
well. And fiat currency is one of its most insidious tentacles.

Fiat has these poor monetary attributes because it is a
tool and appendage of the state. It exists to serve the state. 

Its attributes as money are intentionally constrained so as to siphon wealth to the state through debasement and to surveil and control the behavior of the King's subjects.

Remember that Fiat means value by decree, not by merit! 




3. Why are gold and other alternatives insufficient? 


Gold as a physical heavy commodity cannot be
efficiently used as money at scale. Imagine trying to run payroll with physical gold coins. Try to make change
for a pizza with bullion and forget about payment at strip clubs. Bruising women is not cool unless you're the New
York Attorney General Schneiderman.

Suffice to say that gold when in physical form is impractical for commerce. For gold to work in a modern economy it must be warehoused by a company and then digital certificates or credits must be issued against that gold. Those digital certificates could theoretically work well as money in a moderate economy except for one problem,
""Centralization"" 

A digital gold payment service or any privately issued
market-based money requires some form of centralized control or custody and thus exposes users to counterparty risk.

This is fatal. Because if such a private company ever grows to scale, the government could shut it down. Unplug its
servers, arrest their principal and seize it's assets.

This exact thing happened with ""E-gold"" and another company ""Gold money"" was so scared of this happening
that they stopped allowing payments of digital gold between customers entirely.

Private money when centralized probably cannot attain scale and thus cannot surpass Fiat because the government
won't allow it.



4. So why will Bitcoin or some superior form of CC win?

The coin will win because there is no competition in money. Bitcoin is the best money currently available because it's
decentralized. It cannot be stopped. 

It doesn't happen all at once. Nobody switches immediately from fiat and banks to Bitcoin and blockchain.

Rather Bitcoin will simply gradually come to be used as an occasional alternative to fiat. Individuals will find specific times and places in which it is easier, faster, safer or cheaper
to use Bitcoin to store or transfer wealth than to use credit cards or banks.

Indeed two billion people in the world don't even have credit cards or banks. For them the choice will be easy. Yet
despite the failings of the legacy system, Bitcoin now imbues every human on earth with financial sovereignty. With the coin, anyone of any age race or creed no matter which imaginary lines they were born within. 

And nothing more than a cheap smartphone, one can send and receive money anywhere in the world instantly at
near zero cost and there isn't a goddamn thing that anyone else in the world can do to stop that.

In fact, you don't even need to own a smartphone. You just need to access the internet once. It takes minutes to set up a software wallet and one can manually back up the seed phrase physically and carry it to the grave. You just need to share your address to other users (Manually even) and start accepting Bitcoin.

It is one of the most potent tools of individual empowerment
ever invented and is happening right infront of us.

Fiat now persists solely on the momentum of tradition.
The older generations may cling to it for quite some time but them and their ways are dying, and their wealth decays
in front of them openly, Orchestrated by the very people they worship salute and vote into office. 

Someday schoolchildren will laugh and joke with each other as they learn about the silly flag paper with cultish incantations inscribed on it which in yet another of history's
examples of mass delusion people thought to be valuable. 

Or maybe they won't laugh and joke because they will have learned how much destruction it actually caused.
Maybe fiat will be looked at more like medieval bloodletting. A dark symptom of human ignorance that is so obviously
foolish in hindsight.

Fiat will fall in time and in its place, True decentralized market-based money will emerge. The profit motive alone will lead capital gradually away from those assets which
can be debased and censored to those which cannot.

To future generations it will appear as inevitable as the
collapse of serfdom and for the very same reason this is why Bitcoin or someother cryptocurrency will eventually
replace government fiat.

personalfinance,Refinance break-even timing,"I'm looking at a refinance, and I'm having trouble on how to determine the break-even timing.

I currently have 21 years left of a 30 year mortgage, at 4.75% interest rate. The payment is $750, with 246 / mo to principal.

I got quoted a 20 year refinance, at 2.99% interest / 3.124% apr. The payment is $649. The closing costs are $2625, so it looks to me like the break-even timing would be a bit more than 2 years. 

Is there anything I'm missing here? Do the rates look roughly correct? Is there a way to bring down closing costs besides rolling them into the mortgage?",finance
personalfinance,Debt Validation,"What do y'all know about debt validation? Apparently it's a tool that is used to get credit card companies to eventually write off your debt for taxes.  
What is being pitched to me is that you stop paying the credit card companies so your debt goes to a 3rd party collections agency and the original credit card company writes you off for taxes.  
In the meantime, you stop paying your credit card debts and start paying this company who is really good at this.  
The company agrees to help you if you qualify for a financial hardship.  
They are telling me that I can have everything paid off in 2 years at a minimum monthly payment that is much lower than what I pay to all of the credit card companies now.  
Obviously my credit score is going to plummet by doing this but they assure me that in 6 months it goes back up because I will be debt free in reference to the credit card companies.  
I forget the name of this particular company.  
The guy was giving me salesman vibes, but I don't know. There seems to be a lot of different companies out there that do similar things.  
It's call financial restoration and apparently there is federal law that supports it.",finance

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-march-25.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stock futures turn lower after Fed chief Powell comments

&gt; * U.S. stock futures turned lower Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told NPR’s “Morning Edition” that Covid economic stimulus and vaccinations allowed the U.S. economy to recover faster than expected and that central bankers, at some point, may be able to pull back emergency support.

&gt; * Late-day selling reversed gains and dragged the S&amp;P 500 down 0.6% on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped lower in the final seconds of Wednesday’s session. The Nasdaq dropped 2% after a slightly higher open gave way to a day of selling. Tech stocks were lower despite the 10-year Treasury yield holding below recent a 14-month high as a market rotation out of high-flying growth names continued. The Nasdaq last closed at a record last month. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 last closed at record highs last week.

&gt; * The Labor Department is set to report its weekly look at jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the stock market opens. Economists expect 735,000 new filings for unemployment benefits last week. That would be down 35,000 from the prior week, which saw an unexpected jump even as many states relaxed Covid mitigation restrictions on businesses.

*****

&gt; # 2. AstraZeneca revises Covid vaccine data with lower efficacy rate

&gt; * AstraZeneca late Wednesday issued updated Covid vaccine numbers from its late-stage trial in the U.S. and Latin America after U.S. health officials earlier this week questioned the accuracy of preliminary data. The U.K.-based drug giant now said its vaccine is 76% effective in protecting against symptomatic cases of virus. A release issued on Monday reported an efficacy rate of 79%. AstraZeneca reiterated its two-shot regimen was “well tolerated” among participants and no safety concerns were identified.

*****

&gt; # 3. Biden to hold first news conference of presidency

&gt; * The White House announced Thursday that it’s dedicating another $10 billion to try to drive up vaccination rates in low-income, minority and rural communities. More than 25% of the entire U.S. population received at least one vaccine dose, including 14% who have been fully vaccinated. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require two shots, while Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine is only one shot.

&gt; * Against the backdrop of rising Covid cases in many states and more than 30 million total U.S. infections, President Joe Biden is set to hold his first news conference. He’s expected to point to a surge in vaccinations, encouraging signs in the economy and the benefits Americans will receive from the latest sweeping stimulus package. He’s also likely to face a wide range of questions from U.S.-Mexico border security to gun control in the wake of mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia.

*****

&gt; # 4. Oil prices slide as Covid concerns outweigh Suez Canal disruptions

&gt; * Oil prices fell Thursday as fuel demand concerns re-emerged alongside worries about steps back in the global fight against Covid. Prices of U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude and the Brent international benchmark each dropped roughly 2%, one day after they both surged nearly 6% on the crude shipping disruptions caused by the grounding of a giant container ship in the Suez Canal, a major trade route. It could “take weeks” to clear, according to the CEO of a Dutch company helping with the salvage efforts.

*****

&gt; # 5. Lawmakers to press tech CEOs over speech, misinformation

&gt; * Big Tech leaders Thursday are scheduled to testify at a virtual House panel hearing on efforts to prevent their platforms from spreading falsehoods and inciting violence. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, whose company owns Google and YouTube, will face increased pressure following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the rise in Covid vaccine misinformation. There’s increasing support in Congress for imposing new curbs on legal protections regarding speech posted online.

Forex,ZAR INTEREST RATE 25 MARCH 2021,"**Country of release -** South Africa

**What does the data mean to the market?**  Higher interest rates are great for the value of the currency. Higher interest rates will create a BUY on ZAR Pairs and vice versa. 

**Historic Deviations and Their Outcome**

We see deviations often. We have seen 4 deviations since November 2018.which is great from a two-monthly report. 

**April 2020 -** We had a surprise cut of 1.5%, it was unscheduled, and the market wasn't ready to react. We don't have a chart for this, as it's an infrequent scenario. 

**March 2020 -** An excellent cut of -0.50 gave a 1600 pip move over 3 mins. Not on the chart the data arrives 9 mins late, so the chart time is 13.09

See charts here.

**Today's Forecasts**

Forecast No Change at 3.50%

**Today's Trade Plan**

If we see a 0.25 deviation, then we can expect the market to go into shock, and we would target a total move of at least 800 pips. Hopefully, this would provide multiple opportunities to enter and rack up some nice pips.

personalfinance,NES (Navient Collections) is willing to settle my $88k private loan debt for $17k. Should I pay them?,"I have received two letters from National Enterprise Systems for two loans I had signed up for through Navient over 10 years ago, one for $42k and the other for $46k. I know that I owe them money for the college education I pissed away. I am able to pay this debt, but it would wipe out all of the savings I have been able to accrue since last year. I am not currently employed, so a payment option is unlikely. I have about $20k saved up after selling a bunch of stuff and stimulus checks. Has anyone been able to successfully negotiate a lower settlement? I'm pinched for time because I have until the end of the month to send them a payment to settle according to their letter.

I've been researching most of the night and I've heard some real horror stories from people who paid the settlement and then got a letter stating that I owe more. I am contacting a debt lawyer today to see if they have any advice, but I'm not even sure what questions I should be asking or if I should just pay it and figure out how to generate income until things get better for me. They have never sent me a letter like this before. On one hand, blowing out almost the entirety of my debt in one fell swoop would be worth clearing out my bank account. On the other hand, it would leave me with a small emergency fund until I could find better employment. Ideally if it was $10k or less I would pay it no questions asked but I'm afraid to wait and see.

Current situation:

Navient: -$88k

Fed AES: -$5k (no interest until October)

Savings: $20k

Income: $800/month (cash)

Loans: 120 days late as of May 2015, TransUnion credit report estimates they will be removed 10/21 (should I believe this? What does it mean for me?)

Edit: I have an appointment with a debt lawyer on tuesday, settlement is due Wednesday, cutting it close :]

Edit 2:

**CONCLUSION**

If you're like me, you have probably spent hours scouring this subreddit trying to find answers, but people never update their posts after they reach a solution. I sat down with a debt attorney and they warned me of the tax implications for having so much debt written off, they told me to talk to a CPA, my CPA said that I will owe the IRS over $11,000 next year, but by that time I will be prepared. I called NES and told them I could pay 5k and they countered with just over 7k. I wired them the money after I got an updated settlement offer from them via email. Always get communication in writing before sending money to anyone. They were willing to work with me once I was willing to pay. The lawyer warned me that the SoL doesn't really matter because they will keep the account open (unclear to me how) and the SoL wouldn't start until October. So they would have still been able to come after me for the debt. The lawyer also mentioned that any sort of forgiveness program would not have applied to me anyway.",finance

Bitcoin,How bitcoin “loans” are a bad deal. Think adversarially!,"I know on reddit conventional wisdom is reinforced by downvoting any challenging content, so to those browsing r/bitcoin/new I want you to remember that downvote is for spam. This is not spam, even if you disagree with my opinions.

I’m trying to get people to HODL.

But its hard, everywhere you look there are scammers, and scammers lie.

Lately theres a lot of talk about bitcoin loans, but people are clearly not seeing the trick. 

There are two types of loans— 

TYPE ONE - you loan them bitcoin and you get paid interest. 

With these loans you give up your keys so that they can then loan your bitcoin out to short sellers at a higher interest rate.  

The *only* reason to borrow bitcoin is to sell it short.  If you just want bitcoin, no need to borrow it, you can just buy it. 

This is a bad deal because you are risking your ~%90 returns for %6 returns from people who are short bitcoin and facing bankruptcy. When the hedge fund goes bankrupt you have no recourse.  You can sue BlockFi, but they are bankrupt and you probably aren’t even first in line. 

THE SECOND TYPE - you loan out your bitcoin, and pay *them* interest, while getting half the value of your bitcoin as fiat.

You are loaning them bitcoin as much as they are loaning you fiat. But they want twice as much bitcoin as they will give you fiat— and they want to charge interest!

Think about that. Which is the safer currency?  Which is more volatile?  You’re accepting %100 of the volatility risk in exchange for getting a half the value in depreciating currency. 

Meanwhile they stand posed to steal your bitcoin, with no recourse, in the event of a TEMPORARY dip! 

If bitcoin drops temporarily you can get liquidated WITHOUT a chance to put up more collateral, at any time.  This is in the unchained capital rules.  I bet blockfi is the same.  It happens with software so their claim of “independent third party holding a key” is a lie. The third party works for unchained. 

But if it moons they can take their sweet time in covering their butts for what they owe you. With limitations of only doing it once a month, on their terms.

Notice how all of the terms are biased in favor of them?  They charge you interest, give you half the value, will liquidate you completely at parity, and severely restrict your ability to collect when the market hoes against their short position (they are short bitcoin, because your bitcoin is a liability to them, while your debt is an asset.) 

 They have all the power and the rules are not symmetrical. And you are just supposed to trust them. 

Part of the scam is they obscure what is really happening, they are pretending this is like a home loan when it suits them. But it isn’t. A home is an illiquid asset and foreclosure is a long process with the homeowners rights being protected. Here you have no rights if you are liquidated, and there is no long process they need to do to sell bitcoin on the market.

They are charging you interest to borrow your bitcoin, but the return on BTC is higher than fiat. Meanwhile they get your bitcoin for free and by being short bitcoin are by definition a worse credit risk than you. 

THE SOLUTION: 

A genuine solution would be to give you the full fiat value of your bitcoin, which is locked in multisig under strict terms preventing liquidation. During the term of the loan, no changes can be made, without regard to the bitcoin price unless both parties agree. 

At the end of the loan, the fiat is paid back and the parties split the return, or losses, due to the Bitcoin price changes. 
 
eg:  you put up 10BTC when BTC is at $60k.  It goes into a multisig lock with genuine people independent third party. They pay you $600k and the agreement us 50/50 split. 

Then later, bitcoin is at $100k. You pay back the $600k in fiat, they pay you back 8 BTC.  They profit 2 BTC. You are getting $800k in BTC back on your $600k loan. 

If BTC declines, you both share in losses. 

This is what a pro-bitcoin company would do. They earn BTC from the loan. 

What unchained are doing is betting they will get to seize your bitcoin because of volatility, or make a risk free return on the carry trade of cantillion fiat if they don’t. 

You take all the risk. They take none.  And a single bad day that is quickly reversed— the kind of thing hedge funds like to cause happen, wipes you out.,

————-

For reference, because I know people aren’t aware of it:

If BTC drops %30– very common— you have 4 hours.  I sire hope you aren’t asleep, and are awake, ready to send them BTC collateral!

If it drops %45, you are liquidated immediately, bo chance to send collateral.  How is it multisig if they can liquidate immediately? It’s not. They just pretend like they are accountable. 

From:
https://unchained-capital.com/blog/ultimate-guide-bitcoin-loans/#What_happens_if_the_price_of_bitcoin_drops_during_the_loan

“If the price of bitcoin drops further and causes the loan to decrease to a CTP ratio of 135%, the time to respond to the margin call is accelerated. Borrowers then have 4 hours to either deposit additional bitcoin collateral or fund a partial repayment of the loan principal to improve the CTP ratio.
Finally, in the most extreme bitcoin price drops, Unchained Capital must immediately liquidate loans at 110% CTP. This is the worst case scenario, but we must follow this rule without exception to ensure that Unchained can continue to lend to clients in the future.”",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Student Loans vs. 401K?,"Hey all,

27 year old first gen college graduate here now working at a Biglaw firm in NY making upwards of 190k with lockstep raises as long as I can hang around.

No financial background or familial safety net. I have around 130K in loans - could go up to 200k soon because SO is going back to school (but then we will be dual income. Her earning range is high 60k starting out).

My 130k of debt is all fed student at around 6.5-7% deferred until Sept.  Currently; I am building a war chest of savings and maxing my 401K while those loans sit interest free. No employer match. I have considered refinancing my loans; but I dig the insurance policy of protections that Fed Loans give in the odd event I get canned in an expensive city.

My question: should I even be maxing my 401K right now? Or instead saving all of that in liquid to dump into those loans? I realized that the growth in the 401k is probably about equal or worse than the interest rate on my student debt. But I'm not literate enough to know for sure the better move.

All thoughts appreciated.",finance
stocks,Jobless claims fall to lowest level of the pandemic,"&gt;New jobless claims fell to the lowest levels of the pandemic era, federal data shows, with 684,000 being filed last week.  
&gt;  
&gt;The previous weekly high was 695,000, set in October 1982.  
&gt;  
&gt;Initial unemployment claims fell by 97,000, another sign that the economic impact of the [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) pandemic is easing. An additional 241,745 filed claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, for gig and self-employed workers.  
&gt;  
&gt;The total number of claims for all types of unemployment benefits was 18.95 million for the week ending March 6, according to Department of Labor [data](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf).  
&gt;  
&gt;The surge in new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations has slowed in recent weeks, though health officials are eyeing states that have removed restrictions on businesses and mask-wearing. The United States has seen a [4 percent rise in new cases](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=sf_coronavirus_subnav) in the past week.  
&gt;  
&gt;But Americans are still holding out hope that increasingly broadened access to the coronavirus vaccines are the key to returning to work, more job availability, and an improved economy. Nearly 14 percent of the U.S. population, or about 46,365,000 people, have completed vaccination.

CryptoCurrency,DeFi: A guide on Decentralized Finance for beginners,"# Decentralized Finance

 or “DeFi” is an independently operating financial system that does not rely on centralized financial intermediaries like banks, unions or insurance funds.

The users, with the use of smart contracts, have the ability to trade, invest, and transact peer to peer using crypto currencies.

This eliminates the middle man which in this case are the slow and costly intermediaries.

DeFi is a complex financial use case of blockchain, helping in taking the right step towards mainstream adoption of crypto and blockchain technology. Other such cases include flash loans, derivatives, yield farming and lending.

# Why DeFi?

Centralized financial systems are slow, costly and vulnerable to data hacks, breaches and security issues. To make understanding the concept of DeFi simpler, think of a scenario where your bank makes a bad investment, or increases its fees. It ends up with the customer losing out.

In DeFi, the products, applications, and services, as well as the assets they service, are decentralized and therefore free from these points of failure found in centralized financial systems.

# Advantages of DeFi

Users have the flexibility to trade and transact with nothing but an internet connection, eliminating any scope of discrimination taking place

Instant and fast transfers along with reduced fees and charges are the most immediate benefits a user can observe while using DeFi. There are none to minimal intermediaries, reducing the need of paying the said intermediaries using fees.

DeFi lending protocols offer high interest rates for deposits along with low fees and favorable terms on loans and line of credit

DeFi offers equitable access to financial services to all and anyone with just an internet connection.

Yield farming allows investors to borrow and lend their crypto currencies at much higher rates than traditional banking and investments

&amp;#x200B;

This has been a thorough overview of what DeFi is, and how it is useful to the crypto community. I would like to make a follow up post on DeFi in detail

personalfinance,Converting Trad IRA to Roth IRA. Can I skip paying estimated tax if income last year was low?,"I'm planning to convert \~$6k in a Trad IRA to a Roth. Our marginal federal tax rate is 12%, so we'll need to pay around $700 in taxes. However, from what I can find on the IRS website, you can avoid the tax underpayment penalty as long as your total withholding is at least 100% of the previous year's taxes. Our 2020 taxes were very low and our income went up a lot this year, so our 2021 withholding will definitely exceed the previous year's tax. Does that mean I can avoid paying estimated tax on the IRA conversion and wait until next year's tax filing deadline with no underpayment penalty?",finance
Bitcoin,Jerome Powell - Bitcoin Is a Substitute for Gold,"Jerome Powell is a Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He sees Bitcoin as a Gold Substitute, rather than the dollar, the only problem, he underlined, is that crypto assets, including bitcoin, are highly volatile and not quite useful as a store of value.

He said:  “Crypto assets are highly volatile, see bitcoin, and therefore are not really useful as a store of value. And, they are not backed by anything. They are more of an asset for speculation. They are also not particularly in use as a means of payment. It's more a speculative asset. It's essentially a substitute for gold, rather than for the dollar.""

personalfinance,Budgeting Monthly Income,"I am a 29 year old traveling medical professional so the majority of my money comes in stipends, which AFAIK is not taxable income. Keeping that in mind, I have a few questions:

1. I am trying to balance where my income goes each month and have set up these percentages. Do these seem reasonable?

-Savings - 30% (not saving for anything in particular, but would consider buying a house down the road after my traveling career is over, if I decide to switch to a permanent location)

-Crypto - 7% (this is something I want to keep putting into, but could be flexible on percentages and timing of it, if I would be better served paying off my auto-loan first).

-Checking/Spending - 30% (taking care of monthly bills as well as having some money for dates, hobbies, etc)

-401k - 23% (this will max out the $19,500)

-Charity - 10% (non-negotiable)

2. I have an auto-loan with a balance of ~20k left on it and an interest rate of 3.5%. My current plan was to have 5k in my savings account (will happen within the next 2 pay periods) and then start putting most of my savings money into the auto-loan to get it taken care of ASAP before returning to the full 30% in savings each month. Is that an appropriate way to manage that?

3. I have about 170k in student loans but am holding off on payment on those to get everything else in my life in order. Am hoping for some federal forgiveness but not holding out for that too much with Biden, so I will be resuming those payments once my auto-loan is knocked down a bit.

4. I have a SIMPLE IRA through my previous job that has about 8k in it. Should I keep it in there or is there a way for me to roll it over into my new 401k?

5. Final question! Being that I am a traveler with low taxable income, should I be putting the majority of my 401k contribution into a ROTH? It seems to me that I'll be paying lower taxes now than I would upon withdrawal. Am I thinking about this in the correct way?",finance

personalfinance,Just started my first refi process with Chase. Rate is locked for 45 days. What are my options if appraisal differs from my current estimated value?,"First time home owner (bought two years ago). Just started refinance process with Chase (who currently holds our mortgage). The estimated value I gave is what another lender quoted me based on comps. Our development was built two years ago.

Questions:

1. With the quoted property value, I would have enough loan to value to get rid of PMI. What happens if the appraisal comes back with a significantly lower valuation that puts me back in PMI zone? Do I just go back to paying PMI until I hit that 20% equity?
2. I opted for a partial cash-out where the closing costs are rolled into the loan. However, I still have $5K cash to close that they're asking for, but the officer says since I'll be paying my mortgage until we close, that number will go down. I asked him to explain what this number is (how it differs from closing costs) and why it couldn't be rolled into the loan, but he wasn't clear. What exactly is this number for, why does it go down as I pay subsequent mortgage payments until close, and why can't it be bundled with the loan?
3. From what I'm seeing in this sub, the 2.875% interest rate I got (3.097% APR) is not bad. Is it actually good? My current interest is 4.125%.

personalfinance,Student loan questions,"Hello all,

I graduated in April of 2020 and started in May of 2020 a good job in tech sector making 75k, not ""The Valley"" so that's why not insanely high, but definitely high for my area, and with a company that is almost guaranteed to not let me go anytime soon.





Here are my numbers


- 20664 all federal across 5 (4 years, but did summer classes each year since double major both in tech had a lot of extra credits) loans at varying interest rates.
- currently expected to pay 213/month after payments resume


- emergency fund is currently at 3 months expenses, want it at 6


- 409/freeing up in my budget starting in January (0% credit card, 409/months pays it off right before interest gets applied, December is last payment. Used it to get everything I needed to live a lifestyle I was happy with. Love baking and finally get to do it so got some nice equipment and yeah. I feel justified because its for lifestyle balance, not necessarily budget creep as without it I wouldn't be being able to bake daily all kinds of treats and I wouldn't really be as happy, plan to open a bakery eventually even but I digress).

Well, I have six different options for paying it back and want to know whats best in communities opinion..

Option 1: pay back minimum payments of 213 a month, pay off in 2027. Put remaining 196 per month towards emergency fund to build it up.

Option 2: Transfer 409 monthly payments to student loans, pay it off by late 2024.

Option 3: Get on the Consolidated Repayment Plan at 83/month, put the rest of the 326/month towards emergency funds then pay down at 409/month. Pay down estimate is 2026. 

Option 4: Same idea, but switch funds from paying down to home down payment. Pay down is 2041.

Option 5 and 6 are the same as 3 and 4, but with a slowly growing rate starting at 47/month towards the loan and slowly growing to 140 over a period of time, with a growth every 2 years. 

I know the best option to pay least interest is pay 409/month all the way, but I want an emergency fund of 6 months not 3, and I want to get a house in the next two to three years, I want out of the renting life for when me and wifey have kids. 

I feel secure in my job but not secure in being able to find another one if need me (imposter syndrome I hate it...) so yeah.

Also, second question.

If I do the consolidated loan repayment plans through the federal government now, does that end my ability to defer payments and interest or no? I believe they stay as federal loans right? As long as its done through the studentaid.gov website?

If student loan forgiveness did appear, since they're still federal, would it be likely they get forgiven as well or no since they're consolidated?",finance

personalfinance,Student loan refinance,"I’m not sure if this is better suited for r/studentloans but figured I would try my luck here first.

I refinanced my private student loans in 2019:
- $56,665.91 @ 5.510% for 15 years with a $465 monthly payment 

Now I am looking to refinance again to get a lower interest rate. I’ve input my information and a couple options came up (note my balance is now $50k):
- 10 years, $496.14/mo @ 3.57%
- 15 years, $366.67/mo @ 3.87%
- 20 years, $310.24/mo @ 4.27% 

I need help deciding which option makes the most sense financially. My gut tells me the 20 year option is a no-go despite the lowest monthly payment. I’m open to the 10 year option but it may be difficult to swing that monthly payment as I already struggle with the $465/mo. However, I recently landed a new job that comes with a large pay increase. 

I’ve done the math and if I did it correctly even though I’d be starting over from the beginning if I go with the 15 year option I would pay a total of $66,000 versus about $71,000 if I don’t refinance. 

Just looking for advice here. I feel like “pay off debt as fast as possible” is drilled into my brain so the 10 year option seems appealing to me, but cutting my monthly payment by almost $100 sounds nice too...

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 25, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 25, 2021**

Stocks rose on Thursday, shaking off three consecutive days of losses in yet another volatile trading session. Market participants continue to monitor recent comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the Treasury yield, and the coronavirus situation in Europe. 

In an interview with NPR's Morning Edition Thursday morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency."" This is the latest in a long string of comments from Powell and other monetary officials, like Janet Yellen, that point to the maintenance of accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future. 

However, despite Powell’s consistency in his statements, many market participants continue to fear that coming inflationary pressures could cause the Fed to tighten monetary policy earlier than expected. Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo said, “This will be the first time that every country in the world is emerging from recession simultaneously. And the Fed and other policymakers are banking on this idea that it’ll be a relatively short strain on supply chains but eventually, things get up and running again and you can get the input components to where they’re most needed.” 

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to hover around 1.6%, falling from 1.75% earlier in the week. Despite the decline, the Treasury yield remains at elevated levels compared to 12 months ago, with the expectation that the yield will continue climbing as the economy reopens and recovers. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

We agree, rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Moreover, earlier in the week the, US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)).  In a late-night news release Wednesday, AstraZeneca said it had analyzed more data from that study and concluded the vaccine is 76% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, instead of the 79% it had reported earlier in the week, [insisting the vaccine was “strongly effective” against the virus. ](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-strong-protection-us-rift-466726258e5e546550907f123f67763d)

Fed says banks will have to wait until June 30 to start issuing buybacks and bigger dividends

* **Big banks will be allowed to resume normal levels of dividend payouts and share repurchases as of June 30, as long as they pass this year’s stress test.**
* **Payouts had been restricted based on income, as a precautionary move during the Covid-19 pandemic.**
* **Banks that fail the stress test will have to wait until Sept. 30, and face even more stringent measures if they still don’t meet capital requirements by then.**

Banks will be able to accelerate dividends and buybacks to shareholders this year, but not until June 30 and provided they pass the current round of stress tests, the Federal Reserve announced on Thursday.

The biggest Wall Street institutions have been limited based on income in their ability to do both for nearly the past year as a precautionary measure during [the Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/covid-live-updates.html).

The Fed had said late last year that it would begin allowing regular disbursements in the first quarter of 2021, so the Thursday announcement pushes that date back.

ADVERTISING

“The banking system continues to be a source of strength and returning to our normal framework after this year’s stress test will preserve that strength,” Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.

Bank stocks rose in after-hours trading on the news, with Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase up around 1%.

Lifting the restrictions only applies to institutions that maintain proper capital levels as evaluated through the stress tests. Under normal circumstances, capital distributions are guided by a bank’s “stress capital buffer,” a measure of capital that each bank should carry based on the riskiness of its holdings.

The income-based measures [were put in place](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/fed-to-allow-big-banks-to-resume-share-buybacks-with-limitations.html) as a safeguard to make sure banks had enough capital as the pandemic tore through the U.S. economy.

Any bank not reaching the target will have the pandemic-era restrictions reimposed until Sept. 30. Banks that still can’t meet the required capital levels will face even stricter limitations.

The financial sector is one of the stock market’s leaders this year, with the group up 14.7% year to date on the S&amp;P 500. People’s United, Fifth Third and Wells Fargo have led the banking space.

The announcement comes a day after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who chaired the Fed from 2014-18, said [she would be comfortable](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/yellen-supports-buybacks-warren-wants-blackrock-deemed-too-big-to-fail.html) with lifting the restrictions on dividends and buybacks.

At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Yellen said she agreed both with the decision to suspend capital disbursements, and to resume them.

“I have been opposed earlier when we were very concerned about the situation the banks would face about stock buybacks,” Yellen said. “But financial institutions look healthier now, and I believe they should have some of the liberty provided by the rules to make returns to shareholders.”

Banks bought back just $80.7 billion of their shares in 2020, with most coming before the pandemic hit.",finance

personalfinance,I want to start investing. My mom tells me I shouldn’t because it will affect my financial aid for college.,"TL;DR: I want to invest in stocks. My mom is telling me I can’t because then I’ll get less aid money for college. Any advice?

I (18F) am currently receiving admission decisions and financial aid packages from colleges. I’ve gotten into some local colleges with full merit aid, but they don’t really interest me like some private colleges that are away from home (this is important to me) and carry a huge price tag. My parents are passive-aggressively “okay” with paying for college.

My dad owns a construction company and our FAFSA Estimated Family Contribution (EFC) is approximately $46k. I don’t think I would be receiving any need-based financial aid anyways.

They transferred all of my life savings, approximately 36k, from my savings account into theirs because our personal college advisor said something along the lines of, the less assets I have, the greater chance I’ll get more financial aid. 

I’m unemployed, haven’t worked since the summer of 2018, and am financially dependent on my parents. My debit card is on my name, but opened under my mom’s account (so I think she sees all the deposits and spending? Can someone lmk if she can??).

Now that I’m 18, I want to invest in stocks. My mom is telling me I can’t because then I’ll get less money for college, since I would report that I have some assets on the FAFSA. 

She’s telling me to invest under her name and account. I don’t want to since I was to gain financial independence—and independence in general—from my parents. 

Generally, my mom is very manipulative when it comes to guilt tripping me about how much money they spend on me, like on clothes or other things, so I can only imagine how they’re going to constantly hold the cost of a private college over my head...

How should I proceed from here? Is she right?

If so, can/should I claim myself as an independent, even though I’m not working right now, so then I could potentially receive federal money next year?

I made a bad decision but I paid my debt, had no restitution, judgements, etc.- 

I've had good standing accounts for the last 3-5  years with American Express, Capital One, Chase (consumer credit cards), along with TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab (ROTH IRA/Investment funds). Two years ago, I noticed my AMEX account was terminated. A year later, my Capital One and USAA account was closed. I wasn't given any notifications about these closures. A few months ago, my Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade accounts were also shut down. 

I began calling each company, trying to find the reason. Almost every response was the same: ""It was a business decision"" or ""Our terms of service allow us to shut down any account without discretion"". 

My financial advisor who managed my ROTH IRA at Schwab called me after my account was closed and said he spoke to a friend at Schwab and apparently it had to do with me being on the 'AML' or anti-money laundering list. I have no clue how to launder money nor was it related to my conviction.

I pulled my Chexsystems report and it was completely fine. I even pulled my LexisNexis Risk Solutions report and nothing was there.

CryptoCurrency,"BTC/Crypto is not in an another bubble, there will not be a major crash in the near future like the ""experts"" have suggested and here is why.","This so called current ""BItcoin Bubble"" as per various media and experts doesn't actually exist. But a consideration should be made for the ripple effects of COVID.

I was considering just adding this to discussion thread but I think there has been some major fear mongering and in my opinion; outlandish predictions saying BTC hill hit $300,000 and then fall into a nuclear crypto winter taking a massive nose dive of the likes we saw in 2018 or worse.

Now for those of you who swear by the coin, I personally love it, but normally opt to hold alts like Eth and some defi types because of just how interesting the technology is and it is often financially more accessible with upswings that are more tailored to my investment preferences. I liken it to loving physical gold but holding mostly silver.

Again these concepts are nothing new, but what has been bothering me lately is these ""New wave btc bubble"" posts such as this: 

[Bitcoin could surge to $300,000 — but winter could last for years when the bubble bursts, says crypto entrepreneur](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/bitcoin-btc-may-hit-300000-but-bubble-could-burst-after-peak-bobby-lee.html?__twitter_impression=true&amp;recirc=taboolainternal)

I can say that after witnessing the recent surges and the volatility becoming semi-predictable and there may be notable and predictable patterns. These include which players enter the arena, who is spending on what, or even how someone of high significance tweeting gives tangible insight on how the BTC market will react. It seems evident to me.

Will BTC reach 300k anytime soon? Doubtful. 100k? Easily.  Are we in another bubble that will cause a massive crash like 2018? Extremely unlikely if not downright ridiculous unless BTC suddenly breaks or gets dethroned and rendered obsolete which again is next to nil. It has become too much of a standard already.

Now the reason I make the point of saying this isn't the typical ""bubble"" we have seen in the past with BTC, is because of the mass adoptions by almost all the big corporations and even government entities coming to realize there can actually exist a fine line of regulation yet very valuable and far more convenient and efficient uses for BTC by integration or in combination with fiat, than simply being a layman's hodling commodity dismissed via nonsense like blackmarket fear mongering. And Federal panic that their printers are going to stop suddenly and society will be enveloped in darkness and utter financial chaos will ensue. This is irrational and improbable. Besides its too late even if that had any remote basis in reality.

i believe the Feds are actually realizing they cant fight the expansion of BTC and crypto in general for that matter (I'll get to DeFi shortly). Feds have no choice as even banks are pressuring them to start taking cues from larger companies; and especially how payment providers are utilizing and integrating BTC on a global scale because we are now at that pivotal point - companies, e-commerce and private holders are also holding up a middle finger: 'no governing body can completely and effectively stop this technology as was a main point of its inception. Working as intended.'

This isn't a bubble, it is the cusp of global and mass adoption being accepted across almost all financial sectors with the standards being set by the tech and those who utilize it, the utilization is the very means of getting access to that control with no off switch and that is universal by design. Thus, I believe the value of BTC will gradually rise due to its ever increasing demand, usage and finity. Of course there are the outliers; we may see some usual ebbs and flows correlating to venture, integration and even potential future fork announcements, but BTCs nature and trajectory should theoretically keep it on a steady and organic rise in value through the foreseeable future.

Mining methods are already transitioning and mostly reserved to large data processing centres to even be substantually profitable, mass adoption is moving faster than we can even validate it. I am estimating new adoptions currently being made, around the globe, every minute of everyday. This could eventually include the Feds changing their tune to its allocation in a global fashion to acknowledge it as it was meant to be: a universal currency...just maybe.  

Within the next few years it will likely be considered abnormal for global businesses and e-commerce companies to not have at least some form of integration of BTC or they will be left in the dust, considering the possible increase in values of proprietary software and hardware systems alone, that allow for companies to tap into the blockchain seamlessly. Not to mention the lost revenues.

On the other hand this is also where I believe a ""parallel universe effect"" could have Bitcoin no longer being the single, be all and end all, leader of the pack. Ethereum's smart tech and the freedom of DeFi are becoming more attractive and accessible, thus leading to a choice scenario within universal adoption. You would have BTC as the grandfathered staple ""money"" and then a form of Eth and DeFi as the universal and attractive choice for specialized transactions. Both providing the baseline and premium options. I guess an analogy would be ""would you like to pay with cash, debit or credit?"" 

I am no expert on this stuff but as a career analyst I could see this being the ultimate outcome for global acceptances. What do you guys think about my opinions on this, is it flawed? And am I wrong to suggest there is no longer a bubble effect rather a stabilized adoption effect taking hold, meaning a future crash for BTC and ETH to be highly improbable?

CryptoCurrency,"The biggest indicator for cryptocurrency financial success is a superheated US economy and increased inflation rates. When, if at all will that happen?","In the months since democrats first proposed a $1.9trn fiscal stimulus, established economists have been sounding the alarm, with one, Larry Summers describing the current macroeconomic policy the least responsible in 4 decades. What are their biggest concerns and how could this play out in crypto markets?

Inflation is triggered by an acceleration of money creation to accommodate a governments budgetary needs, in this case, amongst other things the $1400 stimulus landing in bank accounts as we speak. It also should be noted that the stimulus itself is equal in value to the additional savings the middle class has made in the last 12 months (not going on holidays and not spending extravagantly whilst working from home). 

This worst (*or best if you’re invested in crypto*) case scenario would begin with the newly vaccinated US consumers going on a spending spree with their healthy savings - spending at a rate where the production of goods and availability of services cannot keep up with demand. A very high demand for goods with a lack of supply leads to increased prices. 

A good analogy would be imagine suddenly every bar in the US had 100 people queued up outside every night- the price of a beer would quickly rise as it is the best way to deal with demand and maximise profits. This is called superheating. A temporary increase in inflation whilst the market adapts to increase its supply. 

This temporary inflation could however be made permanent by a perpetual cycle of worker anxiety. Workers, fearing this sudden increase in prices, fear the cost of living will continue to rise - they demand higher wages and their employers in turn increase the price of their goods or services in order to fund these increased wages. In this doomsday scenario the self fulfilling anxiety driven cycle could lead to 10%+ interest rates. 

Traditionally investors have several options during hyper-inflationary periods. Notably, stocks and shares tend to underperform in periods of hyperinflation whilst bonds and commodities increase. For instance in 1979 the inflation rate was 13% - with an annual Gold Price increase of 133%. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 lost value in real terms with an increase of only 12.31%

History tends to be a good indicator of the future, but with no data to draw on, no one knows exactly how Bitcoin or Ether will react to hyperinflation. We can make an educated guess and assume it will rise sharply in anticipation of a superheated economy. Institutional investors would look to a variety of assets including Bitcoin - *which is why I believe Goldman Sachs restarted their crypto desk a few weeks ago*. If those hyperinflationary fears materialise we would likely see gains anew.

**All eyes now should be to Biden and congress to see exactly how they will finance the $3Trn infrastructure bill. If it is funded by more borrowing (As opposed to higher taxes) there is a higher risk of a superheating economy and the gains $$$ we are looking for here in the crypto sphere.**

I made roughly 400k off some risky investments I’m sure you can take a guess on what they were, but anyways not entirely sure the best route from here. Currently I have 5k in credit card debt, 20k in student loans and anticipate another 15k for my final year. Car is paid off and living at home at the moment so no rent. My plan is to pay off my credit card debt and my private student loans that have high interest rates and the federal ones I’ll make monthly payments on once I graduate because they have low fixed rate interest rates. I know I’m going to get whacked with some hefty capital gains tax,but is there anything else I should be doing?

Edit: Thanks for all the advice I appreciate it.",finance

personalfinance,Should I get a 14K car on a 28K income?,"I'm just so sick of looking for a car. Carvana approved me for 14K with a 9% interest rate. Should I accept? The monthly payments would be 250 and the insurance would be 200. So plus about 150-250 in gas (I have to commute far), my car would cost me almost a full 2 week paystub. I make about 800 per paystub after taxes.

But I live at home so my other paystub covers all my other bills. Should I do this?

personalfinance,Best High Yield Savings Account? Considering switching from T-Mobile Money,"I've been parking my money with T-Mobile money to get the 4% interest rate on the first $3,000 and 1% after that ever since rates dropped with Citi Accelerate, Ally, Discover, AMEX, etc. It's worked out so far for me, and I've got around $30,000 sitting in that account, but they're switching from having to deposit 200/month to having to make 10 debit card transactions. This is a considerably harder requirement to meet and I don't really intend on using it as a checking account - I have my primary one with BB&amp;T (now Truist), as they have branches and ATMs near me. I've been considering moving my money out to protest this new requirement to get the 4%, but nothing out there seems compelling enough, so I'm looking for recommendations. I have an investment account with something like $35,000 in it and thought about moving the majority of my savings to that, but it feels too volatile, and having something with very high liquidity (that is, cash) for an emergency fund is appealing to me.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Interest Rate,"Hello,

I am currently building a house with Lennar homes and we just received our Conditional approval with a 3.25% interest rate. Its a tad bit higher than what I thought it would be when we went into the underwriting process. It was at 2.9%-3.0% at the end of February. We are projected to close in mid August. I believe I have the option to lock the interest rate 180 days beforehand of which we are currently 136 days until projected closing.

My question is do I lock my rate now? Are rates going to dip again? I was told that when I lock it, it will be higher than market rate so how much should I expect them to raise the rate when I lock it?",finance
personalfinance,Could you use a tax installment plan as a .25% interest loan hack?,"Theoretical question but I hope its not too stupid.

Lets say you owe 10,000 in taxes and planned to pay them but also needed a loan for 10,000.

Wouldn't it make more sense to just not pay your taxes and get an installment plan.  IIRC, the interest rate on those is .25% and you have 72 months to pay the taxes.  Seems like free money considering interest rates are never that low.  Why would anyone pay them up front?

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 03.26.2021: March Cardano 360 Edition,"Hey Everyone!

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/r-KfZsAIjAY](https://youtu.be/r-KfZsAIjAY)

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Cardano 360 was yesterday! The big news first: it sounds like the Alonzo (smart contracts)  testnet will launch around end of April or early May. It’s looking like Alonzo HFC event will happen on main net late July or August. The stream was over three hours long. They covered so much! Now, let’s get to the other details revealed. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8)
2. Grigory Rosu from Runtime Verification gave a big rundown on the universality in programming languages that will be provided by K framework in Cardano.  He said he should have some kind of proof of concept around six months from now.
3. Michael Peyton Jones and Manual Chakravarty (the architects of Plutus) talked about 1) the benefits of Cardano’s modern approach to designing Plutus TX and Plutus Core and how Plutus Core basically being lambda calculus allows for mathematical verification of software written in Plutus, 2) how UTXO (and EUTXO in Cardano) are much more battle proven than other leger accounting systems like account balance system (e.g. ETH) which have had problems, 3) how non-fungible role tokens will be a thing, and 4) how they are now laying out a real development platform for builders instead of just throwing Plutus out into the world.
4. Lars Brünjes (Head of Education) laid out how they are going to train a group of developers through the Plutus Pioneers program.  That group will help test the Alonzo test net after it launches.
5. Lars has also cloned Uniswap in Plutus with a graphical user interface and completely automated price discovery in the liquidity pools.  He did this as a proof of concept to show the capabilities of Plutus. That was demoed right on the stream.
6. They then brought on people from three different Haskell development firms who will be building things on the testnet as a sort of “red team” test of Alonzo.  They all seemed to be very capable in terms of Haskell development (note here that Plutus is basically Haskell).
7. Tom Lindeman (Chief Security Officer at Runtime Verification) then laid out how disastrous the last few years in Ethereum have been for smart contract security.  But, Cardano has a solution.  IOHK and Runtime Verification will partner to certify smart contracts as to security.  Runtime Verification will do the security audits.  This program will be called “Alpha Frontier”.
8. Charles then laid out the details of the timeline for Alonzo as described above.   It sounds like they are targeting to be totally done and hit a code/feature freeze at the end of June.  But, it will take Coinbase, Kraken, Binance et al. at least four weeks to update their systems before they can actually launch smart contracts on mainnet.
9. Collin Edwards and Duncan Couts then gave us an update on the stake pool world as we approach “D DAy” or d=0 which is full decentralization of block production. A stake pool operator Shawn McMurdo has made some Cardano Improvement proposals as to 1) a non-linear curved basis for a0 (pronounced a-naught, represents stake pool operator pledge) to affect rewards more greatly, 2) non-centralized rankings in Daedalus, and 3) an adjustment to minimum fees from fixed to variable.   Collin and Duncan clarified there will be no changes to a0 (pledge) or k (max pool size) at the d=0 (full decentralization) event coming up. Duncan also laid out how they are going to launch P2P node testnet in early Q2.  This will allow for information to flow directly between nodes and will accomplish automation of things like peer discovery that are currently manual on the network.
10. Dor Garbash then gave an update on Catalyst.  As covered previously here, Catalyst has become a monster.  There are 17k people in Ideascale and the treasury is worth more than $400MM.  You heard that right, almost a half billion dollars in the Catalyst Treasury.  We also heard from a bunch of the previous catalyst winners.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. Famed crypto enthusiast and billionaire Mike Novogratz asks the Cardano world ""Can anyone make a real bull case for [$ADA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=cashtag_click)? Does anyone build on it? Use it? Why is market cap so high? Should it be a funding asset? It’s one of the few cryptos I haven’t traded in my life.""

8. Charles will be speaking at the Blockchain Africa Conference this week which may or may not give us more clues as to the African Bird announcement. [https://blockchainafrica.co/](https://blockchainafrica.co/)
9. SingularityNet collaboration with Cardano going down. How else is Skynet gonna pay the Terminators?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ) [https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos)
10. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
11. ~~What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?~~ [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1) RETIRED!
12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh.
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)
14. Charles claimed Elon was trolling Cardano with “meta for k” on twitter. Can anyone argue one way or another on this? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1364350825271685122](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1364350825271685122)

16. Possible Soulja Boy Cardano collab on NFT. Maybe Soulja Boy could be best brohs with Charles and Stephen Wolfram broh? [https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907](https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907)
17. ~~Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?~~ RETIRED!
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. ~~Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark.~~ (Retired: he finally got it) Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. ~~Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?~~ RETIRED!
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years.
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum).

45. Cardano uses a tiny fraction of the energy some other top-ten blockchains use.   This factoid alone should allow you to hook up with eco-obsessed nature people. [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875)

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

90. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).

92. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).

CryptoCurrency,Will Bitcoin’s price increase if inflation of the USD increases?,"While it seems obvious the answer is yes, I want to understand exactly how this could play out. Let’s say we get reports of inflation increasing above 3%, would more investors see bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and sell some stocks to go into bitcoin? How is that supposed to happen when most investors still see bitcoin as speculative?

The reason I can’t imagine this is because it seems bitcoin’s price falls with the stock market and the stock market is falling because of fears of inflation and higher interest rates. If bitcoin’s price should increase from USD inflation, why aren’t we seeing bitcoin rise now that the inflation fears are under way (I see a lot of people talking about inflation these days)?

personalfinance,Tax refund is higher than usual and I’m nervous,"So I filed under Turbo Tax...it recommended I file as Head of Household since me and gf pay most of the bills in the house. We also have a son. I’m letting her claim him but I also get an EIC which I filled. Does an EIC give me extra money? I only put that I payed about 500 in daycare for someone who watched him.

Okay...now..2019 I only worked about 7 and a half months and my tax return was like $1,500
For 2020 I worked 10 months and my tax return says $5,200 dollars

Is this right?
My income for box 1 (wages tips)  was $23,300 (2019 was only $16,000)
My Federal income tax withheld (box 2) was $2251

I seriously just followed what TurboTax told me to do. It recommended filing as head of household which I did and I put the expenses I paid in cash for people to take care of my son. Did I mess up? I know that they were taking a good amount of money from my paychecks during 2020, so I did expect to get some big tax refund but I mean $5,000? Should it be this high? Will I get in trouble? I seriously just followed TurboTax’s recommendations... at first I was happy like “wooo $5,200!” But now I’m scared. What if I messed up and got more than I was supposed to and did something wrong. Will i be sued. Am I fine if they accepted it? Will it come back to haunt me? I seriously answered it as honestly as I could. My gf said I should be fine but I don’t wanna get a notice in 2 years saying I’m being sued, or owe them like $100,000",finance
Bitcoin,"If bitcoin becomes too successful, its failure is guaranteed.","Let me preface this by saying Im not new to bitcoin. Ive mined my first bitcoins back in 2011. Ive been advocating for bitcoin and running a node since 2012. Ive given away many dozens, sold and spent and wasted several 100's, but I still own a nice chunk, most likely much more than you. Bitcoin has been good for me. I also absolutely admire the concept and what has been achieved. I love the idea of decentralized, trustless, permissionless and programmable money. Im absolutely fascinated by the ingenuity of things like lightning network.

But what most of you consider its most appealing feature, is actually a fatal flaw that will prevent it from reaching much wider adoption: bitcoins monetary policy. While for now, this makes it a great investment for the individual,  the fact it has a hardcap and can not be issued as credit, means it is doomed. If or when it becomes popular enough that it becomes a tangible threat to fiat, it will be shut down by governments. It should be. Hear me out.

Lets start with the hardcap. Imagine a world where bitcoin, or even something based on bitcoin, is our standard currency. Where 21M coins represent all the wealth in the world. Anyone who owns a certain percentage of that money owns a certain percentage of the world's wealth. A fixed percentage. As the economy and population grows, the purchasing power of those coins grows proportionally. The rich get richer doing nothing, even though its the poor, or at least those who still need to work, actually growing the economy (assuming it would, which it wont, see later). This is very much like feudalism, where land owners got rich off the labor of the poor, and as long as they never sold their land, land owners and all the generations coming after them, stayed rich doing nothing. Its inconceivable in a democracy, such a class system would be maintained.

But, you say, the rich would spend, and without being productive or investing, over time their percentage of coins would diminish. Would it though? People need credit. Most people, if they want to buy a house before their retirement, need a mortgage. Students may need a loan to go to college and get a degree. Companies need credit to invest, to build ships or factories, to fund research. Society needs credit to build roads and bridges and power plants. In a bitcoin world, those loans, if they would be made at all, can only come from the rich. Who really dont even need to supply credit in order to stay rich, and would charge fees much larger than the economic growth, otherwise it wouldnt make sense for them to take on any risk. So the rich would over time accumulate more coins. More coins that each represent ever more purchasing power.

Not that many loans will be made. Even without exorbitant fees, who is going to take out a BTC denominated loan to buy a fast depreciating asset like a car? Who can afford a 25 year mortgage denominated in an ever appreciating currency? If you think student debt is bad, imagine your debt is in BTC. What are the odds you can ever pay that off? The rich will get richer, the poor will stay permantently poor and in debt.  Inequality, which is not just bad for the poor, but also for the economy,  will go up and up and up. And good luck trying to fix that with taxes, when ownership can be so easily concealed.

When we used gold as our accounting unit, gold itself was not the thing of value, it is what we used to represent value and trade for things of value, like food or land or ships. It was our accounting unit. Now gold could be mined, it doesnt have a fixed supply, if the value goes up, more can be mined, but only up to a point. When our economies grew and the need for credit grew, if we couldnt mine or steal or plunder enough yellow rocks, we ran out of credit. That crushed our economies. It even lead to countries to go to war and plunder other continents to get more gold. More of an accounting unit. Think about that, its like going to war because you ran out of black ink or cells in your spreadsheet. As insane as that was, bitcoin is worse, there is no way get more of it.

Almost everyone here loves to hate fiat money. Credit money. Because it can be ""printed"". Because its ""made from thin air"". Because central banks. The reality however, is that credit money, the ability to monetize debt, itself is a darn clever solution. You may have issues with monetary policies, with central bank policies,  you may object to government spending, but those are not inherent to credit money. Those things are subject to democratic oversight, and if they trouble you, should be remedied through your democratic vote, not by throwing out the baby with bathwater.

Credit money is a fantastic system if you actually understand it. If you have a good businessplan, if you want to improve your future prospects by getting a degree, if you can create economic growth by having a plane or a factory build or nuclear power plant built, you can go to a bank. If you are credit worthy, the bank will assume the risk of you defaulting, and will create the money based on your pledge to repay it from future earnings or profits. A bank will never say: gee, thats a great idea, and we have no concerns about your ability to repay,  we would love to lend you the money, but unfortunately, we have no money available, we lent everything out, come back in 5 or 10 years. Credit money lets you borrow from the future. It is not unconstrained, but it is constrained only by future prospects. Not by an arbitrary number someone came up with or how much gold we happened to find that year.

The ability to monetize debt is absolutely crucial for our economy. Bitcoin can not do this. Whats worse, I do not see how it is possible to create a decentralised currency that can. Anyone can issue credit by writing an IOU. Write ""good for 1000 satoshis"" on a post-it note. That is arguably credit money. And perhaps a bar tender or friend of you will accept that note as payment. But he is not going to be able to purchase groceries with that post-it note. That credit money is not fungible. A post-it note signed by Elon Musk might be widely accepted, a note signed by me or you, wont be accepted anywhere as no one would have any trust that we would honor the debt. It is therefore not money.

Our banking system enables this fungibility, by abstracting the default risk. The same money is issued based on my credit card debt or Elon Musks mortgage. You dont need to worry if your money is created based on one or the other, because in both cases, the bank assumes the credit risk, not you. Presumably, you also want to not have to worry about which bank is issuing the money. A dollar issued by bank X or bank Y has the same value, because our governments guarantee them. Which of course, requires rules and regulations imposed on the institutions that issue the money. How do you decentralise that? This seems impossible to me. Bitcoins main goal is eliminating the need for trust, no middleman, no counterparty risk. But this also by definition makes issuing fungible money as credit, which \*is\* a counterparty risk, impossible. And this makes a flourishing economy based on it, impossible.

To get back to my original statement; if or when bitcoin becomes a threat to our fiat money, if people start using and saving and demanding bitcoin rather than fiat, governments will have to shut it down. Either because they do understand the need for credit or ultimately because voters wont put up with a new feudal system that enslaves most of them.  Now I think bitcoin is virtually unstoppable as a protocol. Its as bullet proof as it gets. But its value is not. Government can easily forbid companies accepting it, from putting it on their balance sheet,  they can close down exchanges and all other legal fiat on/off ramps. Bitcoin will probably survive this, but its value wont, as i doubt even drug dealers would be keen to be paid in bitcoin if they can not easily exchange it for dollars or goods.

Consider this before you mortgage your house to buy more bitcoin. Bitcoin is great for hodlers, its poison for our economy and society. And if bitcoin becomes too successful, its failure is guaranteed.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,To pay the debt or to not pay the debt. That is my question...,"So here’s the long story... 

Mid 2017 into early 2018, I had a string of events that caused my financial situation to go to complete shit. I had multiple credit cards, most with small balances. I was caring for an ill family member which eventually caused me to loose my job due to attendance. (FMLA was not an option for reasons not relevant to this post.) I was out of work using an established emergency fund to pay bills. My family member died and back to job searching I went. I decided in the meantime to pay off my credit card debt as I didn’t know how long it would take for me to find work. Unfortunately I could only find jobs that were part-time or temporary during that holiday season. It got me by for the most part but my emergency fund was still depleting to make up for the difference of what I wasn’t earning. 

During this time my mother was diagnosed with some crazy rare cancer, moved in with me, and sadly passed away less than 2 months later. I paid for a large portion of her funeral expenses and she had no life insurance. Most of this was funded by my credit cards as I didn’t want to completely deplete my emergency fund. My plan was to pay this off when I found a stable and decent paying job which was a few weeks later. 

I accepted a position with a landscaping company where I worked for a total of 11 days before I slipped on water from a leaking washing machine in my home and broke my ankle. I needed surgery, didn’t have insurance because I hadn’t been employed, and was now unemployed all over again. I recovered for 7 weeks until I “convinced” my doctor to lift my medical restrictions so I could work. At this point my emergency fund was depleted and I was paying bills with credit cards. 

Fast forward end of 2019, I found a great job and have been working for about 20 months at a local resort that allowed me to make enough to completely pay off some of my smaller credit cards, and catch up on some auxiliary bills (garbage collection and IRS that hadn’t been paid in almost 18 months and were threatening legal.) Throughout this entire time I never missed or paid late on my mortgage as this was most important to me. COVID hit and I have luckily been on unemployment since March 2020. I am a guaranteed return to work employee when the resort reopens but from what I’m hearing, that may be well into mid 2021 in my state. I am doing some side jobs here and there to make some extra cash but I’m pretty much breaking even right now and I am very thankful to be able to at least say that. 

I currently have 3 credit card accounts in collections that are all between 6-8K each that haven’t seen a payment since mid to end of 2017. Total is roughly 21K. I’m approaching the 4 year mark of my last payments to those accounts and I’m wondering if I should start making a plan to pay them or if I should just ride them out. In my state, statute of limitations for open accounts is four years, while written contracts is six years. I will be honest, I have no idea what the difference between open and written contract accounts are. I tried googling and can’t find anything that explains it to me like I’m 5. I was just more confused. 

I’ve done “a quick math” and with the way things are going, I could probably pay them off at about the same time they hit the 6 year mark. That’s IF there are no surprises between now and then.

Fingers crossed... 

I do not plan on buying a house or applying for a large loan, in the foreseeable future. So time is on my side for now. I just want to get a grasp on what moves I should make from here. I don't live lavishly other than my internet plan that gets me 700+ download speeds with a cost of $110 per month that I'm not willing to sacrifice as it's my ONLY entertainment expense. I don't even have Reddit Premium... or any streaming services. Youtube and Twitch with ads is life... My phone bill is $65 per month, I own one modest but reliable car no auto loan, insurance is $140 per month, I spend about $160 per month on groceries, mortgage and utilities together are about $1200 per month (I have a 3.6% interest rate on my mortgage that I'm currently 8 of 30 years into), I don't spend on clothing, I don't eat take out, my income while on unemployment is about $1750 per month and when I'm working is about $2400 per month. I started a ""high interest saving account"" as my emergency fund with about $1600 in it right now. I contribute all the money I make on the side and any extra money I have at the end of the month to this account. 


TLDR;  I currently have 3 credit card accounts in collections that are all between 6-8K each that haven’t seen a payment since mid 2017. Total is roughly 21K. I’m approaching the 4 year mark of my last payments to those accounts and I’m wondering if I should start making a plan to pay them or if I should just ride them out. In my state, statute of limitations for open accounts is four years, while for written contracts is six years.

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-friday-march-26.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday’s tech rout

&gt; * Dow and S&amp;P 500 futures Friday added to Thursday’s late-session comeback, which saw Wall Street break a two-day losing streak, putting the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 at about breakeven for the week. The Dow closed up 199 points, boosted by economic comeback stocks, after losing as much as 348 points earlier Thursday. Nasdaq futures turned lower Friday after the index closed slightly higher. However, it remained 1.8% lower for the week. The 10-year Treasury yield was up Friday but still below recent 14-month highs.

&gt; * The Commerce Department is out with personal income and spending figures for February at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect an income drop of 7%. Spending is also seen dropping by 0.8%. In January, income jumped 10%, its biggest monthly gain since April, as Americans received stimulus checks approved in December. Spending in January increased by 2.4%. In the coming months, another round of stimulus checks, approved in March, could start showing up in the data.

&gt; # 2. Office-sharing company WeWork signs new deal to go public

&gt; * WeWork, which pulled its IPO in 2019 after a dwindling valuation and resignation of co-founder Adam Neumann, has reached a new deal to go public. The office-sharing company agreed on Friday to merge with special purpose acquisition company BowX Acquisition Corp. The transaction values WeWork at $9 billion, a fraction of its one-time valuation of around $47 billion. Following the announcement, shares of BowX rose 2.5% in Friday premarket.

*****

&gt; # 3. GameStop shares to open higher after soaring over 50%

&gt; * GameStop shares jumped roughly 10% in Friday’s premarket, the morning after snapping a five-session losing streak and closing 52% higher. There was no apparent news Thursday. GameStop has been the most high-profile “meme stock,” popular among retail traders on Reddit and other social media platforms. The stock lost about a third of its value Wednesday after the video game retailer delivered disappointing fourth-quarter results, failed to give in-depth detail about its digital turnaround plans, and acknowledged it’s considering selling more stock.

&gt; # 4. Tesla ordered to have Elon Musk delete anti-union tweet

&gt; * The National Labor Relations Board told Tesla to make Elon Musk delete a tweet that was seen as threatening to labor organizers within the company. The independent federal agency also ordered Tesla to reinstate a fired employee, Richard Ortiz, a union advocate. Tesla must also compensate Ortiz for loss of earnings, benefits and adverse tax consequences that resulted from his termination. The NLRB decision was largely in line with an administrative law judge’s ruling from 2019, which Tesla had appealed to the full board.

&gt; # 5. Suez Canal blockage delays estimated $400 million an hour in goods

&gt; * The Ever Given, a stranded mega container ship in the Suez Canal, is holding up an estimated $400 million per hour in trade, based on the approximate value of goods that move through the key waterway every day. That’s according to shipping data and news company Lloyd’s List. Lloyd’s values the canal’s westbound traffic at roughly $5.1 billion a day, and eastbound traffic at around $4.5 billion a day. The Suez Canal, which separates Africa from Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, March 26th, 2021! :)**",finance
technology,Facebook says it's preparing again to fend off disinformation during a federal election,,technology
CryptoCurrency,Discussion: Are cryptocurrencies property? What is the legal reason (in any country) for treating blockchain assets as property?,"It seems like it is pretty commonly accepted by financial regulatory bodies (IRS, SEC, etc) that cryptocurrencies are property and can be treated as having ownership, but I think the question is a lot murkier than that.  I think there is a big distinction between a cryptocurrency exchange account and a non-custodial wallet, and that wallets can't be treated the same as other types of property.

When you have money in a bank account, for instance, that bank account is tied to your identity.  Only one person or entity is entitled to the assets in that bank account.  Someone must commit fraud by impersonating the rightful owner of the account in order to remove assets from the account, including physical storage like safety deposit boxes.  When accessing the bank online, they must authenticate as a legitimate user to remove assets.  In this scenario, it seems to be a pretty clear case of theft when someone steals money from another's bank account.

Crypto exchange accounts seem to be similar to bank accounts in this regard.  They are tied to one person or entity, and you can only remove money by falsely identifying yourself as the rightful owner of an account.  The only murkiness here is when it comes to how funds are insured.  If USD is stolen from a bank, that money is usually insured and the victim's losses can be recouped by the federal government up to a certain amount.  With cryptocurrency, this is not the case.  Crypto assets must be insured privately if the exchange wishes to provide a sense of assurance to their customers.  I believe this is by far the exception at this point, and that most crypto exchanges do not offer any assurances in the event of a loss of exchange assets.

Now we get into the murky area: wallets.  For most types of cryptocurrencies, a wallet is comprised of a minimum of two components: a public address/key and a private key.  There is an important distinction here, though.  A wallet is not an address on the blockchain, it is simply a way for one person to access a balance tied to an address.  A wallet can be thought of like a combination to a safe.  You can copy the combination a million times and give it to a million people, but that doesn't mean that a million people own the contents of the safe.  In the case of cryptocurrency, I would argue that nobody actually owns the balance of a blockchain address.  Those assets are stored on the blockchain itself, and not in any container that is owned by an individual or entity.  

Here's a thought experiment to demonstrate why I think crypto is different.  If a judge orders a person to hand over a safe and its contents to another party, that other party can change the combination to the safe or remove the contents and put it in their basement, and there is no way for the original owner to access that property without violating the law.  If a judge orders a person to hand over their crypto wallet to another party, there is no way to ensure that only the new person has access to the balance on that address.  They must transfer it to a new address to ensure it is secure.  Otherwise, the original owner or anyone else who has a way to restore the keys can access those funds again without trespassing or committing any kind of fraud.  This is the only type of property I know of where there is no way to ensure that custody has been transferred.  The only thing a person can actually have custody of is the wallet (i.e. one instance of the keys) itself, not the balance of that address, because there can be infinite copies of the keys and there's no way to prevent their duplication.

Where it gets even murkier is if that same judge had ordered one person to transfer the crypto asset to another person's public address instead of surrendering their actual wallet.  The person could comply, or they could destroy their wallet.  Normally, destroying an asset that you have been ordered to surrender would get you in some kind of trouble, because at that point you are destroying someone else's property.  But with crypto, you haven't actually destroyed the asset, you've simply removed your ability to access it.  How would you prove in this case that all copies of the wallet have been destroyed, and that the person hasn't memorized the mnemonic to recover the keys?  There's no other asset I can think of that has these same properties.

In another example, when crossing a country's border, you will often be asked if you are carrying any currencies or other assets with you across the border.  Let's say you have your ledger wallet around your neck.  Technically, you should still answer no to that question, because you only have a public and private key encrypted by a pin in a USB hardware device around your neck.  The cryptocurrency assets are stored on the blockchain - always on the blockchain.  Obviously the customs agent probably intends for you to answer 'yes' if you have a wallet with you, but by the literal meaning of their question, you would not be lying to say 'no'.

I'm not saying that we shouldn't treat crypto as property, but I am saying that it's not like other types of property, and I think this has interesting implications legally.  Speaking practically, nobody actually owns BTC or any other cryptocurrency. It is only an abstract representation of state change across a blockchain.  The transferring of BTC is governed by a set of rules baked into the protocol that are mostly unchangeable.  Only a transaction signed by a private key has the power to move BTC, but anyone and everyone can know that private key, and there's no way to know who knows it.

Simply the fact that we have determined it has value doesn't mean we can treat it like other types of assets that have value.  Special consideration must be given, and lawmakers must be educated about why this particular form of asset is unique.

tl;dr:  Crypto is not like other property.  How should we treat it that is the same as other property, and how should we treat it differently?",cryptocurrency

(I will also talk to you about it in the grocery line, I believe in it that strongly.) I’ve been fighting for equity reforms since I was a wee baby lawyer, from supporting reproductive justice with the Center for Reproductive Rights to advancing reforms against sexual harassment as an aide to Senator Kamala Harris. This is also my first AMA, so not a big deal at all to be doing it with THE Larry Lessig (!?!?)  :)

Lessig ([me](https://www.geneseo.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article/public/sites/news/Lessig-ted3-landscape%20view.jpg.jpeg?itok=PMDYMneh)!) has been in the trenches for the last 14 years, writing books ([Republic Lost](https://lessig.org/product/republic-lost-v1)(2011), [One Way Forward](https://lessig.org/product/one-way-forward) (2012), [The US is Lesterland](https://www.amazon.com/dp/149470160X/ref=rdr_ext_tmb), [Republic Lost, v2](https://lessig.org/product/republic-lost-v2) (2015), [America Compromised](https://lessig.org/product/america-compromised) (2018), [They Don't Represent US](https://lessig.org/product/they-don-t-represent-us) (2019)), endless articles and essays, and organizing movements of people to demand democracy, finally. With [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) and (Joe Trippi)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Trippi], I started [Change Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_Congress#:~:text=Founded%20in%202008%20by%20Lawrence,reform%20to%20increase%20congressional%20transparency.) in 2007, that became Rootstrikers in 2010. In 2014, I helped launch the [MayDayPAC](https://mayday.us/). In 2014, we begin a series of marches across New Hampshire (with the [New Hampshire Rebellion](https://www.nhrebellion.org/), including two across the whole state in January!), in the spirit of [Granny D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Haddock) (and in memory of Aaron), demanding campaign finance reform. And after trying mightily to get the issue of  fundamental reform on the Democratic debate state in 2015 (see the [Citizen Equality Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Equality_Act_of_2017))), I started [EqualCitizens.us](https://equalcitizens.us/), which is litigating and organizing for an equal democracy for all.

The For The People Act is in the Senate right now, and could actually become law, but only with your help! It includes voting rights reform, gerrymandering reform, election security measures, transparency requirements, ethics rules for the Supreme Court, Congress, and the President, and, for the first time in American history, a system to enable Congressional candidates to fund their campaigns with small-contributions only. The bill has passed the House (twice), if we can get filibuster reform, there’s a real chance it could pass the Senate and become law. Let’s talk about what it does and why it is so important.

personalfinance,First (and last) time having to take out a private loan to pay for college classes. Is there a method to the madness or is every loan-giver the same?,"Title says it all.. I’m a senior now and taking some summer classes so that I can graduate in the fall. FAFSA and grinding paying out of pocket has gotten me this far, but financial aid doesn’t cover summer so I have to pay it entirely out of pocket and don’t have the money to do so. Because of this, I’m going to have to take out a private loan. I’m taking out enough to cover the classes and a new desktop computer setup (necessary at this point, what all my work will be done on).

Overall, I’m going to take about $5500 out. I’m from the Midwest US. I’m very new to private loans, and I just got my first credit card about 6 months ago. Who should I go through? How should I do it? Is there anything I should know about private loans before taking them out? Are there any differences between private and federal student loans I should know about?

My bank is the local credit union, and when I was car shopping, their interest rate for used car loans was 5%. Now, it's 3.95%, same as CarMax. Is there any benefit to refinancing with my credit union, aside from having my loan available with the rest of my banking information?",finance

Although I'm not desperate, in this case stress lead to desperation.  I have called and canceled this loan application. 

Again thank you all for helping me understand what I was doing was a bad idea and to just balance my budget a little better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Original post:

I have a feeling this is a bad idea but I need some advice anyway.

Two years ago I went through a divorce and got myself into some serious credit card debt. I've been trying to pull myself out of it but I'm just treading water.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 5 credit lines

|$8790|29.1%|credit card|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$8560|25.5%|credit card|
|$3200|3%|36 months 24 months left|
|$3900|25.9%|credit card|
|$3500|22%|credit card|
|29,040 (total)|||

\*\* not including student loan debt\*\*

I've dedicated $1200 per month to pay these credit lines but I'm not getting anywhere.

My income is around $65k per year.

My credit score is building but is only around 600.

Yesterday Credit Karma, again, suggested I take out a personal loan. I was ""pre-approved"" at 19% for $30k.  I filled out the form and the results came back 60 months at 27% apr, with a monthly payment of around $750. Interest over the loan being close to $14K. Also a $1500 fee for the loan.

This seems like such a terrible idea to take out this personal loan. However it would consolidate the debt and ""save"" me $500 per month (of the 1200 I have budgeted) which I **would** put towards this loan  monthly in the idea of paying it off in 36/48 months instead of 60.

I was willing to take out a high interest loan when I started this process yesterday, but was thinking high interest would be 18-21%, basically anything lower than what the interest is on the cards. 27% feels like highway robbery, however with the high interest rates split between the 4/5 other lines I feel I've paid this out in the two years i've been trying to pay them off already.

Also, my spending is not a future issue. The debt was put on for legal fees, home repairs, car repairs. No foreseeable large expenses are coming down the pipe. I am not going on a shopping spree or taking vacations.

I have gone to the bank and my credit union and inquired about loans. I have been rejected due to my debt to income ratio and my balance to max ratio (can't think of the proper term).

I have not missed a payment on any credit account, credit cards, car loan, student loans in 9 years. I payed off my car in november.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally: and somewhat most importantly. I am in process for this loan from lending club. I am in the portion where I am submitting documents, paystubs etc. Can I back out at this point, if i choose to? or is it too late?

I feel I can afford this loan, even at the ridiculous interest rate. However I know I am just throwing money away and its stupid to do so. In a sense its paying for stress relief @ 27%.

personalfinance,Question regarding how an employer chooses to apply taxes to severance pay/supplemental wages.,"Good morning everyone.

Are there any logistical or cost differences for an employer when they use the W4 withholding tables for federal income tax instead of just applying the 22% flat rate to severance pay/supplemental wages? 

If the employer has the option to use the 22%, why would they knowingly and intentionally choose the W4 method which places the excessive tax burden on the former employee?   

How does that benefit the employer?",finance
personalfinance,Contributing pre-tax income for 2020 before the tax deadline,"Fairly new to retirement savings and now I’m terribly confused.

I made roughly 81k last year plus 1.3k as an independent contractor. I paid a total of 10k in federal taxes and 3k in state taxes. I did not yet pay taxes on the independent contractor money since it was my first year, so I’m allowed to pay for that when I do my taxes. 

My father put in all the numbers into turbo tax and said that for federal tax alone I owe 1.2k, which seems like more than I owe on the 1.3k extra I made. I’m very confused because he said I can contribute “pretax money into a traditional IRA for 2020 to lower my tax burden”. My understanding was that you can contribute to Roth up until April 15th (which I did 6k), but that a 401k you have to contribute within the calendar year. 

1. Why might I owe that much in taxes? (I did moonlight so my income was more than last year but I assumed I was being taxed accordingly by my employer)

2. Can I contribute money into a “pre-tax” account today that will reduce my tax burden for 2020? 

Thank you!!",finance
personalfinance,Does my proposed budget make sense?,"Hi all. I just graduated college and am looking to make the transition to an apartment of my own from my parents house. I've never fully budgeted for living expenses on my own.

Income:
I make $3,912/month net (after 401k contributions of $525 (9%)  from me with a $220 (4%) match from my company) and insurance. 

I want to move to an apartment that costs around $1400/month as it's in a safe area that's close to work and that's hugely important to me. I'm happy to pay the premium for that ""luxury"". 

Rent: $1400-$1555 depending on what's available 

Total living expenses: ~$2190, includes $100 of fun money, $275 on food. 
Breakdown

Rent: $1490
Food: $275
Electricity: $75
Water: $70
Phone: $50
Internet: $79
Fun: $100
Gas: $65
Heat: $50

Total: $2210

Savings $645/month, I'll have a nice chunk saved from my salary by then, around $9k. I out $200/month of this in a roth, because I enjoy a bit of trading. I consider this a super emergency savings if need be instead of retirement as a result. 

No Credit card debt but I have $38k in fed student loans. Repayment is $230/month for 10 years. I've budgeted $505/month to pay that down after September. 

Car: $242/month+ $150 in insurance. My hobby is cars so there's minimal wiggle room. 3% interest rate for 38 more months. I should pay around $1200 in interest total

Subscriptions: $35/month


Does getting an apartment for $1500/month make sense? It's expensive, sure, but finding a complex that isn't getting robbed or full of roaches within 30 minutes of my office is a big ask.

personalfinance,What is the smartest way to disburse my savings to student loans?,"I am a college senior who will be soon graduating this May. I have two private student loans currently in deferment.

One has a principal of $18,082.18 (with accrued interest of $5,900.39 at 8.99% variable).

The second has a principal of $8,631.19 (with accrued interest of  $2,744.24 at 9.99% fixed).

I have about 12k in my savings. Should I pay off the 2nd loan completely and risk the 1st loan capitalizing? Or should I pay off both interests only? Or should I pay partial to some but have a limit to keep my savings at a certain balance for emergency?

I currently have a part-time job paying $10.50. This is a student job that will end after I graduate so should I have some savings to keep me going before I find a full-time job? I currently do not pay any bills. What is the smart move here?

\*\*Note: I may need to help out my parents as well. I am not sure how much they are paying for bills in general, but my father is going to be discharged soon from the hospital and he has no retirement funds. My mother is of old-age as well and will soon quit her job to become a caretaker for my dad. I am not sure how she plans to pay for bills if she does that. My sisters have informed me that we might have to help out if it comes to that (both sisters are poorer than me). I feel pressured to find a full-time job fast. Assuming that it MAY come down to that, how much savings should I maintain to keep the family afloat for a couple of months? I am assuming 12k is not enough itself.....but it may buy us some time.

What do you think is the smartest move for both scenarios (not including family vs including family situation) for a soon-to-be graduating student?

personalfinance,Why do I owe on my taxes when I claim 0 allowances on my W4? (More info in text body),"This year I made ~$45k. I claimed zero allowances on my W4 from 2020. This year on my taxes I still owed just over $1000. I am a single person filed as an independent. 

Some more information that might help: I graduated college in May 2019, and have been working my current job since July 2019. My student loans came into effect November of 2019. I made my monthly payments on them until COVID hit, when my interest rate halted, and has been at a 0% since. In the year 2020, I have paid off around $4000 dollars of my loans, only a small portion of this being taxed (month of january and february). I'm not sure if the student loans, and their lack of interest, have anything to do with the situation but figured it was worth noting. 

Other than that I'm really not sure why I would be owing on my taxes. I don't make a large amount of money and was under the impression I was getting the highest amount taken out per paycheck, which would then come back to me during tax season. I didn't get a either of the two ($1200 and $600) stimulus checks as they were doled out for whatever reason, but was able to recoup them on my taxes, so that did put me in the positive. Still, if it wasn't for that sip up by the IRS, I would have owed $1000 in taxes this year. Why might this be?

Appreciate any help in advance! I'm sure this question is asked ad nauseum but every situation is different so figured a post tailored to mine would be most usueful.",finance
personalfinance,Diversification Strategies for Saving,"So, apart from a 6 month emergency fund, I've been pretty bad so far about saving and investing consistently. I decided today that I want to make sure I'm saving/investing 20% of my after tax income each month.

Unfortunately there aren't any high yield savings accounts with interest rates that keep up with inflation. So my question has two parts:

1. Should I move my emergency fund out of a high yield savings to something else that is just as safe/almost as safe but won't lose buying power over time? If so, what options are available out there?

2. I have 5% of my post tax income going into a Roth IRA and then I'm planning on putting the other 15% into index funds on Robinhood. Is that a sound strategy or should I still be putting some of that 15% into a more stable account like mentioned in question 1?

personalfinance,How to use $70k?,"Hello everyone, I’m hoping to get some advice on the best way to use about $70k in projected after-tax income.

I work for the US government overseas and am fortunate to have them cover my rent, utilities, and school tuition for my kids while we’re here. We only have two years left overseas before we have to come home and lose those entitlements. 

My wife recently got a job here and will earn, after taxes and deductions, about $70k by the time we have to leave. She’s already saved $15k of this income. We currently live on my income alone, and are trying to decide the best way to make use of her projected income. Our options are: save for retirement, save for a house, or pay off debt.

Here are some financial stats on us:

* Both of us are 35; two kids 6 and 4
* $20k emergency fund
* $430k in combined retirement savings (401k plus Roth IRAs), plus eventual federal pension 
* Own a house currently producing a $400/month rental profit after expenses
* Mortgage on rental property is $275k, with 20 years left on a 30 year mortgage at 3.625%; current market value is at least $750k
* $45k in savings toward a down payment on another house (goal is about $100k)
* $30k in graduate student loan debt in my wife’s name, currently in forbearance due to Executive Order, but was previously $400/month payments 
* No debt other than student loans and mortgage on the rental property 

Once we return to the States, assuming both of us keep similar government positions, we will earn too much to be eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA. But with the expected rent and school expenses we probably won’t be able to save my wife’s entire paycheck anymore.

Option 1: Save for retirement, specifically into a Roth IRA while we still have a low enough income to qualify.   If we’re going with this option we’d need to act immediately to take advantage of the April 15 deadline for 2020 contributions. I know this is the “safest” choice because we could always withdraw the principal to pay for the house or student loans, but honestly it’s doubtful we’d actually pull the money out once it’s in the Roth IRA. 

Option 2: Save for a new house so we will be able to continue renting out the one we already own for long-term profit. If we put aside my wife’s income toward a new house we will meet our savings target by the time we return to the US and would be able to hold onto the rental property indefinitely. But alternatively, given the equity we have, we could also do a cash-out refinance to get the money for the second home down payment. 

Option 3: Pay off my wife’s student loan debt. It’s her debt and her income, and this is the most emotionally satisfying choice; but with the other options plus the possibility of some of that debt being forgiven by the government we’re not sure it’s the best idea. 

What do you think is the best way for us to use this money? Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Supplemental Retirement plan for California Teachers - National Life Group vs New York Life Dilemma,"Hello. I am Teacher in California, I'm pretty young (29 years old) and I am very new to and unfamiliar with good investments for retirement. Teachers in CA contribute to something called CALSTRS which is a retirement account that our school districts match our contributions. We opt out of social security payments. So when I started teaching (2 years ago), I was connected to a representative from National Life Group (I trusted him because he worked for my school district). He approached me with the idea of supplemental income in retirement by potentially investing in a retirement plan. Long story short I opened up 2 accounts with him: an IUL called Flex-Life and an Annuity 403(b) which I think is a plan through my employer. 

Anyhow, 2 years later (this week), my agent called me and told me that he switched to New York Life and realized that the IUL (Flex-Life) through National Life Group was not a good plan and that he is sorry and he is trying to tell me to switch over to a new IUL plan through New York Life called Whole Life. The thing is that after 2 years my surrender value is $0 so basically I surrender all the money I put into that account for 2 years ($250 a month). He said that he knows it hurts but it will be for the better because of something about NLG being able to change their interest rates (they lowered mine because it was a new plan from 9% to 3% and lowered their cap from 9.75% to 9%). He said that Whole Life through NYL is a better plan because it's fixed. I told him I would think about it but I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. Like I basically lose $3,000 dollars by switching and now I'm being told that the Flex Life plan I'm on is not a good one either. So here is my question:  


What should I do regarding this decision? Furthermore, are their other options I should be looking for? Should I even have an IUL. Are there better plans for me? I don't want to touch the account till I retire at 65 so I'm really not worried about taking a loan against the account. Somebody please help.

# Flexible Savings

Flexible Savings lets you earn interest on your funds. It’s really easy to use, and not surprisingly, it gives you great flexibility! You can deposit your funds, earn interest, and redeem them at any time.

So, if you’re holdings some money in your Spot Wallet, why not deposit it into the Flexible Savings account Since you can access it any time, it’s easy to make those funds work for you while they’re not being used elsewhere.

Note that the interest will not be calculated on the day you subscribe to a Flexible Savings product. Instead, the first interest payment is calculated from the next day after your subscription.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yqjbzj70hfp61.jpg?width=1244&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=562258b2bef183688119a6fcfebb8d83850e4e56

## Fixed Savings

Fixed Savings offer you better returns but less flexibility to access your funds. The difference here is that you’ll set a predetermined duration for your funds to accrue interest. This will give you generally higher interest rates than Flexible Savings products since the term and interest rate are both fixed.

Fixed Savings products can range from 7 to 90 days. So, if you know you won’t need some funds elsewhere for a certain period of time, you can lock them to earn a higher APY.

## Lending activities

Lending activities are special events that pop up from time to time under the [Activities tab](https://www.binance.com/en/lending#lending-activity?utm_source=BinanceAcademy). These generally have a capped supply, meaning you’ll need to be quick to subscribe. These can offer even higher returns than Fixed Savings usually does.

Otherwise, we could say that these lending products are quite similar to Fixed Savings. But, since they’re only available from time to time, you can get higher rewards if you keep up with what’s happening. Make sure to keep an eye on the announcements to secure your slot!

## Locked Staking

By simply holding Proof of Stake coins in your Spot Wallet, you can earn staking rewards on your holdings – great, simple. However, there’s also a way to earn higher rewards on [staking](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-staking).

If you commit your PoS coins to be locked for periods ranging from 7 to 90 days, you can earn a higher reward. This is essentially the same deal as Flexible vs. Fixed Savings, only with staking.

In addition, some coins will also allow you to do a Flexible Lock, where you commit your funds for staking, but you still maintain the ability to withdraw if you want to.

Now with the proceeds and savings, we could pay off the new mortgage if we wanted to. Or we could invest in a taxable brokerage account, easily get more than the mortgage interest rate (3.6%) and possible get a bit more. Even if we did that, we'd still have 9 months of salary in savings.

personalfinance,Refinancing from an ARM to a 30-year Mortgage... we're only a year in.,"We bought a house last year and had enough of a down payment to clear the 20% hurdle. At the time, my credit was worse than my spouses due to a few months that I missed some credit card payments from before we were married, so her credit score was 700+ while I was in the high 500s. Our debt utilization was not too high to discourage the lender, but high enough to affect our scores somewhat and not achieve the best interest rate possible.

At the time, we selected an ARM because of the lower monthly payments, knowing that we could always refinance a few years  from now after the missed payment marks fall off my credit.

However, the past year we've been making some huge strides reducing our debt and I'm now 700+ whereas she's just barely below 800. The negative missed payment marks are still on my credit, but obviously since our largest shared credit card accounts and mortgage payments are in perfect condition and our debt load has gotten significantly lighter, this has led to our credit scores drastically improving.

Would it make sense for us to refinance right now, given the uncertainty that rates will remain this low forever? I'm happy with the interest rate as we have it, it's not below 3% but even if we could secure the same interest rate with a fixed rate for the remainder of our mortgage, would this make sense to do right now, or should we wait? There's no pre-payment penalty through our lender, but I'm sure that the usual refinancing costs will come into play.",finance

I was curious if there were any patterns in between the BTC Futures' Expiration dates. Bear with me on this (pun intended). This is my first time using a chart. I just needed a line to mark the BTC Futures Expiration Dates (BTCFED).

Findings for 2021 Schedule feels a bit inconclusive right now, but-

1. 7 Days Before BTCFED: 3/3 times: **Loss.**
2. 3 Days Before BTCFED: 3/3 times: **Loss.**
3. 3 Days After BTCFED: 1/2 times: **Gain/Loss.**
4. 7 Days After BTCFED: 2/2 times: **Gain.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Interpretation:**

Well, I honestly don't know how to conclude this study- but if we compile the available data from all BTCFED, and BTC Prices 3-7 days before and after; this is what we get;

1. 7 Days Before BTCFED: 20: Loss / 18 Gains
2. 3 Days Before BTCFED: 22 Loss / 16 Gains
3. 3 Days After BTCFED: 16 Loss / 22 Gains
4. 7 Days After BTCFED: 14 Loss / 24 Gains

I leave the rest of the interpretation up to you guys. I was searching for 'Max Pain Point,' all I've got so far was on the March 2021 data, nothing from the previous years. Maybe someone with a bit more qualitative experience could carry forward on the same topic.

TL; DR:  The findings didn't find any significant evidences on how BTCFED is correlated with large upswings gains. 

Disclaimer: I have no experience reading/plotting graphs/charts. Might probably learn it soon- but one thing for sure, I'm interested to learn more about crypto. &amp; as I post this, it's 5AM here in Southeast Asia, but seeing a lot of 'RemindMe!' made me kind of eager to put this out and see where it goes.

personalfinance,Shopping mortgage lenders,"After reading older posts, it seems like I was supposed to just get one preapproval letter, get an offer accepted, then shop around for different lenders for the best rate. However I was pushed by my realtor to get an underwritten preapproval so Movement mortgage already hard pulled my credit. Credit Karma emails me stating I can shop around and get my credit pulled from different lenders with no affect to my credit score for 14 days; I’ve heard others say 30 days. So I sent in a couple more applications to other lenders and banks. However all I got from those lenders are more preapproval letters when I already had one and an estimate loan interest rate which could change by the time I have an offer accepted. If I got my credit pulled now for an underwritten preapproval and didn’t buy til let’s say 60 days later and went with another lender then wouldn’t I get another credit pull? Can I string these different lenders along until I go into escrow and choose one then without another pull? I’m hoping to buy in the next 90 days.

personalfinance,Helping my parents refinance their house. Is it normal to fill out borrower preapproval application?,"So I am new to this. Parents want to refinance their house as they can get a much lower interest rate and need my financial information since I make the most money. I thought about it and made the decision to help them out as long as I am also part owner of the house. From my understanding if I cosign I will be stuck with the bill if they don't pay without any benefit from it. My parents are great people and don't see them screwing me over, plus if worst comes to worst I can pay a good portion of the house since I have decent amount in savings.

 House has 170k left on mortgage with a value of 800k plus at current market value. I am pretty sure it will increase even more due to its location in a progressive city and already been getting  random solicitors trying to buy the house. They plan to give me the house in the near future. They are near retirement age. They just want a lower interest rate so they don't have to pay more per month. I don't have to pay anything from my understanding. I am from different state and the loan officer contacting me wants alot of my information for preapproval. My bank statement, my last couple paychecks, id card, and she sent me a borrower information form to fill out and also wants my college transcripts? Why would she need my college transcripts? Again I am new to this.

I am risk adverse and thinking of potential negative things that can come from this. I pretty much told them I am helping them out to lower their interest rate. I don't have to do this for them. I don't want them to just retire not keeping up with the mortgage payments and coast off my back. They said they understand.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 26, 2021. (Sorry for the late post)","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 26, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recordings its best day in three weeks as, as market participants digested tepid inflation data in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 1.5%, the Dow Jones closed (DIA) 1.39% up and the SPY closed 1.59% higher.

For February, at least, core personal consumption expenditures – the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge – rose just 1.5%, coming in well below the central bank's 2% target. The report helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy sooner-than-expected. Moreover, the Fed has been consistent in their reluctance to act prematurely. Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve in Chicago said even  a jump in inflation of six months “is not nearly enough to warrant a pivot on monetary policy by the Central Bank. Yesterday, in an interview with NPR, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency.""

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to rose today to 1.68% at the time of writing. The Treasury yield rises with the expectation of economic growth as the US begins to open back up. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

Despite a volatile year so far, the energy and financials sectors have been leading gains in the S&amp;P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares in 2021, underscoring the increasing rotation that is occurring into stocks poised to benefit from the opening of the economy. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

Here is a little story about train tracks. 

[https://www.trains.com/trn/railroads/history/a-history-of-track-gauge/#:\~:text=But%20how%20did%20this%20seemingly,the%20Tyne%20River%20below%20Newcastle](https://www.trains.com/trn/railroads/history/a-history-of-track-gauge/#:~:text=But%20how%20did%20this%20seemingly,the%20Tyne%20River%20below%20Newcastle).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The gauge of a railroad is the distance between the inside vertical surfaces of the head of the rail. Standard gauge is 4 feet, 8-1/2 inches. This is the gauge with which steam railroading began, and it became the common gauge of Britain, North America, and Western Europe except for Spain, Portugal, and Ireland.  
&gt;  
&gt;But how did this seemingly odd width become standard?  
&gt;  
&gt;**When George Stephenson designed the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway in the north of England in 1825, he used a gauge of 4 feet, 8 inches simply because he had been familiar with it on a mine tramway called the Willington Way on the Tyne River below Newcastle. In turn, the Willington Way had been built to this gauge because it was common on roads in the area. After the Stockton &amp; Darlington, Stephenson used the same 4 feet, 8 inches for the Liverpool &amp; Manchester, the world’s first railway between major cities**. There he widened the gauge by one-half inch, probably to give more lateral play to the flanges.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the outset, the choice of 4 feet 8-1/2 appeared arbitrary. The tramways of the Newcastle area had a variety of other gauges, wider and narrower, any of which Stephenson might have chosen.  
&gt;  
&gt;**By the 1870’s, archeological excavations at Pompeii and elsewhere were revealing that the gauge Stephenson chose may have been the approximate gauge of Roman road vehicles. In a famous episode, an American engineer, Walton W. Evans, sought to test this hypothesis by measuring with a metric rule – so as to avoid bias – the ruts made by carts and chariots at Pompeii. He converted his measurements to inches and found that the ruts, center to center, were about 4 feet, 9 inches, consistent with a gauge of slightly less than that. Later archeology confirmed that this was the Romans’ common gauge.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The survival of this gauge for road vehicles in Western Europe, including Britain, resulted in its being carried over onto early railways. An oral tradition says it was established at two strides of a Roman soldier by Julius Caesar to standardize ruts for his war chariots, but this has no documentary evidence and is not generally accepted. As English railway historian Charles E. Lee wrote, it probably represents the optimal size of a road vehicle relative to the indivisible size of a horse. Anything less would have underutilized the horse, and anything greater would have put excessive strain on the animal. The gauge has been carried over into automotive transport, also.  
&gt;  
&gt;In railroading, the optimal gauge with respect to a horse is irrelevant. Rather, the relevant indivisibility is that of a human being. Any technological process has to be adapted to the fact that human beings generally come only in one size, from 5 feet, 0 inches to 6 feet, 6 inches. Certainly, the gauge of 4 feet, 8-1/2, inches was not grossly inappropriate. It allowed passenger cars that seated two people in comfort on each side of an aisle wide enough for people to pass. Freight cars were large enough to accommodate the size of packages that people could carry in and stack. The equipment had a moderate degree of overhang.  
&gt;  
&gt;Broader gauges tried, and rejected, in England  
&gt;  
&gt;**There has never been a lack of observers who thought 4 feet 8-1/2 was suboptimal**  ***(BCASHERS LLOL HEEHEUHEUEH)*** – men as disparate as James J. Hill, David P. Morgan, and Adolf Hitler, to name three. Essentially, this interpretation is based on the fact that area-volume ratios of cylinders become more favorable as size increases. As a consequence, large boilers produce their output at a lower average cost than small ones. On a broad-gauge steam locomotive, the boiler could be larger and slung lower for greater stability.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The man who followed broad-gauge ideology most thoroughly was Isambard Kingdom Brunel, chief engineer of the Great Western Railway of England,**  ***( SHITCOIN CEO)*** **who thought 4 feet 8-1/2, much too small for the operations at 50 to 60 mph that he envisioned. He adopted a huge gauge of seven feet – apparently exactly 7 feet, 0-1/4 inches – for the Great Western, and testified before Parliament enthusiastically of its superiority. Parliament was not convinced, and mandated 4 feet 8-1/2 for future building, but specified 5 feet 3 for Ireland. This could be interpreted as indicating Parliament really considered a broader gauge preferable, but required 4 feet 8-1/2 simply because it was nearly universal except in the west of England. The Great Western was converted to 4 feet 8-1/2, slowly, bringing broad-gauge operation to an end in 1892.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Early American railroads build to different gauges, then standardize  
&gt;  
&gt;The American experience was similar. The gauge of 4 feet, 8-1/2 inches came here mainly because American engineers expected – erroneously – to use a great many British locomotives. Because early American railroads were expected only to connect bodies of water that were impractical to connect with canals, there is no reason to have expected much gauge uniformity. Early railroads did not anticipate interchange of equipment.  
&gt;  
&gt;But because the Baltimore &amp; Ohio and Boston &amp; Albany used 4 feet, 8-1/2 inches, the gauge was off to a flying start. The Pennsylvania used 4 feet, 9 inches, which was compatible. The 6 feet, 0 inches of the Erie and the Lackawanna was the most important northern broad gauge. The Canadian railways used 5 feet, 6 inches, at least in part, for military considerations.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In the South, broad gauges were dominant. If there was a common gauge there, it was 5 feet, 0 inches. By 1861, track of this gauge extended from Norfolk and Richmond to Memphis and New Orleans, although lack of some physical connections and interchange kept it from being a network.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**The Civil War demonstrated the undesirability of gauge differences. Both the Union and Confederate governments encouraged interchange of equipment. After the war, the rapid growth in grain movements from the Midwest to the East was the greatest single force for homogeneity.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Lincoln administration, after planning the transcontinental railroad at 5 feet, 0 inches to conform with the existing railroad in California, decided on 4 feet 8-1/2 for consistency with the most important Eastern railroads. This assured that 4 feet, 8-1/2 inches would be the North American standard gauge.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Canadian lines converted to it in 1872-1873, and the Southern railroads began a process of conversion that ended with a massive conversion blitz on Memorial Day weekend 1886.  
&gt;  
&gt;Narrow gauge alternatives  
&gt;  
&gt;Oddly, as gauge homogeneity was spreading throughout the continent, there arose a movement for narrow-gauge railroads. A Scottish engineer, Robert Fairlie, in 1870 exposited the idea that great economies in weight could be achieved by use of small equipment such as had become common for private carriers serving mines, timber stands, and factories. His fallacy was reversing the actual relation mentioned earlier, that area-volume ratios become more favorable as size increases.  
&gt;  
&gt;Remarkably under the circumstances, the narrow-gauge movement had a vogue of 13 years, from 1872 to 1885, before it collapsed. Most U.S. narrow-gauge mileage was converted by 1900, although a 3-foot-gauge network in southwestern Colorado survived for almost a century.  
&gt;  
&gt;The damage this movement did was much worse elsewhere. It festooned most of sub-Saharan Africa with a gauge (3 feet, 6 inches) poorly suited to the heavy mineral traffic its railways handled, and it beset India, Australia, and Argentina with serious problems of gauge incompatibility.  
&gt;  
&gt;The editor of the principal railroad trade journal of the 19th century, Matthias Nace Forney of The Railroad Gazette, in the course of his opposition to the narrow-gauge movement in the 1870’s, reported that railroad engineers with whom he had discussed the question had responded, in general, that 4 feet, 8-1/2 inches was slightly suboptimal, and that something around 5 feet 0 would have been better. Forney agreed, but **felt that homogeneity for free-running of equipment nationwide at 4 feet 8-1/2 was more important than any gains that could be gotten by an effort at change.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**No doubt modern engineering techniques could be used to identify an optimal gauge, but short of an impressive demonstration to the contrary, Forney’s view of the 1870’s remains the most valid judgment.**  
&gt;  
&gt;*George W. Hilton, a professor of history at UCLA, has written for TRAINS on numerous subjects since 1964. He is the author of “American Narrow Gauge Railroads,” published by Stanford University Press in 1991, the definitive history on the subject.*

personalfinance,Question about HELOC's,"Cross-posting this from a RE investing group, but thought this sub might be able to help as well. I'm doing some research now and am interested in a HELOC. Here's why:

I want to invest, but the market is stupid right now and I'm refusing to buy. HOWEVER, the market being stupid means that my personal homes value is also thru the roof. That said, I want to apply for a HELOC NOW while the values are high, to lock in as much available credit as possible, so that when the market does finally cool down, I can use those funds then when it'll be harder to come up with that much cash.

That said, when shopping HELOC's what are the main things I should be looking for? Fees? Interest rates? Any special terms to look out for?",finance
personalfinance,Filing a tax amendment through H&amp;R Block and I went from being refunded 2000 to owing 66 just by adding 696 as Social Security income? I'm very confused. Help?,"So I messed up my original return I filed about an hour ago because I forgot to include a SSA-1099 for $696 in benefits I received during 2020. Besides my job's income of $49,753.28 I've received no other income. My deductions were just the standard $12,400 according to H&amp;R Block's online filing.

&amp;#x200B;

According to their system my taxable income is $37,945, the taxes I owe are only $4,354, I have $1,800 in credits, and the taxes I've already paid are $7,105. 

&amp;#x200B;

My original return of $2,751 (calculated before I added the SSA benefit) seemed accurate. Now with the information stated above they're calculating that I now owe $66 in federal taxes somehow. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this an error on H&amp;R Block's end? Or is there something I'm missing? Help?",finance

personalfinance,House buying or waiting? Help an idiot out!,"Hi everyone! 

So I am a pediatric dental resident right now. My salary is about 70k. I have a total of $108k in student loan debt from dental school. I have a 760 credit score.

Now enough about me , on to my situation! 
I will be graduating in July of 2022 . Shortly after I anticipate of having a job paying close to or over 250k a year. My question is simple. When considering buying a property versus renting, do you guys think I should look to buying a property as soon as I find a good job (probably around end of 2022) or should I be more focused on reducing my debt to get better interest rates? Would love any advise on this topic or if you were in a similar situation.

CryptoCurrency,DeFi: a guide for beginners,"Decentralized Finance

or “DeFi” is an independently operating financial system that does not rely on centralized financial intermediaries like banks, unions or insurance funds.

The users, with the use of smart contracts, have the ability to trade, invest, and transact peer to peer using crypto currencies.

This eliminates the middle man which in this case are the slow and costly intermediaries.

DeFi is a complex financial use case of blockchain, helping in taking the right step towards mainstream adoption of crypto and blockchain technology. Other such cases include flash loans, derivatives, yield farming and lending.

Why DeFi?

Centralized financial systems are slow, costly and vulnerable to data hacks, breaches and security issues. To make understanding the concept of DeFi simpler, think of a scenario where your bank makes a bad investment, or increases its fees. It ends up with the customer losing out.

In DeFi, the products, applications, and services, as well as the assets they service, are decentralized and therefore free from these points of failure found in centralized financial systems.

Advantages of DeFi

Users have the flexibility to trade and transact with nothing but an internet connection, eliminating any scope of discrimination taking place

Instant and fast transfers along with reduced fees and charges are the most immediate benefits a user can observe while using DeFi. There are none to minimal intermediaries, reducing the need of paying the said intermediaries using fees.

DeFi lending protocols offer high interest rates for deposits along with low fees and favorable terms on loans and line of credit

DeFi offers equitable access to financial services to all and anyone with just an internet connection.

Yield farming allows investors to borrow and lend their crypto currencies at much higher rates than traditional banking and investments

This has been a thorough overview of what DeFi is, and how it is useful to the crypto community. I would like to make a follow up post on DeFi in detail

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 03.27.2021,"Hey Everyone!

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list.

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/o-5hVFoqF6E](https://youtu.be/o-5hVFoqF6E)

Let's go....

Newly covered today:

1. Someone paid $23k for the notorious “Your telling the CEO of IOHK…” tweet.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u_a)
2. IOHK is rolling out a new team that will fight the scammers in crypto. In my mind this involves guys in polo shirts with popped collars carrying [these](https://www.heckler-koch.com/en/products/military/submachine-guns/mp7a1/mp7a2/overview.html) and hunting the bad guys while ‘90s action movie music plays. Probably Dwayne Johnson is their commander. Maybe that’s not what Charles has in mind.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1375473873651568640](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1375473873651568640)
3. Cardano is the Tesla of crypto. We’re just in that early stage right before the Model 3 launch where the Ford and GM guys are at peak fear/peak shit talking but we haven’t made that big move yet.  “It’s an illusion, they’ll never release a sub $40k car.”  We’ll see shortly, gentlemen...we’ll see.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369397063583227911](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369397063583227911) [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1369402020067766275](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1369402020067766275)
2. Famed crypto enthusiast and billionaire Mike Novogratz asks the Cardano world ""Can anyone make a real bull case for [$ADA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=cashtag_click)? Does anyone build on it? Use it? Why is market cap so high? Should it be a funding asset? It’s one of the few cryptos I haven’t traded in my life.""

8. Charles will be speaking at the Blockchain Africa Conference this week which may or may not give us more clues as to the African Bird announcement. [https://blockchainafrica.co/](https://blockchainafrica.co/)
9. SingularityNet collaboration with Cardano going down. How else is Skynet gonna pay the Terminators?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ) [https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos)
10. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
11. ~~What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?~~ [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1) RETIRED!
12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh.
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)
14. Charles claimed Elon was trolling Cardano with “meta for k” on twitter. Can anyone argue one way or another on this? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1364350825271685122](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1364350825271685122)

16. Possible Soulja Boy Cardano collab on NFT. Maybe Soulja Boy could be best brohs with Charles and Stephen Wolfram broh? [https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907](https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907)
17. ~~Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?~~ RETIRED!
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. ~~Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark.~~ (Retired: he finally got it) Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!

25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years.
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

35. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have a hairline that is even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.
36. Cardano reached 550k wallets in half the time it took BTC [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1369933366368362496](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1369933366368362496)
37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum).

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

70. Perceptions are shifting on which platform will be #1 for smart contracts over the next decade. Here’s the biggest crypto youtuber asking his co-host if he’s losing faith in the traditional #1. If you’re in Cardano, you can guess which coin his answer is shifting away from. [https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270](https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270)

74. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity. He specifically mentioned Atala Prism. There was talk of the digital identity being able to be linked to wallets, payment systems, and property. He also reasserted that the deals on the table in Africa would bring “millions of users” into the Cardano ecosystem.

79. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months.

90. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).

91. We are starting to see cracks in the psychological armor of the Ethereum crowd.  This anti-Cardano post was at 0 upvotes (at time of writing) while the fairly pro-Cardano response received triple figure upvotes.

92. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).

96. A guy tried to use Charles’s reaction to the King Soopers tragedy in Boulder to criticize Cardano. Charles told him to go f\*\*\* himself and then auctioned off the tweet with proceeds going to the families of the victims. The auction price quickly hit four figures and closed at $7k.

99. Great new interview with Sebastien! In this one he explains a lot about the dApp Connector being built by Emurgo. As reported by a commenter in one of our earlier threads, it will work with Ergo first and then Cardano. A very interesting tidbit was Sebastien’s explanation of how the Emurgo dApp Connector will actually be safer than Metamask (which fills a similar role in the ETH ecosystem).  Very good info. Thanks to Sebastien and the Cardano Podcast! [https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY](https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY)
100. Today is Cardano 360 day!!!!  Watch it here at 10:30AM Pacific, 17:30 GMT, 18:30 CET.  This is the live monthly streaming show from IOHK.  Watch this one. Hopefully we’ll get a target date for Alonzo.  That’ll tell us when we get smart contracts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg)
101. Looks like the Cardano 360 show may highlight how Cardano will not experience some of the shortcomings that leading blockchains have in the past (like the time that bitcoin accidentally issued 184 billion BTC in one block).  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1374783084881608706](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1374783084881608706)
102. Catalyst Fund 5 will have a $2MM total budget! Included will be a very interesting $50k Metadata challenge in Fund 5.  Metadata can be used to prove the existence of a certain document or event to third parties without necessarily revealing the data contained therein. This means you can do cool things on the blockchain without using smart contracts as in the prior New Balance anti-counterfeiting and Beefchain traceability Cardano projects.The winners of this challenge are actually going to be incubated and supported by the IOHK Metadata team! People waiting for Goguen and smart contracts are definitely sleeping on what can be done with metadata on Cardano today.

105. Cardano 360 was yesterday! The big news first: it sounds like the Alonzo (smart contracts)  testnet will launch around end of April or early May. It’s looking like Alonzo HFC event will happen on main net late July or August. The stream was over three hours long. They covered so much! Now, let’s get to the other details revealed. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8)
106. Grigory Rosu from Runtime Verification gave a big rundown on the universality in programming languages that will be provided by K framework in Cardano.  He said he should have some kind of proof of concept around six months from now.
107. Michael Peyton Jones and Manual Chakravarty (the architects of Plutus) talked about 1) the benefits of Cardano’s modern approach to designing Plutus TX and Plutus Core and how Plutus Core basically being lambda calculus allows for mathematical verification of software written in Plutus, 2) how UTXO (and EUTXO in Cardano) are much more battle proven than other ledger accounting systems like account balance system (e.g. ETH) which have had problems, 3) how non-fungible role tokens will be a thing, and 4) how they are now laying out a real development platform for builders instead of just throwing Plutus out into the world.
108. Lars Brünjes (Head of Education) laid out how they are going to train a group of developers through the Plutus Pioneers program.  That group will help test the Alonzo test net after it launches.
109. Lars has also cloned Uniswap in Plutus with a graphical user interface and completely automated price discovery in the liquidity pools.  He did this as a proof of concept to show the capabilities of Plutus. That was demoed right on the stream.
110. They then brought on people from three different Haskell development firms who will be building things on the testnet as a sort of “red team” test of Alonzo.  They all seemed to be very capable in terms of Haskell development (note here that Plutus is basically Haskell).
111. Tom Lindeman (Chief Security Officer at Runtime Verification) then laid out how disastrous the last few years in Ethereum have been for smart contract security.  But, Cardano has a solution.  IOHK and Runtime Verification will partner to certify smart contracts as to security.  Runtime Verification will do the security audits.  This program will be called “Alpha Frontier”.
112. Charles then laid out the details of the timeline for Alonzo as described above.   It sounds like they are targeting to be totally done and hit a code/feature freeze at the end of June.  But, it will take Coinbase, Kraken, Binance et al. at least four weeks to update their systems before they can actually launch smart contracts on mainnet.
113. Collin Edwards and Duncan Couts then gave us an update on the stake pool world as we approach “D DAy” or d=0 which is full decentralization of block production. A stake pool operator Shawn McMurdo has made some Cardano Improvement proposals as to 1) a non-linear curved basis for a0 (pronounced a-naught, represents stake pool operator pledge) to affect rewards more greatly, 2) non-centralized rankings in Daedalus, and 3) an adjustment to minimum fees from fixed to variable.   Collin and Duncan clarified there will be no changes to a0 (pledge) or k (max pool size) at the d=0 (full decentralization) event coming up. Duncan also laid out how they are going to launch P2P node testnet in early Q2.  This will allow for information to flow directly between nodes and will accomplish automation of things like peer discovery that are currently manual on the network.
114. Dor Garbash then gave an update on Catalyst.  As covered previously here, Catalyst has become a monster.  There are 17k people in Ideascale and the treasury is worth more than $400MM.  You heard that right, almost a half billion dollars in the Catalyst Treasury.  We also heard from a bunch of the previous catalyst winners.

personalfinance,How long should I save for a house down payment before I start investing?,"I make a base salary of 38,000 a year. With overtime I can push it to $50-55k, but that comes with working a lot of overtime. As a single income family (at the moment; Wife may go to work as child gets older, but we are unsure) I feel that the time it takes to save up and end up buying &amp; paying off a house I'm missing out on the investing I need to make to be able to retire.

I have a good retirement account with my employer and am estimated at current projections to have around $800,000 in savings when I retire. That's investing a mandatory 7% (can't opt in for more or less) with employer match at 225%. (Not sure what the max amount is for their contributions - Will find out soon).

I've been following Dave Ramsey's advice. I liked his plan because of the psychological part of it and it's helped me, but I feel that at my income it will take too long to buy and pay off a house.

We are currently saving up our Emergency Fund. I am having difficulties deciding what my EF should be. I have an extremely stable job (mostly because it's nationally short staffed year round) so unless I do something to get myself fired, I'm not losing my job. I know my EF is liquid cash for things like car breakdowns, water heater replacement, etc etc; so I was thinking I should stick more along the lines of a 4 or 5 month EF for now since I rent.

My question is; When should I stop saving up aggressively for a house and focus on my 15% retirement investment and start investing in the stock market?

Edit: A bit more information that may be necessary

I am 29 yrs old.

We get annual raises and Overtime is always available.

House price range I feel is doable (with overtime) at around the 100-120k mark, which gives us a ton of options.

Currently have none saved up as we're working on EF. Estimated to have full EF built prior to December 2021.",finance

Bitcoin,Can someone ELI5 why Michael Saylor says its beneficial to borrow against crypto. I can't get my head around it.,"He says it is a non taxable event to borrow money vs selling. And you get to keep your btc. But you have to always extend the loan (which will work because fiat loses in value compared to btc) to pay for the interest. And I suppose he means that I should put the money I loan into stocks or something to let them work for me. However if extend your loan then you owe more money, so in essence your collateral, ie your Bitcoin becomes less worth. Now how is that different to selling small amounts of btc every year? I mean I have to pay tax for revenue I make on the stocks... and if I spend the money then I just devalue my btc collateral. If lender decides to liquidate my collateral then I have to pay the tax I presume. 

Did he think this through or am I being slow? Please ELI5 to me...

Is the thing that theoretically that I should be able to get much lower interest rates if you can back up your loan by 100% collateral? But currently coinbase takes a lot more that an ordinary loan... Maybe in the future?

**Update**
OK I think I got it now. Call me stupid it's OK. Important thing is I get it not what people call me.

I think I was confused by the fact that I was trying to come up with a way to make  an extra passive income by borrowing money against btc and investing it. But that is of course not possible because btc IS the passive income! So I can only likely make it worse (I mean if I don't start a very successful business or something but that is not a passive income). But this isn't what Saylor says I should do either. What he says is that if I need money TO SPEND now, I should borrow instead and delay the selling for as long as I can until the loan shark absolutely needs his money back. This way I will have lost less than selling right away would have. There will always be a taxable event at the end of time (liquidation) but it will involve less value because money will be worth less. Thanks for clearing things up.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 29th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 29th, 2021.

# **The end of the quarter could create volatility for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/the-end-of-the-quarter-could-create-volatility-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could be buffeted by end-of-quarter trading in the week ahead, as pension funds and other big investors buy bonds and sell stocks to rebalance their portfolios.
*****
&gt; The dramatic move higher in bond yields this quarter sets up fund managers to shift their holdings, to make up for the shortfall in bond holdings.
*****
&gt; The focus in the coming week could turn to the overall economy, with the March employment report expected Friday and the White House’s infrastructure plans expected to be unveiled Wednesday. There is also ISM manufacturing data released on Thursday.
*****
&gt; The March jobs report is scheduled for a morning when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday, but bonds will trade half a day, ending at noon. Economists expect 630,000 jobs were added in March, and the unemployment rate fell to 6% from 6.2%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; President Joe Biden is expected to unveil details of his $3 trillion to $4 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, but strategists say it is too soon to say what form the plan could take or how large it will be in its final form.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, while Treasury yields were less volatile. The closely watched 10-year was at 1.67% Friday, down from 1.75% in the prior week. Yields move opposite price, and strategists expect rates to continue to slip in the coming week as investors rebalance their holdings.
*****
&gt; “It’s the last week of the quarter so there could be just a lot of noise related to that,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. “Obviously, we’ll be keeping an eye on bonds. The 10-year now seems to be in a range of 1.60% to 1.70%. I think people are just trying to find their footing here. They’re trying to figure it out.”
*****
&gt; Some strategists say the quarter-end trade could end up being positive for stocks, especially big cap tech, since rates have stopped moving higher temporarily.
*****
&gt; Stocks are higher for the quarter so far. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.6% for the week and up 5.8% for the quarter to date. The Dow was up 1.4% for the week, and has an 8% gain for the first quarter so far. The Nasdaq has been the laggard, falling 0.6% for the week and up 1.9% for the quarter.
*****
&gt; Bonds have staged a much more dramatic move for the quarter with the benchmark 10-year yield rising from 0.93% at the end of last year.
*****
&gt; “It’s in the driver’s seat right now,” said NatWest’s Blake Gwinn of the 10-year yield. The 10-year is the most widely followed yield since it influences mortgages and other key financing rates.
*****
&gt; Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy, said he changed his view on the 10-year and he now expects the yield to reach 2% by year-end from 1.75%. But in the near term, he said, the yield could continue to fall as big funds buy Treasurys. Japanese investors are also expected to be active buyers around their year-end, which is Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “If anything, we’re really hoping it continues to push yields a little lower, so it gives us a better spot to get involved in shorts again,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Infrastructure plan
&gt; Gwinn said he is focused on the Biden infrastructure plan and does not believe it is yet priced into the market. The $1.9 trillion fiscal plan, just signed by the president, was one driver of bond yields, as investors weighed the anticipated bump in economic activity and higher debt levels it will bring.
*****
&gt; “The Biden plan to me is the biggest risk for the Treasury market right now. I don’t have what is the full Biden plan happening this year priced in to my ... forecast,” he said. “If all of a sudden we start moving quickly on that, and that starts coming together in Q2, I’m going to have to reconsider my 2% target.”
*****
&gt; Gwinn said the market has “fiscal fatigue.”
*****
&gt; “There’s a lot of doubt and uncertainty about how it’s going to be passed, when it’s going to be passed and whether it’s going to be passed ... It’s not tangible enough,” he said.
*****
&gt; The plan is expected to span multiple years, and Democrats are expected to seek tax hikes to pay for it.
*****
&gt; # Rotation
&gt; The rotation into cyclicals and value stocks is expected to continue into the next quarter. For the first quarter so far, energy and financials were the best performers, up about 33% and 16.5% respectively. Tech was up 1.7%, but it was a better performer than utilities and consumer staples.
*****
&gt; “I think certain parts of the market have plenty of upside but part of that may come at the expense of the growth stocks,” said Dan Suzuki, deputy CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He also expects growth stocks to continue to react negatively to rising interest rates and positively when they fall. That trade decoupled somewhat in the past week.
*****
&gt; “It’s not going to match one for one with every wiggle,” he said. “I think the basis behind it is real. If you think rates are going to get up to 2% by the end of the year, that’s really bad for expensive high-growth names. The markets care less about absolute levels and more about direction. The higher rates go, the worse it is for high multiple stocks.”
*****
&gt; Suzuki said the rise in rates is knocking some of the froth out of the market. The stocks of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, had been jumping on their first days of trading in February, averaging more than 5% gains, and saw no gain in March, according to data from a University of Florida finance professor.
*****
&gt; “As we’re seeing the economy get better and better at an incredible fast rate, especially when you add on stimulus, you have companies that are going to benefit most from that acceleration, that are going to be up 2X, 3X plus,” he said. “To their credit, those high multiple growth stocks were so resilient last year ... Tech earnings growth is coming in at mid-teens next year, but again, the more cyclical parts of the economy — energy, materials, industrials, small caps, they’re going to put up much stronger earnings growth this year as a result of the recovery.

&gt; # April Almanac: Top DJIA Month – Up 15 in a Row

&gt; April marks the end of the “Best Six Months” for DJIA and the S&amp;P 500. The window for our seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. From our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on November 5, 2020 through yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 16.3% and S&amp;P 500 had advanced 13.2%. These above average gains are encouraging and suggests seasonality is back on track after getting derailed by Covid-19 last year.

&gt; April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, “Tax” month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fifteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.9% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&amp;P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

&gt; The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline (moved to May 17 for 2021) appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April.

&gt; This year, guidance is likely to be the greatest focus as the economy continues to reopen. Traders and investors will likely be looking for signs that “work-from-home” stocks can continue to grow and signs that leisure, hospitality, and travel are rebounding.

&gt; Typical post-election year blues have done little to damper April’s performance since 1953. April is DJIA’s second best month in post-election years, gaining 1.9% on average. April is fourth best for S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. Although post-election year 2005 did suffer a 3% DJIA decline.

&gt; # Historic Year for the S&amp;P 500

&gt; Tomorrow will mark the one-year anniversary of the S&amp;P 500's closing low from the COVID crash, and for most stocks in the index, it has been a historic year. Within the S&amp;P 500, stocks in the index are up an average of 104.22% through Friday's close, and just three stocks - all from the Health Care sector - are actually lower. Leading the losers, Gilead (GILD) has declined over 10%. Recall that GILD performed well during the initial stages of the pandemic on the promising results of its drug Remdesivir in treating COVID patients, but once the market started to rally, it was left behind.

&gt; The table below lists the top 25 performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 since the closing low on 3/23/20. Topping the list with a gargantuan gain of 763% is ViacomCBS (VIAC). After trading below $12 per share last March, the stock is close to triple-digits today. Behind VIAC, Tesla (TSLA), L Brands (LB), Etsy (ETSY), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) round out the top five, and all have gained in excess of 500%. Interestingly enough, despite the strength of the sector for what seems like years now, the only stock on the list from the Technology sector is Enphase Energy (ENPH). In fact, after ENPH, you have to go all the way down to the 53rd spot to find the next stock from the Technology sector (Applied Materials - AMAT, +186%).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-best-stocks1.png))**

&gt; Leading the way higher, stocks in the Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors are both up an average of over 150%, while Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only two sectors where each one's components are up an average of less than 50%. Just to the right of the S&amp;P 500 in the chart below is the Technology sector which is one of five sectors where the average performance of its components is less than 100%. A gain of 96.1% in a year is nothing to sneeze at in any market environment, but just the fact that the average performance of stocks in the Technology sector since the March lows is now lower than the average of the S&amp;P 500 illustrates the shift we have seen since the sector's peak relative strength last fall.

&gt; # The Big Winner of the Past Year: Commodities

&gt; It has been just over a year since the S&amp;P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and while global stock markets have provided historic returns since the low, the biggest winners come from a completely different asset class: commodities. As global activity quickly ground to a halt, commodity prices plummeted, with oil prices even trading for a negative value for the first time in history.

&gt; Since March 23, 2020, commodity markets have roared back as the global economy has emerged from the shadow of COVID-19. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, oil and lumber prices have more than doubled off the lows, while copper prices have pulled back a bit after reaching that feat back in February:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.25.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “After likely their worst period in history, although I wasn’t around for the bubonic plague so I can’t be certain, commodity prices have roared back as the global economy continues to wake up,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The US and China are well ahead of other nations in terms of economy activity and output, so as the rest of the world plays catch up, we wouldn’t be surprised to see commodities rise even further.”

&gt; The emergence from lockdowns and subsequent increase in activity has boosted prices from the outright deflationary environment we saw last spring, to a more reflationary environment in recent months, and this has pulled commodity prices along with it. The commodity market’s top performer, lumber, has seen a particular boom in prices as the “stay at home environment” benefitted the housing market, leading to all-time highs in housing starts in December—even surpassing the high water mark set before the pandemic began. Adding to the fervor, mortgage rates continued to set record lows, falling as low as 2.82%, according to the Bankrate 30-year national average.

&gt; We upgraded our view on oil in our January Global Portfolio Strategy publication, as strong technical factors favored prices to accelerate higher. Further, oil prices have continue to benefit from a favorable supply environment, with OPEC+ maintaining output until global demand rises, though the risk of a global increase in production at higher prices remains a risk to our view.

&gt; # Mean Reversion After Biggest 1-Year Spike Since 1949?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5689a720ed84d38815a99feebc905f12/e0f60c4ce9518235-5d/s500x750/0ac0150b41e963199a102d356909aac776eb265d.jpg))**

&gt; Lots of chatter out there about the giant 1-year gain of 75% on the S&amp;P 500 from the March 23, 2020 low – actually it’s 74.78%. It may very well be the beginning of a new bull market, but that does not mean (pun intended) that we should expect gains like these moving forward.

&gt; We ran the numbers on the 1-year rolling returns for the S&amp;P 500 back to 1949 and while these giant spikes do come at the early stages of extended bull runs gains of this magnitude have not been sustained and the market has tended to revert to the mean. The arithmetic mean or average rolling 1-year return since 1949 is 9.15%, which isn’t bad either.

&gt; With lingering pandemic/vaccine and political and geopolitical issues, all the noise from the Fed and the bond market, Robinhood and Reddit stock pumping, rich valuations, teetering internals, extended technicals – and the end of the Best Six Months November-April on the horizon, it is not inconceivable to expect the market to consolidate over the Worst Six Months May-October (AKA “Sell in May”).

&gt; Last time we had a 1-year rolling return of this magnitude in 2010 when the S&amp;P was up 68.57% on March 9, 2010 from the March 9, 2009 secular bear market low we had a 10.34% correction to the July 2, 2010 low and a 15.75% rolling 1-year return from March 9, 2010 to March 9, 2011. And let’s not forget the May 6, 2010 flash crash. So while we are by no means “bearish” perhaps a little caution and portfolio defense in the near future is not a crazy idea.

personalfinance,"Federal employer taking out Illinois State taxes for all of 2020, but working from home in a non-reciprocal state.","Hey everyone, this is my last ditch effort to try and recoup some of this tax money I don’t think I owe. I live in South Dakota, where we don’t have a state income tax. My federal employer is out of Chicago, but I have been working from home since the start of the pandemic. I started with this employer late last year, so I haven’t worked a single day in Illinois, except when I went to the office to pick up a few things for work. 

But, my employer insists on taking out Illinois taxes despite me explaining the situation over the phone and by email. The Illinois revenue service requires either a letter on company letterhead or a form W-2c in order to accept my return with the lower amount in “Illinois Income tax”. The instruction specifically say they will not accept a letter from me or a tax advisor. My employer says that since my “duty station” is in Illinois, that’s where my taxes come out. I am not military. The discrepancy will amount to thousands this year and last year in taxes I don’t feel I owe, since I am not living or working in Illinois. 

I’ve contacted my employer and the Illinois Revenue Service and it seems I will just have to pay them. I’m having trouble understand what kind of tax professional would be able to help me out with this, if that’s the route that I need to go. Will I have to pay a lawyer, and accountant, HRBlock? I always do my taxes online, so I am pretty lost as to what to do here.

In short, do you think I owe these taxes? Will it be more expensive to try and recover them? What should I search in google to try and find someone knowledgable to assist?

personalfinance,"change in salary, but high student loan debt, advice on planning.","31, single, medium/low cost of living city in the midwest. this is long, and i'm sorry.

 

i have 100k in debt (all federal) from private undergrad and law school. interest rates are between 5 and 6% on the bulk of the loans. i am on REPAYE and have largely made minimum payments for the 4.5 years i have been paying.

 

i currently work in compliance and have increased salary from 40k to 130k (+~20k annual bonus potential) in the past five years. for the majority of that time, i was between 50-60k. the jump from 75k to 130k happened pretty rapidly in the past year. i've been at 130k since december.

 

I am now contributing 10% to retirement and getting a 5% employer match. i have about 45k in that account. i also have 60k in a savings account (dumb).

 

currently monthly take home is $6,400. currently monthly expenses are $2,800, so i have cash to play around with. budget for reference:

 

* rent: $1275
* insurance: $117
* loan: $434
* utilities (+cable/internet): $175 (averaged)
* parking: $230 (building &amp; downtown)
* cable/internet: $50
* groceries: $250
* entertainment/dining: $250


i am not used to this level of cash flow, so i do not have a roth or traditional IRA established. i want to reallocate my savings so i am better positioned to deal with the cash flow and not fall into the habit of ""treating"" myself (work is stressful and i really like leather goods). here's my immediate plan for my existing savings:

 

* allocate $6,000 for 2020 to a roth IRA
* allocate $6,000 bonus funds (to be paid 4/15) to traditional IRA and complete backdoor conversion
* move $25k to HYSA (separate financial institution) as stable emergency fund
* leave $5k in current savings account for short term (vacation, big merchandise purchase) savings
* move remaining $24k to HYSA (separate financial institution) as long-term savings. eventual goal would be in a home purchase in the $250k range (3-5 years)
 

i am completing ignoring student loans in this, and that is really where i need the advice. my current employer is with a new PE firm. with my recent role change, i was granted profits interest. in the previous three years, similar profits interest grants have paid out over $1 million. this is obviously a huge uncertainty, but i think the company is well-positioned to have similar or larger growth in the next three years based on recent activity. the uncertainty here is both exciting and maddening, but i'm trying not to let this potential weigh heavily in my planning.

 

based on where i am and my goals (save aggressively for retirement, purchase a home in 3-5 years), i need a gut check. does it make sense to pay more aggressively on student loans vs. diverting excess monthly funds to long-term savings? the math tells me no - paying more to student loans is an immediate return of 5-6%; my money sitting in a savings account waiting for me to buy a house is...not. but on the flip side...who knows what happens to the federal student loan conversation in 3 years? i know some of this comes down to personal risk tolerance as well, but what would you do?

 

also, recommendations for higher yield savings accounts to hold my long-term savings &amp; emergency funds would be much appreciated. i am only with one financial institution currently and think that probably needs to change.",finance

The public ones are in deferred / forbearance at 0% interest, but that is currently only until September. I am not sure which loan I should prioritize paying off first. 

I think the most beneficial (debt avalanche approach) is to pay off #7 first as it has the highest balance &amp; interest. I admittedly have not touched any of the public loans at all yet. I guess I am holding out currently because of the possibility of student loan forgiveness.   
If we do not get forgiveness, my plan is to refinance the public loans to private at lower interest rates when repayment resumes.

personalfinance,Student Loans VS Buying A House,"Hey all! 

I've got a few questions on which path would lead me to better success in my future goal of buying a house. Long story short, I have parent plus student loans at a 7% interest rate. Right now they are at $49,900, I've been taking advantage of the 0% apr and really paying them down, $1,000 a month. Now, I've also been saving for a house. I have $10,000 saved up for the house. (well this is reading like a math problem from hell) I had the thought this morning that I might want to take that $10K and just put it straight towards the student loans...the problem then is that I'd be at square 1 for the house fund. But, it would help me lower my debt to income ratio considerably and help me lower my payment when i refinance after the 0% interest term ends. 

My goal, in the end, is to be able to purchase a house either way...Which way is going to help me get to that goal and keep it affordable? putting the $10K saved to my student loans? Or continuing to pay my student loans like I have (utilizing the 0% interest rate) and saving for a house fund more?",finance

Now my question is once a car is repossessed voluntarily or involuntarily do they still keep hitting your credit report with monthly missed payments. The reason i wanna do voluntary is to 'soften the impact' on my credit but idk if it works that way. Should i give it back or just drive it a few more months and wait for them to come get it?

4k all monthly expenses, no debt other than primary house and car payment

Looking to finance a vacation home within driving distance and as a short-term rental opportunity that in the area should be able to cover the yearly mortgage during peak season but not a necessity. Usable April to October and would mostly sit between Nov and March. Aiming for 25% rental occupancy with the rest available for us to stay and rent to f&amp;f.

Not saving for anything in particular and 401ks maxed out. The area is increasing so if we had to flip and get out we could but we'd like to keep it for 5-10 years.

personalfinance,Federal Return went from negative to positive with no new input,"Hey, I can pretty much guarantee this is going to be a stupid question because my knowledge of taxes extends as far as clicking check boxes on TurboTax...

But anyway, a few weeks ago I was filing my taxes; I bartended for the first few months, Covid hit, I went on UI, then I got a regular job in July that pays hourly. Nothing super complicated. I also had coverage through Cigna with assistance from the ACA for 10 months, switching to work coverage in November. Lastly, I missed the 2nd round of stimulus and filed for the $600 rebate.

At the end of this, largely due to underestimating how much I'd make during 2020, my health insurance tanked my return and I owed around $300. I wasn't secure enough to pay it immediately so I closed TurboTax and waited a few weeks to save up some money. Today I re-opened TurboTax to bite the bullet and my return has gone from -$300 to +$1,725. I haven't entered any new information or changed anything. All I did was re-open TurboTax.

Was there some sort of government relief passed that adjusted UI debt or debt through the ACA? Did my tax return just get messed up?

Sorry for the long-winded explanation.

personalfinance,Car lease buyout - need help/advice. dealership tried to intimidate me into taking a bad deal,"The 3-year lease on my 2018 honda civic coupe is up in April. The remaining buyout amount is $12,600 (excluding taxes and fees). Car is in excellent condition, only 26k miles on it. 

I was planning to buy it at the end of the lease, and get a loan for some of it. I currently have $18k saved up, but I don’t like going below $10k -12k for emergencies, so I was planning on getting a loan for about $6k-$8k depending on loan term requirements, and doing a 36mo or 48mo loan with a lender that doesn’t have a prepayment penalty in case I decide to pay it off sooner to avoid paying less in interest (which I will most likely do, I just wanted the flexibility to pay less in case a financial emergency came up like losing my job). 

I was told by my friend who originally brokered this deal (he’s in a different industry now) to expect like $1500 in taxes and fees + the $12.6k buyout, and a loan interest rate around 2.7-3.2%.

My credit score is in the 770 range and my income is currently $93k/year (just my base salary, i’m just over $100k with benefits). I’ve never missed a payment of anything in my life. 

l applied to BofA and the apr they gave me was 5.6%! This seems extremely high to me and I have no idea why I don’t qualify for a lower interest rate. I’m 30F if that matters.

I went to my local Honda dealership to find out exactly how much I would owe in taxes and fees, and to see what their loan apr offer would be - again...5.6%!

The sales manager at Honda “helping” me was extremely unprofessional and raged out at me when I said I thought I could find a better apr through another lender. He exploded at me saying that was *impossible* and I wasn’t “allowed” to get a loan through anyone else, and that my ONLY option was to accept his offer (which would have me paying $17k+ total) on the spot. 

He refused to give me the paper showing the offer/cost breakdown (that he only let me look at for about 5 seconds, which was only enough time to see the 5.6% and the total of $17k - not the breakdown), stating it was for internal use only. I wasn’t allowed to talk it over privately with my boyfriend who was with me to help me (I have autism and anxiety), and I wasn’t allowed to take it with me to go home and think about it. Is this normal???

After barking at me, I sort of clammed up and said “well I’m not agreeing to this” and he practically spat in my face that then my only option was to cut a check for the full amount and expect to pay even more than he was offering and all but told us to get the fuck out. 

I’ve never in my life been treated this way by anyone in a sales or service capacity. My boyfriend was equally horrified. We just left and resolved to figure it out later.

personalfinance,How much do you REALLY need in emergency savings?,"6 months living expenses is the rule of thumb, I'm aware. For my spouse and I that would be around $15k. However, there are a few factors that make me think that we may not need this much:

* My income is extremely stable as I'm funded for the next four years by a government-sponsored research fellowship. We are able live comfortably on my income alone and in fact this is what we do, as my spouse's income all goes toward retirement/loan payoff. We also both have side hustles that we could pretty easily ramp up if needed.
* We are renters in sudsidized university housing, which we can stay in until I finish my PhD (4 years) and has capped rent increases. So no major housing repairs or rent hikes to worry about. They're also pretty flexible about delaying rent payments in an emergency.
* We are well-insured in all areas (health, disability, pet, etc.) Only exception is car insurance where we mostly just have liability coverage, no comprehensive or collision, but that's because our car's super old and not worth much. If our car were to need replaced, our plan would be to finance a ""new"" (3-5 year old) car and cut back our retirement contributions for \~4-6 months to pay it off completely. My spouse could also bike or bus to work for a while if needed (I already bike to work as well).
* We set aside money every month into sinking funds for major planned expenses (car maintenance, insurance premiums, etc.) which is on top of our existing emergency fund.
* Our only debt is federal student loans, which are currently deferred. After September they'll be $200/mo which we can still afford if living on my income alone. The interest rate is quite low so paying minimums for a while is not a big deal.
* We have no plans for children or additional pets (we have one cat).
* We're in our 20s with no known health conditions (plus good insurance through my work with $0 deductible and $5000 out-of-pocket limit, again guaranteed for the next 4 years).
* We have around $50k invested across our 401ks, Roth IRAs, and taxable brokerage (each month we contribute around $1900). If a REALLY big emergency were to arise, we could sell our taxable portfolio (minimal capital gains tax at our current income level), take out a 401k loan, or withdraw IRA contributions.

Based on the above, it seems to me like there's really no need to keep the full $15k in our savings account when it would be better served going toward student loans or investment goals. More like $5-10k seems reasonable to me--I genuinely can't think of anything that could wipe out more than this other than some kind of apocalypse. But I'm open to being convinced otherwise--if I'm way off here, please set me straight! Am I forgetting any kinds of emergencies that we need to plan for?",finance

**First of all, let me start by saying that im not a financial expert nor a financial advisor. This is not financial advice.**

Second, a big thank you to everyone in r/CryptoCurrency. Great community! The amount of education I was able to get in a short amount of time, is also thanks to many of you! Im converting most of my personal wealth to crypto and Im already on the works to change pretty much 100% the way my company works. Professional/Social world is now a digital experience, that has many implications and I couldn't just remain still while the whole world around me is shifting.

&amp;#x200B;

^((ok, lets start))

# Why we are in the beginning of the Biggest Bull Market in Crypto?

Because we are reaching the end of the Dollar/debt monetary system. GMR. What does this mean? Global Monetary Reset. The last one was in 1971. Some information about it:

**1971 GMR Facts**

* US President Nixon temporarily suspended the dollar's convertibility into gold (effectively permanent - still suspended as of 2018)
* This effectively ended the [Bretton Woods Agreement](https://www.finnotes.org/events/Bretton-Woods)

**Before the 1971 GMR**

* Previously dollars were convertible into gold at $35 per ounce

**After the 1971 GMR**

* The dollar is no longer convertible into a fixed value of anything
* Allowed all currencies to float against each other
* Allowed politicians and central bankers to print money and spend with abandon (convertability to gold was not holding them back)
   * Allowed large deficit spending
   * Allowed rapid increase in credit
   * Resulted in inflation
* Effectively removed the mechanism that balanced trade deficits over time
   * Resulted in some countries having massive and long-sustained trade deficits
   * trade and account balances never get settled (since there is no global reserve asset like gold)
* Allowed domestic monetary polices to avoid financial discipline that was historically imposed by the gold standard
   * trade imbalanced no longer resulted in loss of gold &amp; domestic deflation

**Reasons for the 1971 GMR**

* The US printed more dollars that it could back with how much gold it had (at the $35 exchange rate)
   * Cause by significant war spending (Korean war, Vietnam, Cold war) and welfare spending
* Due to the rise in US paper dollars, foreign countries started to convert their dollars into gold
* This started to quickly drain the US gold supply
* Ending the dollar convertibility to gold stopped this outflow

**1971 GMR Impacts**

* Removed the primary reason why foreign countries held dollars
* The dollar started to depreciate rapidly against other currencies
* Oil producing countries started to ask for payment in gold instead of dollars
* Created the need for the [Petrodollar System](https://www.finnotes.org/terms/Petrodollar-System)Source: [link](https://www.finnotes.org/events/1971-gmr)

**Now for some perspective, lets also check out some actual numbers and charts.**

**M1 Money Stock -** [**https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/FRED-M1/**](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/FRED-M1/)

What Is M1?

M1 is the [money supply](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/money-supply/) that is composed of physical currency and coin, demand deposits, travelers' checks, other checkable deposits, and negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts. M1 includes the most liquid portions of the money supply because it contains currency and assets that either are or can be quickly converted to cash. However, ""near money"" and ""near, near money,"" which fall under M2 and M3, cannot be converted to currency as quickly. [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/m1.asp)

Great. Now lets look at our baby.

**Bitcoin -** [https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/)

Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to. All bitcoin transactions are verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being [legal tender](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/legal-tender.asp), Bitcoin is very popular and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies, collectively referred to as [altcoins](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altcoin.asp). Bitcoin is commonly abbreviated as ""BTC."" [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp)

Great. The charts had a huge spike, almost correlated I guess. Lets not make assumptions here! Ok, lets look at some more data.

**The Greatest Wealth Transfer In History -** [**https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhall/2019/11/11/the-greatest-wealth-transfer-in-history-whats-happening-and-what-are-the-implications/**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhall/2019/11/11/the-greatest-wealth-transfer-in-history-whats-happening-and-what-are-the-implications/) **-**  Nov 11, 2019

Over the next two decades, the United States will experience an unprecedented shift of demographics and finances that will likely be felt by every American.

Baby Boomers, the generation of people born between 1944 and 1964, are expected to transfer $30 trillion in wealth to younger generations over the next many years. This jaw-dropping amount has led many journalists and financial experts to refer to the gradual event as the “great wealth transfer.”

In no prior time in the history of America has such a vast amount of wealth moved through the hands of generations.

**Bitcoin is 'more a substitute for gold than the dollar' — Fed Chair Powell**While Bitcoin (BTC) is too volatile to be money and is ""backed by nothing,"" it could be a ""substitute for gold,"" said the chair of the United States Federal Reserve.

Speaking at an event hosted by the Bank for International Settlements, or BIS, on Monday, Jerome Powell delivered frank comments in response to a question on cryptocurrency. [Source](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-is-more-a-substitute-for-gold-than-the-dollar-fed-chair-powell)

For now, we have a Money stock chart that looks similar to Bitcoin chart, which means that there is a correlation with the increase amount of money in the world and the growing of bitcoins market cap.  The younger generation are the ""Bitcoiners"", and at the same time we will witness **The Greatest Wealth Transfer In History.** Then, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is already saying it might be a substitute for gold...

**Automation &amp; Job loss StatisticsMore than 25% of jobs in the US are experiencing high levels of disruption due to automation.**

This figure amounted to 36 million jobs in 2016, with more than 70% at high risk of being replaced by automation. The same research on jobs at risk of automation found that 36% of American workers face medium-level exposure to these disruptive technologies by 2030, while 39% – or 57 million jobs – will face low-level exposure.

# Enough of data. Now let me tell you what is my interpretation. Its worth what its worth.

I believe we are already in the middle-end stages of the transition of monetary system. Its not meant to be a 1 day thing. And if we think that when they are FOMOing, we are being a bit naive imo. Changes with gigantic proportions like a monetary system reset takes years until its in place. So now, let me remind you of the massive corporation and institutional adoption of Bitcoin during 2020 and in the start of 2021, it is only getting faster and wider. Now, lets also remember the fact that Bitcoin's 2024\* halvening will dramatically decrease the Bitcoin supply, just like last year.

I am honestly OVERWHELMED by how far the crypto world has evolved. The amount of good ideas in the space is mind blowing. What I see hapenning in the future? DeFi is bringing a new economy. A new way of work, A new way of getting value. Its not money anymore, its cryptocurrency. Examples of this:

* Brave users are rewarded in BAT (Basic Attention Token) for the ads they watch. Users get paid by attention spent on ads.
* Decentraland casino is now HIRING! - [link](https://www.coindesk.com/this-casino-in-decentraland-is-hiring-for-real)
* Many games rewarding players with crypto
* r/CryptoCurrency and moons. In the future, who knows what this little thingy can do/buy,
* The whole NFT industry will most likely be the new way of distributing art and media, who knows what more can come from there.

nuclear,Don't forget to advocate for Nuclear Power,"While I know we all love having a place to talk about the benefits and need for Nuclear Power it also doesn't do a lot of good for us to be talking to each other if we don't try to engage with power brokers (politicians). So I'm going to lay out why now is a good time to get in contact with your representatives and how to do it. This will be US-focused but for non-Americans (that live in places that have representatives) feel free to use the comments to provide tips and info on contacting your politicians.

**Why Write Now**

* First, it's never the wrong time to write your representative. If there is something you want to see them do or a vote you want them to be a yes/no vote on, tell them that.
* The Federal government is looking at a massive infrastructure bill that has a large clean energy component. (March 2021)
* The perception is that Nuclear Energy is unpopular in the electorate.
* Politicians are often responsive to what will get them elected next not what they think is the best option. So they may choose anti-nuclear if they think their district is against nuclear because that's how they keep their job.
* Very few people actually interact with their politicians so a few letters/calls of support can go a long way to influence their opinion.

**Things To Remember**

* Your representative probably won't read your letter or answer your phone call, their staff will. Don't be offended by this, they are busy.
* Because it's mostly staff reading these letters or taking phone calls. Keep it short. Your contact is probably going to be aggregated and summarized anyway so there is no point in writing a short novel or ranting for 10+ minutes. Stay concise and stick to 1 topic.
* The goal is not to crap on renewables the goal is to endorse Nuclear power. So try to stay positive.
* Also, stay nice, there is no reason to get yourself labeled as a crazy person.
* I find it helpful to use a current event or study as a thesis. For example, the recent air-pollution death toll study from Harvard worked great as a way to frame the importance of transitioning away from dirty energy and into safer nuclear power.
* Generally, the order of impact for contacting a representative is: Phone call &gt; Email &gt; Letter
* If you'd like more tips and things to consider Berkeley has a guide here: [https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/ContactingOfficials/Tips](https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/ContactingOfficials/Tips)
* While it's related to police violence this piece also has good info on things to remember when writing or calling: [https://www.mic.com/p/how-to-contact-your-representatives-make-sure-youre-actually-heard-27624733](https://www.mic.com/p/how-to-contact-your-representatives-make-sure-youre-actually-heard-27624733)

**How to do it.**

* You can look up your house rep and their contact information here: [https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
* You can look up your senator and their contact information here:[https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm?OrderBy=state&amp;Sort=ASC](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm?OrderBy=state&amp;Sort=ASC)
* I personally prefer this tool that takes care of all the leg work for you and connects to FB-messenger, Imessage, text and etc... (I've been using this for 3+ years and have gotten many responses from my representative so I know it works. It doesn't just blackhole your messages.): [https://resist.bot/](https://resist.bot/)

That's all, I hope everyone has a great day and at least considers contacting their politicians to support Nuclear Power :)

personalfinance,I need help on what to decide for my future as a 36 year old single mom.,"I am a single mother of 7-year-old twins b/g. My annual income is $35k plus $6k of child support. My only debt at the moment is a 10K in a car loan that will be paid in 4 years, and 6K in student loans. Right now, I have 9k saved, which will grow to 20k by March 2022. I am 36 years old and I need advice in how to prioritize the different aspects of my life so I can set myself up for success in the future. I am having issues with the following:

· I was a SAHM, during that time I took classes and finished an advanced certificate in accounting, as I already have a bachelor’s degree. I decided to take classes to finish another bachelor degree in accounting. That will take another year and when I finish the degree, I will have a total of 20k in student loans. Another option, much cheaper, would be to study for the CPA and if I pass the exams, I might have a better job.

· I need a place to live and right now I am renting a 1 bedroom for $1050/ month, but I need at least 2 bedrooms as my kids are getting older and my son needs his own room. I am planning buying a two-bedroom apartment, while my son will have his room me and my daughter will share a bedroom. I was pre-approved for a 140k loan, with a 3.1% interest rate and 3% down payment. If I buy a 2-bedroom apartment my monthly mortgage will be $1250, but if I rent, I will pay $1450, I am planning in living this way for 6 years, which will save me $4.600 ($14600 savings for not renting – 10000 down payment and closing costs), plus after 6 years the mortgage will be down 24k.

What I am struggling to decide is should I put off my studies aside by now and focus on the CPA, as that would cost me only $800 instead for the 20K for the second bachelor? This way I can buy a place for my kids and I to live in for the next 6 years. Or should I finish my studies first and after that when I have a better financial situation, I buy a better place? I can also just put school on hold till beginning of next year so I can buy an apartment before incurring extra debt.

Furthermore, I do not have retirement plan or college savings for my kids, so even if I am able to improve my income life in the near future, I would be living in the apartment for the 6 years so I can catch up with other things.

P.S.: Thank you everybody for your answers, I will work to get the CPA first. I appreciate everybody's response.",finance
personalfinance,Phished: Facebook Bitcoin Exchange Scam!,"I’m pretty sure I got scammed and now I’m not sure what to do next to protect myself.

Phished (don't let this happen to you)

I joined Facebook Dating on a whim at the end of Feb. since I was bored from isolation and was contacted by a couple guys supposedly in my area who wanted me to add them on WhatsApp. Conversations were light for a while and then they started talking about teaching me how to make money on the side during the pandemic via Bitcoin/BTC when I mentioned that I was job-hunting. It seemed natural at the time since this was right after Elon Musk backed bitcoin so everyone seemed to be buzzing about it. The guys posed themselves as being successful at trades and asked me to sign up for accounts at different (fraudulent) online exchanges ([bitcoinpro.vip](http://bitcoinpro.vip/); [down.nnjah68.me/app.php/MTc5](http://down.nnjah68.me/app.php/MTc5) CBIX/Hundsun; [rioajsd88.vip](http://rioajsd88.vip/); and [beheld.vip](http://beheld.vip/)) based in Asia so they could coach me and show me how to make money by buying and selling BTC futures in 30s, 60s, and 180s duration. All these so-called exchanges looked and functioned pretty much the same and I couldn't find anything online saying these were fraudulent. I signed up for three, but only attempted to deposit funds into two. One guy disappeared. One wanted to be my protector (and called me everyday to check up on me and on the status of my deposits). Another said he wanted to seriously date me but had to leave on a business trip where he caught COVID and is now quarantined. Incidentally, this lover boy refuses to video chat due to a “traumatic experience” so these scammers are probably stealing identities and catfishing.

While setting up these new accounts, the guys made sure to emphasize securing my account by verifying my identity via photos of my driver’s license and passport as well as listing my personal bank account. At first, the customer service reps for the exchanges all gave me the same routing information for a business account at a U.S.-based bank so I thought that looked legit and made four small deposits, two transactions ending up failing. Both guys started guiding me and it was easy just following their instructions. I was making about 15% (minus fees) on small 30s trades. Then “protector” told me that there was a promotional giveaway, that if you hit a certain amount of funds in your account, you get a certain amount in bonus. He said to ask the customer service rep of one of the exchanges for a “reservation” and encouraged me to take out risky loans and borrow from friends and family in order to reach the target goal of twenty thousand USD. I told him I couldn't go to my parents since they're in debt (pandemic economy) so he planted the idea that I could help them out with the money I'd be making. He even said he’d pitch in with a few thousand USD to reach it, so I ended up taking out a personal loan. This time, the exchange was asking me to wire funds to a personal account in Hong Kong (I reported this to my bank for wire fraud). The transaction was completed and I got the bonus so he coached me again using larger trades, earning 30% in the 60s bids; nearly doubling what I deposited.

A week ago, “lover boy” used a different tactic. I didn’t have money to deposit so he told me to take an advance from the exchange itself. The customer service rep just loaded my account with a sixty thousand USD advance somehow (did they check my credit score?). “Lover boy” coached me in the futures earning 45% due to the larger investment, almost tripling the borrowed amount. However, the funds in the account are frozen until I can deposit sixty thousand USD plus interest. I never signed any document and was simply sent an electronic notice stating a daily interest rate of 0.05%, now have one month to pay it off, and am subject to the legal measures for failure to pay. “Lover boy” says he’ll pitch in if I can pay for 20% of it. I don’t understand how this is legally binding or enforceable, and the exchange is threatening me into submission.

Meanwhile, “protector” said since I was only short another ten thousand to reach the next level of bonus on his exchange, he asked me to “reserve” a spot for fifty thousand USD with the rep, which would help pay for the advance from “lover boy’s” exchange. Only after I signed up did he tell me that the fluctuations were really bad so he couldn’t coach me more and risk losing my money, leaving me no other choice but to borrow money. I asked the customer service rep to cancel the reservation and they said no, that my account would be frozen until I deposited the balance and I would be prosecuted if I reneged. “Protector” said he would chip in again if I scrounged for half of it, which I don’t have.

I’ve just stopped communications with the guys but everyday for four weeks, they acted like they genuinely cared for my wellbeing, that the financial trades were just a means to ensure stable income. Now that I’ve read up on romance scams preying on the vulnerable, esp. during COVID ([Romance Scam](https://support.hbfile.net/hc/en-us/articles/900003462106), [BBC Life Project](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201125-te-romance-scammers-exploiting-lockdown-loneliness)), the modus operandi seems like a pretty good fit. They emotionally manipulate you into a false sense of trust/security and then pressure you to take on more risk than you can afford and before you realize it, you're trapped into scenarios where these customer service reps for the ""exchanges"" threaten to freeze your assets on one end (stick) while the scammers swoop in with promises to pitch in and help you make the money back (carrot) if only you just send more money.

I’ve filed complaints with the Federal Trades Commission, FBI’s Internet Crimes, and my State Attorney General on 3/27. There’s a bunch of articles online warning against scams but not much regarding what to do when you get scammed. Hindsight’s a beotch and I paid for an expensive lesson, but do any redditors have advice for damage control? I plan to make a police report and notify Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Update: 3/28 \*\*

Today, I tried to file a police report. I went to the closest precinct four blocks away and they said I wasn't in their jurisdiction, so I was sent to one 20min away. Lesson here, look up the precinct you belong to before heading over. I went over my case with the officer and they spoke to detectives and they said that even though it seems fishy, there was nothing they could do since: (1) I volunteered the money and information, (2) investing is already a risk, (3) the scammers didn't threaten me only manipulated me with ""bad advice"", (4) they can't track down or stop the people involved since I only have telephone numbers (which can be generated from anywhere in the world) and cannot confirm their identities or addresses since I've never met them IRL, (5) the exchange is not in the U.S., and most importantly (6) nothing was technically stolen as the ""funds"" still show up on the exchange, which I cannot prove is fraudulent. They said if I could track down the owner of the domain, I could pursue a civil suit through a lawyer, but the money is gone, which I already knew, so why bother?

So no police report. It was too complicated and gray; things needed to be black and white. The officer did tell me to: (1) treat this as identity theft and sign up for premium credit monitoring for 5-7 YEARS and to lock Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax ('cause now they have enough data to open up all sorts of financial and utility accounts in my name and/or steal existing ones by resetting ""forgotten"" passwords); (2) notify my banks and have my account numbers changed and ask to see if I can have the bank wires reversed; (3) obtain notarized documentation of all the wire transfers from the banks in case I need to build a case for my records and/or when I can prove illegal activity; (4) not bother with replacing my driver's license since replacements will use the same ID number anyway; (5) change my telephone number; and (6) the advance loan ""contract"" has no actual contact information and the exchange can't force me to pay since they have no legal jurisdiction from Asia, plus I didn't sign any promissory document.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Update 3/29 \*\*

Call my bank and they closed my account. Forgot to get copies of my bank statements since I enrolled in paperless before that so now I need to go in and have the bank print them out.

Anyway, I did more research [fake exchanges](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/cryptocurrency-exchange-fake-website#section-how-to-identify-fake-cryptocurrency-exchanges) and read that this type of scam is called a ""[binary options trading scam](https://www.firstoptionrecovery.com/binary-options-scams)"" and that most of them are actually platforms designed to be like a video game from a company website called First Option Recovery, which supposedly helps fraud victims get their money back. Their home page says that ICOs have very few regulations and that paperwork is exempted on ICOs. I also scrolled around and found that you can go to the [International Organization of Securities Commissions](https://www.iosco.org/investor_protection/?subsection=investor_alerts_portal) (IOSCO) to check for licensed exchanges abroad.

""Protector"" and ""Lover boy"" messaged me so I told them I have no money and went to the police, but they're insisting the BTC exchanges are legitimate and that they were able to withdraw funds...

personalfinance,Am I wrong for making payments on Federal Student loans?,"Keep reading about everyone opting for the suspension payment and interest waiver. I have chosen to maintain my payments, as I want to take advantage of having it all be applied towards the principle.

personalfinance,Using Your $$ Where It Is The Most Valuable,"This is just MY opinion on this, but I would love to hear other views.  Since the housing market is booming right now, and many people are buying their first home, I wanted to make this post/reminder for everyone.  Your $ should be used where it is the MOST valuable. AKA: where it is earning/saving you the highest interest. In the case of a home, your interest rate is about 3%.  In the stock market (long term), you'll be averaging between 8-11%.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's pretend we're resetting your financial investments, and had ALL your money sitting in a bank account before we invest it. For a nice round number, let's say $50k.  You're looking at buying a $250k home, 30yr 3%.

&amp;#x200B;

""How much should I put for a down payment?"" - AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.  Effectively, every $ you put towards your down payment, is ""earning"" you 3% annually (aka: saving you 3% on interest).  With PMI, let's say it's more like 4%.  Do you think you could take that $ and invest it in an ETF to earn you MORE than 4% long term? I would definitely say so.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of putting $50k down (20%), put $13k down (about 5%), and invest the other $37k.  The lower down payment will result in an extra $288 a month on your mortgage for the first 7 years due to PMI, and just $150 after the PMI is taken care of in year 7.  Now let's compare the 2 scenarios apples to apples.

&amp;#x200B;

5% down: You invested the other $37k at 8% a year, and add $0 to your investment each month.  In 30 years, your investment will be worth $344k + you fully own the $250k house, assuming no appreciation. Your NW is $594k

&amp;#x200B;

20% down: You invested $0 on day 1 because it all went to your down payment, but can contribute $288 a month, year 1-7, and $150 a month year 8-30 because your mortgage is less.  In 30 years, these investments are worth $311k + you also fully own the $250k house (again, assuming no appreciation. Your NW is $561k... 

&amp;#x200B;

about $33k less than if you'd done a 5% down payment

&amp;#x200B;

OBVIOUSLY, there are other factors at play. For instance, 10% returns will expand that gap to over $100k in favor of 5% down, while lower returns will shrink it, or even flip the script. However, it's always good to be thinking WHERE IS MY MONEY WORKING FOR ME!",finance
personalfinance,Is my investment / retirement strategy missing something?,"TLDR: Lazy, privileged man is bad at math, inherits money anyways, doesn't know what to do with it besides *leave it alone and don't touch it.*

I'm in my late 20s and several people were kind enough to leave me money when they died over the past few years. This past year has obviously not been typical for the market, but I feel like something is missing from my investing / retirement / lifestyle picture. Here's the thing: I *really* hate working, and I feel as though I may be at my maximum employment income relative to the amount of effort I'm prepared to give. My dream is to be either self employed with a business that actually makes me want to work, or to squirrel away just enough cash in the meantime to eventually quit and maintain my standard of living without working another day in my life. I just haven't found any business ideas (yet) appealing enough to walk away from my steady but draining job, and I'm not fed up enough (yet) to say fuck it and start draining accounts.

My day to day spending comes from my work income, with the investments only touched for large, infrequent expenses, such as education or travel (seeing loved ones 4x times a year for their final years will always have been worth more than the opportunity cost of the flights/pto).

So, am I missing a more aggressive savings strategy? Do I need to buy a liquor store or pour everything into bitcoin mining? Do I just need to be patient and let the market do its thing until I reach ""fuck you"" money? Am I already at ""fuck you"" money and fine to withdraw at 4% until the end of time?

dogecoin,The elephant in the room type post - Are you covered for loss of your coin?,"Greetings, fellow Doge'rs!

Hope everyone is staying safe, in good health and is working on their cardio (getting to the moon is a big thing and takes a lot out of you).

As we all know, crypto is not FDIC insured, and when an exchange gets ""hacked"" (AKA, inside job), your losses are just that. However, there have been several court cases here in the state of Ohio that referenced  Kimmelman v. Wayne Ins. Grp., and in that case, a homeowner won his suit against his insurance company, after they tried to only pay him $200 of his claim citing his crypto as money.

Interestingly enough, it was an IRS citation/classification on virtual currency that shifted the law into his favor, so he could list the stolen crypto under ""property"", and claim its total loss (obviously much more than $200).

Accordingly, the only authority the Court can rely on in determining the status of said crypto coin is the Internal Revenue Service Notice 2014-21. Under Notice 2014-21, the IRS states, “For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property.” Accordingly, the Court finds said crypto coin, although termed ‘virtual currency,’ is recognized as property by the IRS and shall be recognized as such by this Court. 

Now, this is not legal advice, nor should you take it as gospel and think to yourself, ""hey, my homeowners/renters insurance covers me"". Never assume. Verify, and do so in writing.

These are investments, and many of us have 6 figure accounts with various coins in them (To the moon!). My insurance company DOES cover my Doge under property, and although there were some verifications I had to go through to get it inclusive, it WAS possible to get under a protection clause. 

So, fellow Doge'rs - do some research and help protect your investment. Never hurts to ask what coverages you have/do not have, and give yourself some peace of mind while you're at it. Be good to one another and I'll see you on the moon!",cryptocurrency

cardano,"How do you guys see the future in terms of Crypto, Fiat Currencies and CBDCs?","My thought is that inflation will pick up over the course of the year. As that happens, demand for crypto currencies will rise, meaning demand for Fiat currencies go down, further debasing Fiat. As this happens, asset prices will go up in value and the poorest people will be hurt the most by inflation. Then, the FED and Government will have to intervene, either by UBI or bond buying, further inflating and debasing the currency. CBDCs will come out, but won't spur up any demand and will only be used to directly give money to the poorest and be able to track and monitor how that money is spent. I don't see how this doesn't continue into a spiral that makes the poorest who didn't jump on crypto or have stocks even poorer as inflation rises. What then?

investing,Palantir Technologies (PLTR) DD,"I've spent the last few months learning about investing and the finance world and here's my due diligence on Palantir.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ieh7-xYxn0B\_5d7xYB\_VfoQC4r5aT8n7B\_b6BvmKl6c/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ieh7-xYxn0B_5d7xYB_VfoQC4r5aT8n7B_b6BvmKl6c/edit?usp=sharing)

Some key highlights: 

"" **Future of Palantir**

Palantir estimates that the total TAM in the consulting space is $119 billion with the commercial space worth $56 billion with over 6000 and the government space at $63 billion.  In the commercial space, the TAM is calculated by the total number of customers with 6,000 companies with over $500 million revenue and multiplied by the annual contract size (around $10 million a year). The government sector TAM includes government agencies that align with liberal democracies in which the U.S government accounts for $26 billion and international agencies for $37 billion and the federal and state expenditure.

We expect that in the next 10 years for Palantir to:

1. Expand their reach (currently 125 customers) more customers in varying spaces and industries, more users, and to continue to innovate with developments in AI and how AI is applied to operations.
2. Palantir’s 5 year outlook projects $4 billion in revenue by 2025 and will be creating positive annual cash flows starting in 2022.
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has illustrated the potential for Palantir software especially within the healthcare industry,  signing a two-year, $31 million contract with NHS England and assisting the UK Vaccine Program in the ordering, distributing, and tracking of all vaccines through Foundry. Furthermore, during COVID-19, Palantir partnered with hospitals and government organizations to help manage medical supply chains, analyze efficient medical practices, and maximize hospital efficiency in operations.
4. By utilizing Palantir, organizations are able to adapt to changing environments and the operating systems for the modern enterprise give insights into decisions into alpha, pathing into a future leader of the data analytics consulting space. 
5. The building and enabling of the software with connected institutions and companies allows for business software integration along with the vertical integration nature of Palantir’s infrastructure.
6. In addition, Palantir’s software creates organic growth and value for companies that allows for individual expansion with individual organizations to accommodate new users, workflows, and can rapidly scale to that of an institution.
7. Palantir to become the default operating system for data across the U.S government following the court ruling in [Palantir vs. U.S Army (2016)](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/), where the court ruled that the Army violated the 1994 Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and that the Army not conducted research into commercial products, Palantir’s Gotham technology, that was more efficient and cheaper than DCGS-A. Palantir was eventually awarded a ten year contract worth over $876 million over competitor Raytheon Technologies. The controversy was brought to Capitol Hill by Rep. (Republican) Duncan Hunter who voiced the desires of thousands of soldiers in the battlefield.
8. Become a leader in the commercial consulting space, following the increase in the sales force and spending in marketing which plays a major role in an expanding customer base.
9. In both Gotham and Foundry, the “Digital Twin” is effective in upgrading the product such as improving the weapons system and connecting its infrastructure with the company which not only make the company more efficient but better and more competitive. ""

stocks,PFSI is way more undervalued than UWMC and other pureplay mortgage competitors,"**First, a summary:**

PFSI is significantly undervalued when comparing to competitors. They have a 1.04 P/S, 1.38 P/B, 10% of cap in cash, buying back 15% of float. If you think UWMC is undervalued then you'll love PFSI, and I think PFSI is undervalued by at least 50% compared to other pureplay mortgage companies.

I tried to post this in WSB but of course the apes don't actually read the post and just downvotes since they are down in UWMC. Wanted to see if the more rational investors here have any thoughts and comments.

***Just a note: UWMC and RKT still have good potential for short term speculative plays since their short interests are high. This post is only talking about mid to long term valuations among large traditional mortgage companies. I think the valuations of RKT, TREE, LDI, etc are different since they have a different business model with online lending.***

**Introduction:**

With the recent feud between RKT and UWMC, I decided to take a closer look at a few other companies in the mortgage sector. I was surprised to find that PFSI was at such a low valuation compared to competitors. PennyMac Financial Services (PFSI) is a company that does mortgage origination and investment management services. They were founded in 2008 at the heels of the mortgage financial crisis and they are based in Westlake Village, CA. Currently, they are the 3rd largest mortgage lender. They operate in both the direct-to-consumer channel and the broker channel.

**Financials:**

PFSI has a market cap of $4.73B on sales of $4.56B, and a net income of $1.65B in 2020. They also have $3.4B of equity, including $500m cash, at the end of 2020 (see their [10-K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001745916/ef9f38e8-9bdd-48a2-9a09-3cc22e4832ac.pdf)). This means that if they make $1.3B profit in 2021, it's P/B will go below 1 for the current stock price. Book values for mortgage companies are generally pretty accurate because there aren't a lot of physical assets that are difficult to value. $1.3B is a 21% downside to their 2021 earning numbers, and I think it will be pretty likely they make this much since the housing market is still hot. The consensus EPS forecast for 2021 is $19/share, and with 71.77m shares outstanding, that would already be $1.36B earnings. Usually for sectors like mortgage, the outlook and forecast are pretty conservative as well.

**Stock buyback:**

PFSI recently approved an increase of their buyback program from $500m to $1B, $350m of which is already used before end of 2020. This means that they are going to buy back another \~15% of the company at current valuations.

**Comparison to competitors:**

*P/E:*

PFSI (3.09); UWMC (n/a); WD (13.6); ESN (11.45); COOP (11.27); HTGC (8.01)

*Forward (P/E):*

PFSI (5.45); UWMC (6.15); WD (11.82); ESNT (7.39); COOP (6.93); HTGC (11.34)

*P/S:*

PFSI (1.04); UWMC (3.59); WD (3.21); ESNT (5.35); COOP (1.1); HTGC (6.47)

*P/B:*

PFSI (1.38); UWMC (2.6\*); WD (2.68); ESNT (1.29); COOP (1.25); HTGC (1.42)

\*using equity numbers from UWMC's 10-K, the public numbers are wrong because of UWMC IPOed with a merger.

Here I've only compared a few larger cap traditional mortgage companies. I excluded companies like RKT, LDI, TREE, etc because they have different business models with online lending and I think their valuations cannot be compared with these traditional mortgage companies.

**Risks of housing market downturn:**

The major headwind to mortgage companies right now is the prospect of rising interest rates and a housing market downturn. However, we know that JPow said the Fed interest won't move until at least after 2023. The mortgage interest rate may creep up a bit but won't go up wildly for next few years. This means that the risk to mortgage companies is not substantial. The lower EPS is already included in the forecast. Furthermore, these few biggest mortgage companies are still gaining market share from the big banks in the mortgage sector, and I would expect this to offset the loss in overall business somewhat.

Positions: bought 150 PFSI shares to start. I'm also holding RKT shares and leaps for its growth potential and squeeze potential (see my past DDs on RKT: [RKT's Road to S&amp;P 500](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m835pq/rkts_road_to_sp500/), [why RKT is not a mortgage company with an app](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8olrf/why_rkt_is_not_just_a_mortgage_company_with_an_app/), [Catalyst for continued housing boom this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8tg5w/rkt_catalysts_for_continued_housing_boom_this_year/), [RKT's growth story shows up in its financials](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/macryp/rkts_growth_story_shows_up_in_its_financials/))",finance

cardano,Cardano Rumor Rundown 03.28.2021,"Hey Everyone!

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. 

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/Fc4ae6d5yG4](https://youtu.be/Fc4ae6d5yG4)

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. Charles signed a decision memo to expand the Ethiopia Office. IOHK will also be selecting an Ethiopian University in which to build a lab.  They’ll be holding next pan-African developer class in Ghana. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CdzVz9TjcM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CdzVz9TjcM)
2. Charles also mentions the new anti-scammer team at IOHK is investigating a certain “fund”.  I think people here will definitely have a strong suspicion as to who that is. Id.
3. Charles continued to sound certain that we will be able to get on Rogan.  Said it’s just a strategic matter of timing it correctly after IOHK gets a little more done since the audience is so big.  Id.
4. The special committee in Ethiopia signed off on the Ethiopia deal on Thursday, March 25.  This retires rumor #20 in the positive direction. No shenanigans there, broh!  Now it goes directly to the Minister for his signature. It’s all going to be detailed in the Africa Special. Sounds like that’s when the Africa Bird will land and retire rumor #1. Here’s the AMA queued up to that exact spot. [https://youtu.be/-CdzVz9TjcM?t=4433](https://youtu.be/-CdzVz9TjcM?t=4433)
5. Goguen Summit will be online and likely in September. [https://youtu.be/-CdzVz9TjcM?t=5121](https://youtu.be/-CdzVz9TjcM?t=5121)
6. We actually should be happy the maximalists are giving us static.  If you want to know why, check out the whiteboard segment of today’s youtube companion to this post.

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Charles posts a pic of a taxidermy African bird called a Turacos. He follows up that post by saying ""Guys sometimes a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book is just a stuffed Ethiopian exotic bird next to an old identity book. Stop reading into things"". Everyone enjoys speculating what exactly this could mean with the obvious implication being that the African bird announcement involves digital identity in Ethiopia.

8. Charles will be speaking at the Blockchain Africa Conference this week which may or may not give us more clues as to the African Bird announcement. [https://blockchainafrica.co/](https://blockchainafrica.co/) 
9. SingularityNet collaboration with Cardano going down. How else is Skynet gonna pay the Terminators? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ) [https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos)
10. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
11. ~~What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?~~  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1) RETIRED!

16. Possible Soulja Boy Cardano collab on NFT. Maybe Soulja Boy could be best brohs with Charles and Stephen Wolfram broh? [https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907](https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907)
17. ~~Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?~~ RETIRED!
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. ~~Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark.~~ (Retired: he finally got it) Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. ~~Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.~~ Retired!
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. ~~Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?~~ RETIRED!
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO.

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?

57. Commenter Report:  the “metamask of Cardano” speculated about previously in item 30 is the “Yoroi dApp connector”.  It’ll be rolled out “with Ergo first and Cardano once Plutus is released.” [https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-ergo-connector](https://github.com/Emurgo/yoroi-ergo-connector) 
58. It looks like this Yoroi dApp Connector info has even been detailed by Sebastien and Rob on yt. Not sure if we can link directly to this video. But, here is the link to the link. Looks like the dApp Connector talk starts at 1:23:10.  [https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1353203943195734017](https://twitter.com/NicoArqueros/status/1353203943195734017)

63. We get another People of Input Output Global video.  This one features Dan Friedman. He currently lives in Japan.  But, the interview starts off with some very interesting stories about his youth in 1980s Kiev, Ukraine.  His speaking and story-telling style is similar to the captain in a 1990s buddy cop movie (in a good way). Very interesting and compelling guy.

70. Perceptions are shifting on which platform will be #1 for smart contracts over the next decade. Here’s the biggest crypto youtuber asking his co-host if he’s losing faith in the traditional #1. If you’re in Cardano, you can guess which coin his answer is shifting away from. [https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270](https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270)

74. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity. He specifically mentioned Atala Prism. There was talk of the digital identity being able to be linked to wallets, payment systems, and property. He also reasserted that the deals on the table in Africa would bring “millions of users” into the Cardano ecosystem.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8) 
75. If you haven’t seen it in the past, the Atala Prism website has a demo that works with the mobile app showing how the identity solution (along with academic credentialing, health insurance, and proof of employment) would run on Cardano. [https://www.atalaprism.io/](https://www.atalaprism.io/)

79. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months.

90. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).

91. We are starting to see cracks in the psychological armor of the Ethereum crowd.  This anti-Cardano post was at 0 upvotes (at time of writing) while the fairly pro-Cardano response received triple figure upvotes.

92. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).

96. A guy tried to use Charles’s reaction to the King Soopers tragedy in Boulder to criticize Cardano. Charles told him to go f\*\*\* himself and then auctioned off the tweet with proceeds going to the families of the victims. The auction price quickly hit four figures and closed at $7k.

99. Great new interview with Sebastien! In this one he explains a lot about the dApp Connector being built by Emurgo. As reported by a commenter in one of our earlier threads, it will work with Ergo first and then Cardano. A very interesting tidbit was Sebastien’s explanation of how the Emurgo dApp Connector will actually be safer than Metamask (which fills a similar role in the ETH ecosystem).  Very good info. Thanks to Sebastien and the Cardano Podcast! [https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY](https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY)
100. Today is Cardano 360 day!!!!  Watch it here at 10:30AM Pacific, 17:30 GMT, 18:30 CET.  This is the live monthly streaming show from IOHK.  Watch this one. Hopefully we’ll get a target date for Alonzo.  That’ll tell us when we get smart contracts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg)
101. Looks like the Cardano 360 show may highlight how Cardano will not experience some of the shortcomings that leading blockchains have in the past (like the time that bitcoin accidentally issued 184 billion BTC in one block).  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1374783084881608706](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1374783084881608706)
102. Catalyst Fund 5 will have a $2MM total budget! Included will be a very interesting $50k Metadata challenge in Fund 5.  Metadata can be used to prove the existence of a certain document or event to third parties without necessarily revealing the data contained therein. This means you can do cool things on the blockchain without using smart contracts as in the prior New Balance anti-counterfeiting and Beefchain traceability Cardano projects.The winners of this challenge are actually going to be incubated and supported by the IOHK Metadata team! People waiting for Goguen and smart contracts are definitely sleeping on what can be done with metadata on Cardano today.

105. Cardano 360 was yesterday! The big news first: it sounds like the Alonzo (smart contracts)  testnet will launch around end of April or early May. It’s looking like Alonzo HFC event will happen on main net late July or August. The stream was over three hours long. They covered so much! Now, let’s get to the other details revealed. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8)
106. Grigory Rosu from Runtime Verification gave a big rundown on the universality in programming languages that will be provided by K framework in Cardano.  He said he should have some kind of proof of concept around six months from now.
107. Michael Peyton Jones and Manual Chakravarty (the architects of Plutus) talked about 1) the benefits of Cardano’s modern approach to designing Plutus TX and Plutus Core and how Plutus Core basically being lambda calculus allows for mathematical verification of software written in Plutus, 2) how UTXO (and EUTXO in Cardano) are much more battle proven than other ledger accounting systems like account balance system (e.g. ETH) which have had problems, 3) how non-fungible role tokens will be a thing, and 4) how they are now laying out a real development platform for builders instead of just throwing Plutus out into the world.
108. Lars Brünjes (Head of Education) laid out how they are going to train a group of developers through the Plutus Pioneers program.  That group will help test the Alonzo test net after it launches.
109. Lars has also cloned Uniswap in Plutus with a graphical user interface and completely automated price discovery in the liquidity pools.  He did this as a proof of concept to show the capabilities of Plutus. That was demoed right on the stream.
110. They then brought on people from three different Haskell development firms who will be building things on the testnet as a sort of “red team” test of Alonzo.  They all seemed to be very capable in terms of Haskell development (note here that Plutus is basically Haskell).
111. Tom Lindeman (Chief Security Officer at Runtime Verification) then laid out how disastrous the last few years in Ethereum have been for smart contract security.  But, Cardano has a solution.  IOHK and Runtime Verification will partner to certify smart contracts as to security.  Runtime Verification will do the security audits.  This program will be called “Alpha Frontier”.  
112. Charles then laid out the details of the timeline for Alonzo as described above.   It sounds like they are targeting to be totally done and hit a code/feature freeze at the end of June.  But, it will take Coinbase, Kraken, Binance et al. at least four weeks to update their systems before they can actually launch smart contracts on mainnet. 
113. Collin Edwards and Duncan Couts then gave us an update on the stake pool world as we approach “D DAy” or d=0 which is full decentralization of block production. A stake pool operator Shawn McMurdo has made some Cardano Improvement proposals as to 1) a non-linear curved basis for a0 (pronounced a-naught, represents stake pool operator pledge) to affect rewards more greatly, 2) non-centralized rankings in Daedalus, and 3) an adjustment to minimum fees from fixed to variable.   Collin and Duncan clarified there will be no changes to a0 (pledge) or k (max pool size) at the d=0 (full decentralization) event coming up. Duncan also laid out how they are going to launch P2P node testnet in early Q2.  This will allow for information to flow directly between nodes and will accomplish automation of things like peer discovery that are currently manual on the network.
114. Dor Garbash then gave an update on Catalyst.  As covered previously here, Catalyst has become a monster.  There are 17k people in Ideascale and the treasury is worth more than $400MM.  You heard that right, almost a half billion dollars in the Catalyst Treasury.  We also heard from a bunch of the previous catalyst winners.
115. Someone paid $23k for the notorious “Your telling the CEO of IOHK…” tweet.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u_a)
116. IOHK is rolling out a new team that will fight the scammers in crypto. In my mind this involves guys in polo shirts with popped collars and Ledger Nano Xs around their necks carrying [these](https://www.heckler-koch.com/en/products/military/submachine-guns/mp7a1/mp7a2/overview.html) and hunting the bad guys while ‘90s action movie music plays. Probably Dwayne Johnson is their commander. Maybe that’s not what Charles has in mind.

117. Cardano is the Tesla of crypto. We’re just in that early stage right before the Model 3 launch where the Ford and GM guys are at peak fear/peak shit talking but we haven’t made that big deployment yet.  “It’s an illusion, they’ll never release a sub $40k car.”  We’ll see shortly, gentlemen...we’ll see.

investing,Bubble Deniers Abound to Dismiss Valuation Metrics One by One,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-27/bubble-deniers-abound-to-dismiss-valuation-metrics-one-by-one

Vildana Hajric

Everywhere you look, there’s a valuation lens that makes stocks look frothy. Also everywhere you look is someone saying don’t worry about it.

The so-called Buffett Indicator. Tobin’s Q. The S&amp;P 500’s forward P/E. These and others show the market at stretched levels, sometimes extremely so. Yet many market-watchers argue they can be ignored, because this time really is different. The rationale? Everything from Federal Reserve largesse to vaccines promising a quick recovery.

How convinced should anyone be when dismissing the message of metrics like these? To be sure, both the market and economy are in uncharted waters. It’s possible -- perhaps likely -- that old standards don’t apply when something as random as a virus is behind the stress. At the same time, many a portfolio has been squandered through complacency. Market veterans always warn of fortunes lost by investors who became seduced by talk of new rules and paradigms.

“Every time markets hit new highs, every time markets get frothy, there are always some talking heads that argue: ‘It’s different,’” said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer of Mercer Advisors. “We just know from centuries of market history that that can’t happen in perpetuity. It’s just the delusion of crowds, people get excited. We want to believe.”

Source: Robert Shiller’s website
Robert Shiller is no apologist. The Yale University professor is famous in investing circles for unpopular valuation warnings that came true during the dot-com and housing bubbles. One tool on which he based the calls is his cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio that includes the last 10 years of earnings.

While it’s flashing warnings again, not even Shiller is sure he buys it. At 35, the CAPE is at its highest since the early 2000s. If that period of exuberance is excluded, it clocks in at its highest-ever reading. Yet in a recent post, Shiller wrote that “with interest rates low and likely to stay there, equities will continue to look attractive, particularly when compared to bonds.”

Another indicator raising eyebrows is called Tobin’s Q. The ratio -- which was developed in 1969 by Nobel Prize-winning economist James Tobin -- compares market value to the adjusted net worth of companies. It’s showing a reading just shy of a peak reached in 2000. To Ned Davis, it’s a valuation chart worth being wary about. Still, while the indicator is roughly 40% above its long-term trend, “there may be an upward bias on the ratio from technological change in the economy,” wrote the Wall Street veteran who founded his namesake firm.

Persuasive arguments also exist for discounting the signal sent by the “Buffett Indicator,” a ratio of the total market capitalization of U.S. stocks divided by gross domestic product. While it recently reached its highest-ever reading above its long-term trend, the methodology fails to take into consideration that companies are more profitable than they’ve ever been, according to Jeff Schulze, investment strategist at ClearBridge Investments.

“It’s looked extended really for the past decade, yet you’ve had one of the best bull markets in U.S. history,” he said. “That’s going to continue to be a metric that does not adequately capture the market’s potential.”

By some measures, S&amp;P 500 valuations already top dot-com era
At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., strategists argue that however high P/Es are, the absence of significant leverage outside the private sector or a late-cycle economic boom points to low risk of an imminent bubble burst. While people are shoveling money into stocks at rates that have signaled exuberance in the past, risk appetite is rebounding after a prolonged period of aversion, according to the strategists, who also cite low interest rates.

“Today is a very different situation -- I don’t think we’ve got a broad bubble,” Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at the firm, said in a recent interview on Bloomberg Television. “Given the level of real rates, where they are, it’s still likely to be broadly supportive for equities versus bonds.”

Another rationale employed to dismiss certain valuation metrics is the earnings cycle. Corporate America is just emerging from a recession, with profits forecast to stage a strong comeback. The strong outlook for profits is why many investors are giving similarly stretched valuations the benefit of the doubt. Trading at 32 times reported earnings, the S&amp;P 500 looks quite expensive, but with income forecast to jump 24% to $173 a share this year, the multiple drops to about 23.

The valuation case becomes more favorable should business leaders continue to blow past expectations. For instance, if this year’s earnings come in at 16% above analyst estimates, as they did for the previous quarter, that’d imply a price-earnings ratio of less than 20. While that exceeds the five-year average of 18, Ed Yardeni is not troubled by what he calls “the New Abnormal.”

“Valuation multiples are likely to remain elevated around current elevated levels because fiscal and monetary policies continue to flood the financial markets with so much free money,” said the founder of Yardeni Research Inc. He predicts the S&amp;P 500 will finish the year at 4,300, about an 8% gain from current levels.

Still, it’s hard to ignore the risks to underlying assumptions. While rock-bottom rates underpin many of the arguments, this year has shown that the Fed still is willing to let longer-term interest rates run higher. And betting on huge upside earnings surprises is risky too -- it’s rare to see a 16% beat historically. Before last year, earnings had exceeded estimates by an average 3% a quarter since 2015.

“This happens in every bubble,” said Bill Callahan, an investment strategist at Schroders. “It’s: ‘Don’t think about the traditional value metrics, we have a new one.’ It’s: ‘Imagine if everyone did XYZ, how big this company could be.’”

Returns of 2%

Valuations are never useful market-timing tools because expensive stocks can get more expensive, as was the case during the Internet bubble. Yet viewed through a long-term lens, valuations do matter. That is, the more over-valued the market is, the lower the future returns. According to a study by Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian, things like price-earnings ratios could explain 80% of the S&amp;P 500’s returns during the subsequent 10 years. The current valuation framework implies an increase of just 2% a year over the next decade, their model shows.

To Scott Knapp, chief market strategist of CUNA Mutual Group, abandoning standard valuation measures because the environment has changed places investors in “pretty sketchy territory.” Talk of watershed moments rendering traditional metric irrelevant is a signal, he says.

“That’s usually is an indication we’re trying to justify something,” he said.",finance

investment,Investment thoughts,"Over the years I’ve received quite a few questions from family, friends and business partners to advise them on financial matters.

So here is my attempt to give a simple, practical and generic insight into this topic. This means that the advice I’m giving is independent of the disposable income, position or geography. Note: It is only a personal view und in no way a financial advise on a particular investment class. So here we go:

**Saving for a rainy day:** As boring as it may sound. It’s most important to have accessible funds for emergencies or other unexpected expenses. Keep 3 (min. 2) monthly salaries easily accessible in a current, daily or saving account. Do not consider this amount for long-term investments but keep it as a risk buffer. Going beyond 3 monthly salaries is not needed and will unnecessarily reduce your capital for investments.

Investments: In the era of volatility it makes sense to hedge your bets and diversify. This is the first advise. Even if you believe that a certain investment class, also referred to as asset class, is best for you, do not put all your eggs in that basket. The second advice is to look beyond your home country when eying investments. The so-called home country bias often leads to overweighing the home country especially when considering stocks and property.

A solid investment strategy should look at 4 aspects: Diversification to minimize risks, the costs of the investment (c.f. TER = Total Expense Ratio), returns and the investment horizon. Let me attempt to assess these factors for the different investment classes and give guidance on the recommended percentage value to invest. Remember this should reflect your net worth minus 3 months salaries:

* **Government bonds:** Government bonds are fixed-income debit notes issued by a government. Examples are the US Treasury notes or the German Bundesanleihen. These are classified as low risk investments as defaulting is unlikely. The high security is usually reflected in the low returns you earn. The maturity of government bonds is often very long e.g. 10+ years and in Germany we even had the bizarre situation that government bonds were reaping negative returns. If you look at developing countries whose credit rating and history is troubled, the government bond returns may look very attractive. At the same time a total loss of your investment, in case of a government defaulting, is possible. A warning example is Argentina which has a certain track record in this regard. At current times with globally low interest rates government bonds are generally less attractive. **My recommendation: Invest no more that 5-15% of your available capital.**
* **Corporate bonds:** Like government bonds these are fixed-income bonds. However, in this case they are issued by corporations not governments. Thus, the risk may vary depending on the financial health and positioning of the company. The maturity may be shorter as compared to government bonds, yet the risk of a total loss remains. As corporate bonds are a form of financing for corporations the returns are linked to the general interest rate. At present the returns for blue-ship corporations are limited. **Hence my recommendation: Invest no more that 5-15% of your available capital** and be aware of the fact that high interest rates may come at a risk of total loss, which is certainly more likely for private corporations than governments. So, before you invest, check the balance sheet and equity positions of the company.
* **Stocks:** Stocks belong to the asset class of equities. If you buy stocks of a company you become a de facto owner of a small piece of that corporation. While I believe that this is the most important investment class to grow your wealth, here is a word of caution. If you seek advice from a financial consultant for your investment remember the following: Past performance charts or cost-average effect graphs that attempt to lure you into monthly payment plans towards an investment fund may be tricky for 3 reasons: First, the advised fund / stock selection is usually biased towards the stocks/ funds that benefit the financial consultant through affiliations or commissions. Additionally, choices of stocks and funds may also be limited. Second, passive investments like ETFs regularly outperform actively managed funds and they are cheaper as they simply replicate an index such as S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, or DAX. This requires no financial advisor and highly-paid fund manager. Hence, ETFs simply aren’t recommended by financial advisors. Third: The cost-average effect in essence explains that you invest the same amount towards a monthly plan and get certain share volumes. If the stocks are high, you receive less in this particular month but if they are low you get more. As the assumption is that stocks are rising on the long run and your investment will grow accordingly. See the example chart &amp; calculation below:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8js2cv5ksqp61.png?width=521&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4acb87cf6c4568100db441a68f579a747fb28002

*Picture explanation:*

*Investment: 5 x 100 $ = 500 $*

*Purchased units: 1 + 0,666 + 1 + 1,33 + 0,8 = 4,8*

*Value: 4,8 units x 125 = 600 $*

&amp;#x200B;

* However, this is considering a never-ending growth trajectory which is an assumption that can certainly be challenged. At the same time, it is worthwhile to note that even though we witnessed the dot.com bubble burst in 2000, Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008 and the Greece sovereign dept crisis 2011 (incl. a near-collapse of European Currency Union) stocks have faired very well. Credit does not necessarily go to the company leaders but rather to the Central Banks of this world and their liquidity programs which they combined with near-zero interest rates. The result is a devastating devaluation of cash savings and reduced attractiveness of bonds. Hence, stocks remain the main investment class of choice. As a small investor, I recommend cost-efficient ETFs with a broad geographical distribution as this reduces risks. If you want to manage your own stock purchases remember to avoid risk clusters such as investing only in your home market, Tech companies or a certain industry. Make sure to work with limits to avoid emotional decisions or even total loss. Think of buying stocks without a stop loss limit as if you were to jump out of the airplane without a parachute. In addition, I also recommend that you look at dividend payments when you assess stocks as they can add substantially to the overall performance. They are also a sign that a company is profitable. Whether you opt for funds or stocks this investment class is broadly considered as liquid and easily tradable. This means that they are also flexible with regards to your investment horizon. **My recommendation: Invest 50-75% of your available capital.**
* **Property:** For the “average Doe” the dream of owning a place to call home is still very much alive. Investments in multiple properties or real estate funds are rather tricky, so I will not comment on this. As property is usually one of the largest investments in life, a cautious calculation is needed. Investing into a property can be attractive given the current low interest rate. However, be aware of the fact that housing prices in many metropolitan areas have increased dramatically over the last years. It is also critical to note that the mortgage repayments need to be manageable even if interest rates increase. Lastly, property is considered an illiquid investment class. This means that it is not granted that you can sell it, whenever you want or need. **My recommendation: Consider property investments carefully and definitely ask for expert advise for a home valuation prior to purchasing it.**
* **Gold:** Gold seems to shine now more than ever and saw exceptional increases in value in recent times. Whenever you hear about gold the explanation will follow that it is a safe haven in times of crisis. As gold has no real business application and a diminishing importance as a reference or back-up to currencies (c.f. Bretton Woods system), I do not see it as an investment but rather an object of speculation. It’s perceived security against inflationary trends is also not too relevant at present, where we witness modest inflation rates. **Hence my recommendation: Invest 0-5% of your available capital.**
* **Crypto-currency:** Crypto, in particular Bitcoin, have been very present in media for the last couple of years. While these virtual currencies have only limited usability and acceptance as a currency, the underlying technology “blockchain” is a real innovation that has the power to transform the way we transact. Blockchain allows interactions without central authority or middleman which are often needed as trust centers or to secure transactions. If you want to invest, I suggest that you look at this as a bet on the future by selection the crypto-currency with the broadest application. **My recommendation: Invest 0-5% of your available capital.**

I hope that this little guide is helpful for those of you who are struggling with their investment decisions. Whatever you decide, make sure you take a decision as leaving your money in a current account, without any significant interest, is a slow but sure way to shrink your fortune.

personalfinance,Employer not withholding state taxes for PA resident upon relocation?,"My husband and I relocated from Florida to Pennsylvania in January. We both work remotely. I work for a company that hires across the US and withholds PA state/local taxes so there’s no problem there. However, my husband works for a large company that hires across the US that gave him approval to relocate and the ability change his address to our PA address within the company systems, but they’re not withholding PA state or local income taxes. This was not communicated to us previously despite confirming the relocation process repeatedly.

We checked his paychecks multiple times since moving and noticed that PA taxes were not being taken out so we called payroll and were eventually told that the company is currently not processing permanent relocation tax changes because of COVID. So, in the eyes of the company and on my husband’s paychecks, it’s like my husband is “vacationing” in PA and only federal taxes (FL has no state tax) are being withheld until the company lifts the relocation tax change suspension.

Since there’s little we can do about that, we consulted a tax professional here in PA. He said that since the company isn’t recognizing his income as state taxable income that we should leave it be and we won’t be penalized/won’t owe for state taxes that weren’t withheld. He even said something along the lines of “X is a huge company with probably thousands of accountants and they’re saying it’s not taxable, so I’d suggest listening to them when they say it’s not.” But WE are the ones liable for our taxes being withheld correctly so this doesn’t even make sense to me. 

Everything I’ve read makes it sound like we will have to pay the taxes that were not withheld or would have to make estimated tax payments. And there’s obviously no reciprocal tax agreement between states since only one has state tax so we wouldn’t receive a tax credit.

I’m hoping someone might be able to give me some advice on how we can proceed. Maybe someone else has experienced something similar? I’m going to get a second opinion from a different tax professional than the one we spoke to before, but I wanted to see if anyone could offer any advice here.

personalfinance,Car loan - Have I been overcharged,"We recently purchased a new car and we partially financed the sale price. We targeted loan terms of 36 months and shopped around for the best interest rates. We had a pre-approved offer from our local credit union at a rate of 2.6%. 

As it came time to sign the purchase contract, the dealership was able to offer us 2.49% at the same terms. I repeatedly mentioned that I wanted 36months as the loan period. ""No problem"", says the finance guy. As we signed the papers, I realized that the finance guy got us approved for 48months. I asked him about it and he told me ""You can pay it off early, don't worry about it. Won't cost you extra."" I didn't really think twice and I only checked the loan terms for early payment penalties. There were none, so we signed and drove off with a new car.

Only days later did it set in. Did this guy cheat us? My thinking is, that the interest rates are calculated upfront and added to the loan amount, so that's the total sum I have to pay back. With a 48 month loan I calculated, the interest comes out at \~$400 more compared to the 36 month term. 

Here is my question: Are my assumption correct and do I have to pay $400 more even though I will pay the 48 month loan early? Probably depends on the fineprint, but maybe someone has experience with the dealings of a dealership finance department.

I want to confirm my suspicion here first before I go to the dealership and complain and leave a negative review for them when the manufacturer sends out their survey.",finance

Bitcoin,The US Government will NEVER ban Bitcoin.....and the reason is actually the last piece of the puzzle,"Why?

Because the US Government IS SATOSHI NAKAMOTO (big surprise!), and has at least 5% of all Bitcoins available, that is 1,000,000 Bitcoins.

For a start, Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) -256 is the hash function and [**mining**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/mining) algorithm of the Bitcoin [**protocol**](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/protocol), referring to the cryptographic hash function that outputs a 256 bits long value. The algorithm is a variant of the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), developed by the National Security Agency (NSA). and NO Satoshi is obviously NOT Japanese, because is he/she was Jap then this whole thing would have started in Japan.

It is the SAME GAME they are playing when the US Government dumped the Bretton Wood system in 1972 after having secured most of the gold in the US Government vault. Now they are doing that last stretch where they print, print and print more USD fiat to scoop up as much hard assets for the last time. and then BOOM they announce they actually have the biggest Bitcoin horde on the planet.

If they had started off by saying: ""Hey guys we the NSA and the US Treasuries and the FED have worked together to create a new currency called - Bitcoin! Let's mine it and use it but we have already got a headstart and hold 5% of it"" then everyone's reaction would have been like ""f off""

Hence not only would the US Government NOT ban Bitcoin, they are allowing all these private crypto companies like Coinbase, Paypal, Square and crypto ETFs and crypto Hedge Funds in the US to blossom because they would want the crypto industry to be US centric just like how the world is USD centric for the past 50 years. Elon Musk, Jack Dorssey, Dan Bilzerian, Cathie Wood, all see this they just buy and buy with a price target but they MUST have already figured it out.

This whole thing is a government project to begin with, I mean really which common civilian has the resource to develop and deploy something like this - most of the people don't even understand fiat money, leave alone developing Bitcoin.

This is actually MEGA GOOD NEWS for Bitcoin, as we have got the government the strongest country in the world backing it, because it is the same government which created it 13 years ago!

My personal estimate is each Bitcoin will get to $2.5 million USD (I will provide breakdown in another post).

personalfinance,Buying a New or Used car?,"So I know that the answer may seem to obviously lean towards used if you're trying to be as efficient with your money as possible, but I don't think it's that simple. Buying a car that's 2-3 years old seems like the smartest move, however, the interest rate for used cars looks to be around 6.4% from what I've found. Meanwhile, I could get a new car with an interest rate of 0.9%. The difference in rate would likely make the final cost difference much lower than expected, plus you'd have a slightly more valuable car when it comes time to sell.

I know it may seem like I'm just trying to rationalize getting a new car, but I genuinely only care about making the best financial decision. It seems to me like getting a new car with a low rate would be smarter, but maybe I'm missing something.

stocks,Jerome Powell and the 2% inflation promise. FOMC in a nutshell.,"On March 17, 2021 at the FOMC event, the FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated that he expect to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2024, even as the FED has upgraded their US growth forecasts because of a massive fiscal stimulus and an accelerating vaccine rollout.

 
Powell precisely refers to a ""…full range of tools to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. 
… achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."" 

 
Further he adds that their ""…ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.""
So basically the unemployment rate is now forecast to fall to 4.5% by the end of the year instead of 5%. On the other side PCE inflation is expected to rise to 2.2% compared with the rise to 1.8% predicted in December.
But Fed officials expect the bump in consumer prices to be temporary, with PCE inflation falling back in 2022-2023, even as unemployment drops further.

 
 
And regarding to the federal funds rates the FED continues to ""expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 0.25 percent target range""
So they will continue to increase their ""holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month""

 
So the Fed has managed to maintain rock-bottom interest rates ""…with inflation running persistently below 2 percent"" in order to ""achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent"" until the US reaches full employment, with inflation hitting 2 per cent and being on track to exceed that target. The central bank also reiterated that it would continue to buy bonds at a rate of $120bn per month until “substantial further progress” was made.

 
And they ""will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes.""
An approach similar to the famous Mario Draghi ""Whatever it takes"" to save Europe in 2012, from a deep economic crisis.

 
As a result of this policy the upgrades to the forecasts from Fed officials were significant. In fact back in December they predicted 4.2% growth this year, while now they have raised that estimate up to 6.5% (+2.3%), which would be the fastest economic expansion since 1984.

 
What we can say is that this sharp upgrade to the FED's summary of economic projections will certainly generate doubts to the central bank's dovish policy.

 
During his speech Powell reiterates many times that ""The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain.""
And that the FED has provided essential support to households, businesses and communities, and the recovery in economic activity since last spring is due to ""an unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions.""

 
He concludes by saying that the FED understands that ""our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission… and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible""

 
So this is what happened during the last FOMC event.

CryptoCurrency,Will staking / delegating be the future of savings?,"A lot of people seem to know about buying and selling crypto ofcause and some know a thing or two about mining.

\-lower interest rates- helps to drive up stock prices because of more discretionary spending and disposable income

personalfinance,Can we make owning a house work?,"So to preface, our (My wife and I, with no kids now or future) current ""landlords"" (who have really been more like parents to us over these years) have decided they want to consider relocating to a quieter location, and have requested that we start looking for a new place to live over the next year or so (not rushing us but just giving a long heads up). We had an excellent deal on the place we live now, and knew the time would come, but now have found ourselves looking at tackling the option of buying a house a little sooner than we initially planned, in a market that has ballooned since we moved here. 

I work as union tradesman making 35k currently and am guaranteed regular substantial pay increases as I get further along. My wife works part-time retail currently + owns her own growing small business of 4 years bringing in ~27k. That puts us around 60k together, but out here houses start in the 200s. Of course, I know about the whole logic of not buying a house worth more than 3x your income, but due to our pets (which are entirely non-negotiable) making it borderline impossible to find a rental, we're faced with the option of buying, or being forced to relocate (giving up my current stable job in an otherwise unstable field, and her established clients). 

I'm hoping that with my being able to do most repairs myself (outside extensive plumbing), being in a climate where a/c is a non-issue and heat typically isn't either, and a bit of diligence, we are able to weather the fact that any house we'd buy is higher than would be recommended at this point, at least for a year or 2 until I hit journeyman status and it's not as much a concern (or her business continues growing at the pace it has been, but I know better than to count on that). 

We are rural people, so we were hoping to explore the option of a USDA loan, but honestly ignorant as to the differences and benefits. We have 12k saved up currently that could go towards a down payment (or emergency fund? if we don't have to use it all on a down payment), and 700ish credit scores on each of us (for whatever that means regarding interest rates, idk).

CryptoCurrency,Actually unpopular opinion : Venezuela is not a Bitcoin usecase. Hyperinflation was a byproduct of oil price crashing leading to diminished importation and scarce goods. Money printing was only the final nail in the coffin. A quick recap on the Venezuelan situation and how inflation works.,"Venezuela is often mentioned as a Bitcoin usecase, pointing out that the relentless Bolivar printing caused hyperinflation and Bitcoin could fix this. While partially true, it's not the whole picture.

First you gotta know that Venezuela almost doesn't produce ANY of the goods they consume. EVERYTHING that the population eat, drink, and use everyday is from importation. Second, Venezuela's main exportation activity is oil as it is one of the biggest oil reserve in the world (90+% of the country's exportations is oil), so Venezuela basically trades its imported good for its oil (simplification, there is some forex dynamics behind this). 

Now since 2008, oil price have been crashing. In addition, Venezuela's oil production have been diminishing more and more. Add to that economic sanctions from the US like various embargos and political maneuvers, and what happens?

Goods become scarce. Revenue from oil exportation does not cover the cost of importation needs anymore. In addition your previous partners now refuse to trade with you anymore. Food, consumables, everything : there now isn't enough for everybody and you have to fight for it. 

Now one puny band-aid Maduro tried to use was money printing. In normal times, money printing either increase production or increase prices. When there is more money around, people either buy more stuff which companies respond to by increasing production, or the production of said stuff is already saturated so price rise. In a healthy economy (the US for example), the main impact is on production, which boost the whole economy further more and makes the country more powerful : that's why Central Banks are so addicted. That's the reason consumer inflation does not follow the money supply increase in the US, but instead the money goes into stocks as companies thrive from the increased consumption. 

Now back to Venezuela. Money printing can't make the oil wells produce more, which is Venezuela's most prominent business. Of course it does not increase importation either... So the only effect it could have was price increase on the goods, which became very scarce due to the aforementioned problems. Money printing could have been a solution if the economic crisis was a short-lived period as it would have briefly boosted the importation power of the country, but instead in this situation where the problems ran deep, it only made everything worse.

Bitcoin could have fixed the poor economical decisions of Maduro, but it would not have magically fixed the intrinsic problems of Venezuela, which was an economy too dependent on oil and too dependant on foreign importation to sustain itself. 

tl;dr : Venezuela's real problems come from an economy too focused on oil exportation and too dependent on importations, not from its monetary policy. Bitcoin does a lot of thing, but it cannot save the economy of a country that's deeply flawed.",cryptocurrency

investing,Thinking about getting out of BND and picking up series I bonds.,"I've had a Vanguard Target Retirement fund for a few years now but this year I started playing around with some stocks and bonds with some extra cash I had laying around. I thought the 90% stocks / 10% bonds thing was a smart idea just in case equities pop. I'm not really a fan of the 100% stocks thing, just ain't for me, I definitely see the value in having some diversification.

Well some quick searching led me to Vanguard's Total Bond Index ETF (BND). I didn't put a whole lot in there but I put enough.

First big lesson I'm learning: generalized investing advice doesn't always work for all economic situations. Bonds suck right now. They're getting sold off because the real rate of return is 0 or negative (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is only going to get worse if inflation spikes.

I've taken a small loss on this ETF thanks to the sell off. Nothing major but at this point cash would have been better.

One thing I had been interested in was series I bonds. However, currently the fixed interest rate they're paying is 0%. Sucky. The good news is that in May they'll be issuing new ones with an updated fixed interest rate. I assume that since yields are up, they will have to raise the fixed rate above 0%. I assume it will be low, but low is better than 0.

So anyway, I'm thinking about selling BND for a minor loss and holding the proceeds in cash until May, at which point I will pick up the (hopefully) updated series I bonds. The theory is that I can just hold these bonds without the market affecting them (unlike a bond index), and the inflation-adjusted interest plus the fixed interest will be better than cash. That way I'll continue to get the diversification benefits without the downsides that other bonds are facing at the moment. It's like keeping some extra cash but on steroids.

Of course, I could just hold BND and wait for it to recover... but who knows how many years. That's wasted money.

Thoughts? Did I miss anything with my analysis?  Any other suggestions?

personalfinance,Advice on paying off student loan debt. USA,"Hello, I am anticipateing to pay off the entire sum of my student loans this year. Total is ~60k. I know a lot of people are hoping for biden to give student loan relief, however my federal Sally Mae/Great Lakes loans were transfered to Navient and I'm assuming I won't be eligible for this relief package. (Correct me if I'm wrong because I honestly don't know) Either way, I would rather pay them off to help boost my credit score. I've managed to crawl up from ~500 up to around 625. I want to get the maximum benifit from paying these loans off so I'd rather pay them rather than to have them forgiven.

My real question here is how to go about it. Would a lump sum of the total amount be worth less point gain to my credit since they are divided into multiple (example is like 10k, 8k, 7k, so forth.) or would it be better to pay each loan individually over a few weeks/months)

I went to Virginia College around 12 years ago (I didn't know better as those schools were fairly new and I was one of the first in my family to attend a college) that 60k is from a 2 year network engineering degree where credits only transfer to other Virginia colleges and intrest. Yeah they didn't tell me that and I didn't find out until I applied to a 4 year school and after I got a job I was never eligible for a promotion because I had a ""clown college degree"". In hindsight, it was foolish but I was a kid who got taken advantage of. Fair enough, I've clawed my way back up into a position where I'm finally able to pay it down and start over, but at a much better level. Believe it or not, Domino's Pizza has been the catalyst for my change. (I'm a store manager)

personalfinance,Car Loan Impossible to Pay Down,"Long story short, I had a car that was on the verge of breaking down and did not have money to fix what was needed. Instead, I traded it in on a larger SUV with a 14.something% interest rate. I’ve had it 2 years and paid $520 a month every single month. According to my account, I’ve only paid off $2000 towards the actual loan.

Now, I’m in a predicament where I’m needing a larger (rather, wider) vehicle but I’m upside down by $8k. Nobody is willing to accept a trade-in or even refinance for a lower interest rate. So, my goal for this year is to pay as much as possible to get my owed amount down to trade-in value so that I can trade it in for something that doesn’t depreciate as quickly.

I was looking at my account details where it breaks down how much of each payment goes towards principal and how much goes towards interest. It varies on each payment. On one month $460 went towards principal and the rest towards interest, and then the following month $47 went towards principal and the rest towards interest. Now I understand why it’s taking so long to see my account balance decrease, but my question is how do they determine how much is applied to each category?

I realize I messed up agreeing to such a high interest rate and had I done appropriate research, I would have turned them down and sought another option. How do I get out of this without ruining my credit??",finance

I’m in my late 20’s and trying to not only figure out my car situation but also become a better saver. I’m not sure what all information will be useful but I’ll do my best -

Background on me: I’ve had a job since I was 14 and now work in a management role of a large retailer. I make around $48k a year and have $9k in debt (8k which is my car) my credit score is 490 but bounces around pretty frequently (I was very stupid and ignorant in my late teens/early 20’s, still am a bit) 
Edit: my expenses for rent/utilities/car/etc are around $1300 a month 

Currently have $500 in savings which is the most I’ve ever had unfortunately. 

I am NOT a saver because I was never worried about it but now I feel overwhelmed and terrified for my future. 


Currently my biggest obstacle is my vehicle (2010 GMC Terrain, just hit 100k miles) there are numerous issues wrong with it and from the few times I’ve had it checked out I’ve been told it could cost around $2k to fix (which is quite a lot for me especially considering I’ve already put more than $3000 worth of work into it) 
I’m currently in 44 months of my 73 month for my loan amount of $13k and have paid $8k in interest and $5k in principal (20.79% interest rate....I’ve tried to refinance, was not approved even though credit karma shows 100% on time payments) I currently still owe $7.5k....now luckily I do have public transit easily available to me to get to and from work so I am not *absolutely* desperate to get this fixed right away but I feel incredibly drained and tired from taking it so not having a vehicle at all is not an option in the long run, it also doesn’t seem like trading it in is an option as well due to how much I still owe on my loan, someone suggested I let it be repo’d and just build my credit up again but I’ve been desperately working to do so already...looking for any sort of advice here, I am honestly very ignorant to finance and credit.

I've been obsessively consuming all the Cardano news and media on a daily basis for years now. I figured it wouldn’t hurt to share a list of what I'm seeing for anyone else who's interested. Feel free to make additions as you see fit. Many of your additions from yesterday are in the “Newly Covered” list for today. Also let me know if you think any of the “Previously Covered but Still Interesting” items are no longer interesting and should leave the list. 

Check out the youtube companion to today’s post: [https://youtu.be/1C6Ka-n2P-0](https://youtu.be/1C6Ka-n2P-0)

Let's go....

Newly covered today: 

1. Every once in a while, I like to take stock of where the rest of the crypto space is on Cardano. So, let’s do a little review of what a few of the larger youtube crypto and other influencers are saying about Cardano right now.
2. The biggest crypto youtuber with 717k subscribers says “shame on you, Cardano community” for talking so badly about EIP 1559 (the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal). Then in the same video he says he may tell people to sell their Ethereum for Cardano &amp; DOT if things don’t improve by the end of April (with a bunch of caveats). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1OdprEpHfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1OdprEpHfU).   
3. Another youtuber with 587k subscribers posted a video called “Why I'm Dumping Ethereum For This Coin” and said that ETH would have “massive problems” if Cardano hits its deadline for smart contracts on mainnet.  He’s actually recommending some other coins that aren’t ETH or Cardano, but made his lack of confidence in ETH in the face of Cardano’s challenge very clear if Cardano achieves its goals. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p8LgjMQbyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p8LgjMQbyE)
4. Lark Davis (256k subscribers) released a video called “Don’t Buy Cardano” in which he lays out the devil’s advocate argument against Cardano and then responds to those arguments.  He finished by saying “I think that Cardano will prove the haters wrong this year…but...it will simply be a piece of the bigger picture of the cryptoverse.” [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-bB8gzUCMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-bB8gzUCMo)  This followed a video a few days ago that seemed to identify the delay of Ethereum’s layer 2 scaling solution as “probably the biggest crypto fail of 2021”.  [https://youtu.be/QCo5egQmiG8](https://youtu.be/QCo5egQmiG8)
5. That’s a collective 1.56 million subscribers.  Of course, some overlap there. But, that’s a lot of potential viewers. It seems like the message being delivered to them is a lot of playing both sides of the fence. From my view, this is what it looks like when you hit a tipping point and the herd starts slowly capitulating on a consensus position.

9. SingularityNet collaboration with Cardano going down. How else is Skynet gonna pay the Terminators? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdp33bYJpQ) [https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/SingularityNET/videos)
10. Wolfram Alpha collaboration with Cardano.  What will it look like? Mentioned in several recent AMAs. Sounds like Charles and Stephen Wolfram want to be best brohs.  That feels good broh.
11. ~~What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?~~  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1) RETIRED!
12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh. 
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)
14. Charles claimed Elon was trolling Cardano with “meta for k” on twitter. Can anyone argue one way or another on this? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1364350825271685122](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1364350825271685122)

16. Possible Soulja Boy Cardano collab on NFT. Maybe Soulja Boy could be best brohs with Charles and Stephen Wolfram broh? [https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907](https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907)
17. ~~Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?~~ RETIRED!
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. ~~Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark.~~ (Retired: he finally got it) Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. ~~Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.~~ Retired!
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. ~~Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?~~ RETIRED!
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years. 
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

35. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have a hairline that is even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.
36. Cardano reached 550k wallets in half the time it took BTC [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1369933366368362496](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1369933366368362496)
37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1369961368946946053](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1369961368946946053)
39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum). This is one of those nice articles where the British guy pleasantly reads it to you if you want. Use this one to convince all your friends you are the ultimate blockchain expert:  “listen Kyle...the shortcoming of UTXO accounting is....” [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/)
40. Cardano devs at IOHK are the most productive in the industry! Already 3,170 commits and climbing this week! I sleep better at night knowing they are not allowed to sleep. Kidding….kidding.

43. Apparently the first $1200 stimulus check if invested in ADA would be $44,800 now.  [https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1369426234883645443/photo/1](https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1369426234883645443/photo/1)
44. Charles gives us that real talk about why a young billionaire would devote his life to this Cardano thing. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7Da6sFAxuI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7Da6sFAxuI)
45. Cardano uses a tiny fraction of the energy some other top-ten blockchains use.   This factoid alone should allow you to hook up with eco-obsessed nature people. [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875)

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?
49. There’s a new Crypto Time Traveler and this one loves Cardano. [https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2](https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2)

58. It looks like this Yoroi dApp Connector info has even been detailed by Sebastien and Rob on yt. Not sure if we can link directly to this video. But, here is the link to the link.

63. We get another People of Input Output Global video.  This one features Dan Friedman. He currently lives in Japan.  But, the interview starts off with some very interesting stories about his youth in 1980s Kiev, Ukraine.  His speaking and story-telling style is similar to the captain in a 1990s buddy cop movie (in a good way). Very interesting and compelling guy.

70. Perceptions are shifting on which platform will be #1 for smart contracts over the next decade. Here’s the biggest crypto youtuber asking his co-host if he’s losing faith in the traditional #1. If you’re in Cardano, you can guess which coin his answer is shifting away from. [https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270](https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270)

74. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity. He specifically mentioned Atala Prism. There was talk of the digital identity being able to be linked to wallets, payment systems, and property. He also reasserted that the deals on the table in Africa would bring “millions of users” into the Cardano ecosystem.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8) 
75. If you haven’t seen it in the past, the Atala Prism website has a demo that works with the mobile app showing how the identity solution (along with academic credentialing, health insurance, and proof of employment) would run on Cardano. [https://www.atalaprism.io/](https://www.atalaprism.io/)
76. ADA is now live on coinbase.com as well as Coinbase Pro! So, you don’t even need to understand orderbooks to buy ADA now. [https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-now-available-on-coinbase-dd30c1e0d93a](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-now-available-on-coinbase-dd30c1e0d93a)

78. Never imagined there would be a holiday light display that flashed “Screw Doge Coin; ADA is Best” to the original Doge music. Friendly rivalry is probably good in crypto. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM135pv72mY&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM135pv72mY&amp;t=31s)
79. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo)

81. Max Keiser is also not romantically in love with us. Charles lays down the stick pretty hard on this one. I’m saying good. If you can’t take the heat...stay out of the Cardano kitchen, my man.

90. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).  [https://twitter.com/avaxholder/status/1373336728010956801](https://twitter.com/avaxholder/status/1373336728010956801)
91. We are starting to see cracks in the psychological armor of the Ethereum crowd.  This anti-Cardano post was at 0 upvotes (at time of writing) while the fairly pro-Cardano response received triple figure upvotes. [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/maktuy/ist\_charles\_hoskinson\_the\_new\_justin\_sun/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/maktuy/ist_charles_hoskinson_the_new_justin_sun/)
92. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).  
93. Emurgo is thinking about supply chain solutions for the seafood industry. [https://emurgo.io/blog/how-can-blockchain-deliver-benefits-to-the-seafood-industrys-supply-chain](https://emurgo.io/blog/how-can-blockchain-deliver-benefits-to-the-seafood-industrys-supply-chain)

96. A guy tried to use Charles’s reaction to the King Soopers tragedy in Boulder to criticize Cardano. Charles told him to go f\*\*\* himself and then auctioned off the tweet with proceeds going to the families of the victims. The auction price quickly hit four figures and closed at $7k.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374207862646304773?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374207862646304773?s=u_a)
97. Thursday is Cardano 360 and Friday will be “Get ADA Day” as staking rewards for Epoch 255 close. Gonna be an action packed close to the week.  Enjoy!
98. Here was my favorite moonboi tweet of the last few days.  Old photo, but excellent captioning work here. [https://twitter.com/MaximilianXCIX/status/1373471841449304066](https://twitter.com/MaximilianXCIX/status/1373471841449304066)
99. Great new interview with Sebastien! In this one he explains a lot about the dApp Connector being built by Emurgo. As reported by a commenter in one of our earlier threads, it will work with Ergo first and then Cardano. A very interesting tidbit was Sebastien’s explanation of how the Emurgo dApp Connector will actually be safer than Metamask (which fills a similar role in the ETH ecosystem).  Very good info. Thanks to Sebastien and the Cardano Podcast! [https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY](https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY)
100. Today is Cardano 360 day!!!!  Watch it here at 10:30AM Pacific, 17:30 GMT, 18:30 CET.  This is the live monthly streaming show from IOHK.  Watch this one. Hopefully we’ll get a target date for Alonzo.  That’ll tell us when we get smart contracts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg)
101. Looks like the Cardano 360 show may highlight how Cardano will not experience some of the shortcomings that leading blockchains have in the past (like the time that bitcoin accidentally issued 184 billion BTC in one block).  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1374783084881608706](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1374783084881608706)
102. Catalyst Fund 5 will have a $2MM total budget! Included will be a very interesting $50k Metadata challenge in Fund 5.  Metadata can be used to prove the existence of a certain document or event to third parties without necessarily revealing the data contained therein. This means you can do cool things on the blockchain without using smart contracts as in the prior New Balance anti-counterfeiting and Beefchain traceability Cardano projects.The winners of this challenge are actually going to be incubated and supported by the IOHK Metadata team! People waiting for Goguen and smart contracts are definitely sleeping on what can be done with metadata on Cardano today.  [https://www.crowdcast.io/e/fund4-6](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/fund4-6) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjg\_u7Oeel0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjg_u7Oeel0)
103. There is a Catalyst Dashboard available that gives you all the stats on the current projects in Cardano’s multi-million dollar decentralized innovation fund (the world’s biggest). [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15R-Vbajy4t4fGs1TipNMfL1pEO9cwdn6WV13lKviX4Q/edit#gid=40774150](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15R-Vbajy4t4fGs1TipNMfL1pEO9cwdn6WV13lKviX4Q/edit#gid=40774150)
104. Charles says they are going to end up spending $15-30MM this year on research and they will hire 100-200 people. That’s an investment in the future of the ecosystem! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w)
105. Cardano 360 was yesterday! The big news first: it sounds like the Alonzo (smart contracts)  testnet will launch around end of April or early May. It’s looking like Alonzo HFC event will happen on main net late July or August. The stream was over three hours long. They covered so much! Now, let’s get to the other details revealed. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8)
106. Grigory Rosu from Runtime Verification gave a big rundown on the universality in programming languages that will be provided by K framework in Cardano.  He said he should have some kind of proof of concept around six months from now.
107. Michael Peyton Jones and Manual Chakravarty (the architects of Plutus) talked about 1) the benefits of Cardano’s modern approach to designing Plutus TX and Plutus Core and how Plutus Core basically being lambda calculus allows for mathematical verification of software written in Plutus, 2) how UTXO (and EUTXO in Cardano) are much more battle proven than other ledger accounting systems like account balance system (e.g. ETH) which have had problems, 3) how non-fungible role tokens will be a thing, and 4) how they are now laying out a real development platform for builders instead of just throwing Plutus out into the world.
108. Lars Brünjes (Head of Education) laid out how they are going to train a group of developers through the Plutus Pioneers program.  That group will help test the Alonzo test net after it launches.
109. Lars has also cloned Uniswap in Plutus with a graphical user interface and completely automated price discovery in the liquidity pools.  He did this as a proof of concept to show the capabilities of Plutus. That was demoed right on the stream.
110. They then brought on people from three different Haskell development firms who will be building things on the testnet as a sort of “red team” test of Alonzo.  They all seemed to be very capable in terms of Haskell development (note here that Plutus is basically Haskell).
111. Tom Lindeman (Chief Security Officer at Runtime Verification) then laid out how disastrous the last few years in Ethereum have been for smart contract security.  But, Cardano has a solution.  IOHK and Runtime Verification will partner to certify smart contracts as to security.  Runtime Verification will do the security audits.  This program will be called “Alpha Frontier”.  
112. Charles then laid out the details of the timeline for Alonzo as described above.   It sounds like they are targeting to be totally done and hit a code/feature freeze at the end of June.  But, it will take Coinbase, Kraken, Binance et al. at least four weeks to update their systems before they can actually launch smart contracts on mainnet. 
113. Collin Edwards and Duncan Couts then gave us an update on the stake pool world as we approach “D DAy” or d=0 which is full decentralization of block production. A stake pool operator Shawn McMurdo has made some Cardano Improvement proposals as to 1) a non-linear curved basis for a0 (pronounced a-naught, represents stake pool operator pledge) to affect rewards more greatly, 2) non-centralized rankings in Daedalus, and 3) an adjustment to minimum fees from fixed to variable.   Collin and Duncan clarified there will be no changes to a0 (pledge) or k (max pool size) at the d=0 (full decentralization) event coming up. Duncan also laid out how they are going to launch P2P node testnet in early Q2.  This will allow for information to flow directly between nodes and will accomplish automation of things like peer discovery that are currently manual on the network.
114. Dor Garbash then gave an update on Catalyst.  As covered previously here, Catalyst has become a monster.  There are 17k people in Ideascale and the treasury is worth more than $400MM.  You heard that right, almost a half billion dollars in the Catalyst Treasury.  We also heard from a bunch of the previous catalyst winners.
115. Someone paid $23k for the notorious “Your telling the CEO of IOHK…” tweet.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u_a)
116. IOHK is rolling out a new team that will fight the scammers in crypto. In my mind this involves guys in polo shirts with popped collars and Ledger Nano Xs around their necks carrying [these](https://www.heckler-koch.com/en/products/military/submachine-guns/mp7a1/mp7a2/overview.html) and hunting the bad guys while ‘90s action movie music plays. Probably Dwayne Johnson is their commander. Maybe that’s not what Charles has in mind.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1375473873651568640](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1375473873651568640)
117. Cardano is the Tesla of crypto. We’re just in that early stage right before the Model 3 launch where the Ford and GM guys are at peak fear/peak shit talking but we haven’t made that big move yet.  “It’s an illusion, they’ll never release a sub $40k car.”  We’ll see shortly, gentlemen...we’ll see.

CryptoCurrency,DeFi explained: Liquidity pools,"You may have come across the theory of liquidity pools in the Defi ecosystem.

But what are liquidity pools and how do they work? And why do we really need them in decentralized finance? In this post I will explain how they work, their main benefits and general aspects.

# What are liquidity pools?

Liquidity pools are pools of tokens that are locked in a smart contract. By offering liquidity, they guarantee trading, and because of this, they are widely used by decentralized exchanges. DeFi platform Bancor took one of the first initiatives to include liquidity pools.

Liquidity pools, in essence, are the trading aspect of a decentralized exchange. Their role is to increase the liquidity of the market among market participants.

# How do liquidity pools work?

In its simplest form, a single liquidity pool contains 2 tokens and each pool establishes a new market for the same pair of tokens. DAI / ETH is perhaps a clear example of a popular liquidity pool at Uniswap.

The first liquidity provider, when a new pool is created, is the one who decides the initial price of the assets in the pool. The liquidity provider is encouraged to provide the pool with an equivalent value of all tokens.

Based on the liquidity provided to a pool, the liquidity provider (LP) receives special tokens called LP tokens in proportion to how much liquidity they provide to the pool. A charge of 0.3% is allocated proportionally to all LP token holders when a transaction occurred in the pool.

The liquidity providers needs to burn their LP tokens if they want to get their underlying liquidity back, plus any unpaid fees. By utilizing a deterministic price algorithm, any token swap within a liquidity pool results in a price shift. This process is also referred to as an automatic market maker (AMM).

A constant commodity market maker algorithm is used for basic liquidity pools such as the one used by Uniswap, which means that the amounts of the 2 tokens given remain the same. In addition, a pool still has liquidity, no matter how massive a trade, because of the algorithm. The main reason for this is that as the target amount increases, the algorithm increases the price of the token asymptotically.

## The importance of liquidity

The reason that liquidity is so important is that it largely determines how the price of an asset can shift. In a market with low liquidity, a relatively limited number of open orders are open on both sides of the order book. This suggests that one trade can shift the price significantly in any direction, making the stock unpredictable and unattractive. Because of this, liquidity pools are an important part of the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) revolution.

## What are liquidity pools in Defi?

Liquidity pools are intended to successfully address the low liquidity problem and thus ensure that the price of a token does not fluctuate significantly after executing the order of a single large trade.

As mentioned earlier, decentralized exchanges offer bonuses to those who invest in the liquidity pools to maximize engagement. The user has to deposit money into the liquidity pool to reap the benefits and take advantage of it. Liquidity pools are regulated by one or more smart contract protocols. The amount of funds to be invested and the proportional ratio of each token will vary between different DeFi platforms.

## How to participate in a liquidity pool?

To provide $50 in liquidity in an ETH / USDC pool, it requires a deposit of $50 in ETH and $50 USDC. In this situation, a total deposit of $100 is required. In return, the liquidity provider collects tokens for the liquidity pool. These tokens reflect their proportional pool share and allow them to withdraw their pool share at any time.

Every time a seller places a trade, a trade fee is deducted from the trade and the order is sent to the smart contract with the liquidity pool. The trading fee is set at 0.3% for most decentralized exchanges. In this case, if you deposit $50 ETH and $50 USDC and you make 1% of the pool with your donation. You will then receive 1% of the 0.3% trading fee for one of the specific trades.

## How do liquidity pool exchanges work?

There are currently two types of decentralized exchanges in the DeFi space, namely:

* **Exchange of order book:** The order book exchanges depend on a bid / ask arrangement to fulfill trades. Orders are redirected to an order book when a new buy or sell order is placed. Then the exchange's matching engine executes matching orders for the same price. Examples of order book exchanges are 0x and Radar Relay.
* **Liquidity pool exchanges:** LP exchanges exclude the emphasis of order book trading from their exchange. By doing this, they enable the exchange to keep the liquidity level stable. Examples of LP exchanges are Kyber, Uniswap and Curve Finance.

## Advantages of liquidity pools

* **Guaranteed liquidity at any price level:** Traders do not need to be directly connected with other traders as liquidity is constant, as long as clients have invested their assets in the pool.
* **Automated Pricing Enables Passive Market Making:** Liquidity providers put their money into the pool and the pricing is controlled by the pool’s smart contract.
* **Anyone can become and earn a liquidity provider:** Liquidity pools do not require listing fees, KYCs or other obstacles associated with centralized exchanges. If an investor wants to provide liquidity to the pool, he only needs to deposit the equivalent of the assets.
* **Lower gas fees:** Gas fees are reduced by the minimal smart contract design offered by decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. Effective price calculations and fee allocations within the pool imply less volatility between transactions. Uniswap V3 will reduce the gas fees even (30%) more.

## Returns

The return of the liquidity pool depends on three factors:

* The asset prices upon delivery and withdrawal
* The size of the liquidity pool
* The trading volumes.

It is very important to remember that, in proportion to what’s originally invested, investors would end up removing some ratio of assets. This is where the market movement can work either with or against you.

## Risks of Liquidity Pool

Of course, as with everything in DeFi, you have to consider the potential risks. Some of the associated liquidity risks are listed below:

* Impermanent loss
* Possible smart contract bugs.
* Liquidity pool hacks
* Systemic risks

## Impermanent losses

Before you join a liquidity pool, I would like to stress out the impact of impermanent losses.

Impermanent loss describes the temporary loss of funds occasionally experienced by liquidity providers because of volatility in a trading pair. This also illustrates how much more money the LPs would have had if they simply held onto their assets instead of providing liquidity.

Let’s say you have $50 in ETH and $50 in SUSHI tokens, which adds up to a total of $100. If you deposit your tokens in a 50/50 liquidity pool, you would have a ratio of 0.024 ETH ($2104) and 3.27 ($15.28) SUSHI tokens. After depositing your tokens into the pool, the ratio and the price of the tokens change – This is due to market volatility and trades. This results in that at a given moment there may be more ETH than SUSHI in the pools (or more SUSHI than ETH).

If you decide to withdraw your tokens from the pool, you might receive more ETH than SUSHI (or vice versa). For example, you receive 0.015 ETH and 4.47 SUSHI – And the price of ETH has gone up – Your impermanent loss has become permanent.

Just look at the following example, where a liquidity pool is compared to HODLing. Let’s say you start with the same ratio of tokens as mentioned before, and ETH has increased in value by $200:

* In a liquidity pool where the ratio of SUSHI to ETH has changed to: (4.47 SUSHI \* $15.28 = $68.31) + (0.015 ETH \* $2304 = $34.46) = $102.87
* If you had HODLED: (3.27 SUSHI \* $15.28 = $ 50) + (0.024 ETH \* $2304 = $55.30) = $105.30

According to the calculation, you would have made $2.53 more by HODLing. Now, you might ask yourself, why in earth would I provide liquidity then? Well, the answer is simple. As mentioned earlier, as an LP you receive trading fees. If you’re providing liquidity in a popular liquidity pool, APY’s of &gt;30% can be easily achieved. If you want to take it even a step further, you can stake your LP tokens.

## LP tokens

Like any other tokens, a user can use the tokens from the liquidity pool during the period of the smart contract. A user can therefore deposit this token on another platform that accepts the liquidity pool token to get additional yield to maximize returns. Therefore, the user can compose two or three interest rates using yield farming, and ultimately increase returns.

An example of such a DeFi platform is harvest.finance. Harvest.finance allows the user to stake their LP tokens and rewards them with additional rewards **on top** of their fees rewards from the liquidity pool. In harvest.finance’s case, they reward the user with FARM tokens.

So as an example: Let’s say you have deposited $100 in a USDC/ETH liquidity pool on Uniswap with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 50%. The received UNI LP tokens can then be staked at havest.finance for additional rewards, which in this case would be 70% FARM APY. This means that you would receive in 1 year:

* $50 in LP ($25 in USDC and $25 in ETH tokens).
* $70 in FARM tokens.

As you can see, by staking your LP tokens rewards can be highly lucrative. By utilizing these techniques, APY’s of over 200% can be achieved. Of course, you need to remember that the price of tokens such as FARM are quite volatile and thus are risking to turn your $70 in FARM into way less amount of $ in a matter of days.

If you are interested in yield farming, I would recommend to use DeFi dashboard zapper.fi, which gives a great overview of all current liquidity pools and farms.

## Final words

Liquidity pools provide a user-friendly platform for both users and exchanges. The user does not have to meet any special eligibility criteria to participate in liquidity pools, which means that anyone can participate in the provision of liquidity for a token pair. In the DeFi ecosystem, liquidity pools play an essential role, and the concept has been able to increase the level of decentralization.

stocks,(3/29) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, March 29th, 2021-

*****

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-29.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. U.S. futures drop after Friday’s records for Dow, S&amp;P 500

&gt; * U.S. stock futures dropped Monday after a late-session rally Friday sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 up over 1.4% and nearly 1.7%, respectively, as stocks benefiting from a successful Covid reopening outperformed, again. The Dow and S&amp;P 500, which both closed at record highs, saw weekly gains about equal to Friday’s advances. Dow stock Boeing rose 3% in Monday’s premarket after a huge aircraft order from Southwest Airlines. Southwest shares were up modestly.

&gt; * The Nasdaq on Friday erased an almost 1% loss and closed up 1.2%. However, the tech-heavy index still declined about 0.6% for the week, with just three days left in March. The Nasdaq was tracking for a slight monthly loss, while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were poised to turn in solid gains for the month.

&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield was steady Monday, trading below its recent 14-month high. The rapid rise in yields this year has been troublesome for growth stocks, many of them tech names, as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations.

*****

&gt; # 2. Credit Suisse, Nomura take hit from U.S. hedge fund fallout

&gt; * Credit Suisse warned Monday of a “highly significant” hit to its first-quarter results, after the Swiss-based bank began exiting positions with a large U.S. hedge fund that melted down on margin calls last week. Japanese firm Nomura said it’s evaluating a potential loss estimated at $2 billion. Shares of Nomura and Credit Suisse were getting slammed in Monday’s premarket.

&gt; * The hedge fund at the center of the fallout is Archegos Capital Management, which was forced to liquidate positions at the end of last week. The moves by the multibillion dollar U.S. family office, founded by former Tiger equity analyst Bill Hwang, caused a wave of selling pressure Friday in U.S. media stocks and Chinese internet ADRs.

*****

&gt; # 3. Ever Given cargo ship blocking Suez Canal is partially floated

&gt; * The giant Ever Given container ship blocking the Suez Canal was partially refloated early Monday, days after the vessel got stuck and brought a vital global trade route to a standstill. The Suez Canal Authority said the ship’s course has been corrected by 80% and further maneuvers will resume when the water level rises later in the day. It remains unclear when waterway will reopen to traffic as hundreds of ships are backed up and waiting to enter the Suez. Maritime data showed at least ten tankers and container ships changed course to avoid the logjam, including U.S. ships carrying natural gas for Cheniere and Shell/BG Group.

*****

&gt; # 4. Biden to push infrastructure before health and family care

&gt; * President Joe Biden will separate his sprawling plan to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure into two separate pieces. Biden on Wednesday will unveil the first part of his plan, focusing on items like rebuilding roads and railways. The second part of the president’s plan — including child-care and health-care reforms, aspects of what’s sometimes called social infrastructure — will be released in “in just a couple of weeks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday in an interview. Taken as a whole, the legislation is expected to cost more than $3 trillion.

&gt; # 5. Fauci warns U.S. only ‘at the corner’ of Covid pandemic

&gt; * With the possibility of safer summer barbeques just a few months away, along with the promise of widespread Covid vaccine supply in the U.S. by the end of May, many Americans may be feeling as though the nation has finally turned the corner on the pandemic. However, White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that America is really only “at the corner.”

&gt; * New daily U.S. cases, while sharply lower than January’s high, increased 12% in the past seven days compared to a week ago, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Nearly half of people ages 65 and older have completed all of their necessary shots, according to CDC data. However, just 20% of the adult population is considered fully vaccinated.

personalfinance,Unemployment overpayment in 2020 and question how to deal with taxes.,"My wife received 2 weeks of unemployment last year at the start of the Covid crisis she wasn't due.  Long story short, this is her company's fault as they told her she was laid off and she should apply for unemployment but then continued to pay her while she didn't work so they could qualify for small business stimulus at the time. 

Things have now caught up and we are expecting a bill to replay the money to unemployment in the next month.

My question is how do I deal with taxes now?  I haven't filed 2020 yet, but we have a 1099 showing from unemployment (Michigan) show fed and state taxes were deducted and my tax software is now showing a federal credit for those taxes with the new stimulus.

Do I file and take the stimulus credit of the unemployment taxes now and then when I pay back unemployment taxes will be a wash?  Then what about State taxes?  I'm not sure if I'm going to get the bill before I need to file 2020 as they are super backed up.",finance

personalfinance,Should I get a bi-weekly pay. mortgage or get the monthly for 0.1% more interest and just pay that 2 times each month?,"I notice that if I opt for the bi-weekly I get a slightly lower rate, but of course, that's because I'll end up paying a little over a thousand each year (30 yr mortgage). If I use a compound interest calculator to see how much I could generate by simply investing those 1k each year, I get $60K back (double the money) with just a 4% return on investment. $105K with a, still modest, 7% over the course of 30 years.  I know I must be missing something, otherwise no one would opt for the bi-weekly option where you pay an additional 1K per year, because at least with a 240K loan only save a few gran over the course of the loan when compared to getting the 0.1% higher interest rate for the once payment/month mortgage.

Of course, if I went with the monthly mortgage I would still pay twice a month, jut not an additional mortgage payment that year.",finance

deeplearning,[Tutorial] Federated Machine Learning With Keras,"This tutorial covers how to use federated learning to train a Keras model. 

To keep user data private but still use it to train machine learning models, privacy-preserving machine learning has been on the rise. Federated learning is a client-server paradigm in which some clients train a global model with private user data, without sharing it to a centralized server.

The example discussed here has just 2 clients, where they work together to train a model that builds the XOR gate. You can easily use the project with other data as well, by just swapping out two arrays. 

The topics discussed include:

* Review of Federated Learning
* Preparing the Training Data
* Building the Keras Model
* Building a Population of Solutions
* Listening to Connections at the Server
* Server Reply to Client Request
* Client Behavior
* Conclusion

personalfinance,Refinancing used car loan with &lt;10k remaining?,"I'm trying to be a penny pincher and I've heard a lot on this thread about refinancing auto loans.

However, I've spent a lot of time googling options and I'm unsure if most auto refinancing places would consider my refinancing ""worth it.""

Details of my loan:

* Used 2013 Hyundai Elantra with 50k miles 
* $8400 remaining 
* $332 monthly payment 
* 6.5% interest rate through Huntington Bank 
* ~30 months remaining on loan 
* Excellent credit - 799

Only reason I really want to refinance is to see if I can save even a little bit on monthly payments with a lower interest rate. However, I've spent a lot of time Googling, and it seems like a lot of places might rule me out for various reasons (Capital One only does cars 2014 or newer, some places will only do loans with remaining 10K or more), OR would extend my loan, which I also don't want to do.

Haven't tried DCU yet because I'm trying to find options that will pre-qualify without actually applying and pulling credit.

Am I likely to find an auto refinance option that will be helpful for me? (Actually lower my interest rate without extending my loan period)? Any specific recommendations or advice?

I am not currently part of a credit union, but open to suggestions.

Problem is that I own a business that tends to have very inconsistent cash flow.  I own the entire s-corp and we are very cash rich, to account for the fact that we do tend to have boom and bust years.  But Chase says we don't qualify for a refinance because our 2019 tax returns had a small loss (while 2018 had huge gains, and 2020 had good income).  2021 is going to be a boom year as well.  Looking at our balance, you'd have to be absolutely nuts to think we couldn't make payments, but due to the 2 years of tax returns only (not 3 years, and no looking ahead), I can't refi.

Are there any viable options?  In researching bank statement loans, it seems they are basically trash.  Should I just ride out the 7 year ARM and hope interest rates don't skyrocket?  I could pay off the remainder then if I needed to.",finance

stocks,"Market Commentary (the former Tiger Club member margin called, Volatility in the Markets, TIGR earnings) - 3/29/2021","Hello investors,

Hope everyone had a great weekend.

Much has happened over the last couple of days and there's a lot to unfold. I'll start off with the last Friday's selloff and end with one final thought about the markets going forward.

Before we do, one thing to keep in mind as we think through what’s happening in the markets is the power of media.

I hear lots of media noise: changing opinions, shifting sentiments and rising calls for market meltdown.

And understandably so. I mean we are going through an ""unprecedented"" period with events that have occurred either very long time ago or never before: the geoplitical tensions between China, Russia, and the U.S., the new bond bear market, coordinated efforts by central banks and fiscal policies to stimulate the economy, the global pandemic recovery, and new flood of retail traders causing disruptions to the markets.

It's not hard to understand that trading these days is more difficult than at any other point in time throughout history.

Even the experts get it wrong all the time.

The smartest economists last year predicted that it would take at least 3-5 years to fully recover from the pandemic damages but the same group of people are predicting end of 2021 or early 2022.

Look at how the derivatives markets have incorrectly predicted fed funds rates in the past. By the end of 2009, the market was predicting the fed funds rate to increase more than 200 bps by 2011 and take a look at what happened.

📷

Remember back in March 2020 when the epidemiologists predicted that we will not have vaccines until 2023 or that 20 to 30% of the entire population will be eradicated?

My point is that in bad or good times, the ""media"", representing a group of experts in the respective fields, can present real hardships for us by playing with our emotions.

My personal strategy in dealing with the volatile market sentiment is to be very open-minded, listen to every word the experts have to say, especially their graphs or evidence-based arguments, form your own opinion, and do not be afraid to change your opinion if you've realized you got it completely wrong.

Doing your independent research and forming your own opinion is critical because by doing so, you will have a higher conviction in your trades.

Having conviction means you are holding onto the trade or stock when the stock falls 80% or not be tempted to sell when the stock triples.

You are able to do that because even if the stock falls 80% you know this company is a great business and you know it will quadruple in the next five years because it’ll grow its earnings and the market will eventually price to that.

If you do not have the conviction, then you’ll be questioning why is the stock falling and you will question your judgment and be tempted to sell.

Now onto today's topic.

I'm sure most of you have heard by now but last Friday, we had a hedge fund getting margin called, triggering large declines in stocks that the fund sold in blocks.

We need to first understand exactly what happened in order to know if this has any real implications for the markets.

This fund is called Archegos Capital, run by ex-Tiger Asia founder Bill Hwang. Tiger Asia is the Asia division of legendary investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, and Bill Hwang was one of a select club of analysts (the ""Tiger Club"") trained by Julian Robertson.

As a result of forced liquidation, the prime brokers that covered these positions also incurred losses, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, and Credit Suisse.

With that said, as in any type of news, you have to make your own judgment in terms of whether the news is real or not.

I'm not saying the news is fake but I'm saying that it's probably impossible to know if it's 100% true because no prime broker will disclose the name of their client who just had billions of losses.

Practically speaking, does it matter if it was Archegos or another hedge fund? What matters for us is that some big fund most likely went bad and had to sell a bunch of securities. I wouldn't want to waste a minute trying to figure out which fund this was or whether if this story is actually true.

This fund sold $20 billion worth of shares in total, including ViacomCBS, Discovery, and big Chinese names like Baidu 10mm shares, Tencent 50mm shares, and VIP Shop 32mm shares.

📷📷

📷📷

📷

What exactly triggered them to liquidate all of these positions in such a strong bull market?

I would imagine it's the Chinese names and the growth stock selloff during the recent weeks. Look at their performances recently.

📷📷

📷📷

Viacom CBS went from $100 at intraday top on 3/22 to $64 low on 3/25, roughly 40% drop in less than a week. This came at a time when all other growth stocks were going down in flames, especially the Chinese stocks that took hit due to the rising geopolitical risks.

What does all of this mean for the markets?

Well, a few outcomes are possible in my opinion.

Bearish: full-blown market deleveraging, forcing other funds to liquidate and triggering a downward cycle and stocks to selloff.

Bullish: this turns into another September 2020 event where the Nasdaq sold off 10% caused by Softbank's bulk option purchases and the markets recover like it didn't happen.

Most likely, it'll be somewhere in the middle.

The reason I think it won't turn into a market mayhem is the same one I've been repeatedly mentioning for the past few months. Fed has literally promised a proper market functioning and fiscal spending is none like others in the past.

Look at Fed's dot plot for instance. They're as dovish as an institution can get, expecting to keep rates at 0% through 2023.

📷

Even if the market tumbles and the liquidity dries up, causing the S&amp;P 500 to drop 15%, I have no doubt that the Fed will intervene to calm the markets down, which means the drop will only present incredible opportunities for us as investors.

**I am of the opinion that this is another one of those opportunities to buy into the dip.**

As I mentioned in this memo, I believe that this ""great rotation"" from growth to value will cause short-term stress in the growth names but not in the long run.

The reason is rather simple.

I don't think a company that's growing its top line at 30-40% with 80% gross profit won't care if the market rotates from growth to value stocks.

An e-commerce company will also be marginally impacted by vaccine rollouts. I mean obviously it won't see the pandemic-level of sales growth but I don't think an e-commerce firm that grew its top line at 25% a year pre-pandemic will see its sales growth decrease to single digits simply due to people not staying at their homes all the time.

The point I'm trying to convey is that if you pick great businesses growing rapidly, the market has no choice but to price them to their full earnings potential, whether the market rotates from growth to value.

We may see a lower than expected return but it's still a large return. For instance, if we were expecting Fiverr to trade at 10x P/S by 2025, then we may need to lower that projection to 8x P/S and our overall expected return may change from 250% to 200%. And I don't think you should reconsider investing in a company just because your expected return dropped from 250% to 200%.

On another note, I believe we will experience an inflation level we haven't seen in the last 40 years. The 10-year breakevens are already skyrocketing.

📷

My contention is that gold will be the primary beneficiary of this trend but I'm also open to other ideas to take advantage of the upcoming inflation blowout.

**The second topic I wanted to discuss is TIGR earnings last Friday.**

I posted my thoughts on TIGR on these two memos.

(see the comments)

They reported a very strong earnings report on March 26 pre-market and I was very pleased with the results.

Some of you may have seen that as soon as their earnings were reported, the stock went straight up more than 20% pre-market. After that, the stock opened 14% lower most likely due to the China tensions and Archegos liquidation of Chinese names, and fully recovered from intraday lows by the end of the day.

Given that the business is still in great shape with lots of potential, I view these drops as opportunities and I believe TIGR will thrive in the future.

It's certainly not easy to hold onto the securities that burn your portfolio. That's why everyone has different levels of risk appetite and one person's trading strategy will not work for another.

You have to develop your own system to manage risks. If you are not comfortable with a 40% loss, try limiting your exposure to riskier names or hedging your portfolio through options, as I mentioned in here.

Thank you for reading! I hope this helps and please feel free to leave any comments or feedback.

personalfinance,Struggling to get a loan,"Hi all,

Long story short, taking the semester off from grad school and am staying at home. I have two stream of income from my small business and online tutoring, but how much I make and when I make it is inconsistent and I don't think I'll be able to pay my lingering living expenses from grad school on time (Rent). I did not get my loan disbursement for the spring semester since I am not technically enrolled.

So I want/ need to get a loan for $6,000 to cover my living expenses and any remainder on the loan I can pay off when I start school again in the summer.

Here's the issue, I have a great credit score (768) but am technically low income. Also, I have a spotty work history because I have been in school for forever. Also, my tutoring job pays me in cash so I have no proof I'm actually working there. 

So I can't get a student loan since I'm not technically enrolled. And I don't really qualify for personal loans because of my spotty work history + I don't have my 2020 tax return form yet. The one bank willing to give me a personal loan is charging an obscene interest rate of 27%.

personalfinance,Car is going to die soon. Upside down on loan. Use $2k on down payment for a new car or pay down current loan?,"Hello good people of r/personalfinance 

I have a 2015 Ford Focus with 98k miles that’s had all kinds of problems. 2 recall services and warranty work. I found out today that the BCM is messed up and will cost at least $800 to fix. This car is no longer safe to drive as is.

I have some money saved up with the intent to get a new car. I don’t want to lease, I originally wanted to buy. I have pretty good credit. However, I still owe almost $8k on my current car. I got approved for a loan from my bank for $20k with a 5.29 % APR and a doable monthly payment.

Since I most likely can’t afford an SUV that doesn’t have crazy high mileage my question is this: should I “settle” for a nice reliable used sedan, use my $2,000 for a down payment for that and roll my current $8k I still owe into a new car payment

OR 

Use the $800 (or more) to fix the car and use the rest to pay down my current loan, and then hopefully get the car to last a little longer until I can get the car I actually want later down the road?

I got into this situation in the first place because my old car died when I was young and I worked at a car dealership and they got me into a new car lease. I had no credit history, knew nothing about interest rates, leasing, or personal finance in general. I just needed a low monthly car payment and a car to get around in.

So, an extra $12k taxable income that is entirely in the 24% tax bracket.

I was trying to figure out if it made more sense to make that a Trad IRA contribution instead. Figuring, based on current tax brackets, any income over $40k (approx) is taxed at 22% and we're aiming to have, at a minimum, 60k in today's dollars in retirement (likely to have much more than that if things go to plan). If we were in the 22% bracket in retirement, I would think that 2% would be more than offset by the tax-free gains in the Roth. 

Am I thinking right here? Assuming we're in the 24% now and will be 22% in retirement (I know a lot could change), Roth makes more sense?",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 29, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 29, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed as market participants continue to digest the effects of the sudden unwinding in equity markets by large hedge funds. After the best session in three weeks on Friday, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose while the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) pulled back modestly. 

Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management’s family office and a so-called “Tiger cub” (the name Wall Street gave to protégés of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a “significant hit” following Archegos Capital’s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.

Despite the recent choppiness in the market, there are signs the economy is improving. In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week’s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. 

The United States is set to distribute 3 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine each day. California and New York, two of the hardest-hit states, plan to open vaccinations to all residents 16 and older in the next two weeks. On December 8, before he took office, President Biden promised that his team would help administer 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within his first 100 days in office. The administration has reached that goal, and now set a new goal of 200 million shots administered [in his first 100 days](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/president-joe-biden-holds-first-press-conference/6984142002/). Before Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, roughly 20 million doses had been administered (the Pfizer vaccine was approved on December 11, 2021).

personalfinance,Indian Phone Scams,"Because I saw the other post on here talking about getting scammed out of 25k+ and the victim was a young woman in her 20s, I just wanted to briefly share my recent experience with a scam call.  I kept getting scam calls and finally I got so many and was expecting work related calls that I just picked up and went through the motions to waste their time because they were pissing me off.  That was a mistake.

After getting hung up on several times, one scammer finally takes the bait and starts talking to me.  He asks for my name and last 4 digits of my ssn.  I make something up.  He responded by saying, ""No, you're lying, I know your name is \[insert my real first and last name here\] and you live in \[insert town here\] and you have lived in \[starts prattling off names of other towns I've lived in\].  I was shocked.  He says, ""You know it's a federal offense to lie to an officer?""  

I can easily see how someone would have been scared and may have been convinced that a scammer who had their real name and address, and prior addresses, may be a real ""officer"".   Honestly, if they had started off the call with, ""Hello, this is officer x, I'm calling from the y department.  Am I speaking with FirstName LastName?""  I might have been inclined to believe them and may have been so flustered I wouldn't think straight.

personalfinance,Disputing items on a credit report,"Hi everyone. Looking for some advice to see if I have a leg to stand on disputing some delinquencies on my credit reports (as it pertains to trying to buy a home soon and trying to boost credit score to lock in a better interest rate).

Right now there are 8x occurances of delinquency on my credit reports from 6 years ago. All are from my Fed Loans for school. I let the entire account go 90 days late without making a payment to sort out the forbearance/deferment paperwork. Per the conversation I had with a representative at Fed Loans, she said my account has been in good standing since those occurances 6 years ago.  

The way it is set up is I make 1x payment that gets divided across the 8 separate loans on the account. I want to know if I have a valid argument for it to be seen as 1x case of delinquency instead of 8x since it all goes through the same loan house.

Don't know if that makes any sense. Any input is greatly appreciated. Feel free to message me through chat or private messages if you'd like.

If for any reason this goes against the Rules, apologies in advanced and I'll correct it if possible.

Bitcoin,Will There Always Be A Market For Lending Bitcoin for Interest?,"Yes, I know, NYKNYB. Let's move on from that for now and just assume we're all knowledgeable about the risks of lending your Bitcoin to 3rd parties and that we've all determined individually what we are willing to risk, or not.

My question is, will there always be some kind of lending market for Bitcoin out into the future? And if so, is this likely to be the primary way most people generate some kind of passive income from their Bitcoin hodlings?

As the market grows and more players get into the game, my suspicion is that interest rates for Bitcoin lending will go lower and lower as more and more people and institutions realize how pristine of an asset Bitcoin is. Does it ever get to the point where the rate people are willing to pay to borrow Bitcoins (for whatever purposes, and no, they're NOT just shorting, a lot of it is for ""risk free"" market making) is assumed to be the de fact risk free rate of return?

As time goes on, will lending out your hodlings (or a part of your hodlings) still be thing for generating passive income and living on your Bitcoin stack without having to sell any part of your stack? Or is borrowing/lending Bitcoin just a fad that will one day disappear?

personalfinance,Need advice about tax implications of a loan from my mom,"My mother is refinancing her house, on which she owes about $200K. We discussed her taking out $240,000 and loaning me the remaining $40,000.  

I have some debt with a relatively high interest rate; I can pay it off entirely with her loan, and then pay her back in much smaller installments, with no interest. That's the idea. 

I am not concerned about my income/ability to pay her back; she would be happy to make this a gift, but I don't want to do that. She has no problem paying her mortgage and her payments will actually drop by $50 a month now, because of the lower interest rates.

Do we *need* to draw up a loan document where I say I will pay her X per month for # months? Does it matter if we don't strictly stick to this agreement, e.g. some months I give her more than other months?

Is it okay if this is a no-interest loan? Are there tax implications either way? Will either of us have to file any declarations or forms with the IRS about what we do? Will this meaningfully change my tax situation (I have one job, get one W2, and take the standard deduction)?

Is there anything else I should be thinking about while we discuss this? Thanks for your advice!",finance
personalfinance,HELOC Options-How bad is an adjustable rate?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/mdwbd3/refinance_vs_home_equity_line_of_credit/

First post here with more info about me. I don't believe it's necessary to read that post to follow this one.

Since that post I've spoken with my lender and talked about the rates available with representatives from BofA, Frost, Credit Union of Texas, BOK Financial, Bank of Texas, RBFCU, and BBVA.

Most of them don't offer fixed rate HELOCs and the few that do are locking at 5% or more. 

I didn't get quotes for every adjustable rate because my understanding was that adjustable rate=bad, 2008 crisis balloon payment bad.

However, by the time I got to my fifth bank, I started asking more about the adjustable rate since several banks offered ""locks"" on rates where at any point I could lock a portion of the credit line at a fixed rate. I like this because it seems to be that as long as the federal rate stays at .25, the prime rate will stay close to 3.25, which is great. The person I spoke with most (at BBVA) echoed what I heard from lots of other reps in that the flexibility is the draw to a HELOC over a refinance or HELoan. She said that if the prime rate starts to rise, locking in is always an option.

My question is, **what determines their ""lock-in"" rate?** She wasn't able to tell me, but currently BBVA said 5.04-6.39% is the lock-in rate while their adjustable rate was prime +.75-3.75 depending on credit, but with a 1% discount if I draw at least 50k, which I plan to. So if credit works out well, I could even get prime -.25%.

But if the prime rate goes up to 7%, what stops the lock in rate from also going up? Is the 'lock-in' rate just advertising because it'll always be 2% higher than the adjustable rate and the best time to lock in was back when you first withdrew funds? Or will there be a scenario where 



I ask because, while no one knows for sure what may happen with the prime rate, looking at the historical prime rate made me look towards 1980, where I saw that
&gt; The reason interest rates, which ultimately are set by the Federal Reserve, exploded in 1980 was housings' arch nemesis, runaway inflation. ... The cause was an inflationary spiral brought on by rising oil prices, government overspending and rising wages.

Which sounds eerily similar to events occurring today, even if the government is ignoring them for the time being.


I used a heloc repayment calculator and the difference between a 4.25% rate and a 6.25% rate is like 38$ a month, since we are aiming to pay it off in 15 years. 

So I imagine the following:

1. Dream: The prime rate stays low and we save by keeping an adjustable rate locked in at prime+1 or prime-.25, whatever we end up with. This prime+1 number stays the same through the life of the HELOC, so everything works out great.

2. Less ideal: The prime rate starts to go up, we use a rate lock to lock in before it rises too much.

3. Less less ideal: The prime rate starts to go up, we use a rate lock to lock in, but it was a pump fake and the prime rate goes down again. We have a higher but still affordable rate locked in. In this scenario, if it gets super low again, we refinance the current mortgage and the HELOC into one monthly payment, preferably at 10 years to still be done before I turn 50.

4. Less less less ideal: The prime rate starts to go up, we use a rate lock to lock in, but it was a pump fake and the prime rate goes down again. We have a higher but affordable rate locked in, but we don't have the option to refinance because the housing market is down and we owe more than the home is worth. 


Even in the least ideal situation, it's not a 'loss' unless I want to leave the home. 


I guess I'm kind of looking for a 'red team' to **poke holes in my understanding** and tell me if my understanding is wrong, if there's something I haven't considered, or if this sounds like an idiot plan.

I'd also really welcome anyone who has used a HELOC before and their experiences with fixed rate, adjustable rate, and especially anyone who has used a ""rate lock"" ""smart lock"" ""true lock"" or whatever name adjustable rate heloc with an option to fix a rate.


Appreciate any help!",finance

Both me and my domestic partner are living in the US under different visas.

Bitcoin,Knowing When to Buy the Dip - If you're thinking about selling right now DON'T &amp; Why you shouldn't,"Ok ladies &amp; gents,

To some, this recent pull back might look like a repeat of the correction after Elon's candle but it's not.

Here's why:

1. Adoption is increasing (Visa, MasterCard, Tesla, Square, PayPal, JPM, GS, BNY, BlackRock). All of these companies don't mess around and are all taking action towards adopting crypto.
2. Inflation - Do I really need to explain this? Go look at the M2 money supply or the price of any commodity over the last year and you'll get the picture
3. Interest rates might be increasing but they can't go that high. Look up Operation Twist for more info, this is a can of worms I don't want to open right now but basically short-term rates are going up for the near future and long-term rates will go down incentivizing long-term investment in the economy. This will balance out over time and people worrying about rates jumping shouldn't because it would literally break the entire world economy if you don't believe me refer to #2
4. The price is being manipulated right now for either institutions (most likely) or whales to accumulate at a lower price

Proof:

This is called a sell wall. To newbies, this may look like someone trying to offload a bunch of BTC so they can get out but this is an extremely common tactic seen in both the traditional financial markets as well as cryptocurrency markets. It works particularly well in crypto because volume is so low. The idea is (relatively) simple. Pretend you want to buy a bunch of BTC without pushing the price up too much. You can't buy it all at once so you need to spread it out over time. But hang on, doing that will cause a bunch of green candles in a row and everybody and their mom will jump in on the action so what do you do?

You pretend you're selling a bunch for more than what you want to buy it for. This will scare people into selling at or below your sell wall, allowing you to buy up all their BTC for the price you want. Once you have what you want, you take away the sell wall (prepare for launch) and buy up until people join in (to the moon) . This is what happening literally right now so if you're selling stop. My guess is there will be an announcement soon about another company investing in BTC or an investment bank/hedge fund just got they're trading desk running.

TL;DR - Always buy the dip.",cryptocurrency

so I thought I'd present some Data to you to help inform you about why that is inherently incorrect - and that Doge, while not necessarily the best Crypto investment - is still worth buying into.  


**Currently, there are 123 Billion Dogecoin in circulation.**

[\[Cited Source 1 - Dogecoin Current Numbers\]](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2021/01/29/dogecoin-how-many-doge-exist/)

**A maximum of 5 Billion Dogecoin can be released into the mining pool per year as of 2014.**  
[\[Cited Source 2 - Dog Coin released per year post-2014](https://thedogvisitor.com/qa/how-many-dogecoin-exist)[\]](https://thedogvisitor.com/qa/how-many-dogecoin-exist)  


**Including The 5 billion Doge that will be released this year - The Current rate of inflation for Dogecoin sits at a comfortable 3.9%**   


*Where n = number released per year*  
*/ by x = Number in total circulation*  


This means that next year, the Inflation rate will be 3.7% then, 3.6%, 3.4%, and so on.  
Comparatively the federal reserve considers 2% to be their inflation target for the US dollar.  
Whilst Doge has a long way to go before it matches an ""*ideal""* rate of inflation, its long-term prospects are actually exceedingly good and will eventually overtake the USD in that regard.  


So to clarify, no, even though there is technically an ""infinite"" supply of dogecoin, the yearly amount actually released to the mining pool is ***capped at a 3.9% inflation rate that falls by a rate of approximately  0.15%  per year.***  


**Between 700Million - 1.5 Billion Doge is traded per day. (approximately 0.6%) of the total number of Doge in Active Circulation.**  


**Big Hedge funds are** ***heavily*** **invested in Doge because it is stable, long-term security holding for them, whilst other Major Cryptos can be incredibly volatile - Doge is relatively stable and slowly rising.**

11. ~~What did Charles actually do (if anything) on the day of the recent Thanos Infinity Gauntlet snap pic? Just general or was something specific happening behind the scenes?~~  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1367874091722694656/photo/1) RETIRED!
12. Alonzo hard fork (non)event  to complete Goguen and add smart contracts in Q2. You’ll barely feel it broh. Not even an event. Lots of combinator broh.
13. Actual target date of Alonzo hardfork combinator event (smart contracts) will be revealed at Cardano 360 show at end of March. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1366519588519731203](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1366519588519731203)
14. Charles claimed Elon was trolling Cardano with “meta for k” on twitter. Can anyone argue one way or another on this? [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1364350825271685122](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1364350825271685122)
15. Ourobouros omega is slated to bring significant innovation to the Cardano consensus protocol.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1357364560504709120](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1357364560504709120)
16. Possible Soulja Boy Cardano collab on NFT. Maybe Soulja Boy could be best brohs with Charles and Stephen Wolfram broh? [https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907](https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1355770383396347907)
17. ~~Coinbase Listing of ADA.  Will the DCG Mafia ever allow ADA to compete on an even playing field with “their precious” (read in Gollum voice)  ETH? Maybe we don’t even need them?~~ RETIRED!
18. Twitter revamp via Cardano? Charles did a whole vid on fixing social media curation. ~~Other hand: they won’t even give Charles a blue check mark.~~ (Retired: he finally got it) Other other hand: Jack has a mutual love of Africa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JilEb42q-CI&amp;t=2325s)
19. In the Protocol Parameters vid, Charles suggested they will introduce a CIP (Cardano Improvement Proposal) to change the inflation model to accommodate pay for stakepools for processing transactions/data from the ETH, IELE, and Catalyst sidechains. We’ll get to vote on CIPs like this. Kablam! Democracy! Kablam! Voltaire! Kablam! More duckets for staking! Don’t worry broh. They’re gonna stay serious here broh. Charles squinting real hard/blinking/talking slower/using hands a lot here broh. Not planning to violate the things learned from the long Oxford research arc and the input of the Prism Group (Harvard dudes) broh.  Snake still eats tail broh. Kablam! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJorRPk767s)
20. ~~Charles mentioned a seven person anti-corruption committee reviewing the Ethiopia project.  Hopefully no shenanigans there broh.~~ Retired!
21. Charles is scheduled to appear on Lex Fridman’s Podcast in June. Lex seems like a nice guy broh.  He’ll probably end up best brohs with Charles, Stephen Wolfram, &amp; Soulja Boy. Ben Goertzel is also in broh. Lex needs a girlfriend but no paying ADA to romance the androids. Just take lion’s mane, maybe some ‘83 Gordon &amp; McPhail, and solve global issues together broh.
22. Will a Joe Rogan appearance follow this? It was always ”Goguen before Rogan.” They both love meat and you can barely tell they’re both filthy rich. Match made in heaven?
23. 100% Decentralization of block validation incoming this month!!!!
24. ~~Liquidity bird to land sometime soon? What is it?~~ RETIRED!
25. What about the whispers of a telecom deal?  Part of the Ethiopia project?
26. What about paying for utilities and transportation?  Part of the Ethiopia deal?
27. Academic credentialing project in the nation state of Georgia.  Lots of mentions of this over the years.
28. Mongolia project. Also lots of mentions of this over the years.
29. Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana,  &amp; South Africa.   It seems like there have been a decent number of indicators over the years that these governments are also already in play or targeted for the pan-Africa strategy of 100 MM users in 5-10 years.
30. In the recent Cardano 360 show there was talk of Emurgo possibly being in the process of building something that sounded kind of like a Metamask for Cardano.  Sebastian building stuff works good broh. If not, what will fill the Metamask role in the Cardano ecosystem as a sort of universal(ish) bridge for users of smart contracts? Daedalus?  Or something new that would be standalone?
31. Justin Roiland knows about Cardano. What if they ever mention it on the show broh? [https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088](https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1363000121248473088)

35. There will be a “Mastering Cardano” book.  No author signed on yet.  Hopefully he or she will have a hairline that is even more dracula than Andreas Antonopoulos. I kid. Love Andreas.
36. Cardano reached 550k wallets in half the time it took BTC [https://twitter.com/nierop\_pieter/status/1369933366368362496](https://twitter.com/nierop_pieter/status/1369933366368362496)
37. Cardano now has it’s own thirst trap twitter accounts. I won’t list them. But, you probably already know which ones those are if you follow #cardano. It’s probably bullish that we are now big enough for them to target us.
38. We can now claim that Catalyst is the world’s biggest DAO! Luckily, I think it is safe to suspect that ours is less susceptible to recursive call attacks than ETH’s first big DAO. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1369961368946946053](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1369961368946946053)
39. IOHK releases a good article contrasting the various blockchain accounting methods: EUTXO (Cardano) vs. UTXO (Bitcoin) vs. Account Balance (Ethereum). This is one of those nice articles where the British guy pleasantly reads it to you if you want. Use this one to convince all your friends you are the ultimate blockchain expert:  “listen Kyle...the shortcoming of UTXO accounting is....” [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/11/cardanos-extended-utxo-accounting-model/)
40. Cardano devs at IOHK are the most productive in the industry! Already 3,170 commits and climbing this week! I sleep better at night knowing they are not allowed to sleep. Kidding….kidding.

43. Apparently the first $1200 stimulus check if invested in ADA would be $44,800 now.  [https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1369426234883645443/photo/1](https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1369426234883645443/photo/1)
44. Charles gives us that real talk about why a young billionaire would devote his life to this Cardano thing. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7Da6sFAxuI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7Da6sFAxuI)
45. Cardano uses a tiny fraction of the energy some other top-ten blockchains use.   This factoid alone should allow you to hook up with eco-obsessed nature people. [https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875](https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1370571904969551875)

47. Will Babel Fees in Cardano lead to delegators receiving an almost index fund like assortment of native tokens? Will SPOs be willing to accept a wide assortment as payment for transaction fees?  Will the economics of the delegation/staking landscape require SPOs to share those Babel Fee tokens with their delegators?
48. Will NFTs be a glaring exclusion from Babel Fees? Will I have to pay for the transaction fees on my NFT in ADA because I don’t want to give an SPO a small piece of the ownership interest in the digital art or other asset represented by the NFT?
49. There’s a new Crypto Time Traveler and this one loves Cardano. [https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2](https://twitter.com/CryptoTimeTrav2)

63. We get another People of Input Output Global video.  This one features Dan Friedman. He currently lives in Japan.  But, the interview starts off with some very interesting stories about his youth in 1980s Kiev, Ukraine.  His speaking and story-telling style is similar to the captain in a 1990s buddy cop movie (in a good way). Very interesting and compelling guy.

70. Perceptions are shifting on which platform will be #1 for smart contracts over the next decade. Here’s the biggest crypto youtuber asking his co-host if he’s losing faith in the traditional #1. If you’re in Cardano, you can guess which coin his answer is shifting away from. [https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270](https://youtu.be/4jRCmdWva40?t=3270)

74. Charles delivered his pre-recorded keynote address at the Blockchain Africa Conference. His remarks support the rumor that the initial Ethiopia project will be around identity. He specifically mentioned Atala Prism. There was talk of the digital identity being able to be linked to wallets, payment systems, and property. He also reasserted that the deals on the table in Africa would bring “millions of users” into the Cardano ecosystem.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGEs99I6qV8)
75. If you haven’t seen it in the past, the Atala Prism website has a demo that works with the mobile app showing how the identity solution (along with academic credentialing, health insurance, and proof of employment) would run on Cardano. [https://www.atalaprism.io/](https://www.atalaprism.io/)
76. ADA is now live on coinbase.com as well as Coinbase Pro! So, you don’t even need to understand orderbooks to buy ADA now. [https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-now-available-on-coinbase-dd30c1e0d93a](https://blog.coinbase.com/cardano-ada-is-now-available-on-coinbase-dd30c1e0d93a)

78. Never imagined there would be a holiday light display that flashed “Screw Doge Coin; ADA is Best” to the original Doge music. Friendly rivalry is probably good in crypto. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM135pv72mY&amp;t=31s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM135pv72mY&amp;t=31s)
79. Charles doubles down on the declaration that Cardano’s defining moment will be when it can provide the rails for micro finance from the developed world to the developing world not as a form of charity but as a profitable financial activity for both lender and loan recipient. He thinks it will be the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world. He says the base infrastructure for this is being rolled out over the next 24-36 months. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMRGUCLQPYo)

81. Max Keiser is also not romantically in love with us. Charles lays down the stick pretty hard on this one. I’m saying good. If you can’t take the heat...stay out of the Cardano kitchen, my man.

90. Critics think that lack of burned fees is a valid complaint against Cardano. But, good outcomes at scale only come with good incentives and free competition. So, if the fees aren’t paying the costs of transactions in these other protocols, the question goes begging: who is? In the end, the answer always turns out to be that the transaction costs have just been obfuscated under the guise of inflation via coin emission or some other hidden tax on someone in the ecosystem (usually the coin holders).  [https://twitter.com/avaxholder/status/1373336728010956801](https://twitter.com/avaxholder/status/1373336728010956801)
91. We are starting to see cracks in the psychological armor of the Ethereum crowd.  This anti-Cardano post was at 0 upvotes (at time of writing) while the fairly pro-Cardano response received triple figure upvotes. [https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/maktuy/ist\_charles\_hoskinson\_the\_new\_justin\_sun/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/maktuy/ist_charles_hoskinson_the_new_justin_sun/)
92. When smart contracts go live with Alonzo (the final HFC event in Goguen), and we eventually have Babel Fees, it’s going to make almost zero sense for any developer to choose ETH over Cardano. This will apply especially to any project that sends tokens to its customers (e.g. NFT projects) and any project that involves significant computation or transaction loads on the network (e.g. DeFi projects).
93. Emurgo is thinking about supply chain solutions for the seafood industry. [https://emurgo.io/blog/how-can-blockchain-deliver-benefits-to-the-seafood-industrys-supply-chain](https://emurgo.io/blog/how-can-blockchain-deliver-benefits-to-the-seafood-industrys-supply-chain)

96. A guy tried to use Charles’s reaction to the King Soopers tragedy in Boulder to criticize Cardano. Charles told him to go f\*\*\* himself and then auctioned off the tweet with proceeds going to the families of the victims. The auction price quickly hit four figures and closed at $7k.

97. Thursday is Cardano 360 and Friday will be “Get ADA Day” as staking rewards for Epoch 255 close. Gonna be an action packed close to the week.  Enjoy!
98. Here was my favorite moonboi tweet of the last few days.  Old photo, but excellent captioning work here. [https://twitter.com/MaximilianXCIX/status/1373471841449304066](https://twitter.com/MaximilianXCIX/status/1373471841449304066)
99. Great new interview with Sebastien! In this one he explains a lot about the dApp Connector being built by Emurgo. As reported by a commenter in one of our earlier threads, it will work with Ergo first and then Cardano. A very interesting tidbit was Sebastien’s explanation of how the Emurgo dApp Connector will actually be safer than Metamask (which fills a similar role in the ETH ecosystem).  Very good info. Thanks to Sebastien and the Cardano Podcast! [https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY](https://youtu.be/Dkw7hvFP6dY)
100. Today is Cardano 360 day!!!!  Watch it here at 10:30AM Pacific, 17:30 GMT, 18:30 CET.  This is the live monthly streaming show from IOHK.  Watch this one. Hopefully we’ll get a target date for Alonzo.  That’ll tell us when we get smart contracts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQt7AjimaAg)
101. Looks like the Cardano 360 show may highlight how Cardano will not experience some of the shortcomings that leading blockchains have in the past (like the time that bitcoin accidentally issued 184 billion BTC in one block).  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1374783084881608706](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1374783084881608706)
102. Catalyst Fund 5 will have a $2MM total budget! Included will be a very interesting $50k Metadata challenge in Fund 5.  Metadata can be used to prove the existence of a certain document or event to third parties without necessarily revealing the data contained therein. This means you can do cool things on the blockchain without using smart contracts as in the prior New Balance anti-counterfeiting and Beefchain traceability Cardano projects.The winners of this challenge are actually going to be incubated and supported by the IOHK Metadata team! People waiting for Goguen and smart contracts are definitely sleeping on what can be done with metadata on Cardano today.

103. There is a Catalyst Dashboard available that gives you all the stats on the current projects in Cardano’s multi-million dollar decentralized innovation fund (the world’s biggest). [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15R-Vbajy4t4fGs1TipNMfL1pEO9cwdn6WV13lKviX4Q/edit#gid=40774150](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15R-Vbajy4t4fGs1TipNMfL1pEO9cwdn6WV13lKviX4Q/edit#gid=40774150)
104. Charles says they are going to end up spending $15-30MM this year on research and they will hire 100-200 people. That’s an investment in the future of the ecosystem! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLwyFADws8w)
105. Cardano 360 was yesterday! The big news first: it sounds like the Alonzo (smart contracts)  testnet will launch around end of April or early May. It’s looking like Alonzo HFC event will happen on main net late July or August. The stream was over three hours long. They covered so much! Now, let’s get to the other details revealed. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULBLgPgxtN8)
106. Grigory Rosu from Runtime Verification gave a big rundown on the universality in programming languages that will be provided by K framework in Cardano.  He said he should have some kind of proof of concept around six months from now.
107. Michael Peyton Jones and Manual Chakravarty (the architects of Plutus) talked about 1) the benefits of Cardano’s modern approach to designing Plutus TX and Plutus Core and how Plutus Core basically being lambda calculus allows for mathematical verification of software written in Plutus, 2) how UTXO (and EUTXO in Cardano) are much more battle proven than other ledger accounting systems like account balance system (e.g. ETH) which have had problems, 3) how non-fungible role tokens will be a thing, and 4) how they are now laying out a real development platform for builders instead of just throwing Plutus out into the world.
108. Lars Brünjes (Head of Education) laid out how they are going to train a group of developers through the Plutus Pioneers program.  That group will help test the Alonzo test net after it launches.
109. Lars has also cloned Uniswap in Plutus with a graphical user interface and completely automated price discovery in the liquidity pools.  He did this as a proof of concept to show the capabilities of Plutus. That was demoed right on the stream.
110. They then brought on people from three different Haskell development firms who will be building things on the testnet as a sort of “red team” test of Alonzo.  They all seemed to be very capable in terms of Haskell development (note here that Plutus is basically Haskell).
111. Tom Lindeman (Chief Security Officer at Runtime Verification) then laid out how disastrous the last few years in Ethereum have been for smart contract security.  But, Cardano has a solution.  IOHK and Runtime Verification will partner to certify smart contracts as to security.  Runtime Verification will do the security audits.  This program will be called “Alpha Frontier”.
112. Charles then laid out the details of the timeline for Alonzo as described above.   It sounds like they are targeting to be totally done and hit a code/feature freeze at the end of June.  But, it will take Coinbase, Kraken, Binance et al. at least four weeks to update their systems before they can actually launch smart contracts on mainnet.
113. Collin Edwards and Duncan Couts then gave us an update on the stake pool world as we approach “D DAy” or d=0 which is full decentralization of block production. A stake pool operator Shawn McMurdo has made some Cardano Improvement proposals as to 1) a non-linear curved basis for a0 (pronounced a-naught, represents stake pool operator pledge) to affect rewards more greatly, 2) non-centralized rankings in Daedalus, and 3) an adjustment to minimum fees from fixed to variable.   Collin and Duncan clarified there will be no changes to a0 (pledge) or k (max pool size) at the d=0 (full decentralization) event coming up. Duncan also laid out how they are going to launch P2P node testnet in early Q2.  This will allow for information to flow directly between nodes and will accomplish automation of things like peer discovery that are currently manual on the network.
114. Dor Garbash then gave an update on Catalyst.  As covered previously here, Catalyst has become a monster.  There are 17k people in Ideascale and the treasury is worth more than $400MM.  You heard that right, almost a half billion dollars in the Catalyst Treasury.  We also heard from a bunch of the previous catalyst winners.
115. Someone paid $23k for the notorious “Your telling the CEO of IOHK…” tweet.  [https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u\_a](https://v.cent.co/tweet/1374769078519300097?s=u_a)
116. IOHK is rolling out a new team that will fight the scammers in crypto. In my mind this involves guys in polo shirts with popped collars and Ledger Nano Xs around their necks carrying [these](https://www.heckler-koch.com/en/products/military/submachine-guns/mp7a1/mp7a2/overview.html) and hunting the bad guys while ‘90s action movie music plays. Probably Dwayne Johnson is their commander. Maybe that’s not what Charles has in mind.  [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1375473873651568640](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1375473873651568640)
117. Cardano is the Tesla of crypto. We’re just in that early stage right before the Model 3 launch where the Ford and GM guys are at peak fear/peak shit talking but we haven’t made that big move yet.  “It’s an illusion, they’ll never release a sub $40k car.”  We’ll see shortly, gentlemen...we’ll see.
118. Every once in a while I like to take stock of where the rest of the crypto space is on Cardano. So, let’s do a little review of what a few of the larger youtube crypto and other influencers are saying about Cardano right now.
119. The biggest crypto youtuber with 717k subscribers says “shame on you, Cardano community” for talking so badly about EIP 1559 (the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal). Then in the same video he says he may tell people to sell their Ethereum for Cardano &amp; DOT if things don’t improve by the end of April (with a bunch of caveats). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1OdprEpHfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1OdprEpHfU).
120. Another youtuber with 587k subscribers posted a video called “Why I'm Dumping Ethereum For This Coin” and said that ETH would have “massive problems” if Cardano hits its deadline for smart contracts on mainnet.  He’s actually recommending some other coins that aren’t ETH or Cardano, but made his lack of confidence in ETH in the face of Cardano’s challenge very clear if Cardano achieves its goals. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p8LgjMQbyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p8LgjMQbyE)
121. Lark Davis (256k subscribers) released a video called “Don’t Buy Cardano” in which he lays out the devil’s advocate argument against Cardano and then responds to those arguments.  He finished by saying “I think that Cardano will prove the haters wrong this year…but...it will simply be a piece of the bigger picture of the cryptoverse.” [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-bB8gzUCMo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-bB8gzUCMo)  This followed a video a few days ago that seemed to identify the delay of Ethereum’s layer 2 scaling solution as “probably the biggest crypto fail of 2021”.  [https://youtu.be/QCo5egQmiG8](https://youtu.be/QCo5egQmiG8)
122. That’s a collective 1.56 million subscribers.  Of course, some overlap there. But, that’s a lot of potential viewers. It seems like the message being delivered to them is a lot of playing both sides of the fence. From my view, this is what it looks like when you hit a tipping point and the herd starts slowly capitulating on a consensus position.

Forex,Will the US ever issue a new currency to replace the USD as we know it?,"When the Euro replaced many over-inflated currencies like the Italian Lira back in 1999, the transition appeared to go over relatively smoothly, and the currency actually gained in strength since then.

Right now, the Fed is printing so much money that people seriously question the reliability of the USD. The Feds ability to raise interest rates is in doubt, due to the risks to the global economy as a whole.

The only solution to prevent runaway inflation may end up being having to halve the USD, or consider issuing a whole new currency that starts fresh. Could this be something implementable by the US government if/when they choose to do so?",finance

Bitcoin,Help me understand Bitcoin Economics,"I've read a good bit about Bitcoin, but there is one question that bothers me a lot:

**""Bitcoin fixes inflation"" &lt;- is this really true?**

*1. Fed conducts monetary policy*

In the economy as it is right now, the federal reserve controls the money supply using open market operations (monetary policy). If it wants to increase the money supply, they buy bonds from banks (gives banks more money) If it wants to decrease the money supply, they sell bonds to the banks (takes money from banks).

AFAIK, This is how the Fed ""prints"" money. By buying bonds from banks. Not using a printing press.

*2. Monetary policy helps mitigate recession &amp; control inflation*

AFAIK, we need this monetary policy because it helps control unemployment and inflation throughout the business cycle. There's a classic explanation from Ray Dalio's youtube vid on economic machine. Businesses need loans, banks give out loans, the leverage stimulates growth, economy expands. At some point, businesses need to pay back loans, and business growth stifles, economy contracts, potentailly to recession or panic.

If businesses and banks start using unsustainable amount of loans. They increase the interest rate (reduces incentive for taking out loans, therefore reduces money supply, reduces inflation) and limits expansion. The fed can also stimulate growth in a recession by lowering interest rates (increases money supply), and mitigating the contraction.

*3. Currently, we equate growth to inflation*

As we've seen, growth comes from loans. loans create 'new money' that businesses can use for growth. Creating this 'new money' inevitably increase the money supply, and leads to inflation.

AFAIK, the only way economy grows with deflation is if the country's production, usually through some innovation, creates more goods than is demanded, and purchasing power of the currency increases. But this is an ideal scenario, usually is not the case in a lot of countries. Most times, businesses need loans to grow.

*4. Bitcoin is deflationary.*

Yes, you can't create bitcoin out of thin air like the fed buys bonds from banks. The increase in supply will asymptotically reach an end, and there will be limited supply.

Limited supply + demand in the money(btc) market  = deflation.

**Expanding money supply is needed for economic growth, but Bitcoin has limited supply...**

5. Bitcoin as a ""solution"" to inflation (ignoring the tech or commodity view, just currency)

It's true that bitcoin is not deflationary. But this deflation seems different from the natural positive deflation the economy wants. The 'positive' deflation comes from the ecnomy's growth in production, and where businesses produce so much that they start lowering prices and increasing purchase power of the currency. On the other hand, Bitcoin's deflation is from its limited supply unrelated to economic growth.

Yes, current inflation sucks because increase in money supply devalues currency while appreciating asssets. This reduces purchasing power of the lower income class that owns less assets and enriches the upper class that owns a lot of assets. This sucks. Bitcoin does prevent this from happening which is good. But if money supply can not expand, how could the government stimulate economic growth?

***6. Central question:*** *can there by economic growth without expanding the bitcoin supply?*

There will inevitably be a period of economic slowdown where production slows and unemployment rises. If there is no way to incentivize loans in the bitcoin system (unlike the fed who can lower interest rates), there will be no solution to recover from a recession.

**Conclusion/TLDR:** In a decentralized system of wallets and bitcoins with no banks, and where there is no way to incentivize increase or decrease of money supply, there will be no business cycle of expansion and contraction. If we cannot create credit, economy cannot be driven forward. Then how can bitcoin be sustainable as a global currency?

(this was just a braindump of some things that bothered me. I would really appreciate if people can point out where I'm going right or wrong, and offer other perspectives. That would be really helpful!)",cryptocurrency

economy,Do taxes really pay debt?,"Recently, I came across an online resource that kind of made me re-think the whole debt debate, and I'm wondering if I'm having something wrong, so any comment on my argument would be appreciated:

If the US (or any economy) is consistently having fiscal deficits, yet consistently increases its debt, it naturally follows that the old debt isn't paid by taxes but by new debt. However, investors still see US Treasury Bills as risk-free, as they should. The Federal Reserve can always pledge to do quantitative easing which would incite investors to buy T-bills in case of an imminent default, and the proceeds of these bills' sale would save the country from defaulting. The risk of default thus shouldn't be accounted for in the treasury bills' interest. All of this means that the US would theoretically be always able to borrow new debt, but under the very important assumption that it won't cease to exist anytime soon, or it wouldn't be default-risk free. Now if all of that is true, why would the US not continue with its borrowing spree? Why would it not intervene heavily in the economy to ensure full employment for example? Would it even be immoral for the gov to have a fiscal surplus ? According to Kalecki's profit law, all else being equal, profit on one side equals deficit on the other. The US government's mandate is to serve its citizens, so if there's a surplus, it means the rest of the American economy (actually world, but American economy to some extent too) holds that ""deficit"" position. If the gov can always borrow debt away, if making a surplus immoral then?

I feel like when you find a huge glitch on a video game, so since I can't really see the breaking point of all this, I'm asking you !",finance

stocks,(3/30) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, March 30th, 2021-

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-tuesday-march-30.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stock futures fall after Dow record as yields jump

&gt; * U.S. stock futures dropped Tuesday as the 10-year Treasury yield hit a new 14-month high in early trading. The Nasdaq dropped Monday. The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell from the previous session’s record close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing at another record despite weakness in bank stocks caught in the fallout of the Archegos Capital Management margin call chaos. With two days left in March, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were sitting on solid gains for the month. The Nasdaq was tracking for a monthly loss.

*****

&gt; # 2. 10-year Treasury yield hits new 14-month high

&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield topped 1.77% early Tuesday, taking out another January 2020 high, as Covid vaccine rollouts and planned infrastructure spending boosted hopes of a broad U.S. economic recovery. However, the move also stoked inflation fears and put growth stocks, many of them tech names, under pressure because higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations.

*****

&gt; # 3. How Goldman and Morgan Stanley avoided Archegos losses

&gt; * In the Archegos meltdown, triggered by last week’s slide in shares of ViacomCBS and other stocks, Goldman Sachs avoided losses in the episode, CNBC’s Hugh Son reported. By the time Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and Japan’s Nomura said early Monday they unloaded positions on behalf of Archegos, Goldman Sachs and its Wall Street rival Morgan Stanley had already finished unloading their positions, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Archegos is a family office founded and by Bill Hwang, a former equity analyst at Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management.

*****

&gt; # 4. CDC chief warns U.S. headed for ‘impending doom’ in Covid fight

&gt; * The U.S. is facing “impending doom” as daily U.S. Covid cases begin to rebound once again, warned CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope, but right now I’m scared,” she said in an emotional, candid moment during Monday morning’s press briefing. Even as vaccinations accelerate nationwide, coronavirus hospitalizations are also climbing and falling fatalities are starting to plateau. Walensky urged Americans to “just hold on a little longer.”

*****

&gt; # 5. Biden tells states to reinstate coronavirus mask mandates

&gt; * President Joe Biden followed his CDC director’s comments by urging governors and local leaders who dropped sweeping mask mandates to reinstate their orders. While indicating that some states should wait to reopen their economies, he also condemned “reckless behavior” likely to spur more infections. “We’re giving up hard-fought, hard-won gains,” Biden said in Monday afternoon’s press briefing. “As much as we’re doing America, it’s time to do even more.” He said a failure to take the virus seriously “is precisely what got us in this mess in the first place” and could lead to more infections and deaths.

personalfinance,"Need help figuring out best way to maximize federal EV credit, can I increase my tax liability?","Hey guys, I'm typically a very frugal person who buys used cars for less than $10k.  Yesterday our 16y/o 200k mile car bit the dust.  For the first time it seems like buying a new vehicle might be the best choice for our family.

A little bit about my life situation.  Married, 4 kids 7yo and under, we have no debt.  Mortgage paid off, no CC debt, no loans.  Last year we made ~125k + 10k in capital gains, We put in ~32k to pre-tax contributions, our AGI was 101k.  I don't expect this to change much this year.   I also have ~100k in a relatively new brokerage account which has gained 26k in the last year, and another 60k between savings and checking.

We want to buy a 2021 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid.  The quoted OTD price is 37k.  The Pacifica Hybrid looks to still be eligible for the $7500 federal EV credit.  For under $30k (assuming I can get the credit) this seems like a great bargain compared to slightly used models.  My question for you guys is:  Is there anything I can do to make sure I receive as much of the rebate as possible?

I don't know if I fully understand the way these tax credits work, but it looks like I can only use the credit to decrease my tax liability at the end of the year if I owe in.  That is a problem (if you can call it that) as we had a $5100 return this year, and that was with me not paying any federal tax at all from my paychecks.  My wife paid in $5400.  If she stops paying in now, we would still likely still receive a small refund next year.

There are also to the Child Tax Credit this year, which brings the possible Child Tax Credit for us up from $8000 to $13800.  However half of that looks like it will be paid out during 2021, the rest will be applied to our 2021 tax return.  I'm not sure if this will add or subtract from our tax liability at the end of the year.

I planned on holding money in my brokerage account as long as possible, but I'm wondering if now would now be a good time to sell stock as it would add to my tax liability.  Is this a good idea, given I'd be doing it to maximize the amount I could get back from the EV credit?

Also, if the $7500 EV credit is available now, does that mean for sure I would be able to apply it to my 2021 taxes next year or is there a chance that it may disappear and all of this is for nothing?

Try not to burn me if I completely misunderstand the way any of this works.  I appreciate any advice that I can get as this will be the biggest financial decision I've made in the last 15 years.  Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Personal Loan to Boost Credit Score?,"I combed through these pages trying to find an answer on this but couldn't, so forgive me if this is a repeat question.

I own a house and am moving in a few months. Depending on where the house actually sells I will have between $70-$85k in equity, which should be enough to put 20% down on a new house.

My current credit score is hovering around 700...100% monthly payments, 0 derogatory marks, and 2 hard inquiries with one about to fall off.

That said, the one area my credit score is struggling in my credit utilization. I made some rough choices in my early 20s and am paying back credit card debt that I've whittled down to about $12k. My minimum payments are currently around $250 a month and I pay more than that each month. I also have some student loan debt and a small car loan, but both are manageable.

The question is this--is it worth it to take out a personal loan to pay off the CC debt to knock down my utilization? I tried applying for an increase in limit but since I don't spend on the card anymore the CC company told me I didn't need it. I could do a 4 year loan with a 10% interest rate, about 8% lower than my CC rate, and probably pay it of faster than the 48 months. I am confident my spending habits have changed and I do have cash on hand but want to save it for the move (we are moving long distance) in case anything comes up.

I am still going to need to apply for a mortgage and want to get as low of a rate as possible. In short: trying to get my score as high as possible by July or so and don't have the means to pay off $12k offhand...does a personal loan make sense to pay off the cards and boost the score, or should I just keep the cards as is and deal with having a lower score?

Thanks in advance--please let me know if there are any other details that would be useful in answering this question!",finance

My new salary with a non government employer is just north of $106,000 annually, new employer contributes 20% of my base salary toward my retirement (I am unable to contribute more). Additionally, all healthcare costs are covered by my new employer by providing a HSA with enough funds to cover the deductible. If it matters, my only loans are my home and my vehicle with $130,000 remaining balance combined. 
I have no other IRA, or other retirement plans/funds. All told after expenses/bills, my net funds are $2,500 each month which I use for “spending money”. With that being said, I went to a financial advisor to determine how I may best use the remaining $3,300 (after adding the $800 since I will be unable to contribute to my TSP after separation). I anticipated a recommendation for an IRA/backdoor IRA.

stocks,Question about Supplementary Leverage Ratio,"What are your thoughts on the SLR expiration? Are some people overreacting, or is there an actual cause for concern?

I was looking for the change in ratio back last March, and the change seems to be a 1% difference. 

&gt;The supplementary leverage ratio generally applies to financial institutions with more than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. It requires them to hold a minimum ratio of 3 percent, measured against their total leverage exposure, with more stringent requirements for the largest and most systemic financial institutions. The change would temporarily decrease tier 1 capital requirements of holding companies by approximately 2 percent in aggregate.”

However, I believe the quote below is why most people are counting on their to be major issues. It seems like banks would have been accounting for this over the past 9-10 days after the Fed's announcement, that there would be no changes and they would let the changes to the SLR expire.

&gt;The change would exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of the rule for holding companies, and will be in effect until March 31, 2021.

Source: [https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/84939/what-is-the-supplementary-leverage-ratio-and-why-is-it-important](https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/84939/what-is-the-supplementary-leverage-ratio-and-why-is-it-important)

In addition, it seems that larger banks may have always needed to keep a 5% SLR to deal internationally and also keep a bit of a buffer. 

Source: [https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/us-banks-sufficiently-capitalized-to-withstand-slr-expiration-22-03-2021](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/us-banks-sufficiently-capitalized-to-withstand-slr-expiration-22-03-2021)

I get the expiration could cause volatility in the bond market, which will have a direct effect on the stock market, but I do not see this as causing a market crash like 2008 like some have stated. I also think that most banks and hedge funds would account for this after the Fed's announcement (meaning this could be priced in). The Fed also seems open to change, if this has huge adverse effects.

Am I just completely missing something here? Sometimes Reddit feels like a ZeroHedge article, but then again, the mainstream media seems untrustworthy. I have seen some analysts asked about SLR expiration, and they have said that the change is minimal. On the other hand, some redditors are really calling for a market crash because of this. 

My positions since 2015 have been all in tech. I am seriously debating if pulling out for a bit would be good, to see what comes. This is a pretty big decision for me, as I am also sure I would have to account for cap gains tax in doing this when liquidating/rebuying in my positions. If I do this, I probably would rebuy back in to VOO/VTI instead. I know probably the most common suggestion will be cut from my winners and invest in VOO/VTI anyways. I just think I can do better than 10% per year returns myself. And from the articles I have read, the SLR rule was changed to allow banks to do more lending to households and businesses, so it seems like it would hurt the banks bottom line more than anything else in terms of revenue.",finance

CryptoMarkets,Watch SNL explain the multi-million dollar phenomenon of crypto art and NFTs in an Eminem parody,"A skit on Saturday Night Live took on explaining the concept of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, and crypto art.

The show breaks down the meaning of NFTs to a parody of Eminem’s “Without Me.”

In the skit, hosted by former cast member Maya Rudolph, Kate McKinnon plays US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. The former Federal Reserve chair presents to a college class when a student played by Pete Davidson asks her what an NFT is.

NFTs have captured the spotlight in recent months with eye-catching sales. In the past month alone, crypto art sales have brought in over $1 billion, according to NFT marketplace CryptoSlam.

Earlier in March, digital artist Beeple made history when he sold a crypto art piece for $69.3 million. Other high-profile figures including Grimes, Steve Aoki, and Jack Dorsey have also sold NFTs for millions of dollars.

NFTs operate as unique digital assets that can be bought online using cryptocurrencies, including ether and WAX. The tokens can include anything from art to sports highlights, cat videos, memes, and even individual tweets.

When you buy an NFT in most cases you’re not buying content, but rather a token that connects your name with the creator’s art on the blockchain. If someone buys an image or meme, they can own it on the blockchain, but they have no control over rights to its distribution.

ethereum,Incentive misalignment in staking,"Staking aligns the security needs of the Ethereum network with its minimum necessary issuance monetary policy, while trying to be fair to ETH owners. However, I think this alignment will be imperfect once withdrawals are enabled.

At the moment, the effective balance has an upper limit of 32 ETH. This was good to begin with, to prevent a small number of over-sized validators running the show. However, this prevents compounding of staked ETH over time. By itself this would be OK, but there is a way around that. For example, if withdraws are approved now, any staker having 32 validators with 33 ETH each can exit and re-enter with 33 validators of 32 ETH, increasing his returns.

This is a problem for two reasons:

1. It creates unnecessary friction, with big players constantly rotating their validators\*. It may also affect security, although it seems minor to me.
2. It gives an unfair advantage to large players, that can start compounding quickly, while single validator owners will have to wait until they accumulate 64 ETH.

The simple solution is to increase the max effective balance, for example to 320 ETH. This will solve the problem completely. It may also reduce the number of validators, but without affecting the staked amount. This may be good, making the network more efficient (there is no real reason for me to run several validators on the same computer) and maybe even allowing to reduce the 32 ETH limit.

\*The optimal rotation time depends on the number of validators and length of exiting and re-entering.

personalfinance,Larger down payment vs. larger monthly payments,"I'm buying a house for $1,450,000.

My household annual income is $205,000, no debts, very stable, and it's expected to increase to around $260,000 within the next 2 years. I also get about $40,000 of bonus per year. A child coming in a few months, so might need to save some money for daycare. 6 months emergency savings. Aside from that, we're quite frugal.

I have two options:

1. 20% down payment and a loan for the other 80% at 3.25%, for an estimated monthly PITI of $6,675.  This comes down to a DTI of 39%.
2. 25% down payment and a loan for the other 75% at 3.25%, for an estimated monthly PITI of $6,360. This comes down to a DTI of 37.2%.

Both are a bit of a stretch, but considering I'm in a HCL city, that I am certain to have an income increase within the next 2 years, and that I have found a home I really love with relatively low interest rate, I feel good about these numbers. The question is, which option is better?

My family is suggesting borrowing more money (option 1), making use of the low interest rate, and saving the leftover money for repairs/improvements in the house. I'm leaning more towards a larger down payment (option 2), which will save us about $300 in monthly payments, but with the down side of leaving us with very little left over money for repairs/improvements.

crypto,Preventing MITM between two microcontrollers,"Hello, I have recently started learning about cryptography for my small personal project and for extending my knowledge.

Basically I will have several MCUs - one secure MCU (sMCU - for communicating with flash memory), one less secure MCU (nMCU - for Bluetooth functionality) and one super secure MCU (xMCU) which will (somehow) ensure that those two other MCUs were not MITM'ed. And my need is to securely communicate between sMCU and nMCU.

That xMCU idea came after I've learned how asymmetric cryptography works and that public keys can be sniffed and communication hijacked.

I've also learned that I shouldn't save any secrets into the MCU OTP memory, because it's quite easy to read even with proper fuse bits set.

So, is there *any* way to achieve this? I don't have (yet) much knowledge about CA, but would it be possible to somehow involve root CA saved in my xMCU? Like I would pre-generate CA, some keys and then stored CA's public keys to my two MCUs.  
Then my idea was something like: generate new key-pair on xMCU, send public key to nMCU, nMCU would verify that received public key using pre-stored CA's public key and if it was right, I would generate another key-pair on nMCU, encrypt my new public key by received public key and send it back to xMCU.

I hope I've explained it well, because I'm getting a little lost in it, there's now too much keys now in my idea:D

I have $22,000 within my savings. The properties I have been looking into range between $200,000 and $250,000. At a 3% interest rate at 30 years, a mortgage could range between $831 and $1054. The property taxes would be near $250-$400 a month. Some HOA fees included as well. I would not be living alone, my roommate would be making the salary of an entry level baker on Long Island. I am not sure of what the typical salary of that position is on LI. My credit score is nearing 700.

I have been offered some assistance from my parents for the down payment/closing costs and in return we co-sign the lease. I would pay the mortgage, and reside on the property, then in the future when I decide to move out. We turn it into an investment property and rent it out. I am unsure if I should accept this offer.

Would under a 20% down payment even be accepted in this market? Should I be waiting for a housing market crash? And is my salary enough to afford the purchase w/ a roommate? What would the minimum salary required be to purchase a home in my area?

Thank you for your answers in advance, and I can answer any additional questions.",finance
gaming,"For those who don't know, here's a simple comprehensive list of the ""The Perfect Storm"" that caused the massive GPU and other chip shortage.","Hi. Quick introduction: I write for a popular Dutch tech website, and want to give you a simple synopsis of what's going in GPU-land. This is based on both my personal research and those of others. I've compiled the whole research into 15 reasons why we're in the situation we're in:

1. Naturally, COVID-19 happened. Fabs got shut down, and production had slowed down significantly. You have to keep in mind that both AMD and Nvidia were already producing their chips before the actual release. This is not the biggest issue, though.
2. Both Nvidia and AMD outsource their production to other fabs like TSMC and Globalfoundries. Unlike Intel (who has their own fabs and has readily available chips, albeit 14nm ones), they have to 'reserve' chip production 1 year in advance. When COVID happened, they immediately scheduled lower production for 2021, as they expected to have a large oversupply by 2021 due to an oncoming recession.
3. This turned out to be the opposite, as everyone started working from their homes and needed PC's and chips. So while production was lowered, the PC market was up by 20% year over year. Nvidia also mentioned that they ""expected high demand, but not THIS"" high
4. The RTX 2000 series was interesting, but not a big improvement over the Pascal (GTX1000) series. Raytracing was very niche and meant massive framedrops. Many people skipped this generation hoping that the next generation would be better
5. Well, RTX 3000 WAS very promising. And even though the performance per watt isn't actually THAT much higher than RTX 2000, they had a huge performance bonus over RTX 2000. The ""$500 RTX 2080 Ti"", as dubbed by Nvidia for the RTX 3070, got many people on edge on buying a new GPU.
6. Chinese New year happened. not a huge avalanche of problems, but it does slow productivity even more in this crucial period as fabs get closed in China.
7. Bots and scalpers. This is of course known by everybody here, but I want you to know: bots and scalpers are not the SOURCE of the chip shortage! They are merely a catalyst that drove up prices even more. We should rightfully be angry at them as PC gamers, but they're not at the root of the issue.
8. Shipping prices increased due to COVID-19. Both by water and air, prices rose by 100% in some cases, driving up costs
9. Trump happened, who tarrifed all graphics cards (among other things), making them about $50 more expensive.
10. According to multiple retail stores we've spoken (who shall remain anonymous by their request), the msrp pricing of the RTX3000 cards is ""almost an insult"", to where they would lose money on every card even if the distributor and retail store inquired 0% margin on the cards. This is also the case for AMD: when questioned about the RX6700XT, one retailed replied ""The msrp of $479 is nothing short of ""Utter madness"". We don't know if this is the case in all countries and/or cards, though!
11. Of course mining has to be mentioned, but what role did they play? Bitcoin and altcoins skyrocketed during the pandemic. This means that as long as mining remains profitable, that 'more cards = more better'. This means that demand is 'practically infinite'.
12. Simultanous release of the XBOX One X, PS5, and many Electric Vehicles need a huge amount of cutting edge chips. It has come to a point where car manufactures have shut down because they can also not get enough chips for their cars
13. You can't just ""ramp up production"". Even building a new fab takes a lot of time and A LOT of money.
14. Although it's true that every retailer is asking more money for the cards 'because they can', it is also the chip manufacturer who asks a lot more for these chips than previously thought.
15. Also a big one that almost no realizes, is backorders: let's say that (hypothetically) 20,000 people backordered an RTX3070 for $550 at Newegg. Newegg only had 500 in stock (again, hypothetically), so 19,500 are still in backorder. Suddenly, chip manufacturers and distributors are asking significantly more money for these cards, maybe costing Newegg as much as $700 to import. This means that in the next 19,500 cards they deliver, they lose $150 for each card.This is the reason that backordering is disabled almost anywhere (except for ludicrous prices), and that stores are asking so much for these cards to compensate for the loss. Not to give them too much credit, as I do personally think that they're now massively profiting as well from the situation.

To conclude, some questions you might have:

* Q: How long will this shortage last?
   * A: Simply said, no one knows. Although productions seems to return slowly to normal, there's no telling when prices will come down. Which brings us to the next question. It's reasonable to expect the shortage to go on into 2022.
* Q: When will prices come down to normal.
   * A: It's a real possibility that they will never truely come to normal pricing again. If people are willing to pay $900 for a $500 graphics cards at retail, they will keep selling it at $900 as long as there's demand.
* Q: Will a bitcoin crash solve the issue?
   * A: Probably somewhat, but that chance is very low. This is not investment advice!

They went to an accountant and the guy tried saying she owes $2.3K. Then came the COVID forgiveness bill for up to $10.2K. Her mom is now saying she cannot file her own taxes and she needs to wait to for her(the mother) to file her and her husbands first. Her mother also pocketed the stimulus money and only gave $500 of it to my girlfriend. What are our options here, she needs the federal aid to afford community college so the little she can work she can pay for her own living expenses, so she can’t file as an independent. However, her mom is withholding child support money, stimulus money, and now she’s withholding info on her taxes. We have copies of all her tax documents and to our understanding the other accountant hasn’t filled them yet.

personalfinance,Stuck between Renting or Buying.,"Hey everyone,

I am seeking advice on whether or not I should continue renting or buy. I am a 22M currently work in IT and make 50k/year ($3,320/month net) Midwest Area. I have 0 debt and have a credit score of about 740. 

Rent is \~$600/month (finished sisters basement). Live with my GF and dog. Made arrangements where GF pays half ($300).

I have lived here for 1.5 years but the basement has flooded twice (2-3 feet sewage water when raining) and has a lot of mold within the walls. My plan was to stay here for 5 years and save money but I don't think I want to live here anymore. I was originally looking to rent somewhere else ($950-$1200) is the norm in my area.

My brother is a real-estate broker and I sat down with his loan officer to get pre-qualified. They stated I can get up to $300,000 for a single family and $420,000 for 2 unit.

I told my brother I would like to wait to save more money before going through the actual preapproval process. Currently I have about $23K saved (Just started saving in Jan 2020)...I am saving about $2K a month and should have close to $40K by Jan 2022.

However, my brother is stating that in the one year I wait to ""save"" more money it will actually end up costing me more down the road when I buy a house. His reason being that interest rates will be higher next year. Since he is my brother, he is willing to give up his commission to help me purchase a property making the process cheaper for me...In return I send clients his way over time. The loan officer recommends I go FHA with %3.5 down and estimates I spend $6K-$10K in closing costs. 

My gut is telling me to just wait and save more money but I also don't know if I am passing up an opportunity to potentially save thousands over the 30 year loan. I have 3 options...either tough it out and stay in the basement to save more money, go rent somewhere nicer and save a bit less money, or own a home save a lot less money (barely $1k/month). My gf is able to contribute max $400 per month toward rent/mortgage and yes I am prepared to pay the full amount if we break up. 

Do you guys think it is a good idea financially to purchase a home in my current situation?

Thank you all in advance.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 30, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, March 30, 2021**

The broader market finished lower following another volatile session, but interestingly, many individual stocks that were beaten down in recent weeks surged. Market participants continue to digest the sudden unwinding in stocks by a large hedge fund and an elevated Treasury yield.

Yesterday, Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management’s family office and a so-called “Tiger cub” (the name Wall Street gave to protégés of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a “significant hit” following Archegos Capital’s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.

Despite the fear stemming from Archegos’ margin call, new data shows encouraging signs that the economy is recovering.  In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week’s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March — the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic.

However, concerns from market participants remained centered on the pace of economic recovery. With the recent passage of more stimulus and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to maintaining accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future may cause a rapid spike in inflation.

personalfinance,"I can't find a credit report or credit score for me, featuring is this a good way to gain good credit?","I, F 18, just filed my taxes for the first time. I have had two separate bank accounts so far since I was 16, only for debit and savings.
I was put on a credit card as a secondary card holder that my dad had when I was underage to help me build up my credit. He at some point took me off it. (I don't know when he took me off it, but the credit card did become pass due and is currently unusable and sold to a debt collector.)

I used credit karma and annualcreditreport.com to try and find out about my credit score. Is it possible that I can't get anywhere because I have no history of credit at all? Or should I go to my bank to see if they can pull a credit report and/or score.

I know next to nothing about what a credit report is, but I know having good credit is extremely important. I signed up for an ULTA credit card to hopefully give me some credit by purchasing a tiny thing with it and paying it off immediately. I've started working on getting student loans, when it comes time to pay interest each month, does keeping up with payments up my credit score a lot? I know it helps, but I don't know by how much.

Should I get a regular credit card? I'm not too familiar with the process of getting one, and that one personal finance class in high school didn't really stick with me. As a starting college student who is about to leave the nest, get federal student loans ( I qualified for the loans and accepted them through my school, I just need to finish the process.)

The only upside to getting a credit card (if I can) is for making small and essential purchases, especially since I know I wont have the money for it all the time due to working part time

 (ex: broke for two weeks, buy groceries during that time with credit card, get paid after then pay the card off.)",finance
CryptoCurrency,Letter to my younger self,"I've been in crypto since 2017... and over the years I've made every single wrong. If I could build a time machine and tell my younger self a few things, these would be it:

&amp;#x200B;

1. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME
   1. While money comes quickly in crypto, as compared to traditional markets, it goes away even faster. Your profit, and return on investment, is directly corelated to the amount of work, effort, research, and attention, you put into your investments. If you do it right, you will have a ton of success... if you don't, your failure will be epic in so many ways.
   2. Things might sound outlandish in crypto, but if you follow rule #1, you'll be able to figure out which have potential, and which ones are never going to reach the daylight. If someone is trying to make you ""Get in right now or you'll never be rich"" that's ok... let them have the glory of monster gains, there are plenty to be had that will fit your needs. I'll tell you below how to figure out which projects are good and which ones are not.
2. PEOPLE THAT TALK ABOUT BEING THE BEST IN CRYPTO ARE NOT
   1. If you run across someone that constantly says that they are the best (paid group leaders come to mind), they are far from it. The one's that are the best let their work talk for them, and they are more than happy to help others be successful for free.
   2. The biggest names in crypto are the ones that show you their work... If you have doubts about someone being who they are, just ask them to show you their P&amp;L. If they are genuine, they will do so without hesitation, if they are not... they will give you an excuse of why they will not. ""I only talk to real Alphas"" is not the right response to this.
3. YOUR NET WORTH IS NOT THE MEASURE OF WHO YOU ARE
   1. It is easy to look at some people turning $5,000 into $500,000 in 6 months and thinking that you should do the same... you won't. Some of these people are incredibly talented, gifted, and dedicated traders who spend 8-12 hours every day working on their portfolio. They have years of experience that makes them good at what they do... or they are just really lucky. Either way, you're not going to beat them until you become the same.
   2. Being successful in crypto means different things to different people. Set your goals early and gauge your success based on your goals. ""I want to be rich"" is not a goal, it's a dream. ""I want to make $100K this year using crypto"" is a goal... ""I want to be a millionaire in 2 years with crypto"" is a goal. Once you make it, figure out what you need to achieve it. You might have to educate yourself, you might have to practice trading on paper before doing it for real, you might have to lose some money before you make some. Just make sure you know what you're trying to do and what you need to do to get there.
   3. The biggest thing that will stop you from succeeding is your ego. Be humble, be smart, be the one that people want to be around. You'll get much further in life if you swallow your pride and admit your mistakes.
4. DO YOUR RESEARCH NO MATTER WHAT
   1. Whitepaper
      1. Does it make sense?
      2. Does it solve a problem that needs solving?
      3. Does it solve it better than anyone else out there?
      4. Is there direct competition, if so research them
   2. Management team
      1. Are they experienced in the field they are trying to enter?
      2. Do they have someone external helping them enter the field?
      3. Do they have experience leading startups or history of long term business development?
   3. Adoption
      1. Are people talking about it or is it so far off the beaten path that a handful of fanboys know about it... if it is latter, it's probably not a good projects
      2. Market cap and volume... a great sign of adoption is high volume as relative to the market cap... you want to see volume in the 10% of the market cap at least... So if you have a $10M market cap coin, at least $1m should be traded on a daily basis... $50M cap coin means $5M trading volume... etc. and majority of that trading needs to come from a large variety of wallets. You want big holding wallets, and small wallets to be moving the coin around... it shows a healthy ecosystem. To that note, small transactions on regular intervals are bots keeping the network alive... if that is most of the volume... MOVE ON.
   4. Execution
      1. Once you get into the coin, it is important to track the progress of execution. Everything might look good on paper but if they are not able to make their idea into a reality you will see a bunch of fluff news around but no actual implementation
      2. Crypto companies move at the speed of light. They knock out projects in weeks and months, not years. If you run across a team and project that has very few executed projects across a long time span, there is something wrong. Especially if they keep saying  ""Great things are coming"" ""Amazing stuff is about to happen"" What a traditional company does on 5 years, a crypto company can do in 1... so if they have been around for 4-5 years and they don't have much to their name, it's a shitcoin... you should move on
      3. Is there transparency with the investors? If the team is not willing to share their roadmap with the investors (YOU) and is reluctant to keep up with regular updates, then something is not right. Right teams will not only update people on the things that are going on but they will also engage the base on a daily basis to keep the interest alive. They need to be as excited about the project as you are.
      4. Check their GitHub. A good project will have some data on there and you will be able to parse through it to find out if it is legit or not. If it doesn't look right, you might want to move on (Credit u/klock23s)
5. RISK MANAGEMENT MATTERS
   1. Catching falling knives is dangerous. Don't try to be perfect on your entry and exit. No one can predict that. If you have done your homework, you'll know the entry range, the exit range and the right time to act. When you do, act with intent, not doubt.
   2. Diversification is going to be a key to your success. Invest in a wide variety of projects, different industries, different fields. No one industry or project will reign supreme so make sure that you cast a wide net.
   3. Don't put in more than 3-5% of your net holdings into any single project. That doesn't mean that you should ONLY invest 3-5%, no... it just means that any single project should have no more than 3-5% of your overall holdings.
   4. Use stop loss if you are swing trading, if you're not then have a number in mind where you're going to cut your losses. 98% of traders lose money, it's a simple fact... most of them lose money because they have crappy risk management. Even if you're in love with a project, you should know when to get out. Things change so re-evaluate often. More importantly, if you risked only 3-5% of your portfolio, even without stop loss, you're going to do OK.
   5. No one is perfect, if you are a trader that has a 70% strike rate (meaning that 70% of your trades are profitable) you will come across a losing streak where 5-6 of trades you have will be bad. Without risk management, those trades could wipe you clean and leave you broke. to recover a 50% loss, you have to make it up with 100% gain to break even... doubling your portfolio is not that easy. Most successful traders have a strike rate of 40%, so using proper risk management is key to their success.
   6. Keep a journal of all the trades, entries, reasonings, rationale. Part of risk management is knowing when you F-ed up... you won't know that until later and you need to know why. Learning from your mistakes is hard when you don't know what you did that was so wrong. (Credit: u/LittleAce7)

Remember, these are rules and not law. There are exceptions to every rule, but if you have too many exceptions, then you don't have any rules in place. So use caution if you decide to not follow one or more of these.

Most importantly though, remember that crypto and trading is not life. You only live once, and while you will fail often, make sure that you take the time and dedicate it to the things that are more important in your life. Spend time with your family, spend time with your loved ones and share with them the precious little that you have.

No mater what, even if you lose it all, don't give up. Lessons can be costly, but you will be stronger in the end. If you learn from your mistakes, I can guarantee you that you will come out OK in the end. Trust me, I've done it... and I'm doing just fine!

See you in the future.

stocks,Buy shares across the Atlantic,"There seems to be not only a rotation from growth to value stocks at the moment, but also one across the Atlantic. The DAX has again reached a high of 15000 points today. German shares are in contrast to American still relatively cheap. Also, unlike the U.S., there is no need to fear inflation in the euro area (the ECB could never raise interest rates here in the next five years) because the economy here is not yet running at full speed. 

An example of this would be that the Volkswagen share has risen sharply in recent weeks, mainly due to higher interest from American investors. Also, an American would have earned a 10% return last year just from currency effects if they had held European stocks. 

So my question therefore to the Americans among you: Do you have your eye on European stocks? Can you trade them? There are definitely interesting companies in Europe that you can still buy at a reasonable price. And for us Europeans it is quite natural to look around the US market (probably more than in Europe).",finance

Built our house two years ago.

At this point in time, I am fairly certain that our property value has increased in value to the point where we could potentially get rid of the PMI if we refinance. There are houses of similar size around us selling for $420,000-430,000, and they do not have extras that we have.

We were not having difficulty paying off the credit cards and paid more than the minimum each month, we just got the personal loan to get it paid off quicker and save money over time.

Our credit scores are about the same, and depending on the credit bureau they range from 675-720. No derogatory remarks. 

Not sure if there is any other information I should provide, but I am happy to provide additional info if needed. 

My questions are:
Will the recent personal loan interfere with getting approved to refinance?

When they calculate DTI, what all do they use to determine that? Will they use our current mortgage? 

Will my husband’s commission be used when determining our income? He has been with the same employer for almost 4 years. I remember having to answer extra questions about his earnings when we got our original loan, but do not recall exactly how they determined our income.

Given our credit, can anyone provide a ballpark estimate of a rate we might qualify for? Zip code is 79416. 

What are the average fees for refinancing a mortgage?

Given the information I provided, would it be worth it to refinance? Would a lower interest rate, in combination with potential removal of PMI, result in a payment low enough to recoup the cost of refinancing fees over the course of a couple of years?",finance

CryptoCurrency,I’ve Waited 60 Days To Post This.,"EDIT: Due to popular demand I’ve included a TL;DR it’s at the bottom.

I already know this is going to be an extremely unpopular opinion within this community so I ask that you please take the time to read this entire post before making judgment or commenting. Even if you know the answers to some of these please read the entire post. The information builds upon each other to explain some of the more advanced topics  near the end. 

A bit of context about myself before I go further. This post is going to explain to this community why Dogecoin is successful, and why it will continue to be successful moving forward. HINT: (the answer is not Elon musk or pump and dumpers). I’ve followed cryptocurrency since 2013. I’ve followed Dogecoin since 2016. A lot of the misconceptions I see in this community - I had the same opinions and thoughts as well. I actually sold my Dogecoin in 2018 thinking it was going nowhere and that it was a just a meme coin. I know where you guys are coming from when you make these claims. However, most of them are either misconceptions or flat wrong. I’ll explain why below. 

I support cryptocurrency in general, and whether this community wants to admit it - Dogecoin IS a cryptocurrency, and it is highly successful one at that. For the purposes of this post I will comparing Dogecoin to bitcoin (yes, I know there’s plenty of other cryptocurrency out there. I did this for simplicity and comparison the concepts still apply. I also did not address PoW vs PoS because I feel like that conversation is broad and being had in other threads here). 

The problem with Dogecoin is not the cryptocurrency itself - it’s that the majority of people are horribly misinformed. They find out about Dogecoin and take their biases and apply them Dogecoin before researching. This includes this community. R/cryptocurrency is a specific subset of society who has an extremely knowledgeable background in the technological aspects of cryptocurrency. You may personally have a solid understanding of the technology aspect of cryptocurrency but the reason why Dogecoin will be successful is based on economics, mathematics, social theory and statistics as WELL as the underlying technology. Each of these topics is extremely intricate and each field requires years to fully master. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won’t be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It’s been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. 

Now that I got that intro out of the way - I am going to explain each misconception regarding Dogecoin (which a lot of these also apply to cryptocurrency in general - again this is a pro-cryptocurrency post, not strictly a pro-Dogecoin only post). This is a re-write of another article I wrote tailored specifically for the Dogecoin community - since I know my audience; I removed some of the simpler topics. 
		
1. Question: What Is Dogecoin? And why Dogecoin?

Answer: Similar to other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin, finds itself with the support of hundreds if not thousands of individuals pushing for this currency to succeed. But why is that? Unless you have been absent from every social bubble, you may have heard of Bitcoin. For the purpose of this explanation, you will find that Bitcoin is not exactly an easy thing to equate to Dogecoin, but lets think about the criteria of a Cryptocurrency. For those of you who have been around for a while - you know very well that Bitcoin did not find its foothold overnight. In fact, it took several years. A lot of people fought tooth and nail for their belief in the coin. Crypto, in a nutshell, is a decentralized form of currency that finds its value in a combination of individual asset involvement, ease or difficulty in security of an exchange, creating a method of reliable, secure, trustworthy exchange, and other reasons. 

Initially as a purely meme-driven alternative to the likes of Bitcoin and Litecoin, Dogecoin in-fact boasts very low transaction fees and fast transaction times, very little network congestion, and most importantly, is designed to be used as a daily means of exchange, like your morning cup of coffee. Also, it is really fun, and who doesn't like the Dog ?!

Think of it like this: to exchange goods and services without currency, one must barter. I can barter a service (a haircut, for example) towards someone who needs a haircut, and in exchange they can barter a good or service to me. Currency then becomes an ""IOU"" (I Owe yoU) so that, if somebody needs me to cut their hair, they can give me an IOU for a good or service they control. When enough people begin adopting this, a centralized currency eventually takes hold. Crypto seeks to take this a step further and, instead of relying on building up a centalization in terms of valuable metals or debt, it is built up solely on the exchange of goods and services. Dogecoin, compared to other cryptocurrencies, finds itself in a strange position where the origins did NOT see it soaring to the moon in any situation. Funny how things can change in time. Dogecoin has pros and cons to it. Comparing it to other cryptos, it does not face a supply cap like Bitcoin does. It is not a directly equated asset, such as how Bitcoin can be attributed as a digital gold asset. Mining dogecoin is also much simpler (comparitively) and does not face difficulty spikes, a source of Bitcoin slow-down.

2. Question: Is Dogecoin just a meme or should it be taken seriously? 

Answer: We have all witnessed the power of a meme, the depths it can reach in society, especially in recent years. We have seen it many times before with video games, consoles, Oreos, or as of late even toilet paper... A meme has inherent value in the form of “widespread information”. A meme can spread an idea across diverse communities, and even entire countries literally overnight. This can bring about lasting effects on culture and society. If correctly taken advantage of, Doge can become the dominant meme currency of the internet, and amass real-world value just by being a popular, recognisable meme itself. This is where the saying “Dogecoin is the people’s coin” comes from. This is marketing 101. If your idea, or product is too complicated or not enough people know about then it doesn’t matter how technologically sound it is. Dogecoin have the best technology? No. Can it be improved upon. Definitely. In fact, the original developers have started working on the project again. An analogy I like to use is this. McDonald’s makes hamburgers. They have a clown as a mascot. A literal personification of a joke. Does make McDonald’s make the best hamburgers? No. Does McDonald’s have “value” in their industry? Undeniably so. So what does McDonald’s do correctly? They provide a cheap, easily accessible, and brand able product to the masses. Which is what dogecoin does for cryptocurrency. 

3. Question: Does Dogecoin have value or it just a s—-coin. How does Dogecoin and other cryptocurrency increase in price or decrease in price? 

Answer: Yes. Dogecoin has value. If didn’t have value then it wouldn’t be bought or sold at all. Anything can have value as long as enough people assign it value and agree to it. The value of any means of exchange is fundamentally driven by supply and demand. If two parties agree that X amount of asset A is roughly worth the same as Y amount of asset B, you effectively have established a market.  That’s why the US dollar and other fiat currency has value even though it just a piece of paper. The difference between fiat currency and cryptocurrency is that fiat currency is determined by centralized government and other underlying economical/market conditions. Cryptocurrency is meant to be a decentralized form of fiat currency. Now as to why the price changes from say .05 to .06 (random numbers using this as an example for explanation purposes. It is not exact) this value is driven primarily by supply and demand. We already know the supply of Dogecoin(will be covered later) so for the purpose of this the main driving factor in the change in price is demand. But the demand for Dogecoin isn’t just one person. It’s the entire group of people who own Dogecoin. So if at any given time lets say 10 people with 1000 Dogecoin want to sell. But only 5 people want to buy 1000 Dogecoin. This means that the sellers “value” Dogecoin less at its current price than buyers do. 5000 Dogecoin less. This changes to price from .05 to .49. The same applies if more people wanted to buy. Then the price would go from .05 to .051. An algorithm repeats the process over and over constantly updating the price. However that’s only one way to change the value. The best way to increase the overall value of cryptocurrency in the long run is by giving it utility.Which basically means that it can be used for something other than just buying at .05 and selling it .06. That is why you see people pushing to accept Dogecoin as payment. It further legitimatizes Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency and currency in general when companies allow you to exchange it for goods and services. Another explain not related to Dogecoin is NFTs. The concept of supply and demand as well as utility applies to all cryptocurrency. 

4. Question: Circulation of currencies. The importance of buying, selling, and holding - and the differences between them. 
		
Answer: To briefly explain this, a lot of people have been saying “buy and hold” or “I’m never selling!” - which in itself is great start. But there remains a lot of misinformation around the topic, for example that simply ""buying and holding "" will drive up the price indefinitely. Unfortunately, that is just not true. Buying, holding, and selling are all intricately connected with each other. ALL of those three states are essential for a (digital) currency to flourish. Holding does neither hurt or raise the value of the asset, but rather it helps to establish a baseline, which is also called ""setting a floor"". Those who have diligently kept on holding their coins, have allowed Dogecoin to stabilize at its current price point. Remember, this remains a huge gain from where Dogecoin has been just months ago. An active circulation of a currency is critical to establishing it as an effective means of exchanging goods and setting it up for long term growth.

5. Question: Why is Dogecoin always hovering between a certain value (example between .05 and .06) explaining floors and ceilings. How large owners/whales impact market conditions. 

Answer: The day to day trends of Dogecoin may appear strange at first sight, but those who continue holding onto their Doge are affecting or rather creating the floor. The floor is essentially the lowest value Dogecoin will drop to at current market conditions. A common floor that’s been set for about a month is .05. Why is this value the floor at current market conditions? Because when the majority (around 1 million new people came into Dogecoin in February) bought Dogecoin at .05. This means that there is a large amount of people own Dogecoin and purchased it at this amount. To protect their investment and keep from losing money they are holding their Dogecoin and refuse to sell it at a lower price. This keeps the price relatively stable - called a floor. However a person with a large supply of Dogecoin (what they call a whale) can impact this because they own so much, they can effectively sell off so much that the price goes below the floor. The price will tend to rise back up to floor because people are buying in at the lower price to dollar cost average (lower the average per they paid per Dogecoin) which is known as “buying the dip”. Now to address ceilings. A ceiling is a price - that once Dogecoin hits that value - a majority of people begin to sell. The most common ceiling is .06. Now, why is the the ceiling and not something like .1? Well because there’s a subsection of this community who day trade - which is basically trying to play the day to day prices by buying in low and selling high and taking the profits. The most common values to use are whole cents. I.E. .05, .06, .07. If someone bought at .05 and sold at .06 they made a 12.5% profit on their investment. As Dogecoin steadily gains momentum through increased demand and utility Dogecoin will start to bypass the ceilings and replacing the ceiling with a new floor. 

6. Question: Mining Dogecoin. How new Dogecoin are created and enter the market/supply. It there an infinite supply of Dogecoin being produced? Comparison to Bitcoin and the US dollar. 

Answer:
mining is the process of creating new cryptocurrency by solving a computational puzzle. mining is necessary to maintain the ledger of transactions upon which cryptocurrency is based. Miners have become very sophisticated over the last several years using complex machinery to speed up mining operations. Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate cryptocurrency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is in the in the 50,000 dollar range per coin and the price per Dogecoin is in the .05 range. with a realistic possibility of only reaching $288.60 at current market conditions (this will be covered later). That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin can be used like a dollar - cheap, spendable and easily replaced. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different.

7. Question: Should Dogecoin have a cap on its supply. What does having a cap mean, why do some cryptocurrency have a cap and other don’t? How does it affect the price? Will adding a cap increase the price per Dogecoin. Comparing bitcoin (capped) Dogecoin (no hard cap) 


Answer: - 
When people say they want a supply cap - what they are saying is that they want to place a limit on the total possible supply of Dogecoin. They point to bitcoin as having a cap, and since bitcoin has a cap, that must be why it is valued so high. Through scarcity. That is partially true, but it’s not because of the cap. The scarcity doesn’t come from having a cap, it comes from having a low supply and mining amount which reduces over time. Known as a bitcoin halving. 

Bitcoin and Dogecoin are two completely different cryptocurrency. Their supplies are different. Their utility is different. Having a cap does nothing in terms of the actual value of Dogecoin or bitcoin at the current moment. The cap only matters once that limit has been reached. The cap for bitcoin doesn’t happen until 2140. The price of bitcoin is due to the limited supply (18 million) relative to the global population, the bitcoin mining rate and bitcoin halving. All things that Dogecoin does differently. That doesn’t mean Dogecoin doesn’t have value. It doesn’t mean Dogecoin is infinite. It just means that they’re different. Dogecoin has a current supply of 128 billion, which is why the price is lower and harder to change in value. It is easier for bitcoin to rise $1 in price because the supply of bitcoin is so low and the supply of Dogecoin is so high. It doesn’t mean that Dogecoin can’t rise in price - just that it’s harder. 

Adding a cap won’t automatically increase the price because the cap isn’t the problem. You can’t reduce the 128 billion supply (unless you burn them or lose them). They already exist. People get confused because they don’t understand inflation and continual growth and why they are necessary for Dogecoin to a successful cryptocurrency based on the core parameters made when Dogecoin was created. They also don’t understand infinity. Dogecoin is not infinite. It can never reach infinity because infinity isn’t a number. As long as Dogecoin exists and is being mined it is not infinite. 

To further this point the original developers of Dogecoin have already stated that they will NOT be adding a cap. Adding a cap fundamentally changes Dogecoin at its core level and they’re just not going to do it. Here is the direct answer from the Dogecoin developers: “A, block reward is needed to secure Dogecoin network in a decentralized manner. Dogecoin is merge-mined with Litecoin, and that makes it somewhat secure against PoW attacks. But if Dogecoin reward will be too low, some Litecoin miners may drop Dogecoin, and our security will suffer. From this point of view, bigger reward is better. If you propose reducing the reward over time, you must also propose a solid way to keep Dogecoin secure. Now about the economic aspect. Current Dogecoin issue rate, taken relative to current total amount, is low, it's almost nothing compared to all the other factors that affect Dogecoin value. If you look at Dogecoin price chart since the introduction of current issue schedule, you will not see effects of ""inflation"" for all the wild price changes caused by other factors. And this already low issue rate gets even smaller over time, compared to total amount of dogecoins. The only real reason for these ""cap"" proposals is trying to ""sell"" Dogecoin to investors under the premise of possibly increased scarcity in the future. In my opinion, we don't need to try to appeal to investors. Dogecoin value will be increasing because of strong community and increased usage. And the fact that Dogecoin value increases is already enough for investors to jump in and increase it even more.”
You can read the full response to this directly from the developers here on their GitHub 

Even if they DID add a cap it would actually be LESS beneficial for Dogecoin as a currency. 

Here’s some Basic economics explaining why. Inflation and deflation are common economic terms used to explain the change in the inherent value of a currency. This means that that 1 US Dollar today does not have the same value or “worth” as it did, for example, in 1950. Inflation is a situation of rising prices in the economy. A more exact definition of inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level in an economy. Deflation on the other hand occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%, that is a negative inflation rate. While inflation reduces the value of a currency over time, a sudden deflation of a currency increases its relative value. This would allow more goods and services to be bought than before with the same amount of currency. Deflation can be a factor in leading to a recession and also result in a deflationary spiral.

Common follow up question:
What does all this mean with regards to cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin versus Dogecoin?

Well - Bitcoin is stagnant or deflationary over time, while Dogecoin is inflationary overtime. This is due to the way they are architected and mined, and how new coins are added into their respective markets What gets misunderstood is which one is “better” or rather ""the lesser evil"". Dogecoin doesn't need a supply limit like Bitcoin, because in the long run it will be much easier to exchange Dogecoin for goods and services, than with other crypto currencies or regular currencies for that matter. Bitcoin will continue to skyrocket in price because less and less are being mined. Bitcoin is like gold. Dogecoin is like the dollar. Bitcoin and Dogecoin have their pros and cons. Our current money is backed by signatures on debt contracts, not on real values. But it works, because we believe in it, even if it will be our downfall if it continues like this. People get confused because they think inflation is a bad thing, when in fact it is actually beneficial in small quantities and beneficial to the longevity of a currency.

Currencies have inflation - commodities don’t. Dogecoin is better suited to be a currency than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is better suited to be a digital version of gold. That doesn’t mean one is better than the other - just that they are different. 

8. Question: Is a Dogecoin increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Could and will it potentially happen? What would change if it does happen? How high could Dogecoin realistically rise in price? comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. - Explaining Market Cap, what it is, what it means, and how it’s used. 

Answer: Despite not having a fixed or capped supply, yes, the value of dogecoin can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market in the future. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.

Mathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply
MC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply)

Market cap just means how much the total supply is “valued/worth” at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply.

I see people saying how insert x cryptocurrency has a current market cap of $y billion dollars then they find out what the market cap needs to be and say if this many people put this much money into the system then the price will rise to that value. The most common example is that for Dogecoin to be $1 it would have  $128 billion market cap. People then say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.

Super simple right? The only problem is: THAT’S NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.

Simply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap. The only two variables that change the market cap are price. And supply nothing else can change the market cap.

Market caps REAL use is a comparison tool. It’s used to compare how successful a market is compared to other markets. I will provide an example below. 

The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is $6,077,915,837 ($6 billion). If Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of about 128 billion dollars ($1 x 128,495,957,919 circulating supply). Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency) currently has a market cap of approximately $898,761,019,333 (~ $900 billion). This means that at $1, the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is about $2,000,000,000 (2 trillion), thus the market cap of the US currency is $2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach the equivalent market cap ($2tn / $128bn), the price per Dogecoin would have to be $15.60, thus matching the entire short-term US currency (M0 money supply in economics).

This is definitely not impossible, but it is highly highly improbable to reach such value any time soon. If that were to ever happen, it would take years. Now, the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (short-term liquidity / paper) currency is $37 trillion. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value of Dogecoin would have to be $288.60. If it was valued any higher than that amount, Dogecoin would be ""worth"" more than the entire world’s short-term liquidity currencies combined. Keep in mind - It could technically mathematically speaking go past this point, but what that would mean is that the economy behind Dogecoin would be stronger than the entire global economy of today. It’s not impossible- but is is highly unrealistic to pass that point. 

You can use this same comparison tool and apply it to any cryptocurrency of choice to find “realistic” values of the price per coin. It’s just important to remember that MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there’s 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is “worth” 6 billion at the current price. When I originally wrote this people got confused so I wanted to clarify that.

9. Question: Pump and dump vs long term growth and the difference between them. Is Dogecoin just a pump and dump meme coin.

- so I want to side bar here really quick. Dogecoin is not simply a pump and dump. The graphs speak for themselves. Pump and dumps don’t last months. Being part of the cryptocurrency community I’m sure you all have experienced REAL pump and dumps and this argument can finally be put to rest. However, I still want to provide an answer to this misconception because I still still it lingering around. 

Answer: ""Pump and dump"" is a form of securities fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Pump and dumps are illegal. While a subset of people were trying to pump and dump Dogecoin, the legitimate community is focused its long term growth and stability which is achieved through the rest of the topics addressed here

Sustainable Growth is how cryptocurrency flourish. The trends over the past few months show that the true Dogecoin supporters are focused on sustainable growth - not pump and dump or short term gain.


10. Question: Elon Musk - Is he important for Dogecoin? The impact of celebrities and big business supporting Dogecoin Celebrity/Influencer Involvement

Answer: Elon Musk, Mark Cuban
As many may know, Elon is highly involved when it comes to “meme culture.” we can see Elon has tweeted several times concerning “doge,” reposting memes found from Reddit, as well as concerning himself with the ripples of the recent stock news. Mark Cuban, another notable wealthy, down-to-earth, community-involved individual, has recently mentioned “#dogecoin” specifically and actually began allowing his NBA basketball team to accept Dogecoin for payment. Regardless of whether these people have positive intentions towards $DOGE or not, their mention carries weight and public opinion and is a good assumption that new eyes are looking at us as a result. It should be noted that they have tweeted neutrally to positively towards $DOGE, not indicating a full-send support but they clearly are not talking down the possibilities.

Big business allowing Dogecoin to be supported as means of exchanging goods, and people like Elon musk supporting and backing this cryptocurrency are important to proving its value and legitimacy. 

However, it is important to remember that this is not the sole determining factor in the price. The price is determined through supply and demand and utility. Elon musk and other major high profile individuals doesn’t control that, but they do help 

11. Question: What is a 51% attack? Can it realistically happen? What are the implications if it were to happen?

Answer: A 51% attack refers to an attack on a blockchain most commonly bitcoin. Such an attack is possible but still just hypothetical. It requires group of miners to control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or computing power.

The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control of the network, meaning they could double-spend coin. 

They would almost certainly not be able to create new coins or alter old blocks. A 51% attack would probably not destroy bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency outright, even if it proved highly damaging.

You may have seen an article going around talking about the 51% attack and why it will cause Dogecoin to go to zero. Regarding the 51% Hashrate attacks, Yes, they are real, and have been ever since cryptocurrencies aka Bitcoin started. The article even mentions an example. Now, if a large group of people with a lot of resources very effectively coordinated, they could indeed make a 51% attack on Dogecoin happen. But not just on Dogecoin, but also on many other, small cryptocurrencies. This is nothing new, this has basically been known for the last 10+ years. But the author of the article needs clicks, so there goes the horror-scenario headline... Possible - yes, absolutely. Likely, not very. Unless you have a large sum of people with a few resources each coordinating perfectly - that is in my honest opinion very unlikely - you could have governments, very large hedge funds, or maybe Elon Musk build a vast array of mining farms and do said 51% Hashrate attack. But again, that effort would only be worthwhile if those groups had a definite interest in destroying Dogecoin. There are probably other cryptocurrencies that would be more interesting from that perspective, such as litecoin. Of course, despite the sensationalist headline, for them clicks, the author covers their own backside by stating the following:
""In conclusion...Pretty much all the crypto besides Bitcoin and Ethereum are at material risk of a 51% attack, and it's not just a theoretical risk."" This problem is not tied specifically to Dogecoin, but to every single cryptocurrency. Now let’s do some math to calculate exactly how much it would cost in order to succeed in pulling off a 51% attack on Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a hash rate of 299.17 TH/s or 299,170,000 MH/s. If you were to use an RTX3090 which costs $2,000 US Dollars, and has a hash rate of 121 MH/s. You would need 1,260,964 RTX3090 at a cost of $2,521,928,926 dollars ($2.5 billion). Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. 

12.. Question: There is a lack of developer support for Dogecoin. The technology is outdated. Why would anyone come work as a Dogecoin developer when there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies? 

Answer: The short answer is there is already development being done due to recent weeks bringing Dogecoin back into relevancy. the original Dogecoin developers have already began working on the project with the new found support of the community and companies accepting Dogecoin as payment. Can the technology be improved? Yes. Is it being improved as we speak? Yes. 

13. Question: if all of the above information is true why are so many people trying to discredit Dogecoin as legitimate cryptocurrency? 

Answer: I already explained this through the answers above. Mainly because people are misinformed. No one person has all of the knowledge of all aspects of a cryptocurrency so when someone is attacking Dogecoin on why it won’t be successful is probably misinformed. Dogecoin is already successful. It’s been proven already. The question is HOW successful. Which nobody really knows the answer to. Others will try to discredit Dogecoin for the exact same reason they try to discredit cryptocurrency in general. it is novel and has gained popularity. Crypto Is a new(ish) technology and a lot of people don’t understand how it can be used. People also discredit it because it’s a “meme”. Which as established above has nothing to do with the usefulness of the cryptocurrency itself. 

14. Question: Will cryptocurrency replace fiat currency? Will a cryptocurrency be the next world currency? 

Answer:  (this is the visionary in me) 
Cryptocurrency is in its infancy. People don’t realize the worldwide paradigm that is taking place right in front of our eyes. People are starting to see that traditional fiat (paper) currency back by centralized governments and debt are flawed and can be improved upon. Cryptocurrency is the future whether the people who can’t see it or try to disagree believe it or not. It’s inevitable. I knew it was inevitable in 2013 when I first heard about Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency will replace fiat currency in the future. Will it be Bitcoin? ETH? Dogecoin? Ada? Some other cryptocurrency that doesn’t exist yet? I don’t know. Cryptocurrency is taking the financial sector by storm - odds are there’s going to be a few key cryptocurrency for each aspect. - ones replacing fiat, ones replacing precious metals, ones replacing the banking system through deFi. Honestly getting into cryptocurrency now is like supporting the internet in the 80s - nobody knows where it’s going to be in 30 years.

If you read the entire thing, thank you. If not here’s the TL;DR - 

No, Dogecoin is not the most amazing crypto in the world, but it does have a niche role and shouldn’t be hated on by this community the way it is. 

•	⁠The meme aspect of Dogecoin has no
Impact on its viability as a cryptocurrency. It’s actually a benefit that helps in marketing it to the masses.

•	⁠Don't treat it as an investment that will rise in price dramatically like Bitcoin. Just because the price per coin is low doesn’t make it a bad crypto. 

•	⁠Stop hating Dogecoin if you haven’t done your research. There’s actually a lot of benefits if you took the time to learn. 

•	⁠Each cryptocurrency has its pros and con and Dogecoin is useful at what it does. As a currency to
Exchange goods and services as well as helping to educate new people about crypto.

We're all in this together. Be a crypto maximalist; don’t bash a coin just because it does things differently. Embrace novelty. 

I hope I was able to change the minds of least some people of this community.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Long vs Short term capital gains scenarios,"I am curious about two scenarios on what would be categorized as long term vs short term capital gains. In particular, I am interested in knowing the tax laws for trading shares from the same company at different times throughout the calendar year. This is impactful to know if, for example, I want to average down on a particular stock. 

For each of the scenarios, the following applies:

* I buy 100 shares of stock-x on Jan 1, 2021
* I buy 50 more shares of stock-x  on Aug 1, 2021  


**Scenario 1**

* I sell 80 shares of stock-x for profit on Feb 1, 2022

**Scenario 2**

* I sell 130 shares of stock-x for profit on Feb 1, 2022

&amp;#x200B;

Based on these scenarios, how will my capital gains be categorized? Aspects I'd like to know are if my capital gains will be partitioned into long term *and* short term tax rates? Or does it only matter the date of my original purchase into stock-x (meaning everything after a year of my *first* purchase is considered long term)? **I am mostly interested in federal tax rates, but I live in California (which taxes capital gains), so if anyone knows if California handles these capital gains scenarios the same way, please share your info.**",finance

# LITTLE GUY BECOMES MARKET'S BIG MOVER

**By** **Tim SmartFebruary 2, 1999**

Cathy Wilkinson and Vinnie Cunning are two of the reasons the American economy is on fire. Both are avid investors in the stock market -- Wilkinson a novice, Cunning a veteran -- but each shows the way Wall Street has evolved in the past couple of decades from a province of the wealthy to a marketplace for the masses. Their experiences and behavior show how far the market permeates daily life for many people, so much so that now chatting about stocks has replaced talk about real estate as the topic du jour of the middle class. ""It's everywhere, it's at the water cooler, it's in the bars, it's at the beach,"" said Fairfax financial planner and investment-guide author Ric Edelman. ""When you turn on sitcoms, there's starting to be jokes about mutual funds. 

There is definitely a cultural change going on. Ordinary Americans are beginning to recognize wealth is within their grasp."" Just ask Wilkinson, a 45-year-old mother of four in Dewey, Ariz., who listens to the morning market commentary on National Public Radio while driving her children to school in her 1999 Volkswagen Beetle. The children regularly check their mother's portfolio on the personal computer and offer tips, recently egging her on to buy shares in Walt Disney Co. ""I have a pretty specific goal in this E-Trade account,"" she said, referring to the online brokerage she uses to buy and sell stocks. ""Any money made is to go to their {private-school} tuition. That was my lofty goal when I set it up."" 

A market novice who began buying individual stocks a month ago, Wilkinson boned up on finance by reading specialty periodicals such as Barron's and watching financial news networks such as CNN/fn. ""In reading, I was convinced the stock market was a good place for our money,"" said Wilkinson, who has about $75,000 invested. Her major holding? E-Trade. Like many new to online investing, Wilkinson concedes she initially became obsessed with surfing the message boards on the Motley Fool, an Alexandria-based company that is a modern-day equivalent of the village green for electronic investors. But lately, she said with a laugh, ""I've really been cutting down. I check in in the morning and then in the evening."" 

Alexandria mailman Cunning, on the other hand, doesn't even own a personal computer and he lacks cable television, too. But he does enjoy watching ""The Nightly Business Report"" on public television each evening. Cunning, 58, has been investing steadily in the market since the early 1980s, religiously putting the maximum $4,000 annual contribution for himself and his wife into individual retirement accounts, as well as contributing to a federal savings plan. He owns a broad array of mutual funds, from high-tech to large-cap growth stocks. He's had his share of losses, but the overall trend is up. ""From 1982 up to and including 1999, I have never missed a contribution and as I sit here and talk to you, my IRAs are over $300k,"" said Cunning, who mostly favors mutual funds but has also taken to some individual stocks. 

Economists and market experts say investors like Wilkinson and Cunning -- not the so-called ""smart money"" on Wall Street -- are the reasons behind the greatest bull market in history and, in part, what is already the longest domestic peacetime economic expansion ever. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan may fret about inflated stock values, questioning whether they reflected ""irrational exuberance,"" as he did two years and 3,000 points ago in the Dow Jones industrial average. But the 43 percent of adult households that now have money invested in stocks are having too much fun to stop. Even Greenspan may be softening, noting as he did Thursday that there is some economic logic behind the current frenzy in Internet stocks. Greenspan compared the Internet stock boom to a lottery, in which the size of the potential jackpot induces bettors to buy tickets -- despite the fact that most ticket holders will lose money. 

The trend of populist investing has been evolving for some time, starting with the removal of fixed commissions on stock trading in the mid-1970s, and gaining steam with the development of tax-advantaged retirement plans such as the IRA and 401(k) in the 1980s. But it picked up speed with the advent of affordable and accessible computer technology and now is on afterburn with the expansion of the Internet into everyday life. ""Without the Internet we wouldn't be able to do this stuff,"" said a 53-year-old worker for a District-based international organization who did not want his name used because he trades at work. The World Wide Web is full of online brokerages that offer trading costs as low as $8 a pop, or about one-tenth the amount full-service brokers used to charge. ""We all thought we could never invest against these professionals,"" the investor said. ""Now we're more skeptical."" 

There are lots of ways to measure this explosion of interest in the market among ordinary people, but a few statistics paint the picture: The number of investment clubs sanctioned by the National Association of Investors Corp., in which people of like interest place equal amounts of money into a pot to play the market, has doubled in the last three years to about 37,000, representing around 700,000 individuals investors. Assets under management at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., the company that made the discount stock brokerage business respectable, reached $491 billion at the end of last year, a 39 percent increase in 12 months. The company has added 1.6 million new accounts in the past two years, bringing the total number of Schwab accounts to 5.6 million. In the fourth quarter, 61 percent of all Schwab's daily trades were conducted online, up from 41 percent a year earlier. 

In 1985, there was $105 billion invested in 401(k) accounts. At the end of 1997, the number was close to $1 trillion. The number of companies sponsoring plans for their employees, meanwhile, rose fourfold to 267,000. Nearly a third of the plans have average balances exceeding $50,000. In 1990, investors poured $12.8 billion in new money into stock mutual funds. By 1997, the most recent year for which data is available, that annual flow of cash into equity funds had hit $231 billion. Behind the numbers are real people, with real aspirations and apparently an almost limitless faith in the power of stocks to make them rich. It's a dramatic shift in sentiment from earlier generations, who lived in the shadow of the Great Depression and were largely indifferent to Wall Street. 

""For a long time, there was the specter of 1929,"" said Thomas O'Hara, chairman of NAIC, the investment association. ""You had parents and grandparents telling kids not to invest in the stock market. We think, probably starting around 15 years ago, that has run its course."" The thirst for stocks is even driving the economy, powering a binge of consumer spending that has been rising at a rate faster than income growth and producing the surprisingly robust 5.6 percent growth in national economic output, or gross domestic product, in the fourth quarter of last year. In fact, some market gurus and economists now half-jokingly say the market is the economy. They may just be right. While the nation's GDP is around $8 trillion annually, the current value of the stock market exceeds $14 trillion. ""People have become owners of the system,"" said Dan Carper, the partner in charge of marketing at Lord, Abbett &amp; Co., a New York money management firm. 

This ""democratization"" of the market, as some call it, received a huge boost from the spread of IRAs, 401(k)s and other retirement accounts over the past two decades. They enabled companies to turn over to many workers much of the responsibility for building retirement nest eggs, turning employee At the same time, direct grants of stock, or options, have become a more common form of employee compensation. Once a perk mainly confined to Silicon Valley start-ups, options are now enjoyed by tellers at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis and shipyard workers at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia. As people of all ages become more aware of the stock market, they become more comfortable with its risks, analysts say. 

Along with investors under age 30 who are too young to remember the last protracted downturn in the market (a quarter century ago) are the baby boomers, many scrambling to make up for lost time. ""Baby boomers are the first generation ever looking forward to retiring at 70 and lingering around for another 25 years,"" said Deutsche Bank Securities economist Edward E. Yardeni. This herd-like behavior, of course, scares the daylights out of many long-term professional investors and economists. When the Dow fell nearly 20 percent last summer, some of them saw it as a much-needed correction that would bring investor expectations back down to earth. ""This has been the best market of all to say, I can do it better on my own,' "" said John Markese, president of lthe American Association of Individual Investors. ""But this market is going to go sideways and even down for a while and these people will fall off in droves."" 

But so far, the individual investor has hung tough -- and behaved in a way that continues to confound the experts. Last year, after a period that economists classified as the worst financial crisis in a half-century, the Dow recorded its third consecutive double-digit annual increase. ""I think we're really just at the tip of the iceberg with the impact the individual investor is going to have on the market,"" said Mike Riley, who recently sold a golf course in Dayton, Ohio, for a handsome profit and is now investing $50,000 of his money in stocks of companies such as Dell Computer Corp. and Yahoo Inc. ""There's a whole different group of people out there."" They include people like Cathy Wilkinson, whose first month in the market was marked by a wild ride with Internet and other high-tech stocks. Showing the faith that is characteristic of the new breed of individual investors, Wilkinson said she'd stay the course if the market crashed. ""I'd still hang in,"" she said. ""I don't think I'd sell anything right now."" Furthermore, she said, what happens in the market isn't going to fundamentally alter her economic outlook or behavior, she said. ""I don't think it will change the amount of shoes I own.""

personalfinance,Planning to move from the US to Canada and go back to school. Is this a sound plan?,"I graduated with a BS 4 years ago and plan to go back to school in September. I will likely be in a 2.5 year program. I have just under $130k in student loan debt, but do not plan to go into any more debt. I'm moving from a really expensive city to a very affordable city to be with my partner, who will be finishing his Master's degree in the fall. I plan on getting an MA in Economics and although I anticipate an initial pay cut since I make $71k right now in the US, my lifetime earning potential should be higher.


I refinanced my private loans last year and got my interest down by almost 3%. My rate is 4.61% (which is around the average for all my loans, but the bulk of my loans are private at $108k). I plan to refinance again as I qualified for 2.99% APR. I plan to defer my student loan payments during grad school.


Currently, I have $45k in a high-yield savings account (well, high yield pre-pandemic) and should have between $50-55k or so when I start school. On top of this, I have $24k between two 401k accounts. I don't plan on touching this unless absolutely necessary and I'm not sure how I should deal with this money (roll over to a Roth account, transfer it to a Canadian account, etc.). I plan to pay for all of my tuition expenses out of pocket. TBD as to whether I'll get financial aid, but I've saved enough money to pay for it all out of pocket. I haven't been paying my federal loans since May and plan to refinance these since I'd get a better rate, plan to stay in Canada permanently, and am refinancing with a company that offers pretty generous deferral and forbearance if anything unexpected were to come up.


Some other major expenses are going to be appliances and furniture which I'll split with my partner since his roommate owns most of the furnishings in the apartment.


What is the best way to plan for these few years without income (save for an internship which will offset the cost of my unexpected qualifying semester)? Is this a sound plan in general, to stop paying my student loans until I graduate? 


Should I put aside extra money in my budget each month or rather budget in small payments toward my loans to avoid insane interest accrual?


Also, is there a best way to go about transferring my money from USD to CAD? The exchange rate is worse for me than it was a year ago. Should I just exchange money as I need it (say once per month), or is it likely that this will keep trending not in my favor for the next few years? To put it in perspective, $50k in USD is worth ~$63k today. In January last year, it was worth $66k. My estimated budget is around $1250 CAD per month as of now so that's about a $100 per month difference.",finance

stocks,"Thoughts on FUTU, a Chinese online trading platform","I've been following FUTU for a while, and its really starting to pique my curiousity. It showed up on my radar in January after I saw it go from $40 to $70 in 2 weeks. That's pennystock kind of movement and it scared me to get in as I wanted to wait for some consolidation. Well, consolidation never came and it rocketed to a peak of $191 before pulling back in the February-fuck-fest that all growth stocks hit.

FUTU's history is interested as it was only listed on NASDAQ on March 2019.

FUTU offers brokerage service provider and is transforming into an all-rounded online financial services platform integrating trading, wealth management, market data and information, social collaboration and corporate services.

The CEO of FUTU was the 18th employee of Tencent.

The shareholder letter is really good:
https://ir.futuholdings.com/static-files/987fd24a-8db0-4126-b267-9a03f397f968

*Sidenote: why the fuck US interest rates would affect a Chinese trading platform, I'll never understand....*

So I started to look into this company. First off, they're expensive. Their PE is 107 with a PS of 40. If you valuations don't mean anything to you, then you haven't learned anything from February's pullback. But their growth may quickly drive down their PE and PS. They are expanding globally, outside of China and Hong Kong. 

They posted earnings on March 26:
https://ir.futuholdings.com/financial-information/annual-reports

Ironically, their earnings were great, but their stock still tanked. I have a suspicion they tanked 15% because of Archegos fuckery more than anything else. But I can't prove this. Chinese stocks as a whole got decimated on March 26.

Their YoY revenue growth was 281% with YoY triple digit growth for 4 consecutive quarters. Revenues were up 211% YoY. With trading platforms, the number of users matters a lot, and their users grew 60% YoY.

They posted a USD$170M profits on USD$427M of revenues, which gives them a net margin of 40%. Their gross margin is closer to 75%, which is very impressive. Their revenues have grown almost 3x YoY since 2016.

Their growth and revenue is very impressive. Comparing to what SQ and IPOE/SOFI offer, FUTU is a very impressive Fintech specifically around growth, revenue and margins.

With that said, I can't find any projections for 2021. With a PE of 107, if FUTU maintains triple digit growth, I think its easy to assume that their stock price will easily make its way to $200. Their forward PE is targeted at 30, which is low when compared to all the other overvalued companies we're seeing recently.


I think the biggest threat to FUTU right now is CPP regulations. They call it out in their 10k, that the are not an accredited securities dealer in China for Chinese stocks. Given the recent involvement of CPP, I think the looming specter of the PRC Ban-Hammer will be ever present. But the leadership of FUTU seems friendly to CCP and will bend the knee when necessary.


Does anyone have any other input on FUTU?

**tldr** I think FUTU is trading at a discount right now because of the recent Archegos shenanigans and growth stock beat down. But given that they're based in China and targeting expansion into SEA, I think FUTU is a great high growth and volatile company worth investing. They will live and die by their growth numbers.",finance
personalfinance,A cautionary tale about 401K loans,"**UPDATE - Prudential just called and said that the loan will not default. Thanks everyone for the suggestions and support.**

I know that most everyone knows that you shouldn’t take a loan against your 401k. And I know that many people do it anyway. I want to share my story. Mostly to vent but maybe someone might have some advice. 

Apologies for the long post. But maybe it will help others.

In 2016 I took a 401K loan to put a larger down payment on a home. At the time the only loan I could qualify for was an FHA loan and the maximum allowable amount to finance was about 100K less than the purchase price. I could have afforded the monthly payment if they would have done an 80% loan. But I didn’t have 100K that I could put down. I didn’t know everything I know now about finance. But I thought I was safe. My wife and I were both employed in full time positions. I had over 25 years seniority with my company. My wife had 10 years with hers. We had no credit card debt or other debt other than our car loans and they were at very low interest rates. My budget told me that we could afford the house. So we did it. My first mistake was not understanding all the rules on the 401K loan. I wouldn’t have been too worried at the time about what would happen if I lost my job. I had 25 years seniority and I was a hard worker. So I thought my job is safe. 

**Mistake number one, if you take a 401K loan make sure you know ALL the rules, consequences etc before you do it.**

So everything was fine. We loved our house. Time went by. In 2018 I was promoted. Nice increase in pay. Things were great.

Then Covid hit. In March 2020 the casino I worked at was closed. Before that happened a large number of people were laid off. Not me because I had so much seniority. But when the casino closed we were all laid off until the casinos could reopen. No problem I thought. I have my emergency fund. Shouldn’t be too long. This will be fine. I called the 401K provider and they told me that due to the cares act I did not have to make payments on the loan. When I went back to work they would re-amortize the loan and I would have a new payment schedule.

In mid June it was announced that the casinos would reopen in early July. Great I thought. I just need to hold out a little longer and then I will be back to work. NOPE! The company decided they would bring people back by seniority in the position, not with the company. Since I was the newest manager in my job title I was not brought back. I was shocked. I was told that when business increased people would be called back according to their position seniority. But I was the last person that would be called out of five managers. I knew this wasn’t likely. I was left on a laid off status with company paid benefits until September of 2020 and then I was let go. 

**Mistake number two, don’t assume your job is secure. You never know what might happen.**

I immediately reached out to my 401K provider to find out what needed to be done about my loan. I was relieved to find out I didn’t have to pay the entire amount back. I was told that due to the Cares act I did not ned to make any payments until January. I would receive mail with instructions on how and when to make payments. There was a $100 fee to convert my loan. But I was just relieved I didn’t have to pay the full amount.

I didn’t receive anything by mid-January so I called my provider again. They apologized and said they would send the information immediately. I checked my account and saw that they charged me another $100. So I had to call back again to get this fixed. Took three phone calls to finally get that straightened out. But I got my first payment slip and sent a check off.

In February, once again no payment slip. Call them up. Tell them what happened. They said I could just mail a check and gave me the information to put on it. So I sent a check off. Then I got a payment slip for March and sent that payment off. Because of the overload on the mail service everything was really slow. My latest check actually cleared the bank before the prior one I sent. But I figured it was just taking extra time. March rolls on and the previous check I sent still hasn’t cleared. I’m getting concerned. But I don’t want to send another check with no payment slip. So I figure I’ll send two checks in April. If they find the February check and deposit it too, no biggie. 

So yesterday (March 29) I receive a letter in the mail dated March 19, saying they have not received my payment. Pay the outstanding balance due or the loan will be defaulted. Payment is due by MARCH 31. I have two days to make a payment and they don’t accept any form of electronic payment (I had checked previously because I didn’t want to have to write checks). And the letter says the amount past due is ZERO dollars. WTF?! I called this morning and explained everything and asked for help. The person on the phone took all my information and said it had to be escalated to a different department. I should expect a phone call by end of day. At 4pm (pacific time) I called because I knew the help lines were only open for a couple more hours and I hadn’t gotten a call back. After several minutes of explaining everything to a different person they said they could see notes from my previous call. They started saying something about my payments had been applied to the interest and not the principal and that was what was causing the problem. I was told starting next month everything would be corrected. So I asked “does that mean my loan will not go to default tomorrow?” The person on the other end of the line said they didn’t have an answer for that question. After waiting on hold for a long time I was told there was no one left in the office that could answer that question. I should expect a phone call in the morning with an answer.

So now I wait to find out if everything is ok, if I have to pay the loan in full to avoid taxes and penalties or will they just report it as a nearly distribution and I will have to pay the taxes and penalties.

This is definitely one of those stories where if I could go back I would listen to the people that told me not to take a loan against my 401K. I hope this helps others avoid the problems I had.",finance
MachineLearning,[Discussion] What do you think would happen if a GPT model was continuously fine-tuned on its own I/O?,"**Edit: The AI does not simply talk to itself. It talks to a human and the responses from *both* parties are used for further training. (In batches, paired together with symbols to indicate who is saying what)**

This would be quite computationally expensive obviously but suppose I've got the hardware and a lot of time and patience. Suppose I have daily conversations with the system, and the input/output of every interaction is immediately fed back in as training. (And we set the learning rate higher than normal because strong fitting would actually be good in this case)

Since natural conversation with a single person would take a long time to generate an appreciable volume of text, I was thinking maybe there'd also be ""introspective"" periods of training where it generates both sides of the conversation by itself, pretending there's still a human participant.

We could even add a simple ""judgement"" pass where the weight of fine-tuning for the AI's output is adjusted depending on how the human responds.

altcoin,No BTC - No Worries. My investment strategy that 99% of you will think is 100% DEGEN. I say it works 60% of the time EVERYTIME - tell me I’m wrong ✌️,"Ok so call me a crypto noob, degen, idiot or whatever you like - I can take it. I joined the game properly in Nov 20 when I took out a bank loan and invested in Cardano and Polkadot. This initial investment soon doubled - like in 2 weeks. 

Was I lucky with timing. YES. 

So I then thought YOLO: let’s get another bank loan, bigger this time. So I invested ALL of the new loan into Zilliqa - why? Because it was ground breaking sharding tech, staking rewards, geographically distanced from 🇺🇸 and SEC and I just liked the coin. 

Soon my portfolio doubled.. then tripled.. then quadrupled, 5x then 6x. Did I swap into BTC or ETC? NO. 

I kept stacking my passive income and compound interest is 🔥.. my next play was cashing about 25% of my Zilliqa and investing into EGLD when it was $50.. did this pay off, yeah I tripled up in about a week. 

I then cashed my EGLD and bought into other coins like OMI, UNFI, NORD, GHOUL. I then 4x in most of these coins - still waiting for some to take off as the market cap is sub $10M! 

What I’m trying to say is this - do not be handcuffed into thinking you MUST have 50% of your portfolio in BTC or ETH. If you have a healthy appetite for risk and want better rewards then stick to your convictions and invest in projects, sectors and coins you actually believe in. Go hard or go home essentially. 

Yes one day when I get to suicide stack levels of wealth I may consider putting some of my gains into BTC for stability and peace of mind - but I’m far too early on the journey to give into fear this early. 

Let me know if you think I’m a degen idiot or if you have utilised a similar strategy and ignored the sheep.

personalfinance,What do you do with your IRA?,"So I've tried to read the wiki side bar, and I've decided since I can max out my 401k every year (plus employer matches up to 7%) I should try throwing money into an IRA just to try to round out my investments.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't realize that IRAs could be so many different accounts, that you can do CD/bonds/or stock market. I decided to go stockmarket route with the company my 401k is through (fidelity).

&amp;#x200B;

I bought individual stocks intially just to see what it was like, but decided I didn't want to be a day trader and instead sold them all and bought a target fund. I feel like that's the smartest choice for where I am in life and that it mirrors my 401k, both are a targeted fund for the same date.

&amp;#x200B;

Is that what you're supposed to do with your IRA though? What does personal finance do with theirs, put it into bonds/CDs instead?

&amp;#x200B;

Stats about me:

Married, spouse and I are both 34

Combined income of 200k

Liablilities: 125k student loans, 6k car loan

Monthly expenses: 3k

My 401k: 40k, not sure on spouse

My IRA: 4k

Edit: adding this from a comment,

We've been sitting on the student loans because they are currently paused and theres been all the talk of potential loan forgiveness. There are a total of 4 loans each about 30k interest rates \~6%. At the moment we're trying to buy a moderately priced house that is similar to what we currently rent and lower our monthly rent 20%, then snowball the increased savings into loans and some house remodeling. Current goal is all loans paid off by 2024, 30k a year. Loan payments when they restart in October would be 1750/mo. Each loan is about $400/mo off.

personalfinance,Nonresident working in US for 1st time - Lost with IL-W4 and allowances,"Hi Reddit!

I am an international (hence nonresident) studying in IL and I am preparing to intern during the summer and hence have some income in the US for the first time. I have to clarify  that I live here with my wife, nonresident as well, who doesn’t (nor have the right) to work in the US.

The company Im going to work for sent me two forms the Federal W4 (which I filled as Married filling separately and where I did no claim any dependent) and the IL-W4 where I am a bit confused. In Step 1 I am doubting between 1 or 2 personal allowances as No one else can claim me as a dependent and I am not sure whether I can claim my wife as a dependent (second box to tick). As mentioned before my wife is on a dependent Visa and does not work nor is going to work this year.

So basically my question is that, should tick the box that states: ‘I can claim my spouse as dependent’ or not?. I checked with the company already but I am not very confident on their answer.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC’s position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN’s products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN’s acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

personalfinance,Would a personal loan from family need listed as a liability on a mortgage application?,"Essentially, I received assistance from a family member with tuition and university costs in a sort of personal loan, complete with a notarized promissory note, to complete my degree.

I’m now in the process of applying for a mortgage as a first time homebuyer, and I am wondering if that personal loan needs listed as an outstanding liability on the application. I would assume so, as it technically is an outstanding debt enforceable by the promissory note, but am unsure how to list it if so (basically just as an “Other Liability” with comment that it’s a personal loan?).

vet,My almost 9 week old German Shepherd is sick and we seem to be running out of options. I shall provide a complete record of his health and behaviour so that anyone who's willing to help can have full context.,"He(Atlas) came to me about five days ago, and was fine for most of the day..until evening when the diarrhoea started. We asked a few friends and they dismissed it as ""something that naturally happens to all puppies"" at first, but it didn't stop there. At about 2 AM in the night, he puked a white foam-like substance that contained small specks of red. We also realized that the diarrhoea had traces of what looked like blood in it as well.

The next morning(Day 2), we took him to a vet and he was given a few injections as well as homeopathic medicine (ParvoOut) for prevention against the parvovirus. We were also told that he was anemic and had a severe calcium deficiency, so we kept administering him appropriate supplements as prescribed by our vet(Ostopet Calcium, Gutwell powder to name a few). 
He did vomit again at night on Day 3, but we were told that it was merely due to indigestion and we assumed that his petfood (Royal Canin) was probably not suiting him too well. Slowly but steadily, he seemed to be getting better with his stools much more normal and his diet re-stabilizing. 

Day 4 saw him in probably his best health yet; he was keeping fairly active and although still a little low on stamina, he was eating and resting well. The vet told us to give him his deworming medicine at night..and that's when things turned for much, much worse.
 
Shortly after his dosage, he vomited again - no blood this time - and started having frequent diarrhoea as well(non-bloody at first). By morning, he seemed to be constipated since he was visibly straining himself a lot while passing stool, only for it to come out in very little quantity..and then the bleeding re-started. 
He spent the rest of the day not eating anything after early afternoon, and was extremely lethargic even when not asleep. He refrained from just about all activity and the only time he got up was to pass stool(diarrhoea still, some times bloody, even). 
As advised by friends and other professionals, we fed him a little bit of Cerelac, which he puked out instantly. A second vet told us to give him Zenflox OZ syrup, and he puked that out instantly thereafter as well. We then gave him Domstol syrup to stop the vomiting, and rushed him to Vet #2 who gave him more antibiotic injections so he could easily pull-through the night. He remained low on energy still, but seemed better at first..until this morning.

He started vomiting again - brownish-reddish substance - and he did so twice. We immediately rushed him to a hospital and he was given fluid therapy there. The doctor said he may have caught the parvovirus. It's been about three hours since his visit to the hospital, and he still hasn't regained any of his strength and refuses to eat or drink anything. We force-fed him a mixture of electral and glucose as advised by the doctor, but he hasn't had anything else since yesterday afternoon. Is there anything else we can do to better his chances of survival? Both me and my puppy Atlas could do a lot with some help.",cryptocurrency

btc,nullc demonstrates maxis' common confusion between Szabo's and Nakamoto's ideas re. SoV,"In my spat with u/nullc yesterday, having indirectly in my OP and and then expressly afterwards acknowledged that the properties of precious metals are an essential part of the mix of what made Bitcoin, he kept repeating it as if I was somehow denying that. At one point he came back with the assertion that SoV (issuance mimicking PM mining) is and always was (from Satoshi, through the intermediate years and through the block-size debate) 'front and foremost'. It's easy for people to look back at the bitcointalk forums from 2012-14 to see that was by no means the dominant conversation but what to me is more interesting is the following:

It is only when he offered in evidence a link to Satoshi that it became clear to me where the small blockers / BTC maxis are getting all muddled. They've inculcated themselves so deeply into the SoV *before* / at the cost of everything else that they're projecting it back to Satoshi.

But it was Szabo, not Nakamoto, who was obsessed by *collectible before medium of exchange* which was introduced in his [novel theory about how money comes into being](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/). Bitgold was the name of Szabo's theoretical offering.

What Nakamoto was addressing his energy to was what is worth remembering was not until the Bitcoin whitepaper even known to be possible - i.e. to crack the double-spend problem (and in the process, to solve the Byzantine Generals problem). 

And when he did, what was his announcement? Was it: 'Finally, I've solved a means of creating a digital gold'? Was it: 'OK folks, I've solved the means of creating a scarce asset. Let's everyone not do anything with it until it becomes so valuable that it magically becomes a medium of exchange'?

No, how can we summarise what Nakamoto's expression of the essence of what he'd discovered was....? Oh, here's a clue which he may have buried in a footnote somewhere: ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System""!

[The piece Greg linked](https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A9562) in fact contradicts the assertion that the precious metals, store of value thing was *front and central* to Satoshi:

&gt; [T]here is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.

It was in the absence of his being able to think of a trustless means of adjusting supply 'as the population of users grows' that he proposed issuance that mimics the mining of precious metals. ""Supply is predetermined and the value changes"" was apparently the only workable solution he could come up with - and given we know this has a track record in relation to precious metals, it was worth a go.

Satoshi's reference to the 'positive feedback loop' was an afterthought possible benefit of using predetermined supply. Market scarce-resource feedback loops are a double-edged sword. Alone, it won't make something valuable. Maybe if you add in faith that Szabo's novel theory is *how it must be* could that be enough? Add into the mix a means for hodlers / speculators (who have enough of it that they can afford), when they really have to, to be able to move it digitally from one place or one person to another without someone being able to stop you, you could theoretically be onto something? Who's up for going 'all in' on that. Apparently many!

But they will to a man refuse to acknowledge that i) by pricing whole diverse set of use cases from being viable on-chain, they've severely limited what people can realistically do with it; ii) that where they've taken BTC is on a reckless economic experiment that relies entirely on Szabo being right; iii) that for Szabo to be right, they with a focus on newcomers but primarily in their own minds, need to be convinced that what they are doing is not speculating, not playing the greater fool game but rather playing some noble part in the 'SoV stage' of the evolution of something that will undoubtedly become the one and only king of crypto (swallowing up all shitcoins) and money for the world (once people have found ways to use it again but there's no rush because its only proper use right now is to hodl).",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The Economist Who Predicted Cryptocurrency,"Friedrich Hayek. Nobel prize winner in 1974 in Economics for his ""pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations”

In 1976 Friedrich Hayek wrote  
**The Denationalization of Money.**  
The book argued for the end of the government’s monopoly on currency.

**Introduction quote from the book**

*“In my despair about the hopelessness of finding a politically feasible solution to what is technically the simplest possible problem, namely to stop inflation, I threw out in a lecture delivered about a year ago a somewhat startling suggestion, the further pursuit of which has opened quite unexpected new horizons…  
The further pursuit of the suggestion that government should be deprived of its monopoly of the issue of money opened the most fascinating theoretical vistas and showed the possibility of arrangements which have never been considered.”* - F.A.Hayek 

Thirty years later, the financial crisis of 2007 saw huge inflation, rising unemployment and sky-rocketing interest rates. It was considered the most serious financial crisis since the 1930s. Once again, the government’s monopoly on currency was questioned. On 3 January 2009, the first bitcoin was mined.

It was Hayek’s theory made practical.

Hayek’s theory in his book was that not only would the currency monopoly be taken away from the government, but that the monopoly on currency itself should end with multiple alternative currencies competing for acceptance by consumers. Cryptocurrencies continued to follow in the economist’s vision. Since the creation of the first bitcoin, 8,700~ crypto alternatives have been created.

Another visionary quotes that got stuck in my head and they’re worth mentioning. 

“*I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government.

I thought that you guys would like to hear this fact, that such a vision was written and told 40 years ago by someone that achieved something in his life. I know, that some of you don’t like, when we are sharing the quotes from the history figures because they said a good chunk of things that was false. In this case, I feel like, the vision that Mr.Hayek had, is becoming true, and everyday we’re closer to it. 

Hope you found this “legacy” somehow educating or inspiring.

personalfinance,Question about a federal tax return!,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,Paying off car loan,"First let me expressed that I managed to pay off my student loan! Now the only loan I have is my car loan! Currently, i have over enough to pay it off, but i have been debating whether I should pay it off in one payment or just pay it off monthly.
Currently:
I owe ~$10,000 @ 4.5% interest rate on the car, it already has over 100,000 miles, and with the job I have, i can foresee that I will be putting roughly 30,000 miles on it by the end of this year.
My car is a 2015 Mazda6.

My question is, do i pay it off in one payment to be debt free or continue the monthly payment and use my money elsewhere?

CryptoCurrency,"Seriously, stop simping over these Investment Banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan","Have people already forgotten what happened in the USA 2007-2008 and in the EU in 2009-2012 because of them? These banks screwed us willingly over causing the global economy almost to collapse in a matter of weeks if it wasn't for taxpayer (our) money to save them. Bitcoin was created so normal citizens could protect themselves against these scummy people. Did they learn anything or was anything changed because of what happened? Of course not. Please stop cheering for them, they're 10x worse than Elon Musk having fun with Dogecoin or any Youtuber people hate in here.

**Short summary:**

These banks created one of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the 30s. Banks gave money to anyone wanting to buy a house, even if their financial position was horrible to begin with. This of course created a bubble on the housing market with thousands and thousands of subprime loans. Refinancing your home at that time was no problem of course, add an adjustable-rate mortgage (interest rate cheap at the beginning expensive later) to the mix and you have recipe for disaster.  The housing market of course looked attractive for European and US based companies gobbling up these subprime loans, number only go up right? They bundled these trash loans in a CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligations ) and sold them off, of course knowing it was trash. 

Suddenly on one day the housing market started to collapse, too many houses were built and investors found out these AAA loans were actually trash. Who was betting against the housing market? Goldman Sachs of course, our little crypto friend. Other (investment) banks went broke as they had a shit ton of these financial products. Crisis flew over to Europe, creating the Eurocrisis. Lots of European countries still hold these subprime loans and are still getting bailed out by the European Central bank because they're otherwise bankrupt. 

**Aftermath :** 

**-** Jobless rate USA hitting 10%.

\- 170.000 families homeless in 2009 (USA).

\-Central banks purchased US$2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks

\- ultimately purchasing $1.5 trillion newly issued preferred stock in major banks

\- The U.S. lost $3.4 trillion in real estate wealth from July 2008 to March 2009 according to the Federal Reserve. 

**Goldman Sachs:** Lost $2.1B in 2008, $1.7B profit in 2009. $20B profit in just 10 years after the crisis.

\- Most bank paid a fine, almost nobody on Wallstreet went to jail. 

TL;DR: Investment banks screwed us over and will likely do it again. Bitcoin isn't their toy to play around with, it was created to protect us from these people.",cryptocurrency

business,"Behind the scenes of a small freelance business—Our 2020 revenue, profits, challenges, and future plans [Long post]","Every year, I like to share how our business has performed over the previous year and how that impacts on our business and personal finances. My hope is that being transparent about our revenue, expenses, profits, challenges, and plans is helpful to other small business owners. The aim is to:

&amp;#x200B;

* Share our business finances transparently, straight from our bookkeeping and tax returns.
* Show that small businesses can create a reasonable income, even tiny ones like ours!
* Inspire other people that you really can make money working for yourself, although it’s not the easiest thing.
* Explain our challenges and plans, because I’m sure there are many commonalities with other small business owners.

Let’s get into it. (I’m sorry there’s not a TL;DR, but I hope you’ll find reading this post worthwhile)

&amp;#x200B;

## About us and the business

* Myself and my wife run a freelance business, established in 2014 in North Carolina.
* I provide freelance writing services (mainly to B2B clients in the technology and finance spaces) and she provides freelance editing and proofreading services, directly to private clients and via the Fiverr Pro platform.
* We’re both in our late 40s, and had professional careers prior to becoming freelancers. We’ve used much of the experience gained there to run this business.
* Our business is set up as a multi-member LLC, currently taxed as a partnership, although I have applied for S Corp filing status from this year.
* Our clients are probably around 50% US-based, and 50% from elsewhere in the world.
* The business is 90%+ of our personal income, with the rest being dividends and capital gains.
* We’re financially stable, saving for retirement, and middle-class, without massive personal expenses (home paid for, no debt, no kids.) This means we’re not planning to radically grow the business, just get some moderate growth year-over-year. In fact, as we’re getting older, we’re realizing that time and freedom are just as important as money in the bank.
* Between 2016 and 2019, we managed to up our revenue each year, both due to taking on more work and raising rates. 2020, and the pandemic, stopped that trend.

&amp;#x200B;

## Our business principles

* I’m a huge productivity / automation geek, so I try to optimize how our business runs as much as possible. This means being very on top of our daily operations, and also thinking about medium- to long-term changes we need to make. Yes, it also means I love a spreadsheet.
* We never compete on price, but instead on providing as much value as possible to a client. So, our services are definitely in the more expensive range of freelancing, but we provide a ton of additional expertise, reliability, flexibility, professionalism, experience, etc.
* Our services are all based around demonstrating that value and experience, which means knowing our audience and their problems, and providing high-touch, high-value solutions—basically being fast, hassle-free, and keeping our promises.
* We openly publish prices on our business websites, so if a prospect contacts us, we know they’ve looked at our prices and considered us in budget. That saves enormously on conversion, as all of our leads are warm / hot.
* We rely completely on inbound content marketing and SEO. We don’t apply for gigs, advertise, cold email, or anything else. Partly because I don’t want the expense or time overhead, and partly because as a freelance writer—content marketing should be all I *need* to do—as that’s the service I’m selling to clients.
* I have no desire to start or run a freelance agency!

Alright, let’s get into the finances.

&amp;#x200B;

## Our business revenue, expenses, and profits in 2020

I’ve shown our business finances below, rounded to the nearest $1,000. I’ve also included 2019 figures in brackets next to each, so you can see how they changed. Any disparities are likely to be rounding errors.

## Revenue in 2020: $125K  vs. 2019: 146K

* Annual revenue from proofreading / editing: **$37K** ($25K)
* Annual revenue from freelance writing: **$88K** ($120K)
* Total annual revenue: **$125K** ($146K)
* Revenue per day from writing: **$370** ($500)
* Revenue per day from editing: **$155** ($100)
* Total revenue per day: **$525** ($600)

## Revenue thoughts

* We saw an overall reduction in income of around **15%**, which, given COVID and the terrible impact it had on so many businesses, means I think we were lucky.
* My freelance writing business took a fairly big hit from COVID, reducing income by around **27%**.
* Two of my biggest clients were related to currency exchange and travel money, and they fell off the radar completely, probably resulting in about a **10%** to **15%** drop by themselves, with the remainder coming from cut marketing budgets elsewhere.
* The inbound marketing work I was doing for our editing business in 2019 and early 2020 paid off, with almost a **50%** rise in income there.

&amp;#x200B;

## Expenses in 2020: $21.2K  vs. 2019: 24K

I’ve shown our business finances below, rounded to the nearest $100. I’ve also included 2019 figures in brackets next to each (Rounded to nearest $1,000), so you can see how they changed.

* Health insurance premiums: **$11.7K** ($11K)
* Accounting fees: **$1.8K** ($3K)
* Computer software and subscriptions etc: **$2.4K** ($2K) (SaaS subscriptions, web hosting, etc)
* Bank and credit card charges: **$1.6K** ($2K)
* Office costs (Home office deduction): **$1.5K** ($2K)
* Business donations to charity: **$1.2K** ($1K)
* Internet and phone: **$1K** ($1K)
* Other expenses: **$2.1K** ($2K)
* Total expenses: **$21.2K** ($24K)

## Expense thoughts

* Nothing surprising here, my accounting in 2020 was less complex than 2019, so reduced fees there. Additionally, less revenue meant lower card processing and bank fees.
* Expected, standard increases across other areas.
* In total, expenses accounted for around **17%** of our revenue in 2020 (**8%** without health ins premiums), compared to **16%** in 2019 (**9%** without health ins premiums).

&amp;#x200B;

## Total profits (pre-tax) in 2020: $104K vs 2019: $122K

* Again, no surprises here. Reduced revenue from COVID resulted in lower profits.
* Our pre-tax profit margin was **83%** of revenue in 2020 vs. **84%** in 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

## Taxes (self-employment, federal, state) in 2020: c. $27K vs 2019: c. $33K

* No surprises here. Our overall tax burden in 2020 was **26%** of profits, compared to **27%** in 2019. It was **22%** of revenue in 2020, vs. **23%** in 2019.
* Some of these taxes are applied to other income like capital gains and dividends, but the majority are from business income.
* The rule of thumb I use is to pay around 30% of profit in taxes as estimated taxes through the year, resulting in a small refund at tax time.
* That held true again this year (approx a **$2K** federal tax refund.)
* I hope to get S Corp tax election status for 2021, which should allow me to reduce my self-employment taxes by around **$6K** to **$7K**.

&amp;#x200B;

## “Take-Home” Pay after expenses and taxes in 2020: $77K, 6.4K a month vs 2019: $89K, $7.5K a month

* Our take-home pay fell by approx **$12K** net in 2020 vs. 2019.
* That’s around a **15%** decrease.

&amp;#x200B;

## Monthly living expenses $4.5K a month in 2020 and 2019, $55K a year

* Our monthly living expenses didn’t really change at all between 2019 and 2020. Any cost of living increases were offset by things like not going out to restaurants.
* We have paid off our mortgage and don’t carry debt.
* We don't have kids, which significantly reduces our expenses.
* We do have “emergency” savings to cover six months of expenses.
* Main expense items are groceries, utilities, property tax, pets, entertainment, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

## Disposable income in 2020: $1.9K a month, 23K a year, vs 2019: $3.3K a month, $39K a year

* We spend **20%** \- **30%** of this on charitable donations, larger projects, and fun stuff.
* **70%** \- **80%** of this disposable income is invested over the medium- to long-term, mainly in retirement accounts. Only 15 years away from retirement and need to build those funds up!

&amp;#x200B;

## Financial summary

OK, that’s it for all of the finances. To summarize our annual 2020 figures (any disparities are rounding errors):

* Business revenue: **$125K**
* Business expenses: **$21.2K**
* Business pre-tax profits: **$104K**
* Taxes: **$27K**
* Take-home pay: **$77K**
* Living expenses: **$55K**
* Disposable income: **$23K**

Looking purely at the figures, my conclusion is that COVID19 had an impact on our finances, but we were still able to stay ahead of our costs and maintain a good standard of living.

&amp;#x200B;

## Here’s how 2020 compared to 2019

* Our overall revenue decreased by **$21K**, around **15%** YoY.
* Our overall profits decreased by **$18K**, around **15%** YoY.
* Our take-home pay decreased by **$12K**, around **15%** YoY.
* Our disposable income fell by **$16K**, around **40%** YoY.

# My thoughts for 2020, 2021, and beyond

If there’s one thing 2020 taught me, it’s that small businesses have to be prepared and adaptable. Here’s what I learned and what we are going to do:

**Diversify even more**

We were already pretty diversified with our client base prior to COVID, but losing just two major clients put a sizable dent in our income. I’m focussing even more now on getting clients across a wider range of industries.

**Maintain healthy savings**

We have six months of living and business expenses in ur bank accounts, and although we did need to dig into them a bit, having that money there significantly reduced our stress levels.

**Keep contributing to longer-term investments**

We delayed our retirement contributions while our revenue was unsteady, but caught up towards the end of the year. The compounding effect is so important that I didn’t want us to miss out.

**Get government help**

I applied for an EIDL loan when our revenue took a nosedive. I’ve repaid the loan since, but the short-term security that provided, together with the small grant, was still very helpful.

**Automate wherever possible**

I want to save time, effort, and cognitive load so integrating all of our apps together lets me streamline that process, putting aside more time for paying work.

**Focus on inbound marketing**

The months of May through June / July were very quiet. I completely rebuilt my freelance writing website to drive up organic search performance. It worked, and all of our inquiries are now 100% inbound, with around 20 writing-related keywords in the top 3 Google results. Previous work on our editing website means we have about 25 there in the top 3.

**Focus on value, not price**

All of our rates are published openly on our websites, which isn’t something that a lot of freelancers do. We find that’s very helpful for pre-qualifying leads, and also sets an expectation for the quality of work a client can expect.

I also rewrote all of our “services” pages to speak to how we can help clients and make their lives easier. In a time of COVID, people already have so much cognitive overload, and what to hire experts that can make stuff happen, without much oversight, so that was a real value-add for our target audience (mainly B2B clients, marketers, and agencies needing people with technical knowledge).

**Maintain independence over your work**

Although we do get some work through the Fiverr Pro freelance platform, all other work is either through marketing agencies, or directly with clients. I find this level of control very helpful, as it means I can speak directly with clients.

**Be exceptionally professional, but friendly at the same time**

We don’t see ourselves as “just freelancers” but as running a business that’s as professional as those we serve. That means being very flexible and reliable, responding rapidly to questions and communications, staying completely on top of work, and being friendly and hassle-free, and charging fair, transparent rates.

**Emphasize proactive communications**

Part of business professionalism is keeping clients informed, rather than them coming to us. That means weekly emails and updates on when work will be returned, checking in, and such.

**Keep your pipeline full**

I’ve struggled with the balance between existing work commitments and taking on new clients. I could move to retainer contracts, so that’s something I’m thinking about. As it happens, our revenue does vary a fair amount from month to month.

**Help your professional community**

We all grow through sharing knowledge with our peers (hence the reason for this post). It sharpens up your thinking, lets you see how other people are doing, optimizes your approach, and gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling!

**Realize that at some point in life, freedom and time are as important as money**

I’m not sure when it happened, but I’ve grown to value independence over my work, and choosing to do only what I want to as equally important as earning money. Now, that’s probably because I have *enough* money, but chasing the dollar is no longer as important as it once was.

**Play with dogs!**

Because, y’know, working from home must have those benefits, right?!

Alright, I think that’s it. Thanks very much for sticking with me through this. I’m happy to expand on any of these points or answer any questions. Over to you!",finance
personalfinance,"Received Conflicting Advice from Financial Advisor, Seeking Advice","For a little background information, my wife and I both graduated from post-grad education in 2018, and currently have a total $350K in federal student loan debt; most student loans range from 5-7% interest. We are both 28 years old, and together make $216K yearly (before taxes). We own a home valued at $175K with a 2.85% interest rate.

It was not until January 2020 that we began to be serious about paying off our debt. By the end of 2020 we had paid off both vehicles, several thousands in other previously made frivolous purchases, a small but high-interest student loan, and put enough money down to have 20% equity in our house and rid of our PMI. We had dwindled our debts down to just our mortgage and student loans, and felt ready to truly tackle our massive $350K loans starting in 2021.

For those unaware, all federally-held student loans are NOT currently accruing interest until at least the end of September, due to COVID relief. Aside from matching the maximum of what each of our employers will put into each of our Roth 401K's, as of January 2021 we have been putting any extra money toward student loans. Specifically, we put my wife's entire check into a separate bank account, as well as several hundred from my own check. That money goes straight to our student loans, and equates to a little over $7,000 per month. It is our job to live off of what remains from my check. On this path, we would be paying somewhere in the ballpark of $90K on our loans, per year.

My father-in-law convinced us to go to a financial planner. I was hesitant to go because I was not planning on investing more than the match until I had a better handle on our student loans. This financial planner recommends changing our student loan payments to a 10-year payment plan, and investing the rest in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs); he was suggesting putting down $4k/month in student loans and somewhere between $2-3k/month in ETFs. He referenced a ""tax diversification triangle"", recommending spreading our capital into each area of the triangle (1. ETFs/mutual funds 2. Traditional 401ks 3. Roth 401k/IRA).

He states the benefit of EFTs is you can pull that money out at any time without penalty. Furthermore, he explained whereas you can invest in EFTs and pull out at anytime to pay off student loans once it has grown, you cannot go the other way around (once you pay off the student debt that money is gone). He went on to say while we would feel great after paying off these student loans, we would have earned no capital at the end of this journey in 4-5 years. For example, he emphasized that if we continued to just pay off our student loans, we would have no money at the end to put toward a down payment for our dream home. 

I'm very hesitant to take his advice. Although I understand the value of compounding returns on investments and being aggressive when younger, I also know my student loans have compounding 5-7% interest over time.  Plus, this amount of student debt feels crippling and has a psychological factor to it. Although refinancing these is an option, it's not something I would consider right now with interest currently being frozen, and I value some of the safeguards offered by federal loans not offered by private lenders. It is something I will consider in time when our total student loan value is much lower. Personally, I want to continue hammering on these loans, then shift more to investing when our loans are paid off or at least at a more manageable number, around age 32-33.

Also, as a side note, this financial planner makes money two ways: it costs a flat fee of $600/year for his consulting services, and he also makes money via investments we make through him.

Here are my questions:

1. Would you recommend continuing to hammer down the student loans, or would you recommend following the financial advisors advice?
2. I've always been heard the importance of making sure to max out 401k. So if I were to divert money from student loan payments to investing, why would I put my money in EFTs and not more into my Roth 401k?
3. He's also mentioned life insurance, which isn't a bad idea. I know universal/whole life insurance is NOT recommended and not worth it, but he recommended finding a term life plan that offers two options: disability waiver and convertible permanent insurance (whole life...). This threw me for a loop. He explained this ""convertible"" option may add \~$7 to my premium (he threw out an estimate, increasing it from $30 to $37). He states that at the end of the 20-year term, it gives the option to convert to a whole life term, at which point the premium would become much higher. He states the benefit of this is that if I were to develop a terminal illness and it was 20 years from now, and I knew I only had a few more months/years to live, ""it would be crazy"" not to agree to convert to whole life at this point and pay $500/month for the remaining months/years when we would know it would result in a $500,000 payout on my impending death. Has anyone heard of this option and have any opinions?",finance
personalfinance,"Need Advice: Should I Refinance Home Mortgage? (4.125% APR, 30 Year, Started Sept 2019)","Hi all,

I've been trying to figure out the math on this and was hoping someone might help, because every time I call Wells Fargo about this (my current mortgage holder), they seem to discourage me and say its not worth it... but its probably not in their best interest to give me a better interest rate

Here is a summary breakdown of our financial situation:  
**Mortage**: $167k  
**Type**: 30 Year Fixed  
**Interest**: 4.125%  
**Start Date**: Sept 1 2019  
**Monthly Payment**: $1,213.55  
\- Principal = $258.52  
\- Interest = $574.25  
\- Escrow = $380.78

Right now it looks like you can get a 30 year fixed mortgage with as low as 2.2% APR. My wife and I both have over 800 credit scores, so I would imagine we would get one of the competitive rates

Current mortgage we did not have enough for the full downpayment after closing costs, etc.. so we're paying some PMI as well

We don't really have a lot of liquid cash right now with COVID, and after buying the house, so coming up with closing costs again would be difficult and would likely have to be rolled into the loan

He had most of the money and was going to finance the rest (I think he planned to finance about $12k out of $40k). There was a little anxiety at the dealership, and a parent offered to send him the balance while he shopped around for a personal loan to pay the parent back.

I had indicated prior to this transaction that I thought it would be harder and maybe higher interest to try and do this, but it wasn't my choice.

So my friend is going to have a $40k truck with no outstanding balance on it. I've seen a lot of discussion on title loans that seem to be mostly predatory.

personalfinance,"How does delayed payment toward principal, as well as length of loan, factor in to interest savings on extra payments?","Hello,

​

I have a car loan with 16k left, at 3.99% with 36 months remaining. I also have student loan of 32k at 3.45% with 72 months remaining.

​

I made an extra payment of 5k towards my car (it's already gone), but according to my contract, this will be applied at the end of the loan, that is, when the car has 5k left on the principal, it'll be written off. In addition, they have given me a 10 month grace period, so no payment or interest accrued for 10 months.

​

That means for the next 10 months i have an extra \~500 to put towards loan. I can put it towards my car loan, and let it be applied at the end, or I can put it towards my student loan.

​

I know in general you always pay towards higher interest loan for maximum savings, but how does this delay in repayment factor in? Does it at all? Does the length of the loan matter? I'm thinking along the lines that the savings from the extra payment on my student loan will compound longer since the loan has a longer repayment.

​

Additionally, when either of the loan is up, that cash flow will go towards the other loan.

​

edit: forgot to add interest rate for student loan
Edit 2: clarifying that the 5k payment has already happened. The question is more about the next 10 months of grace period from car loan",finance
vet,My cat wont eat and idk what to do,"Shes about 5 years old. Last monday we took her to the vet cause she was peeing around the house alot and we suspected a uti. And apparently she is both diabetic and has a uti. So it was kind of expensive cause i payed for most of it. They told us she needed a high fiber diet so we had to get her new food. She ate it once (on the tuesday the day after.) and hasnt ate any of her food since. On around Thursday i tried giving her egg whites because i was worried and she ate those up so i know shes hungry. Ive been giving her her meds (both insulin and liquid uti meds) twice a day everyday (except a few missed doses cause i couldnt catch her). They said she needs to eat with the meds especially the insulin and idk how to get her to eat. I mixed the new and old food together but i managed to separate it to see if i could get her to eat her old food but she still wont even if i place her before it so she can see it. She doesnt like wet food either but my dad is going to try and get her some to see if maybee we can get her to eat it for once. I KNOW shes hungry. I just walked into the kitchen to maybe get a bagel and found the bag chewed open and the bagels were nibbles on. She had maybe 2 or 3 of her mouthfuls of the bread. They were blueberry. And earlier she tried to eat a whole sausage from the counter but i caught her before she got the chance to have more than a nibble. So obviously shes hungry because shes barely eaten in a week, she just wont have anything we give her, even her old food. What should i do? Also, are the few bites of bagel she ate gonna harm her? Should i stop giving her her insulin injections till she eats? My mom thinks i should just not feed her and see if she eventually just gets desperate and eats the food we gave her but i dont think i should do that. Im scared shell literally starve to death. Should i feed her egg whites again? They wont give her the nutrition she needs tho. Idk what to do. And also my dad is my only possible ride to the vet and theyre closed Friday and he always works till 6 the next 2 days. So the earliest i could get her in is saturday. I dont know what to do. Id feel bad waiting her out. Its been she literally hasnt eaten basically at all (sxcept the small bagel bites today) in literally 5 days.  What do i do? 

Also cause i think this is required info: shes spayed, we live somewhere in Canada, shes just a regular shorthaired cat. And when we took her i think she was like 12 something pounds? So kinda chubby but she lost a few ounces from her last visit two years ago. Not much, but were feeding her how much they told us to. Also she has been drinking during this time.

EDIT: i also want to add that the morning after the egg whites were fed to her there was diarrhea on the carpet and i dont think it was my dog so im not sure if the egg whites did that to her or the insulin or uti meds? I did research before feeding them to her and all sites said that they can eat them but not as a whole diet because it doesnt have all required nutrients.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,We were asked to re-sign refinancing documents but the whole experience left us confused and suspicious of the lender and notary (Southern California),"We refinanced our mortgage with our existing mortgage lender. The notary came to our house on 3/15/21 to sign re-fi documents. On 3/20/21 she came back telling us FedEx had lost the documents and that we needed to re-sign everything and use the original date of 3/15/21 on all the documents. She had us sign and fingerprint her book both times. She had her book pre-filled out with all our info from the first signing on 3/15/21. Is this considered backdating? Is any of this illegal?
 
Through the tracking number they gave us, they say the original documents were finally delivered on 3/22/21, but there is no mention of any delay by FedEx. In fact, it shows the documents were picked up at the FedEx office on the afternoon of 3/20/21, the same day we re-signed everything. We were told the second set of documents were physically dropped off at the lender’s office.
 
After going through our sets of both signed documents, we noticed there were three documents that were not in the original set: a statement of fact about a property we rented from, a Tangible Net Benefit Disclosure, and a Closing Disclosure.
 
All of this seems very fishy and we’re wondering if we should look into this further, possibly by consulting a lawyer, but were just not sure.",finance
personalfinance,Iowa529 and I already graduated from college.,"Paid my own way through college and gradschool, graduated years ago, and just found out my deceased parents had set up an Iowa 529 College Fund for me that they never told me about or used to help me pay for college. Has around $20k in it.

Reading the website, it says:
What if I do not use the money in my account for a qualified education expense?
The earnings portion of a distribution not used for a student's qualified education expenses is subject to federal taxes and a 10% federal penalty tax and may be subject to state income taxes. 

I'm wondering what the best way to deal with this account is and how I minimize the amount of taxes and/or penalties I have to pay on it. Is there any way I can withdraw it or roll it into a retirement account and avoid paying taxes on it?

personalfinance,Reduce student loan debt or invest,"Seeking advice or maybe just discussion on a big decision I've been mulling over. 

I will be starting law school in the fall. I have been working full time for three years and putting away as much as I can (just in a savings account, boo -- low interest I know, but I could not risk losing the money). I have squirreled away about 70k which I thought I would use to reduce the amount of debt I would have to take on for law school.  

BUT, I am almost 100% positive I will be going into government work upon graduation, which means after 10 years my remaining balance will be forgiven (all law school loans are federal and therefore subject to Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness). 

So lately I have been thinking, maybe I max out my federal loans each year to pay for school and expenses and instead put my savings into a mutual fund. In 10 years, when my debt is forgiven I would have a heck of a head start on a retirement fund or down payment for a house. 

The idea of 200k+ in student loans hanging over my head is scary but as long as my fund is earning more than the interest on my debt (\~6%) doesn't this kind of make sense? Thoughts?",finance

Today marks the final session of Q1 of 2021. 

Ahead of President Biden’s address later today, the White House revealed a new, massive infrastructure proposal. The proposal includes roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring.

Today marks the final session of an extremely volatile quarter. Year-to-date, cyclical, energy, financial, industrial and reopening stocks have strongly outperformed tech and high-growth stocks that led the market higher last year. As the pace of vaccinations increases (roughly 3 million doses distributed per day in the US), it seems market participants have been rotating to stocks poised to benefit from the gradual reopening of the economy. 

Despite signs of economic improvement, market participants are concerned that the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy, combined with massive fiscal spending, may cause an unwanted rise in inflation, reinforced by the recent climb in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (1.735% at the time of writing).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Because the change occurred after some people filed their taxes, the IRS will take steps in the spring and summer to make the appropriate change to their return, which may result in a refund. **The first refunds are expected to be made in May and will continue into the summer.**For those taxpayers who already have filed and figured their tax based on the full amount of un employment compensation, the IRS will determine the correct taxable amount of un employment compensation and tax. **Any resulting overpayment of tax will be either refunded or applied to other outstanding taxes owed.**For those who have already filed, the **IRS will do these recalculations in two phases**, starting with those taxpayers eligible for the up to $10,200 exclusion. The IRS will then adjust returns for those married filing jointly taxpayers who are eligible for the up to $20,400 exclusion and others with more complex returns.There is no need for taxpayers to file an amended return **unless the calculations make the taxpayer newly eligible for additional federal credits and deductions not already included on the original tax return**.For example, the IRS can adjust returns for those taxpayers who claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and, because the exclusion changed the income level, may now be eligible for an increase in the EITC amount which may result in a larger refund. However, taxpayers would have to file an amended return if they did not originally claim the EITC or other credits but now are eligible because the exclusion changed their income.**These taxpayers may want to review their state tax returns as well.**

CryptoCurrency,Top 3 April 1st Jokes in the World of Crypto,"Remember that tomorrow (or maybe today somewhere) is April 1st. Crypto tracker and news websites often come up with some kind of a joke. Here are some of the famous  jokes pulled of in the past:

**1.** **OneCoin overtakes Ethereum**  
April 1st, 2017. The excellent forum was edited by the popular CoinDesk crypto-portal, which shocked its readers by saying that OneCoin had become a US federal court verdict, and the judge even ordered CoinMarketCap to place it on its cryptocurrency list without delay. Subsequently, OneCoin was ahead of the list of the most valuable Ethereum crypts and ranked second after Bitcoin. In addition, the court ordered the federal order to be intensively involved in building a ""decentralized"" system. Obviously, such a novelty could be waived with a reader who did not realize it was April 1st. Just for your warning - OneCoin is one of the biggest scams in the history of crypto and its creators have been arrested.

**2.Ethereum Conference in North Korea**  
Report was submitted from Vitalik Buterin, who wrote on the blog while he reported on major mainstream adoption of Ethereum, said that DevCon3 was moved to Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Interestingly, on April 1, 2017, after the release of this report, Ethereum's value rose by nearly 10 percent. However, whether it is directly related to it or simply a common market development, we will never know.

**3.SEC approved Bitcoin ETF**  
Finance Magnates dropped a proverbial bomb in seemingly breaking news about the SEC approving two Bitcoin ETFs. Although there are multiple contact clues indicating that it was a joke, the text’s serious tone caught many readers off-guard. The article was the top result when Google returns a search for the term Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Think about this:,"1. Increased access to central currency alternatives (stocks/crypto) reduces the demand for central currencies, reduced demand for a currency causes reduced value (inflation). Inflation causes increased demand for alternatives. A vicious cycle.


2. The expectation of inflation causes inflation as people abandon a central currency, so central banks like the Fed are incentivized to downplay the threat of inflation.


3. If people have the option to pick between 2 currencies completely equal in functionality and spendability, only difference being inflation rate they will choose the currency with the lower inflation rate.


If the above assumptions are all true we can conclude that all central currencies will eventually be replaced by the alternative with the highest functionality/spendability and lowest inflation rate.",cryptocurrency
stocks,Biden's Infrastructure plan and who benefits?,"Long post but easily readable. TLDR at the bottom.

As of right now, Biden is speaking about the huge infrastructure plan. This plan is spread out over 8 years and will be paid for in new tax hikes. The tax plan is expected to raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, end federal subsidies for fossil fuel companies and increase the global minimum tax paid from about 13 percent to 21 percent, as well as other measures aimed at taxing corporations that shelter profits offshore to avoid taxes.

IMO, the rare earth elements (REE) space is going to grow at a fast past over the next few years and decades. If you don't know what REE is, it's a group of 17 metals (lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium) that appear in low concentrations in the ground. The popular ones used in mainstream commodities (such as electric vehicles, batteries, and energy storage) are lithium, graphite, cobalt, nickel, and copper.

There was a Global Metals &amp; Mining Live Virtual Investor Conference yesterday and today that saw several companies pitch their companies and talked about what they do and the how the mining business will see a lot of growth for the next several years.

There's two US based companies that I would recommend and that's MP Materials, ticker symbol, MP and Energy fuels, UUUU. The reason mining rare earth metals is so important for the US is because we have to become independent from other countries to mine, specifically China. China supplied 80% of the rare earth metals to the US from 2014 to 2017 and they supply 75% of the rare earth materials to manufacturers. There is only one US based rare earth mine and that's California's mountain pass mine. Guess who owns it? MP Materials.

I made a spreadsheet list of stocks and ETFs that may see some benefit from this plan. Tabs on the bottom so its divided by each category.

personalfinance,"I am trying to buy a condo in Los Angeles County, as a first time buyer I would like to layout one of my purchase options and get some outside opinions","Hello everyone, thanks for clicking on my post, a bit about myself, I am a 29 year old man with no dependents, and unmarried. Due to the quarantine I was able to save up some money, so figured now was the time to invest into some property and stop renting. I initially had some desires of specific places to live, but have realized that this is a very heavy sellers market, and I would most likely have to accept things I initially did not want to accept.

I make $91,000 a year give or take, and my monthly bills currently come out to about $1070, which includes car, all types of insurance, etc. I am  not too worried about the monthly payments, as I would most likely be moving to this location with my girlfriend who would help with the monthly bills.

I found a location that is very nice and that I actually like, but it seems that if I actually want to acquire this place, I have to move fast. Everything in this area is selling for more then the asking price, and there are usually dozens of offers within the first few days, it's insanely competitive.

I offered $452,950 on the location which puts me in the running against 7 other offers, and my realtor says we have a chance. I would like to get some input on their counter offer and see if you guys think it is fair.

**1. Buyer to submit their best and final offer, and Initial deposit to be 3% of the final purchase price.**

**2. Close of escrow to be 21 days or sooner. Should the buyer need extension, buyer shall pay per diem in the sum of $150.00.**

**3. Loan Interest Rate on Buyers new loan to be best prevailing interest rate.**

**4. Escrow and Title companies to be seller's choice.**

**5. Master bathroom mirror, refrigerator, washer/dryer and all furniture are excluded from the purchase.**

**6. RPA 10 F (2) to be 3 days after acceptance.**

**7. Upon final acceptance buyer may be required to cross qualify by the seller's choice lender without any obligation.**

&amp;#x200B;

Some of this seems confusing to me, but certain things also don't seem like a big deal. For example number 2 and number 5 aren't a big deal to me, I am willing to work fast, and I want my own furniture anyway. As well as number 1 is acceptable to me, are the rest of the things in the counter normal in your opinion?

Part of being competitive my realtor says is how quickly I am willing to work, so they are looking to have this offer accepted by 6:00 PM tonight (which I am okay with if it's fair). We would be upping the offer to $462,950, which at that point would cost about $23,000 as a down payment (part of which would be covered by the deposit) and then the closing costs would be my responsibility and cost about $9,259. My realtor says in the last 10 years it has been irregular to be able to negotiate splitting the closing costs and it would have to be my responsibility to be competitive. I have nearly $50,000 in cash currently so I can afford it, though it will sting of course.

I would like to hear any and all opinions and would be happy to answer any questions, I have just over 3 hours to make a decision on this offer, or continue my search.",finance
personalfinance,Paid 84k to 48k student loan. Still owe over 65k. Help?,"Hi everyone, have a question regarding my student loan debt. 

I originally took out a 48k loan for nursing school back in 2014. It was deferred for two years while still in school, and I started making payments in 2016. To date, I’ve paid 84k on the loan, and currently owe over 65k. I know I’m getting hosed on my interest rate which is over 12 percent. I currently pay 1400 a month, and abt 90% of that goes to interest.

I want to get it refinanced, but because of this ridiculous amount of debt, my credit (mid 650s) simply won’t let lenders take on the debt. I realize a cosigner for the loan is an option, but unfortunately no one likes me that much. I legit don’t know where else to turn for help in figuring out this ass backwards situation. 

I feel like my best bet is to pay off other credit card debts and get my credit score up slightly so that I may be able to refinance. But I wanted to see if there may be other options I haven't explored.
