financialindependence,How To: Pensions and FI,"I keep seeing the question of ""How do I handle pensions?"" in relation to financial independence, so I thought I might write up a more general answer to this question. Look for LOTS of good info in the comments since I'm just trying to start a (hopefully) intelligent conversation about this.

Q1) How do I account for a pension in determining my FIRE number?

A1) FIRE is about achieving the INCOME you need to live the lifestyle you want without continuing to work. For non-pension folks, this means saving up enough to draw 4% of your investments annually (the 4% Safe Withdrawal Rate) to give you the income you need. If you have a pension you simply reduce the amount of income you need from your investments by the amount of your pension IF THE PENSION IS SAFE.

Example: You want to retire with $75,000/yr in income. You have a SAFE pension that will provide $50,000/yr in income. In that case, you need your investments to provide another $25,000 in income per year. At a 4% SWR you need another $625,000 in investments to give you that additional $25K ($25K divided by 0.04).

If your pension is less reliable, you'll need to hedge your bets. Honestly, I can't give you a magic formula for that: it's a guess you have to make about how reliable your pension is. If you are with the US government, I'd go 100%. State? Some states may renege on providing the **fully** promised pension (Illinois), but I don't expect any state to default completely. It's a tough call, but you should get most of what is promised to you. Corporate? Well... I can't even begin to advise you, so let's leave that to the comments.

Q2) How do I account for my *expected* pension in determining my net worth?

A2) OK... this is a bit complicated. If you actually stay in your job long enough to get your full pension benefits, then you can create a ""virtual net worth"" by saying your pension is the equivalent of what you would get from investments that gave you the same amount of income via 4% safe withdrawal rate. If your pension is really safe, though (e.g.: U.S. federal goverment), that actually understates the value of your pension since your risk of failure is really small. Then again, if your pension is a corporate pension where the company might go bust, this might be optimistic. Again, look to the comments for good information outside my most general suggestions.

Example: You have a pension that provides $25K/yr in income. That's the 4% SWR investment of $625,000. You can add that to your ""virtual net worth"".

Now, this is COMPLETELY dependent on whether of not you really do stay in your current job long enough to earn that full pension. NO ONE can tell you if you will or not. That's up to you.

Likewise, ""virtual net worth"" is significant, but different from ""real"" net worth. If your spouse is kidnapped, real net worth is more important than ""virtual"" net worth. No kidnapper is going to accept a payment plan! That said, I hope this starts a good discussion of how we can look at pensions as regards to their impact on our FIRE ambitions.

personalfinance,Can you still qualify for American Oppertunity Credit if you received Federal Pell Grant?,"TurboTax says I meet the criteria for the American Oppertunity Credit but I really don't want to be wrong and be penalized for it.

* 25 year old single no dependents

* 1098-T says I am at least half-time student

My first semester (Fall2019) costs came to $1,707, but tuition waiver&amp;Pell Grant a covered $1,056 so I only had to pay out of pocket $651.

I entered the $1,056 into TurboTax for my ""scholarships/grants/fellowships"" and entered $280 for my ""other education expenses"" (books). 

I would think that because I entered all the numbers accurately the software would also be accurate in reporting that I qualify for a $931 American Oppertunity Credit. But I have zero experience with this kind of thing and it frankly seems way too good to be true.

I have a couple of questions that I was hoping you guys might be able to help out with. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of 2018 (account statement shows late November) my bank closed a 401k from a company i only worked at for a few months. The account balance was under a certain threshold that the company required to keep the account open, so they closed the account and cut me a check. The account was roughly $930 and the check was $720. I contacted my bank and said I wanted to roll it over to my current workplace plan, so i got a certified check for $930 and completed the rollover docs. Account statements show that the rollover completed early January 2019. 

My understanding is that since i rolled it over and i reinvested the entire amount (not the taxed amount) that i can deduct the \~$210 that was taken out by taxes. So my questions are: 

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Is this True? 

2.) Was i supposed to do this last year? 

a. Maybe i did do this last year... Would i be able to spot this on the 1040 ?

b. if i didn't do this... is it bad? i assume not, essentially its a free $200 to the Feds right? 

3.) If this is an item for this year, what part of my taxes section would i do this on (I use TurboTax)

personalfinance,Solar Tax Credit,"I've been searching through solar tax credit questions, but haven't found the answer I'm looking for. Trying to find a tax advisor, but looking for answers in the meantime.

Looking to install solar on our property and finding the tax credits confusing. Someone explained them to me and I thought I had it all figured out, but then tried to fill out the tax forms as though we had done a solar project for 2019 and it got confusing again. So I'll lay out a scenario here and maybe someone has insight into it.

You work and pay taxes through your paycheck all year then go to file taxes. Your gross tax liability is $3,100. You paid out $3,500 in your paycheck. Normally you file and with regular credits (example: child credit) and you get a $2,400 refund. This year you bought solar and your credit is $5,800. So on your taxes your gross liability goes to $0. Now, I understand you carry over the unused $2,700 of your credit and can claim it the next year. All things being equal, your tax liability will go to $400 that year and back up to $3,100 the year after when your credit is used up. But what about your other credits? What is the refund check you receive from the fed? Is it the $3,500 you paid out? Or is it the $3,500 you get as credit for the solar, plus the $2,400 you would normally get as a refund for other credits?

My situation gets even more muddled because I work in a different state than I live. So I can claim a state tax credit as well. Given that I pay no taxes to my state all year, I always owe. Liability for the state is say $2,000, but after credits I actually only owe say $150. Same question applies here, do I get a refund from the state for the $2,000 or just not owe the $150?

personalfinance,Pay loan in default status in full or rehabilitate?,"Hello all.. I posted this in r/StudentLoans also but I thought the fine folks here might have some good insight as well!

This might be a _little_ long. Bear with me.

**TLDR**: Trying to decide between paying off a defaulted loan in full or starting rehabilitation and paying for tuition out of pocket. Both options drain my sister's savings account. Trying to figure out what the best option is and if paying off the default loan in full will allow enough time to let the financial aid come through and apply for private loans. Also would like to keep the negative impact to credit to a minimum.


So this is actually my sister's situation. Her and I are trying to figure out the best course of action. She has a federal student loan (approximately 6k) that is in default status and preventing her from receiving federal student financial aid this semester and applying for private student loans to cover the remaining tuition balance if the federal aid does not cover it (a la Sallie Mae). We are considering two options:

1. Pay off the defaulted loan in full (at the compromised balance of $5800
  - This would basically empty her savings account. BUT I'm guessing she would be out of default status immediately and her financial aid will then go through and then she would possibly be able to apply for a private loan to cover the rest of tuition
2. Start the rehabilitation process for the defaulted loan and get on a payment plan for her term bill using out of pocket money (~$7800) for the semester to prevent her from being dropped from her classes.
  - From my understanding (and what she got from multiple calls the the US department of education number), she would be eligible for federal aid in 5 months and the loan would be out of default status at the end of the 9 month period of consecutive payments towards the loan. So no private loans until the end of the 9 months. 

With either of these options she will be draining her savings account but if she goes on rehabilitation she will **for sure** be able to stay in school for this semester since she will be going on the payment plan.

A couple of questions currently preventing us from making up our minds:

  - In regards to paying the loan balance in full...
    -  Rehabilitation removes the record of the default from her credit history. Would the same thing occur if she were to pay off the loan in full tomorrow? In other words, if she just paid the balance in full, would it have the same affect that a rehabilitation would in terms of her credit report?
    - This also drains her savings account so we would need to be able to get federal aid and a private loan quickly in order to prevent her from being dropped from her classes due to non-payment. 
  - In regards to rehabilitaion and paying for the tuition out of pocket...
    - The loan will be in default status for 9 months leaving her no time to get private loans for fall semester (if needed) since it will basically occur during fall semester. She will be eligible for federal aid after 5 months which is fine. There is the possibility that it will only cover a small portion of next semester's term bill at which point she might be SOL for any additional loans.

What do you guys think is the best course of action? I'm leaning more towards paying off the defaulted loan in full tomorrow and getting the federal aid to come through as long as the record of default comes off her credit report. Looking forward to any and all advice and thanks so much in advance!!!",finance

hydro,Kratky to soil methods with results,"Early in the season I trialed two different methods I thought up to convert soil plants to Kratky.

Method one was to make a rockwool box with 5 strips of rockwool. One on the bottom of a mesh pot, with the other 4 strips making up the sides. I placed the plant's roots in the box and filled it up with clay pebbles to weight it. The bottom of the rock wool was submerged into the nutes but the roots stayed above.

Method two was to cut 3 big holes in the mesh pot in a triangular pattern. I then ripped, not cut the roots into 3 equal sections and fed them through the mesh pot. I then filled the mesh pot up with clay balls.

Here's the results:

Pic 1 is using the rockwool box  
Pic 2 is using the roots rip method  
Pic 3 and 4 are of a plant using the ripped roots  
method, but the roots either gave up or didn't feed off  
the falling nutrient level fast enough.

Assessing the subsequent root ball, I would say both techniques had equal success. ..but I'm cheap. And rockwool isn't. ..so I will solely use the rip method next time 📷

I’ve scoured the NRC’s website but can’t find anything for Idaho or otherwise.

CryptoCurrency,The Cantillon Effect and Wealth Inequality,"Have you heard of the Cantillon effect?

Wealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.

This rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.

Whenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.

When the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.

Also, those the very top are often diversified, so even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.

The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.

**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about**.

In accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. If it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.

Under modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.

Under this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.

This is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.

In a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.

Under central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.

In both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.

Thus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.

For instance, the financial sector contributed massively to the growth of billionaire’s wealth.

One of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.

In a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited. In other words, the phenomenon of **asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.

Asset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.

1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.
2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.
3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.

Hence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.

Despite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.

**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.

I have always been good at holding down jobs and living a pretty comfortable life but I haven't really thought much about the future and retirement. With both of my parents gone now, I'm sorta thinking that it's time to grow up and think deeper about all of this stuff.

My current situation: I'm in my late 30's, I've worked as a teacher for the last 8 years with a state sponsored retirement plan, I have about 150k saved up, no real investments outside of 20 shares of Apple stock gifted to me years ago. It's just my wife and I as two DINKs (no kids planned, just our pup).  

My goals: 

\- Keep working towards retirement even though I'm rather skeptical about the upcoming decades...

\- Buy a home and investment property, if possible

\- Diversify

\- Retire early, of course! Who doesn't? 

The new inherited numbers:

\- roughly 100k in IRAs

\- roughly 400k in investments

Big Questions:

1) Do I get a financial adviser or can I learn this stuff on my own? Any recommend resources? I'm worried about taxes...

2) I'm considering Vangaurd for simplicity sake, good choice? I understand the mutual funds thing that comes along with this choice vs. more control.

3) Do I liquidate half of the investments and put them in a high yield savings account because I'm worried the market is about to dive after all of this crazy growth and reinvest later in the market or in real estate once things mellow? 

4) Should my wife and I get life/disability insurance?

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance,"I currently have 13 years left on a 15 year mortgage. I refinanced 2 years ago from a 30 year that I had 22 years left on. 

I had a 5.5% interest rate on the original 30 year, it was an FHA so I also had mortgage insurance that was able to eliminate with a refi. 

I now have a 4.75% on the current 15 year mortgage. Balance is $127,000. I pay my insurance and taxes through escrow with the mortgage payment. 

I see that the interest rates have gone down again. Would a refi be worth it again, only two years later? 

Florida, and I’m 30, if it matters. Thank you for your time.",finance
personalfinance,"30-Day Challenge #2: Check your percentages! (February, 2020)","&gt; *Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.* —[someone](https://www.snopes.com/quotes/einstein/interest.asp)

# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Check your percentages!**  There are two different challenges this month depending on your position in the [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) list of steps.

1. **If you're on steps 0 through 3, do the first challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Building an emergency fund
  - Paying down expensive debt (interest rate over 10%)

2. **If you're on steps 4 through 6, do the second challenge.**  That's you if you're:
  - Saving for retirement
  - Investing for other long-term goals

3. **If you're not sure which challenge applies best to you (e.g., not saving for retirement yet, but don't have credit card debt), feel free to pick and choose from either challenge.**

4. **Bonus points: do both challenges!**

# First challenge

Your challenge is to pursue improving your interest rates.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 2 or more of the following things:

* If you have debts, compile information on each debt including the type of debt, the amount owed, and the interest rate. Also [find out your credit score and review your credit report.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%2830-day+challenge+get+on+top+of+your+credit%29&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=year)
* If you have credit card debt that you are carrying from month-to-month, [call up your credit card company and make a request to lower your interest rate](https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/how-to-lower-credit-card-interest-rate/).
* If you have enough money in your checking account to cover *at least* one month of expenses, start building a second tier to your emergency fund by opening a high interest savings account that pays at least 1% interest rate and deposit $50 or more into it.
* If you already have a savings account, [research your options](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/rates/) and consider moving your savings account to a bank paying a higher rate.  (The wiki has some [common recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions).)

# Second challenge

Your challenge is to audit your investment expenses and emergency fund.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 3 or more of the following things:

* Request a fee schedule/statement from your financial advisor (if you have one).
* Request a fee schedule/statement from the administrator of your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan (or find out your fees by logging into your plan account).
* Look through recent statements to see if there are any charges you don't recognize.
* Calculate your [blended expense ratio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios#Blended_expense_ratio).
* Evaluate your emergency fund and adjust it accordingly if your expenses and/or risk tolerance have changed. If you raised it, make a plan to meet your new e-fund goal sometime in the future.

The idea here is that you might uncover some expenses you didn't know you were paying, which in turn might give you a reason to make a change for the better. The impact of [costs on investments can be depressing](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost). If you find a clean slate, sleep well knowing that your money is working for you first and your investment company second. Another way to sleep well is to ensure you have enough set aside for emergencies. You may have set up your emergency fund goal and met it a number of years ago and perhaps times have changed for you. It's a great time to ensure you have an appropriate amount set aside for your expenses and risk tolerance.

stocks,"If I could go back in time 20+ years, I never would have started 'trading'. Remorse of a previous investor.","I hope this post helps someone out there to avoid the mistakes that I have made.

When I was a kid, my step dad helped me invest $850 I had saved up in my first stock.   The first tech boom was just a few years away.

By the time I was a teen I had a full portfolio and was rocking it.  I had around $50k invested.  All from money I made working at a flower shop, computer repair shop, (and selling a bit of pot too if I am being honest), and buying stocks.  I was going to be the next Warren Buffett of course ... lol.

In 1999-2001 day trading took the internet by storm.  Even your cab driver had trading tips back then.  I got sucked in with many others, and I also got wiped out.  By early adult hood, I had blown out my account to 0 on dumb options plays, not knowing what I was doing and taking idiotic risk that I didn't fully understand.

For a decade I avoided the market mostly, even though it had once been such a passion.  I got a degree.  Went into a different industry.

Sadly at some point along the way again, I thought I could be a 'trader'.  I went through similar cycles as the first time (perhaps with a bit more knowledge, wisdom and maturity than the first time).  The game is even harder now though.  The HFT's and Algo's are programmed just so perfectly to squeeze out your money, even if it is one penny at a time.  Once again, after wasting many years, I found myself at the bottom.

I will spare you the rest and jump straight to the ending:  I am nearing 36 years old, and my portfolio is nearly non existent.  I am not poor, and I own a nice little business ... but I am also filled with regret.

Had I never started trading, and had I just continued investing, I would probably be a multi millionaire based on the trajectory I was headed by this point.  I also would have gotten to skip many years of shame, doubt and guilt.

The amount of people in this day and age that are actually successful traders are so god damn few and far in between.  There is a reason the entire world has moved to quant systems.  Computers trade better than humans filled with emotions.

Moral of the story for you youngins' out there:  Buy and hold.  Maybe don't buy today at the peak of a fed induced 10+ year bull run and wait for a market correction in the next few years (ironic that I would be giving financial advice by the way), but when the opportunity strikes .... buy and hold.  Make smart investments.   Don't take dumb un-necessary risks.  Sometimes the boring stocks are the absolute best ones.

The stock market shouldn't be exciting.  It shouldn't be something that makes you lose sleep or feel anxiety.  It shouldn't be 'fun'.

Hope someone gains something from this post.",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 3rd, 2020.

# **Stocks stumble into February, one of the weakest months for market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/31/stocks-stumble-into-february-one-of-the-weakest-months-for-stocks.html)**
*****
&gt; As stocks enter the month of February, worries about the coronavirus that slammed stocks in January could continue to be a big market catalyst in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; There are lots of other possible drivers for markets, including the January jobs report Friday and other key economic news, which comes as worries grow that the economy was already weakening even without the impact of the rapidly spreading virus. There are also dozens of earnings reports, including Alphabet, Disney and Merck.
*****
&gt; Another focus for markets could be the Iowa Democratic presidential caucus Monday, where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders could possibly win over former Vice President Joseph Biden.
*****
&gt; But the virus headlines could dominate, rattling stocks and continuing to drive investors into the safety of bonds. U.S. airlines Friday said they were discontinuing flights to China, as Beijing tries to contain the transmission of the virus that had infected nearly 10,000 people by Friday.
*****
&gt; China’s mainland stock markets reopen Sunday night New York time, and investors will be watching for the ripple effects from that expected decline, though traders have been actively trading Chinese market ETFs.
*****
&gt; # Correction or pull back?
&gt; Stocks are limping into February after January’s disappointing losses, and analysts see more selling ahead as virus headlines rattle markets. But they are divided on whether the selling will soon be capped, or the pullback will reach 5 to 10%.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8% Friday to 3,225, its worst day since October. It was down 2.1% for the week, and ended the month with a 0.2% loss, its first negative month in five.
*****
&gt; “February is the third worst month of the year, with an average negative decline of 0.1%, and it’s been up only 53% of the time, versus an average gain for all months of 0.7%,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said September and August are the worst and second weakest months for the S&amp;P 500, going back to World War II. In general, stocks are higher 60% of the time, over all months.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was about 3.4% from its Jan. 17 high. “I call a decline of 1% to 5% noise. The closer we get to 5%, the louder the noise,” said Stovall, adding the S&amp;P could decline as much as 10%.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s a good possibility, just based on valuation—over 19.6 times forward earnings. That’s the most since 2002,” he said. “By my metrics, we were overvalued by 9 to 12%, so we end up with a deep pullback or a shallow correction.” A correction is when the market loses 10% from its high.
*****
&gt; “People have definitely been buying volatility to protect themselves from more of a leg down,” said Patrick Kernan, CEO of Cardinal Capital Corp. “We believe, like last Friday, when the coronavirus really started coming to a head, that people were very nervous ahead of the weekend.” Kernan, who trades S&amp;P options, said investors do not appear to expect a very sharp decline, but they do see more volatility and more downside for stocks.
*****
&gt; RBC chief U.S. equity strategist Lori Calvasina said she has been expecting a 5 to 10% decline, even before the virus, but she expected it to be triggered by the primary season. After Monday’s Iowa caucus, the New Hampshire primary is the week after, and Super Tuesday with about a dozen primaries is March 3.
*****
&gt; “I still think it’s so early. If you were to see Sanders win, I don’t thinkthe market would like it, but I wouldn’t really change my view,” she said. “I still view it as a 5 to 10% pullback. The election has always been a central contributor to that,” she said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said it’s still early in the process and markets could ignore the Iowa vote, even though investors see Sanders’ policies as negative for stocks. Sanders supports Medicare for all; would end oil and gas fracking, and would raise taxes for individuals and companies.
*****
&gt; “Only 16 percent of those who have won the Iowa primary have gone on to win the presidency,” he said. Investors do see Sanders as having less chance against President Donald Trump than former Vice President Joseph Biden, who has lagged him in Iowa polls.
*****
&gt; Stovall said investors will certainly be monitoring economic data in the week ahead, after fourth quarter GDP showed a slower pace for consumers and business spending remains depressed. This past week, economists were penciling in a short-lived hit to first quarter growth from the virus before it bounces back in the second quarter. But the first quarter could also see a half percentage point hit from Boeing’s production shut down.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the virus could shave 0.4 percentage points from first quarter growth but it would mostly recover by the second quarter.
*****
&gt; Stovall said he’s watching “a combination of earnings and the jobs report because earnings reports could give clues as to what companies are thinking about the virus and the jobs report should give us additional clues about how strong the economy is,” he said.
*****
&gt; The expectations that the virus could hit global growth has sent Treasury yields sharply lower this week, and the dollar has weakened against the majors. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.52% Friday afternoon, and strategists say it could continue to move lower. Yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; The 10-year has also fallen below the yield on the 3-month bill, and the curve has become “inverted.” An inverted yield is a recession warning, and those fears are rising again due to the potential impact of the virus on China’s economy and the world economy.

# What a Difference Two Weeks Makes!

&gt; The tone of the market sure did change over the last two weeks! The image below is from our Trend Analyzer screen of US indices as of the close two weeks ago on 1/17. Heading into that weekend, the major US averages were all at 'Overbought' or 'Extreme Overbought' levels, and while their Trend ratings were all positive, the Timing scores for nearly all of them was 'Poor'.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/011720-US-Indices-1024x494.png))**

&gt; Fast-forwarding to the present, it's a completely different picture for the major US indices. Today, not a single one of the major US index ETFs is overbought, and a few of them are even oversold. Here's the silver lining, though; since all of their Trend ratings are still positive, their timing scores all currently rank as 'Good'. While not what we would classify as a 'Perfect' set up right now, for investors who have been waiting for a pullback, the window is starting to open.

# Short Circuit

&gt; It was just a week ago that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) gapped sharply higher to record highs on the back of strong earnings from Intel (INTC). So much for that rally. By the end of the day last Friday, the SOX was actually down over 1%, and outside of a rally this past Tuesday, it has traded down every day since. From record highs on Friday morning, the SOX is closing out this week down more than 8% from last Friday's highs and below its 50-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since October. For the last several months, the 50-DMA has acted as support for the SOX, so we'll be watching closely to see how the index holds up in the days ahead. We've repeatedly discussed the importance of the semis as a barometer of the health of the broader market, so it will be important for the group to find its footing soon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/013120-Semis-Chart.png))**

&gt; In terms of the SOX's individual components, the weakness has been broad-based. Since its closing high on 1/23, every member of the SOX besides INTC is down, and INTC is barely up! The average performance of the index's components since 1/23 has been a decline of nearly 9%, and a third of the components are down by double-digit percentages. Semis had been a leadership group for the market as recently as last week, but after the declines over the last five trading days, the average 2020 performance of stocks in the index is a decline of 3.5% and only eight components are up. Even for the semis, this has been a quick reversal.

# 49ers Or Chiefs?

&gt; The Super Bowl Indicator suggests stocks rise for the full year when the Super Bowl winner has come from the original National Football League (now the NFC), but when an original American Football League (now the AFC) team has won, stocks have fallen. We would be the first to admit that this indicator has no connection to the stock market, but “data don’t lie”: The S&amp;P 500 Index has performed better, and posted positive gains with greater frequency, over the past 53 Super Bowl games when NFC teams have won. Of course, it doesn’t always work, as stocks did great last year even though the dreaded Patriots (from the AFC) won the Super Bowl.

&gt; A simpler way to look at the Super Bowl indicator is to look at the average gain for the S&amp;P 500 when the NFC has won versus the AFC—and ignore the history of the franchises. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this similar set of criteria has produced an average price return of 10.2% when an NFC team has won, compared with a return of 6.8% with an AFC winner. An NFC winner has produced a positive year 79% of the time, while the S&amp;P 500 has been up only 64% of the time when the winner came from the AFC.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/super-bowl-indicator.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The 49ers have won the Super Bowl five times, putting them just behind the six that the Patriots and Steelers have won. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have won the Super Bowl only once, exactly 50 years ago.

&gt; The year the Chiefs won the Super Bowl (1970), the S&amp;P 500 was virtually flat. Meanwhile, we’ve seen some impressive market returns the years the 49ers made it to the big game. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged nearly 21% in the six years they made it to the final game, and 19% in the five years they won.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bulls-are-happy-the-49ers-are-in-the-super-bowl.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “There have been 53 Super Bowl winners, yet only 20 teams account for those wins,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And wouldn’t you know it, the 49ers have recorded the third-best market return out of those 20 teams when they win.”

&gt; Here’s a breakdown of the 20 Super Bowl winners and how the S&amp;P 500 has done following their victories.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/how-does-the-SP-500-index-do-when-you-team-wins.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; LPL Research would like to reiterate that in no way shape or form do we recommend investing based on this data, but those of us outside of New England can all agree we’re glad the Patriots aren’t in the game! Have a great Super Bowl weekend everyone.

# Viral Outbreak Ends Period of Market Calm

&gt; Fears that the deadly coronavirus would spread further around the globe intensified Monday and led to the biggest one-day drop in the S&amp;P 500 Index since October 8, 2019. In fact, it was the first time the index moved 1% in either direction since early October—spanning 71 trading days. Not only that, but the index’s streak of 30 consecutive days without back-to-back declines, tying the longest such streak in over 60 years as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, came to an end. Stocks had been eerily calm.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/71-days-in-a-row-without-a-1-change-for-the-SP500-index.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We know from history these calm periods haven’t lasted very long. We were due for some volatility with stocks up about 15% in less than four months and valuations elevated. But a catalyst for a sell-off wasn’t obvious after the U.S.-China phase-one trade deal was signed on January 15. Economic data has been better globally, central banks remain supportive, and the major escalation in the U.S.-Iran conflict had minimal market impact. Then the coronavirus outbreak happened.

&gt; “The coronavirus outbreak brings uncertainty to markets, and investors are understandably nervous,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While economic activity in China is being impacted, particularly travel-related businesses, we expect limited U.S. economic impact as with SARS in 2002–2003, bird flu in 2006, and Zika in 2016.”

&gt; More than 100 deaths have been confirmed out of more than 4,500 cases of the coronavirus. Initial reports suggest this virus may be less deadly than SARS, which led to 774 deaths with more than four times the mortality rate as corona. Our hope at this point is that the current outbreak will be better contained and less deadly than SARS.

&gt; We certainly don’t want to minimize human losses, however, our job is to provide you information on the potential impact to the markets. History tells us that the economic and market impact after potentially similar events tended to be modest and short-lived. The SARS outbreak started in November 2002, global equities bottomed in March 2003, and the outbreak was fully contained by July 2003—several months into the 2003–2007 bull market. The temporary loss of global output was quickly recovered in the third quarter of 2003.

&gt; So while this situation is fluid and unnerving, we would advise suitable investors to stick with their long-term investing plans where appropriate and focus on generally supportive fundamentals of the economy, interest rates, and corporate profits.

# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

&gt; A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&amp;P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).

# Market May be Immune to Coronavirus

&gt; Over the years the market has built up a rather strong immunity to viruses, outbreak, epidemics and pandemics. While economies and communities around the world have suffered from these outbreaks and the horrific human toll they have taken, the market has proven to be resilient.

&gt; We took a look back at 14 previous such contagions since 1950 and how the market performed right after the disease was confirmed publically by health officials and where the market was 3, 6 and 12 months later.

&gt; HIV/AIDS continue to be an ongoing problem and is the longest running, widest spread and deadliest infectious human disease since the Spanish Flu that killed 50-100 million people worldwide from 1918-1920. HIV/AIDS is estimate to have taken the lives of some 30 million people.

&gt; However, from the time these epidemics have become known to the public at large they have had little negative impact on the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. As you can see in the table here the market was weaker during the outbreaks of the first three on the list, but there were arguably other factors that had a greater impact than these diseases.

&gt; In 1957, during the Asian Flu pandemic the market was pushed into a bear market by a hawkish fed that had been raising interest rates culminating in a bear market bottom in October 1957. The downdraft surrounding the Hong Kong Flu in 1968 was likely cause more by heightened hostilities in the Vietnam War and the related protests and events in the USA that culminated in the bear market bottom on May 26, 1970.

&gt; When the HIV/AIDS epidemic became known in 1981 the market was suffering from the nasty double-dip recession from 1980-1982. The Iraq War held the market down in early 2003 during the SARS outbreak. The sovereign debt crisis and the downgrade of US debt in 2011 likely hurt the market more than the horrendous Haitian Cholera outbreak. The Measles scare in the US in late 2014-early 2015 had little impact on the market, though we suffered a mini-bear in 2015-2016 due to the EU Sovereign Debt Crisis, Brexit fears and the Chinese bear market.

&gt; So while the new Wuhan Coronavirus is a major health and economic concern, especially to the affected areas, if history is any guide, the market is not likely to suffer from it.

personalfinance,How should I work this out?,"Hello everyone 

I am about to redo my mortgage as I want to move house  and as I've made a few dollars on my current house I have the option of using some equity to pay off my 10k car loan.

Now I have a 10k car loan which has 33 months left to go with interest of 3.33%

I have a option of getting a mortgage at 1.82% but over about 20 years 

So would I be better keeping the car loan and paying it off in a few years but at a higher interest rate  or adding the price  onto my mortgage at less interest rate but over a much longer time frame?

Thanks for any advice",finance

Is there any way that the fact I've been paying it for as long can help me out? I really want to be paying less for this than I am.",finance

personalfinance,Halo with employer / tax office UK,"I am currently employed by my company and have been so for over three years. Earlier in the year I recurved a letter from HMRC saying I owe £75 in tax, the letter stated that it would change my tax code and take the money that way so I just thought nothing of it. Then a month or so after I received another letter from HMRC saying I need to fill in a self assessment. 

I rang up HMRC (with great difficulty) and they states that I was not employed so they couldn’t change my tax code. Meaning there is now a late payment so a self assessment has to be filed. My work said that no P45 has been sent to HMRC, so they do not know why this has occurred. When speaking to HMRC they also told me they had received no tax for this year however my work claim to be paying it. 

I filled in the self assessment unaware of how to do it or anything to do with it. I couldn’t remember my income from some years so I used what the numbers from what HMRC have said they have received. I also managed to get a PAYE reference from work so that I could claim that I was employed. Finally I had sorted it out and thought they would just ask for the £75 and that be done with. 

Anyway jump to now and I have received a letter from HMRC saying I owe £2500. And I have no idea on what to do. What confuses me most is that I put the exact same numbers in that the tax office already had so what has it jumped from £75 to £2500. They have also thrown in some late payment fees as well as interest rates on top. 

I am going to seek a tax accountant to look through my books to help me out but I need as much advice as I can get, because I feel that my work has made a mistake and it’s me who is paying for it.",finance

When speaking to HMRC they also told me they had received no tax for this year however my work claim to be paying it. 

I filled in the self assessment unaware of how to do it or anything to do with it. I couldn’t remember my income from some years so I used what the numbers from what HMRC have said they have received. I also managed to get a PAYE reference from work so that I could claim that I was employed. Finally I had sorted it out and thought they would just ask for the £75 and that be done with. 

Anyway jump to now and I have received a letter from HMRC saying I owe £2500. And I have no idea on what to do. What confuses me most is that I put the exact same numbers in that the tax office already had so what has it jumped from £75 to £2500. They have also thrown in some late payment fees as well as interest rates on top. 

I am going to seek a tax accountant to look through my books to help me out but I need as much advice as I can get, because I feel that my work has made a mistake and it’s me who is paying for it.",finance

personalfinance,Please check my debt plan and give me feedback,"Hello Reddit and yes this is another debt thread…I know sighs right?! I have already gotten a plan together which I have been using for about a year now and I want to make sure that it is the best option for me long term. My information is as follows I am currently a 30 year old male with no degree, yet. Currently in school for computer science which I am paying for out of pocket to not go into any more debt, I am currently a year or a year and half out from graduation. I live in an average cost of living area and made gross 51K this year. I have a decent job with relative job security as well. I have a loose budget because I have a difficult time tracking expense categories. Things like Mint seem to put things automatically into the wrong category for me. Current debt situation is 

I have 3 credit cards as the following:

CC1- $0.00 owned on this card and I have locked the card, cut it up, but kept it open.

CC2 – 2,546.13 owned current it is at 0% interest rate until March 18th then goes to 17.49%

CC3 – 5,800.00 owned currently it is at 6.74%.
I have my mortgage with 84,000 owned at 3.87% on a 30 year fixed

Sadly I have two student loans as well 
SL1 – 2559.71 is at 6.8%
SL2 – 7040.33 is at 6.8% as well.

I am currently contributing 6 percent to my 401k 4 percent to Roth and 2 percent to traditional. 6% is the max that is matched by my company and I have currently 19340.15 in my 401k. I have built up a 1K savings account in order to pay for emergencies should I need to. My concerns are my car which is older and will break down sooner than later.  My relationship as well is getting to the point she is expecting a ring. My goal is to be out of most of my debt before 2020 ends so I can shift the money I am spending on debt towards long term savings goals.
My current plan has been the following I have been putting 500.00 towards CC2 every two weeks in order to get it paid off before the balance transfer 0 percent promo runs out. All other bills I have been making the min. payment on. When CC2 is paid off I was going to shift that 500.00 payment towards CC3 which if I make 1K payment a month on will put me paying off the card by Nov at the latest. Hopefully getting a tax return which I am not sure if I should put towards the CC or put into the savings for the car possibility. Question is should I cut back my contribution to my 401k in order to pay down these debts faster and then when they are paid off increase my contribution while being able to put more money towards my long term savings or am I looking at this debt in the wrong light. Currently I am stretched pretty thin with bills and this debt. I do go out some, but I have trimmed a lot of my expenses down.

personalfinance,Should I invest or pay down debt?,"Hi all! Long time lurker, first time poster.

I have recently fully financed my emergency fund with $11,000 (my monthly expenses are $1430 so that's \~7.5 months) and I'm looking to see where else I can put my money. I previously contributed about $220 a month to my emergency fund, so that's freed up money that I want to redetermine where it can be best utilized. 

**Salary &amp; Retirement**

I make $54,000 a year. My employer puts 5% of my salary in a 403B and I put in an additional 3%, which is that's their max matching. I could elect to put in more, but they don't contribute over 5% so I prioritize my Roth. I will max out my Roth IRA this year through monthly savings and some extra money I came across from tax returns/side gig work/etc.

I'd like to retire relatively early, so retirement is important to me, as is having diversified investments (money I can draw on before 59 1/2). Also of note: my wife is a medical student and currently has no income, but in 5 years will be making $350,000 annually, phasing me out from Roth contributions. She will also have $250,000 in student loans, so our tax situation will be complicated in a few years and I'll be in a much higher tax bracket.

**Debt**

I have no credit card debt (I use a credit card to pay for monthly expenses and pay it off in full each month). I have an $8,000 car loan at a 3.25% interest rate. 

**Options**

Should I:

a) continue to save into my emergency fund in my bank's savings account (.05% interest rate) to have more cash on hand

b) pay down my car loan

c) invest the extra $220 in non-retirement investment accounts

d) something else, or a combo?

personalfinance,Please help! Need to decide what to do with my student loans (refinance or keep federal through great lakes),"I have been working with a financial adviser for other aspects of my money, but he referred me to some other company when it came to student loans and truthfully I feel like the guy I have been talking to doesn't really know what is best for me and just keeps pushing for me to refinance. Additionally, I know a lot of people are going to say to try and aggressively pay these down - I get that and will try to put as much extra as I can toward them. However I haven't gotten my first paycheck yet and so I really don't know what my takehome is going to be and how much extra I will have. I'm not in a position in life to just throw all my money at these loans (trying to save for a house/kids). So here's a breakdown of things:

* Salary: 105000 yearly (again, no idea what my takehome will be yet)
* Loans: 252k total
* 25 year payment plan through Great Lakes = monthly payments of \~1700, and then drop off after 4 years to 1400 (one of my loans gets paid off). The interest rates of these loans are high, 6.8-7%
* Refinance through Earnest (best deal I could get) = 20 year payment plan of payments \~1700 a month, interest rate of 5%

So, my payments will be the same either way, but I realize I'd pay more in the long run by keeping them through Great Lakes because it's an extra 5 years. I'm not against refinancing, but I would hate to lose the protecting of having federal loans that if something were to happen I could easily switch back to income based payments. And after 4 years my payments would drop if I kept them federal, whereas if I refinance they will always be the same. So really, I'm just not sure what to do and need to make my decision soon since these loans are coming out of deferment next month. Thanks all.

personalfinance,"Evaluating ""will tax rates in retirement be higher?"" for Roth vs Traditional","# The Common Retirement Saving Dilemma

It is very common to hear variations on these statements:

* Picking Roth vs traditional depends on future tax rates. We can't know them!
* Tax rates now are at historical lows

These statements are **true**. They do dictate whether or not someone should contribute to Roth or pretax in 401k/IRA/403b/etc.

However, what most people do not understand is that the impact of changing tax rates over time has been overwhelmingly on very high income earners - mid to high six figures or more.

This resource - [https://qz.com/74271/income-tax-rates-since-1913/](https://qz.com/74271/income-tax-rates-since-1913/) \- does something very insightful. It takes your current income and adjusts for historical inflation, to determine your inflation adjusted salary over time - then calculates what your effective taxes would be in those historical years.

\*if someone finds one that includes more recent years please let me know!

# Experimentation

Take some time to play with this tool for your expected drawdown in FIRE (or conversion ladder amounts). Take a number that is reasonable for your situation and start exploring.

For example, if you plan on paying taxes on $100k/year\* in retirement as a married couple. Put in $100k and select ""married."" This is a high number for many folks here as far as FIRE goes.

Some really important observations for this hypothetical:

* The highest effective tax rate over time was \~28%, immediately after WWII
* The last decades were lower than before, but only marginally - for most of the last 50 years, the effective federal tax rate was between 17-23%
* Putting in $1M or $10M a year makes you see how much more dramatic tax brackets impacted high earners

At $60k/year taxable income, the last time your effective federal tax rate was above 20% was the 1960s.

\* Note that this is also taxable income, not actual converted income. The standard deduction has increased over time (as well as personal exemptions) so there is additional space in your ""income"" for tax free conversions that is difficult to account for here. This has been true historically with exemptions and a lower standard deduction and is now more simple with a higher standard deduction.

# Key Takeaways

Using historical inflation adjusted tax brackets, it is highly unlikely your effective federal tax rate will be meaningfully higher than your marginal tax rate now, even in worst case historical scenarios.

This means you should always prioritize traditional over Roth unless:

1. Your taxable income in retirement from retirement accounts will be well into the mid-six figures
2. You have **significant** non-retirement income in retirement (pensions, inherited RMDs, massive capital gains, etc)
   1. I suspect the overwhelming majority of folks here do not fall into this category
3. You believe effective tax on your FIRE income will be worse than the last 80 years of tax brackets
4. Your marginal federal rate is 12% or lower
   1. There are actually still situations where this make sense to do traditional even when in 12% bracket however it's outside the scope of what I'm writing about here because it's a lot more complicated and involves drawdown strategies in early retirement
5. You prefer fully accepting failure mode of paying too much in taxes now (via Roth contributions) over possibly paying more later (via your money growing too much)
6. You will blow the tax savings you get from traditional vs Roth (there's no point in optimizing your savings only to waste the savings)

tl;dr: the ""tax rates in retirement"" argument almost never makes Roth preferable over traditional",finance

personalfinance,Filing taxes... why do I owe $4K?,"I feel like I am missing something here.  I am attempting to file my taxes through TurboTax (should probably just find a CPA) and something doesn't seem to be adding up.

I got a new job in October of last year, and before starting my new job I sold some RSUs that I was granted from my old job.  Keep in mind the capital gains on these RSUs were MINIMAL.  I'm talking like a couple dollars each.

When I went to file my taxes this year, I am being told I owe over $4K and I am assuming this is related to the sell of these RSUs.  Where my confusion comes in is that I was under the belief that I was taxed on the RSUs when they were granted to me.  For example, (these are made up numbers) if I was granted $20K worth of RSUs, only $13K was actually available in my stock account.

It seems that TurboTax is not recognizing that I've already paid taxes on these units and I am trying to be taxed again -- or maybe I am just missing something?

Could anyone please help me decipher why I would owe $4K?  I am a single filer with one deduction and have never had this issue before.  I sold some RSUs in 2018 as well and didn't run into this.  Please let me know if any additional information would be helpful.  Thanks!

About me: 26 y/o single male + no kids, current annual gross salary $75000 (I expect it to increase over time), hoping to retire between years 2055 - 2060 (not sure where I will retire), employer matches 5% of 100%, and putting in about 30% pre-tax biweekly to try to max it out. I would say I have a decent risk tolerance.

I picked these funds mainly just because they had low ERs, which is partially the reason why I skipped out on the international/bond funds.

Additional info: I have a Roth IRA with Fidelity that I set up in 2019. I maxed it out for 2019 (all into FIDELITY FREEDOM INDEX 2050 INVESTOR FIPFX) and for 2020 (all into FIDELITY ZERO TOTAL MARKET INDEX FZROX). Also have a taxable brokerage account with Charles Schwab with ~$10000 into Schwab Total Stock Market Index Fund SWTSX. I have about $28000 in a HYSA for emergencies + fun/vacations + some dental procedures planned this year. My monthly expenses are usually less than $1000.

My leave of absence started from the fall 2019 semester and will end this spring 2020 semester; I plan to return for the fall 2020 semester. I started camming January 2020 and estimate that I’ll earn about $16,000 from camming this year.

personalfinance,Which one of three options to paying down debt?,"Between work bonuses and new year allowances, small savings, and tax return I'll have a chunk of money to assist in my debt related stupidity. 

All credit cards have interest rates in the 20s. Five cards total. 
The highest balances have the lowest interest but also highest minimum payment due to the high balance. The lowest balances have the highest interest rates but also the lowest minimum payments due to the lower balances. 

With the lump of money I can do one of 3 three things. Well four things with the fourth being do nothing with the money and keep chipping away while maintaining some sort of emergency cash cushion.  

Option 1: use the entire lump to pay off the two lowest balances. This will give me an extra 170 a month to either start another EF or put into the other bills.
Option 2: use the entire lump to pay off one of the larger balances. That will give me an extra 160 a month to utilize elsewhere as in option 1. 
Option 3: knock the largest balance down by almost half. The min payment is currently 342. I don't know what kind of impact this option would have on that. 

When I put them all onto paper I cannot decide which option is the best route. 

Option 1 is utilizing the snowball method but uses all of my EF. Option 2 clears the balance on my second highest balance, third highest int rate card. This also uses all of my EF but if something were to ever happen this particular card can be utilized unlike the lower balance card/accounts which are store and/or e-commerce specific. 
Option 3 uses all of my EF and does not eliminate an account from the debt list. It does however cut the largest balance by almost half and theoretically will decrease the min payment respectively which obviously helps for all the accounts.

personalfinance,Why aren’t self-refinancing mortgages a thing?,"For example: The provider could (permanently) lower the rate on their stock of existing 30-year fixed rate self-refinancing mortgages when rates drop.  Since the rates can only drop and never go back up, there shouldn’t be a need to re-qualify and go through a new round of closing.  I know banks make money on deals and don’t hold mortgages on their own balance sheets, so I get that one reason these aren’t on the market is because mortgage providers are trying to do as many deals as possible.  But it might just require a different business model.

Customers would obviously love not having to mess with or pay for additional rounds of refinancing, not to mention knowing that if interest rates drop in the market, the rate on their mortgage will drop, too.  But there’s something in it for the providers, too: They could split the difference on the existing rate and the best refi offers on the market.  Eg, if customer is at 4.5% or higher and provider knows they could get 3.5% on a refi elsewhere, existing provider could voluntarily drop the rate to 4% to give existing mortgage-holder some incentive to stay put.  So not only do they get to hang on to customers that would have jumped ship, they also collect a 1/2% premium over the market rate.

Why isn’t this a thing?",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay on my student loans?,"Two years ago I graduated from college with about $55k in student loan debt. For the first two years after graduation, I opted for the income driven repayment plan which gave me a $0.00 payment so that I could allocate my money to the highest interest rated loans first. I’ve made *some* progress and am now making roughly $75k/y.

Someone I work with has been saying that his advisors told him to hold off on paying his student debt because it will likely be forgiven soon. Since I’ve been making more money, I have been paying very aggressively on my student loan debt, but I wonder if this is the best use of my money. I’m getting a good (20%) return on my smaller investments. 

The rates on the debt range from 3.5-6.7% with an overall average of about 4.7% if memory serves. Should I continue throwing my commission checks at this debt or should I bank on loan forgiveness and put my money to use elsewhere??",finance

I am not aware of him even taking any loans at that time as he was employed as well as receiving SS checks. He has not been in school, nor has anyone in his/my family since then. Today, I found a past due bill for a payment on a 10k federal loan with the U.S. Department of Education stamp on it. The loan is a DLUCNS and has ""Date Dispersed"" 1/2018. He was still living independently at that point, but is now in a retirement home. The bill says ""YOU HAVE MISSED SOME PAYMENTS"" and shows no payments have been made toward it. He rarely checks his mail and is getting pretty forgetful these days, so I'm not 100% about any claims he might make for or against this topic. He is also pretty irresponsible with finances and has terrible credit.

personalfinance,What can my Parents do about their stupid car purchase?,"For the life of me, I do not understand why people get into horrible car loans. In the case of my father, he decided to finance a 2008 bmw, some four years ago. At the time I believe it was 12k, and with 3k down, and an abhorrent interest rate, they still owe 8000 after 9000 in payments.

Now... when this was happening I told my father... do not get a bmw why do you even want one? Just get a Honda or a Toyota that's like 5k or 4k and you've paid the majority of it already and are only going to need to finance 1-2k. But... he likes ""German"" cars because of the way they drive and the exoticness, so of course I retort, **A BMW is a German Toyota in Germany except far less reliable, big whoop.**

So today the car has been giving tons of issues, literally for two years. His thought was ""well the payments are high right now, but I'll make some money later and just get out of it"" yeah that never happened...

business,Why don't people consider government contracting?,"I'm just trying to understand the reason why most people skip out on (federal) government contracts and only do private market business. I eventually plan to try it out for my self. Some of the pros to me include:

2. Not needing to do market research as the government tells you exactly what they want
3. The government will always have the money to pay you while private businesses could go bankrupt before the end of the deal
4. There are many programs designed to help those without a lot of money

There are more benefits as well. The only con I can come up with is that it is a confusing process to navigate which would be unappealing to existing businesses. Even so, I feel like starting a contracting business is a good venture. What do you think?",finance
MachineLearning,[D] Navigating latent space using human preferences?,"GANs are capable of generating a wide range of detailed, realistic images of human faces, landscapes, and animals. It is also possible to smoothly interpolate between two images or adjust them to match specific traits: for faces, this might include age, gender, or hair color.

But what if you want images with more vague, human-defined traits? For instance, imagine you're an artist trying to create a fictional landscape, perhaps for a book cover or a video game background. With a typical GAN, you can generate many random landscapes and pick the best one, or maybe even use labels to narrow your choices down further. However, if you have a very specific vision in mind, this can be very inefficient. You know what looks ""right"" when you see it, but without an explicit definition of a cost function, making the GAN generate what you want seems like a difficult problem.

What methods might be used to find regions of the latent space that fit some vague, human-defined criteria? I imagine a system in which the user is presented with two images and asked to pick the ""best"" one. To generate the images, a machine learning algorithm creates a latent space vector, which in turn is fed into the GAN. As more examples are selected, the images get better, until the user has results that are just what they are looking for. The selection process could be something similar to the one in [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741) from OpenAI.

I don't currently have anywhere near the machine learning skills or computational resources necessary to tackle a problem like this, but I think it's an interesting idea with many potential applications. Does anyone know of any existing papers about a method like this one? If not, does the concept seem realistic, or are there issues I'm not aware of? Thanks!",technology

personalfinance,Buying my first car. Am I getting hosed?,"So I am looking at purchasing my first car on my own. I went today and looked at a 2013 Toyota Prius. The total out the door price they are quoting me is 13.181.91. This includes $2000 trade in credit for my 07 Honda Civic. 

My problem is I knew that they would likely try to screw me in some way so I told the salesman that I did not want to make a decision today and if everything was right I would come back monday morning. 

The first thing the salesman told me is that he could get me a better rate then the credit union. I just looked up the credit union rate for used cars and they are offering me 4.50 which would put a payment of 48 months at $301 per month. 

The best rate the dealership gave me is from BB&amp;T for $317 per month. By my calculations that is a 7.219% interest rate. 

In addition to this, according to the research I have done, the retail value for that vehicle is only $11,500. 

So my question to you all is this. Is it worth going back on Monday and letting them know that I am aware they are screwing me? Should I negotiate for a better out the door price? Or should I walk away and look somewhere else?

I am renting my house and my tenants are paying me $2500/month for rent. I have a 30 year mortgage with a 5.37% interest rate. The only reason why it is so high was because I had a low paying job at the time and I was in a rush to get a house right away since my dad was my cosigner and he was extremely sick.

personalfinance,"Question about FAFSA. I think my parents may have messed it up when I was in college, can someone please explain how it works?","So I've been out of college for about a year and a half right now and when I left college, I had over $100K in debt. I went to a public, in-state university and got a Bachelor's degree. I always wondered why my debt was triple or quadruple of what most of my peers debt was, and now I'm worried my parents filled out the FASFA wrong which prohibited me from getting any aid.


My Dad works 1 job and makes I think about $75k if I recall from when I looked at my FAFSA. My mom lost her job halfway through my freshman year of college and never got a job again. So $75k was what my parents had. But they didn't actually pay for my college so any debt from school was 100% mine. My parents did take out about $65k worth of loans in their name, but I'm 100% responsible for paying them. My parents do not pay those for me. Not sure if the loans being in their name changes things, but just a little more information in case it does make a difference.


I know people whose parents had a combined income of $90k who left school with only about $15k of debt. Maybe not that low, but less than half of what I owed which was $108k by the time I graduated. My parents didn't involve me in the whole FAFSA process so I have no idea how it works or how the government chooses who to help, but I find it fishy that I have so much debt. I'm down to about $85k now, but life is a bit overwhelming for someone with an average degree and and entire paycheck per month goes to just loans, not counting my rent, bills, food etc. that I have to pay.


I just want to understand why I would have so much debt and why the government wouldn't help aid me more if my parents total household income is less than most of my peers. I'm scared my parents screwed me over by filling out the FAFSA incorrectly all this time or by entering something that would make it so they benefit even if it means I would suffer. I've asked them about it and told them that I have way more debt than anyone else I know, but they stand by saying that ""we are middle class, so the government doesn't help the middle class."" I just find it hard to believe that everyone I came across in college had a household income of less than $50k. I got zero financial aid and had to pay the full ticket price for school. The government gave me loans with smaller interest rates, but only for about $8k a year, which I still have to pay back.


Again, I dont know about the process or what FAFSA asks because my parents never let me get involved, but I want to understand. If anyone knows what may have happened, please explain. I feel like I shouldn't be in this situation, but I want to be educated on why I am. And I know it may be too late to fix anything, but if anyone has any advice at all on how to handle this or if this can be fixed, please let me know.",finance
personalfinance,W2 state wages WAY underreported. Does it matter? Can I just claim the correct amount myself?,"We sold our home in a tax free state in late 2018, and purchased a new home in a neighboring state that collects income tax a few weeks later. I worked at three different jobs in 2019. My W-2 from my primary job, where about 90% of my income comes from, seems totally accurate, and the state wages (Box 16) match my federal wages (Box 1).

I also had a part time job that I have had for many years where I made ~$7500 last year. Although I had asked my employer to update my address to the new state so my tax documents would be accurate, he apparently forgot to update them.  I myself did not notice right away because I am on direct deposit and my checks are always for zero dollars (it's a tipped position and the hourly wage is not enough to cover even the federal taxes), so I never looked at the check stubs. I noticed part way through the year and asked him again to update my address, which he again forgot all about, and I again neglected to follow up on. Towards the end of the year I caught the error again and he finally did update my address. When I opened my W-2 today I noticed that my state wages were listed as only $76 (probably because that's all I had for reported income after he finally updated my info).

At my third job, which I only worked at for one day in 2019, I had a similar problem. This job was back in the tax free state and my supervisor never gave me a W4 for the state I reside in when I started. I picked up on that pretty quickly and got one online myself, filled it out and sent it to him, but it definitely did not get processed before my pay went through for that one day. Today, looking at THAT W2 I noticed that not only was Box 16 (state wages) blank, but so was Box 15 (State and State employer ID).

So here's my question: what do I have to do now? I know neither of those two jobs withheld any state taxes, which is fine because I wasn't expecting them to (one job didn't have any money in the check to pay them, and the other job was only one day so it's a very small amount). Should I just fill out my taxes with the correct information myself, even though it will conflict with those W2s, or should I be getting corrected W2s from those employers? I can't seem to find any information on the internet related to this specific issue.

Getting my company match with the 401(k), putting about $500 or so back a month in liquid savings, using Acorns to scrape a little pocket change into a shorter-term investment, and also putting into a Roth IRA (not much, like $100 a month).

I am very likely going to be moving out of my current living space by this summer (hopefully sooner). I'd ideally like to buy, but I am very torn between two options.

**OPTION 1:** A 2- or 3-bed, 2-bath townhouse for $160-180k. Finished or only in need of very small updates. HOA is there but relatively inexpensive for the area. Area is not quite as desirable as option 2 but is still nice. It's near shopping and dining options. Because it's larger and has a small yard, it'd probably have a higher resale value than the second option.

PROS:

* Needs minimal work
* Wouldn't be crowded if I shack up with a partner
* Would probably have a higher ROI if I were to sell

CONS

* Farther from work
* Would probably be harder to rent
* Couldn't currently put 20% down on it
* I could afford it but I'd probably want to have a roommate for extra wiggle room/fun money 

**OPTION 2:** a 1/1 condo for $75,000. At 576 sq. ft. it's much smaller than I'd like. It's very close to a good university in my area and closer to where I work. Also near lots of shopping and dining stuff. It needs between $5,000 and $15,000 of updates (mainly new appliances, a bathroom overhaul, flooring, and paint. Some things I can do myself but some I'd need a pro for. Most appliances I could probably buy gently used off of Marketplace for way cheaper). Because it's near a university, I think it'd make a fantastic rental for a student and the HOA does allow renting. 

PROS:

* I could put 20% down easily and have it paid off in 10 years if I really wanted to
* Higher rental potential (I think)
* VERY close to work and places I like to grocery shop and eat at

CONS

* VERY small
* Needs work
* While I think it'd be easier to rent, it'd probably be harder to sell as well

Some other things to consider:

* My credit is pretty good for my age at a 744.
* It's currently a buyer's market where I live
* I will need to replace my car this summer (wanting to get a Toyota Prius or a Camry Hybrid so I can run it for years until my wheels fall off, lol) and am planning on putting at least 20% down on it, if not more. I'll be damned if I end up upside-down in a car note.

My gut is telling me to go with the condo because there will be waaaaay more financial room for emergencies if they happen, and it'd be a good money-maker if I live there for a few years, then move out and rent it. You know, tough out a less-than-ideal situation for a few years for longterm financial gain in the future. But also, interest rates are STUPID low right now and I'm worried I won't see these rates again in the future when I'm ready to move on.

Edited to add after u/pancak3d pointed this out: I am not so sure I want to stay in this area for the next 20 years.

Trying to make one lump sum payment to get rid of a single loan. 

Should I pay off:

1. $2,680 with a 6.8% interest rate
2. $5,808 with a 3.8% interest rate
3. $4,978 with a 4.2% interest rate

or should I just make one lump sump payment to the single account (which has all the loans under it) to take away from the total balance?

I've read the PF wiki, but with the amounts not being drastically different, I'm not really sure if I should use the avalanche method or the snowball method.

personalfinance,"As a young adult with fairly considerable savings, what do I need to do now to best position myself for the next recession?","I'm in my young 20s, with $45k in savings. I make roughly $3,600 a month after taxes, and have $700-1000 of monthly expenses. Everything else goes in my savings - I'm not a big spender and don't really touch this money at all. For some time now, I've been wanting to do something with it though, as it's just collecting dust in my savings account with some pitiful interest rates. However, with the market as good as it is currently, I don't think it would make sense to jump in now. But everything I'm reading says we're heading for another drop fairly soon.

So my question is how can I best position myself to make the most of the next recession and come out ahead? My family is telling me that when the housing market crashes, I need to buy a two or three-family property to rent out as one rent will pay the mortgage, and the other(s) are just extra cash. However I don't really have the desire to put in the time to do the whole landlord thing - I guess I could use one of those property management companies, but that would take a significant chunk out of the gravy (and I feel like I would worry about what kind of job they're doing - I don't want them to basically be skeevy landlords on my behalf). Not totally against going the property route, but I have my concerns.

I guess it depends on what drops when, but for those of you who invested their money and came out of the downturn in 2008/09 ahead, what's your advice? What did you put your money into, and is there anything I can be doing now to prep myself for that so I can jump on it when the time is right?

cybersecurity,[X-posted from r/ITCareerQuestions] Bitten off more than I can chew? [First job],"\[Reposted here since this was the first sub which I read\]

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all,

As the title states, I'm apprehensive (but also a little excited) after having recently received tentative confirmation about a job offer.

Quick background: Not based in or from the U.S, mid 20s, completed my bachelors in PoliSci and was offered a post-grad scholarship shortly before graduation to do a Masters in a related field, so I took it up out of some interest and focused on cyber/information warfare + counter terrorism. Still finishing up on the one year post-grad, will graduate in summer.

\[The job\] I recently applied for the equivalent of a federal position (pretty much working for the local gov) on something related to cyber thinking that I wouldn't get it, but it wouldn't hurt to apply anyway. Quite to my surprise, I did get called for the interview and did the necessary preparation. I was similarly surprised when informed the next day that they were interested in bringing me on board and that I could expect a formal offer in a few weeks.

The position in question seems to be related to the preparation of red-teaming exercises (based on the NICE framework the closest seems to be Cyber Instructional Curriculum Developer), but they made it clear during the interview that I would be expected to acquire technical skills if I joined them (they would send me for courses/certifications, it seems) and that I also would have opportunities to rotate to different departments after staying with them for a few years.

\[Background experience or lack thereof\] The problem is that I have precious little actual experience and/or knowledge relating to anything cyber. I was interested in this for a few years in my youth - read Mitnick's books on social engineering/lurked on Packetstorm, some basic means of compromising a system (XSS, SQL injections etc) and fooled around with Nmap/Metaspl0it/some RATs/Wireshark/Snort - but didn't actually have any tangible successes to show for my interest. Between my twin interests of current affairs/politics and cyber, I chose the former and followed that pretty much till present.

During my course of studies in college, I did pick up some basic scripting experience in R and found it quite enjoyable, but it wasn't to a very high level (i.e I wasn't creating packages, just knowing how to use them to wrangle data). As R is also a statistical language/glorified Excel rather than a general programming language like C or Python, it's probably not very useful for cyber, I'd imagine. I did take an exploratory module to learn basic programming methodology (inheritance, mutability etc) in Python towards the end of my Bachelors but did extremely poorly in it - partly due to having other modules to focus on and partly realizing that others could code much better than I - i.e. they could work through problem sets in a few hours and get the right answer while I struggled to debug my code and solve the problem set even after a few days). I performed particularly poorly when asked to code to solve mathematical/algorithmic problems (anonymous functions were horrible) but did decently during the portion teaching us OOP (which I quite enjoyed since I found it very similar to how most games worked) and even considered learning JS or trying to learn C++ now that I had a basic grasp of what an OOP language was.

\[Problem\] Hence why I'm fairly apprehensive about this first job - I feel like I'm woefully under-prepared and in over my head. To be fair, I did make it clear during the interview that I didn't have the CS undergrad or Computing Msc. which they would probably benefit more from and even brought up my horrible grade for that Python/programming methodology module in the interest of full disclosure, but they looked favourably upon my self-directed interest to learn R beyond what was required for my college modules, my past youthful flirtation with cyber-related things and my general geopolitical knowlege/research skills/some domain specific knowledge on APTs etc which I brought to the table. When asked if I was averse to learning about cyber things and going for certification courses in this field, I replied that I wasn't (since I still do have that youthful interest) and would probably look towards it eagerly, just that I wasn't confident in my aptitude or abilities per se. In the end, I suspect they find it easier to train an Arts student in (basic?) technical skills for whatever their purposes are rather than train a CS student to appreciate geopolitics/international politics (which I thought would be easier), and that's why they're willing to take a risk on me.

I do plan on accepting the job offer if/when it comes since it seems like a fantastic opportunity to learn and see how far I can go in this domain, but I'm aware of the huge risk the hiring manager is probably taking on me and I don't want to let him/them down. I do have some interest from my youth as mentioned earlier and I've read what I could from this and related subreddits to get a general idea (it seems to be A+, Network+ and Sec+, then see which area one wishes to specialize in?) of this fresh hell (or new opportunity) I've found myself in.

Having read, I have a few specific questions for those well versed in this field:

1. For this specific position (the equivalent of a Cyber Instructional Curriculum Developer), would the usual route of A+-&gt;Network+-&gt;Sec+ still be relevant or would I be looking at a different path of certifications to study and acquire?
2. Would it be wiser to wait for on job training (since some of what I've read emphasize how these certifications are more for knowledge/as a HR formality) and for them to send me for courses after gaining experience or should I try to hunker down and study for these things (if they're broadly applicable to all positions in this field) in between completing my post-grad and starting the job?
3. If it's the former for the above question, what else can/should I do now to better prepare for the position? I've read [the Miessler guide](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/build-successful-infosec-career/) as helpfully suggested and will probably start building a VM lab, but I'm not sure whether idly tinkering around would be productive or if I should direct my endeavours in a more focused manner towards...something?
4. Are there different positions within the NICE framework which emphasize programming more or less than others? Some of what I've read from this/other subs seem to suggest that actually being able to code is peripherally useful at best for data wrangling but not critical to one's job in network security or something similar, while others seem adamant that programming is the bread and butter of cybersecurity. Is it a case of 'in general you should understand if/else loops and hopefully a bit more than that but you probably won't be expected to get your hands dirty' or 'some positions like Digital Forensics would need you to get down and dirty coding but not so much others'?
5. Given the huge breadth of positions within the cybersecurity domain, I realize that the specific position mentioned above seems to be among the least technically intensive as compared to others like Incident Response, for example. What might be some related positions that I should consider rotating towards if I somehow flourish in this role after a few years?

I'm incredibly thankful that such an opportunity presented itself and I do hope to do my best, but at the same time (given my background described above) I think my apprehension could be forgiven. Any general advice or comments would be appreciated as well.

Thank you!

tl;dr: Didn't expect to land a position in this domain, no relevant/practical experience or knowledge. Send halp. Did I dun g00fed biting off more than I could chew or would this be an excellent opportunity for growing/learning?",technology

personalfinance,Mortgage Payments During a Refinance,"Hey All,

We are in the process of refinancing our home. The goal of the refi is to get rid of PMI. We happened to get lucky with current interest rates as well and that’s dropping also. All-in-all we are pretty excited and think it’s the right move.

Our new loan will be 280k @ 3.5%, 30 fixed. And we are replacing a 273k principal (beginning of the refinancing process). However, I believe we will make two more mortgage payments by the time we close.

My question is, since our principal will be dropping by two mortgage payments... where does that money go? 

The refinance was written up to cover the 273k and some closing costs and escrow and what not, which results in the 280k new loan amount. But, if the principal drops by the time we close... does the new loan amount drop? Or do they just get to keep the difference?

personalfinance,Are people really getting this boned on first-time car buying rates?,"There was a local thread in our buy-sell forum looking for recommendations on auto dealers for someone to buy their first car. Here's how a conversation went:

**Me:** Don’t buy a new car, buy one that’s 1-3 years old with under 30,000 miles. Do not take a loan for more than 4% interest. Do not accept a loan term of more than 60 months.

**Other poster:** ya some people dont qualify for 4% you know top tier rates for used cars are around 4% right?

**Me:** If they can stay under 6% and not stretch beyond 60 months, that's fine. 10% and up on rates, and 72+ month loans are what really screw people over. If you can't afford a car within these parameters, you need a cheaper car.

**Other poster:** it's not the car it's your credit that qualifies you for rates. Every 8-10pts of credit is a different tier. You know a first time buyer rate as low as it gets is around 12.99% at 60 months so if you havent financed anything auto related before be ready for those types of rates.

**Me:** I never said anything about the car qualifying you for rates. It's just that people ALWAYS over-buy when it comes to vehicles. They think they ""need"" or ""deserve"" a better vehicle when in fact it's keeping them in debt. I've financed many vehicles in my life and I've never paid more than 2.88%, even as a first-time auto buyer. 13% is, pardon my French, BATSHIT INSANE, and nobody should ever pay that high of interest for a car, period. EVER. That's predatory. I will never in a million years endorse or acquiesce to a system of personal finance where you have to pay 13% interest for a rapidly depreciating asset. This type of thinking is what keeps people in poverty. It's a shame personal finance isn't taught more in schools.

**Other poster:** that is a factory incentivized first time buyer rate for most companies. You are getting no where near the low single digit rates for a first time buyer things have changed and banks have tightened up. Unless u have a cosigner and that varies depending on bank, and stipulations of the cosigner

**Me:** Nobody says you need to take financing from the dealership. You can get a loan from a bank or a credit union, and it sure as hell isn't going to be anywhere close to 13%.

**Other poster:** No local or major banks usually have first time buyer rates available. For example most major banks would charge you in the teens as well. Plain and simple you are deemed a risk as a first time buyer you are not getting top tier incentivized rates. You better have good money down, buying a car that is holding good value and isnt over priced at 90% LTV (depending on bank), steady job for over 1yr and steady living situation. Which most first time buyers do not have all those things lined up which then narrows down the select banks you can go to who will even offer you a competitive loan. Manufacturers usually offer the best rates for first time buyers.

**Other poster** not tryna argue just tryna shed light so people know what's real. I sell over 200+ cars a year and I see many first time buyers. I work with banks directly and just being honest that most people do not qualify for good rates as first time buyers especially on used cars. Used cars you usually pay 1% more for same type of loan.

------

So: Is it really this dire for new car buyers, or is this a predatory car salesperson talking out of their ass? I directed the original poster of the thread to the comprehensive auto buying guide.

tl:dr: Car sales person claims no first-time car buyer can get an interest rate under 12.99%. I think they're full of crap.",finance

That’ll tell you how much interest you should get charged per day, multiply that by the number of days since your last payment to tell how much interest you should be charged.

I’m an active duty service member. For some reason I ended up paying a little under $100 in federal income taxes last year (money stopped being withheld). TurboTax popped up saying I owed around $1000 because of it. Decided I’d try freetaxusa, and I’ve ended up going from owing $1000 to a projected +$680 refund. Im assuming due to this $1800 earned income credit I didn’t have last year with turbo tax (I imported my last years return into freetaxusa). 

I’m assuming something may be wrong in the algorithm or I may have made a user error.

Bitcoin,Disruption timeline.,"Companies and entities that will be disrupted and made redundant by bitcoin and the lightning network, in order of occurrence.

**First**, lightning as a payment mechanism will proliferate with every point of sale terminal and every banking wallet app able to send from and receive to a lightning invoice. The world will use lightning as the standard for transaction and transfer processing.

**Disrupted**: Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover, alipay, wechat pay, paypal, transferwise, worldremit, western union, SWIFT, and similar companies of this nature.

**Second**, as the world settles on using lightning as the global standard to process the worlds transactions and transfers it will simultaneously (like a Trojan Horse) make every point of sale terminal and every banking wallet app capable of receiving bitcoin. This will mean bitcoin can be spent anywhere and sent to anyone even if the recipient has no idea what bitcoin is. This will increase the demand globally for holding bitcoin directly instead of using bank accounts forcing banks around the world to offer Bitcoin accounts in order to keep customers. 

**Disrupted**: Bank of China, HSBC, JP Morgan, Chase, BNP Paribas, Bank of America, Credit Agricole, and similar deposit taking institutions of this nature that do not adopt bitcoin. 

**Third**, as the move away from banks occurs and the smart banks adopt bitcoin accounts in order to survive we will see demand for fiat decline and demand for bitcoin rise. This will lead to a dramatic rise in inflation creating a self reinforcing feedback loop that acts as a vortex. People adopting bitcoin to escape inflation will in the process of doing this create even more inflation, until the inevitable outcome of a catastrophic collapse in demand for fiat occurs  globally.

**Disrupted**: US federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, Swiss National Bank, Bank of Canada, Reserve Bank of Australia, International Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, and similar entities of this nature around the world.

At this point the world will converge on one fair, sound, and politically neutral money, **Bitcoin**, and one free, instant, and politically neutral payment system, **Lightning**.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Looks like H&amp;R Block low balled my tax return. What are my options at this point?,"So I went to H&amp;R Block last week to get my taxes done, and to my shock, I only received $270 back in Federal taxes, which was confusing at best. TurboTax estimated a \~$5,000 return for me. I'm a single guy, making $135k in Massachusetts.

I had a bad feeling about it since the woman doing my taxes couldn't even correctly copy my income and I had to correct her on multiple occasions. Wouldn't be surprised if she was legally blind due to her age. That's besides the point, but I had a bad feeling regardless.

So after the tax appointment, I told them to hold on to the returns and NOT to file them. I didn't pay them because I forgot my wallet so they just left it in the file. Then yesterday, I did my taxes with Turbo Tax and got a federal return $3,240. I imported my W-2's with TurboTax. So with TurboTax, I received $3,000 more on my federal taxes than I did with H&amp;R Block. For state, I owed the basically the same with H&amp;R Block and TurboTax. I prepared my taxes with TurboTax but didn't e-file it yet.

I have a feeling the tax accountant used last year's tax rules for my return. I have no other idea how and why I was low balled so much.

personalfinance,Turbotax deluxe charges an additional $40 to take their fee from your returns,"Not sure if this is common knowledge but I noticed this yesterday when filing my federal taxes yesterday. I had to use TurboTax deluxe because of some additional things I had to add in and I don't want to use paper. They mention that it costs $40. No issue there. When choosing a payment method you have the options of using a card or allowing them to take it directly from your returns. Underneath the latter they mention they would take $40 directly from your returns. What they fail to mention is that it's an additional $40, not the $40 you pay for deluxe. So you'd end up paying $80 in total for choosing this method vs $40 for entering your card info. Caught it when I was reviewing everything.  Heads up guys.

EDIT: My problem with this is that they made it seem like it's a part of the initial $40 not as an additional fee. The language used seems intentionally misleading.

personalfinance,14 year old minor working part time at a small family owned restaurant - tax implications?,"Hello, my daughter just began working part time for a small, family owned restaurant.  I'm concerned about  the informality of the entire situation and am seeking advice.

She'll be working about 12 hours a week.  She has a work permit through her school.  She is really enjoying the job and is excited to get a little extra spending money.

She and her employer, who has never employed someone that is not a member of the family, have agreed that she'll work for minimum wage, rather than the server wage\*. 

One of my concerns is she got her first pay yesterday, which was just a check written to her (it was a business check), not a formal pay stub.  This amount was total hours worked x minimum wage.

I'm concerned about federal with holdings, medicare/social security and lack of a formal W2 when it comes time for me to sort out her taxes next year.  I'm not sure the restaurant owner is planning this... my daughter doesn't know the right questions to ask.

I am worried that if I go and ask these questions that the owner will just say ""oh, I didn't know it would require all this... I don't think it will work out well"" and dismiss her from the position.  Needless to say, my daughter would be very angry.  I do not think they are doing anything shady, I just don't think they know what they are supposed to do.

Also, when she handles her taxes, will she file on her own, but not as a dependent, and I'll be allowed to continue to declare her as a dependent on my taxes?

\* She will act as a waitress a little, but most of their orders are online and pickup.  She says those don't get tipped, so I think it works better for her to get minimum wage... but am not certain what would happen to any tips she'd get while serving dine-in customers.

The BoA savings earned a pitiful $7.75 last year in interest, so must be like 0.025% or something! So ideally need to put it somewhere else too. Obviously need to have access to at least an emergency fund, maybe $30k (fully expecting one of our cars to die at any point! + general emergency fund).

Graduated in August 2019 with a masters, finally working in my industry as of January 2020. My salary is $42k before taxes (estimated take-home is 34k).
I currently live rent free and I walk to work so my living costs are quite low. I am good about budgeting for groceries and only going out to restaurants for special occasions. I like to go on camping trips for vacation so those expenses are  low.

All federal student loans adding up to $24k before principle + interest. The breakdown:
Unsubsidized: 
7,790 @ 6.6%
2,000 @ 3.76%
1,000 @ 4.45%
Subsidized:
4,750 @ 3.76%
2,141 @ 3.76%
2,750 @ 4.45%
2,750 @ 4.45% (yes, a duplicate)

I know that subsidization means nothing as of March because the grace period will be over and all will start accruing interest on all loans. Total interest is currently $987.

personalfinance,accounting help: Paying debts sequentially vs. consolidation,"I’m obviously not an accountant and my rudimentary math skills are at odds with my common sense.

I have two three debts, we’ll call them A, B, &amp; C:

Debt A is $4717 @ 11.25%, minimum payment $97

Debt B is $1783 @ 14.5%, minimum payment $53

Debt C is $1350 @ 0%, minimum payment $50

I’m currently paying A at minimum ($97), B @ maximum ($200), C @ minimum ($50). The goal is to pay off highest interest B first @ $200/mo, then move onto lower interest A @ $297/mo, and then finally pay off the rest of C @ $347/mo.

Using a simple online credit card calculator, it appears as though B would be paid off in about 8 months w/ $93 in interest. Over that 8 months I’ll have paid off an additional $776 to A, so the remaining A balance of $3941 would be paid off in about 13 months with about $250 in interest.  Over those 21 months I’ll have paid off an additional $1050 to C, so the remaining C balance of $300 would be paid off in 1 month. This plan appears to take about 22 months with about $343 in interest.

I have an option to consolidate the interest-accruing debt at 6.4%, which sounds like a great idea. It seems like I should pay everything off sooner and with less interest, but I can’t get the math to prove it. Total debt $6500 @ 6.4% w/ $300/mo payments appears to take 24 months w/ $425.65 interest.

Am I doing something wrong? Or why does consolidating at a lower interest rate take longer to payoff and with greater interest paid than paying the individual debts sequentially?

Can anyone point me to an online calculator that would allow me to plug all this in, play with the repayment amounts, and see what affect it would have on duration of repayment and total interest paid?",finance

NelNet: Multiple loans all with an interest rate under 6%

Since I don't get to see the numbers for each option without credit checks, I haven't been able to confidently make a decision. So I figured I would bring my question here as I don't personally know anyone in the finance industry who would be able to help nor do I know any other place to get advice. 

I'm looking for monthly payments that won't break the bank. I currently have a career using the Master's I got, making 67,000 a year which the potential to move up to 74,000 a year once I pass my board exam. I also have a credit score above 700 currently as I'm on top of my credit card bills. I pay multiple bills on my own, and without my student loans I have a comfortable amount left each month for savings, but once I start paying for my loans based on the standard payment plan now, I'll barely be afloat each month. Nelnet offers a lot of repayment options and Heartland is low enough that I could aggressively pay that off quickly, but Sallie Mae offers little to no other options for repayment plans. Which brought me to the two options of Consolidation or Refinance. 

My question to this sub-reddit: in your professional opinion, from the information I've given you, which option would make the most sense for me to pursue so I can pay my loans but yet live a somewhat comfortable life? 

I fully understand, yes it was stupid to take out the loans, but I had no other option to get through school.

Given the interest difference over the lifetime of the loan, 1.5% reduction sounds too good to be true. Quick napkin math shows about 100k worth of interest saved. What exactly am I missing here, and what stimulus those companies have to spam me with letters?",finance
personalfinance,Fastest way to tackle $20K of Credit Card debt,"Hi there,

I am currently trying to find the fastest way to tackle my mounting credit card debt. A breakdown of my financial situation is below;

Take home monthly income $3,710.00

Rent/utilities/groceries/other living expenses (debt not included)- ($2,600)

Rent is $1,545 for a studio

Cell phone $60

Utilities (trash, water, Electricity) - $120 a month

Shopping/groceries/entertainment $460

Gas $80

Car insurance $173

Hulu/Tidal - $22

Therapy -$100

Loans with under 7% interest:

Car payment  - Outstanding \~$5,000 Minimum Payment ($285)

Student Loans - Outstanding \~$9,000 Minimum Payment ($150)

Loans with \~20% interest

Credit card #1 Wells Fargo outstanding debt $9,102 APR 19.65% variable Min payment ($233)

Credit card #2 Discover outstanding debt $13,000 0% APR until Nov 2020 20% there after Min payment ($261)

I lived in a very expensive state coming right out of college and got myself into credit card debt trying to get by and since then it has spiraled. About a year ago I was in a position I thought I would pay my debt off so I did a transfer balance but unfortunately have not been able to pay down as much as I believed. Ideally I would like to have a majority of this paid off in \~3 years which when doing credit card calculators seems impossible (quoting me at about $800 a month payment over 36 months). I am really just trying to pay these credit cards off as soon as possible since I feel like they are only holding me back. I have never missed a payment on any of my debt payments and have a 698 credit score (was 780 a year ago but has been dropping due to revolving credit being too high). I looked into a personal line of credit through my bank (WF) but it looks like that too would be around 20% so it wouldn't be beneficial. I have had my WF card for 8 years and have never missed a payment, has anyone had success getting their interest rate lowered there?

As you can see things are a little tight and have only been getting worse as I have been needing to rely on my cards more and more for the unexpected expenses that come up. Any advice on which card I should be tackling the hardest right now would be appreciated. My job does not offer overtime and I have no assets I can sell.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Voya 401k Allocation Advice,"Hi, I’ve been looking around here trying to find someone with my similar circumstance, but haven’t found exactly what I need, so I figured I would post. I need help with 401k allocations. My company switched to Voya recently and I don’t know what to choose. I currently have 100% in Voya Target Solution 2050 and it hasn’t been doing well.

About me:

* 34 years old, in a relationship, but not married, no kids.. may have some in the future if my eggs aren’t scrambled. (If I do have kids, I may stop working, or work part time making much less money..)  
* Salary is 95k + 60k bonus, typically goes up every year
* Currently 132k in 401k 
* Company matches up to 10k a year, so I put in at least 10k.. typically a little more than that
* Plan to start putting more in this year. Should I max out Roth and then do 12% my salary in 401k? I’ve normally been putting 12% of my salary in 401k only. I finally paid off my student loans, so I have no debt (woo) and can contribute more. Thanks in advance for your help.

personalfinance,Why do the mortgage points/credits vary so much between each rate step?,"Today I can lock at the following rates on a $300K mortgage.

3.500% with a $1875 credit

3.375% with a $750 credit

3.250% with $1500 in points

My question is this: Why wouldn't the difference in the credits/points be fairly constant as I move down in rate?

Seems like I'd be pretty dumb to take the 3.750% when I can ""buy"" the 3.625% for only a $375 difference.  But then, it's a big leap to go from 3.625% down to 3.5% at a $2250 difference.  And then, to really confuse me, it's only $1125 to go down to 3.375%.  Seems like that the difference should be pretty constant as you change rates.  

Can anyone give me a good explanation of why it's not a more constant change in credits/points as interest rate changes?",finance
MachineLearning,"[D] Does actual knowledge even matter in the ""real world""?","TL;DR for those who dont want to read the full rant. 

Spent hours performing feature selection,data preprocessing, pipeline building, choosing a model that gives decent results on all metrics and extensive testing only to lose to someone who used a model that was clearly overfitting on a dataset that was clearly broken, all because the other team was using ""deep learning"". Are buzzwords all that matter to execs?



I've been learning Machine Learning for the past 2 years now. Most of my experience has been with Deep Learning. 

Recently, I participated in a Hackathon. The Problem statement my team picked was ""Anomaly detection in Network Traffic using Machine Learning/Deep Learning"". Us being mostly a DL shop, thats the first approach we tried. We found an open source dataset about cyber attacks on servers, lo and behold, we had a val accuracy of 99.8 in a single epoch of a simple feed forward net, with absolutely zero data engineering....which was way too good to be true. Upon some more EDA and some googling we found two things, one, three of the features had a correlation of more than 0.9 with the labels, which explained the ridiculous accuracy, and two, the dataset we were using had been repeatedly criticized since it's publication for being completely unlike actual data found in network traffic. This thing (the name of the dataset is kddcup99, for those interested ) was really old (published in 1999) and entirely synthetic. The people who made it completely fucked up and ended up producing a dataset that was almost linear. 

To top it all off, we could find no way to extract over half of the features listed in that dataset, from real time traffic, meaning a model trained on this data could never be put into production, since there was no way to extract the correct features from the incoming data during inference.

We spent the next hour searching for a better source of data, even trying out unsupervised approaches like auto encoders, finally settling on a newer, more robust dataset, generated from real data (titled UNSW-NB15, published 2015, not the most recent my InfoSec standards, but its the best we could find). 
Cue almost 18 straight, sleepless hours of determining feature importance, engineering and structuring the data (for eg. we had to come up with our own solutions to representing IP addresses and port numbers, since encoding either through traditional approaches like one-hot was just not possible), iterating through different models,finding out where the model was messing up, and preprocessing data to counter that, setting up pipelines for taking data captures in raw pcap format, converting them into something that could be fed to the model, testing out the model one random pcap files found around the internet, simulating both postive and negative conditions (we ran port scanning attacks on our own machines and fed the data of the network traffic captured during the attack to the model), making sure the model was behaving as expected with a balanced accuracy, recall and f1_score, and after all this we finally built a web interface where the user could actually monitor their network traffic and be alerted if there were any anomalies detected, getting a full report of what kind of anomaly, from what IP, at what time, etc. 

After all this we finally settled on using a RandomForestClassifier, because the DL approaches we tried kept messing up because of the highly skewed data (good accuracy, shit recall) whereas randomforests did a far better job handling that. We had a respectable 98.8 Acc on the test set, and similar recall value of 97.6. We didn't know how the other teams had done but we were satisfied with our work. 

During the judging round, after 15 minutes of explaining all of the above to them, the only question the dude asked us was ""so you said you used a nueral network with 99.8 Accuracy, is that what your final result is based on?"". We then had to once again explain why that 99.8 accuracy was absolutely worthless, considering the data itself was worthless and how Neural Nets hadn't shown themselves to be very good at handling data imbalance (which is important considering the fact that only a tiny percentage of all network traffic is anomalous). The judge just muttered ""so its not a Neural net"", to himself, and walked away. 

We lost the competetion, but I was genuinely excited to know what approach the winning team took until i asked them, and found out ....they used a fucking neural net on kddcup99 and that was all that was needed. Is that all that mattered to the dude? That they used ""deep learning"". What infuriated me even more was this team hadn't done anything at all with the data, they had no fucking clue that it was broken, and when i asked them if they had used a supervised feed forward net or unsupervised autoencoders, the dude looked at me as if I was talking in Latin....so i didnt even lose to a team using deep learning , I lost to one pretending to use deep learning. 

I know i just sound like a salty loser but it's just incomprehensible to me. The judge was a representative of a startup that very proudly used ""Machine Learning to enhance their Cyber Security Solutions, to provide their users with the right security for todays multi cloud environment""....and they picked a solution with horrible recall, tested on an unreliable dataset, that could never be put into production over everything else ( there were two more teams thay used approaches similar to ours but with slightly different preprocessing and final accuracy metrics). But none of that mattered...they judged entirely based on two words. Deep. Learning. Does having actual knowledge of Machine Learning and Datascience actually matter or should I just bombard people with every buzzword I know to get ahead in life.",technology

It got to a point where I couldn’t make the payments on my credit cards. In the end all of them got charged off, some went to collections and some never got sold and were written off as a bad debt. 

Over the past year I’ve been rebuilding my financial health and have somewhat gotten back on track. Of the accounts that went to collections I’ve settled them all with a pay for delete so they will be getting removed from my credit report.

That leaves me with 5 accounts that were never sold to collections. All charged off around 5/2018

Citi Bank $800
Chase $800
Capital One $1000

personalfinance,Balance Transfer Question,"Hello All,

My Girlfriend is in debt and I've been helping her budget and slowly help her personal finances. Recently I was on her account budgeting and noticed something called a ""0% APR balance transfer"" After doing a ton of research, reading fine print, and looking up options, I decided that it was worth doing a balance transfer for her.

Now the reason why I am reaching out is because I realized that the balance transfers will accrue back interest if the balance transfer isn't paid out. Is this true for all 0% APR credit cards? Right now she has about 15k in credit card debt and another 15k debt in auto loans. I was thinking of transferring her 15k CC debt to a 0% APR for 21 months with a 5% fee. She would save a good amount of money because right now she is paying 15% APR on the CC debt. However I know she won't be able to pay off the balance before the 21 months, would she be able to do another balance transfer before that timeframe hits?

Any other advice on how to handle her debt better would help. She is a part of Navy Federal and I was thinking I could call her bank to negotiate a 0%APR.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

personalfinance,We suck at investing,"Alt account for privacy reasons

So to be quite frank, my spouse and I are very poor at investing.  Spouse is USAF Officer, O-5.  I am a Systems Engineer.  We are currently stationed overseas.  Annual household income is $250K+.

Except for our vacations, we are very thrifty.  I cook every meal at home, and we eat out very rarely.  Vehicles have been paid off (we pay in cash) and student loans have been paid off for years.  We do not have a mortgage as I sold our home stateside about five years ago.  We have no recurring bills other than rent/utilities.

We both have an IRA that I max out every year.  Current value is \~$110K+.  I should note that the spouse's IRA is set up for almost zero-risk government bonds.  Mine is a little more flexible but still on the lower side of risk.  I know we have too much liquidity.  Current savings is $320K+.  Besides my IRA I have a 401K, and my spouse will have a traditional military retirement starting in about 7 years.  Annuity should be \~65K+ per annum.

We have a school-aged child that will be college-aged in 10+ years.  We have set aside money for this so that he will have his education entirely paid for.

I know we should be much better investing our money.  Quite frankly a lot of this is due to time issues.  Managing two high profile careers and a young child with no outside help is difficult.  I figured that with all the time I spend on Reddit, I should maybe try and see if anyone has some sound advice.  Should we just schedule a meeting with a financial adviser?  Our bank offers one, but I am starting to hear negative things about their investment services.  Everyone is telling me to go to Navy Fed.

My plan is to retire in 10 years, my spouse will likely work for at least 15 more (1/2 of that as civilian).

Any advice is much appreciated.",finance

So I have a 2016 Honda Civic that a dealership wants to give me $11,000 for to put towards a 25K 2016 Colorado with 24,000 miles. I got approved for a 72 month 4.6% interest loan.

In the long run will I spend more money continually trading in vehicles and paying off around $10,000-$13,000 each time at an approximate 4% interest rate every couple of years? Or will I spend more money financing a $25,000-$30,000 vehicle at this same interest rate after my Honda stops working at around 150,000-200,000 miles. Assuming it makes it that far.

investing,"There has been a ton of discussion about leverage lately. In this post I discuss obtaining leverage via personal loans, buying stock on margin, leveraged ETFs, options and futures.","The belief that the US stock market always increases in value over the long term is a central tenet of many investing strategies ([read about the equity risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityriskpremium.asp)).

Exposure to the an index fund beyond 100% can be achieved via leverage:

**Personal leverage** such as home equity loans or personal loans are limited by capital available and high interest rates.

**Buying stock on margin** also usually has unacceptably high interest rates and a market downturn can lead to a margin call.

**Leveraged ETFs** perform well in bull markets, but due to the “implied interest rate” due to borrowing costs and management fees, still lead to significant costs for obtaining leverage. In addition, because many of these are rebalanced as frequently as daily, your returns can be greatly diminished and you effectively buy high and sell low in a sideways market. However, in a market with consistent momentum, either negative or positive, the frequent rebalancing can actually work in your favor. This means you will lose significantly more in down years, but not 2x or 3x or whatever your leverage is. The oldest leveraged ETFs I could find (RYNVX 1.5x, SSO 2x) are compared with the S+P 500 [here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2007&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2020&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;initialAmount=50000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;symbol1=RYNVX&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;symbol2=SSO&amp;allocation2_2=100).

**Options** are an effective way of obtaining leverage without the same costs inherent to the strategies above. However, costs such as premiums, theta decay, and not receiving a dividend will limit returns. [This 2008 paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1149340) advocates buying deep in the money Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS), which equates to an implied interest rate of LIBOR + less than a percentage point for 200% exposure, although higher amounts of leverage had higher implied interest rates. I won’t explore options fully in this post, but they are a reasonable choice and are described in detail in the paper.

**Futures** may be the most cost-effective way of obtaining leverage, or are at least comparable to options. With [index futures](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042315/how-do-sp-500-futures-work.asp), you enter into a contract to buy or sell the index at a future date (NOT optional), and the notional value contract can be 5x, 50x, or 250x the underlying index (in the commonly traded CME group contracts). Depending on how much capital you commit to the margin (a sort of good faith deposit), leverage can be anywhere from almost 0x up to 25x if your margin requirement was 4%. This position can be rolled forward quarterly, and leverage will increase if the index loses value and decrease if the index gains value. The costs inherent to futures include small trading fees, the lack of dividend reinvestment (although this is priced in to the futures contract), and the cost of financing (usually near the risk-free rate). In addition, interest rates and dividend yields affect the pricing of futures contracts. Large drawdowns can also result in margin calls.

A future post will describe a detailed analysis of using S+P 500 index futures contracts to obtain leverage.

**TL;DR Leverage results in greater gains and greater loss, but can be expensive to obtain. Options and futures are the most cost-effective way of obtaining leverage. Holding a leveraged long position with options and futures is possible, but can be completely wiped out with severe drawdowns.**

What do you think? Is leverage too risky, or a valuable part of a young person's portfolio?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Plan Help,"Hey all,

My wife and I are about to start paying off her loans.  She just graduated from a doctoral program and we are now 90k in student loan debt. Without going into all personal details, we CAN afford to use her entire salary ~$65,000 before taxes to pay off her loans in 2.5 years or sooner. We have lived off of my salary long enough to know that it is manageable, so all of hers will go to loans. 

With the current repayment plans for federal loans, you have the standard, gradual, or income-based payment options. We had questions on how those payments, regardless of repayment type, are divvied up to the loans.  We WANT to pay off the graduate loans 3x $20,500 @~6% first as those are what is gaining the most interest but we arent sure if thats what the repayment plans would let us do.  I'd hate to pay off parts of the smaller loans because I am forced to, AND payoff the large loans with the remaining monthly salary when it makes more financial sense, in the long run, to pay off the more expensive loans first.

personalfinance,"Didn't even have car for month, totaled by teenager, blue book value dangerously low","Some context into this situation: last night, I parked in front of the house I live in in the street as out of the way of the main path of traffic as I could, as the house in question has its driveway too full to pull into. (My mother who has to pull out at 3 AM for work, my father who goes to work at 5 AM, and in front of the latter is behind a third car that is undrivable due to inoperable brakes.) and went to sleep.

This morning, I woke up to a loud crash and ran outside to find a pair of high school kids that crashed into my car, having hit the dip a little ways past my car and lost control of it. They also pushed the car (Despite the emergency brake being engaged) into an RV and took it's bumper off before it struck a fourth vehicle and took out a mailbox. The driver, a 16-year-old male, was unharmed, but the passenger, his girlfriend most likely, was sent away on an ambulance with a broken leg and a possibly injured neck. But before she did, I attempted to render aid to her only for her to pull me closer to her (While the driver was staggering on my house's front lawn) and told me he was under the influence of something else, but she was unable to tell me before the guy got too close and prompted her to stop.

Also regarding the boy, he reportedly didn't even have a driver's license or permit, and the car really belonged to his parents. He was not authorized to drive the car at all and apparently had a run-in with an officer just minutes before the incident, though due to the wording, I could not tell if he got pulled over or if he evaded the cop at first only to crash.  I do know however that his sister arrived and after the officers gave him three tickets and refused to give me or my grandmother (Who arrived due to my inability to speak) his parent's names for the purposes of insurance, he was released to his sister.

To my car itself, it's been totally destroyed. It is a 2001 Chevy Prizm that has been fully paid off and the driver's side front tire is bent so badly that it's unusable, the rear passenger side tire completely broke off, the catalytic converter flew off and onto the street, the driver's side part of the engine compartment is caved in entirely, and the driver's side door has a huge hole in it that suggests that had I been in the car, it likely would have taken one of my legs off. I only had the car for less than a month and had yet to be in any sort of accident or incident before now.

Additionally, this is the absolute first time I ever had to deal with the sort of incident. And I am at a loss as to what to do exactly. I do however have the names of the parents, so the insurance claim is now pending. But I still would rather have some advice from others who went through this sort of thing then go in blind and end up stiffed and get so little money from it, it won't even pay for the down payment of a replacement car.",finance

personalfinance,HSA and payroll taxes - am I being overtaxed?,"Trying to understand how payroll is treating my hsa deductions and if I'm being taxed too much. 

Background:

I elect to have pretax HSA deductions from my monthly paycheck of ~$294. My understanding is that this should sidestep federal tax as well as Medicare (state employee in Texas, so I pay into TRS not social security).

On my pay stub, I can see that the wages for which federal tax is applied accurately reflects my wage less the HSA deduction (among other pretax deductions like dental).

However, in the Medicare taxes portion of my stub, the hsa deduction is not factored in, and reflects only wages less the various pretax items, e.g. dental plan. Same is true for TRS, but since it isn't SS I'm not sure HSA is the same there.

I see on my 2019 W2 that whereas box 1 reflects my wages less my hsa contributions, box 5 for Medicare wages does not. HSA deductions are reflected in box 12 however.

My question is: is my payroll department withholding tax correctly, or are they over withholding on medicare (or TRS)? My entire purpose of going through the cafeteria plan is to lessen some of the payroll impact.

My HSA provider, TASC, costs me $2.50 every month. A off,I figured it was a better bet than personally going through Fidelity HSA given the savings through payroll tax avoidance. If that isn't the case then I see no incentive to continue with TASC and will go Fidelity.

personalfinance,When to contribute to retirement?,"I have been diligently paying down my debt for the last few years, and I'm very nearly done! The only thing I have left is:

&amp;#x200B;

$550 for computer purchase (interest-free until May)

$450 for phone (interest-free until March of next year)

$17684 in federal student loans (average 4.16% fixed interest rate, PSLF/RePAYE)

$180 medical bill I will pay this month

&amp;#x200B;

The computer could be paid off in full now, but my plan is to do it in April. The phone I have set up for automatic payments and it will be paid in full before the interest-free period expires.

&amp;#x200B;

I take home about $1020 biweekly from my main job, after taxes, insurance and mandatory CalPERS contribution (10%). I also make about $985/mo net at a second job (non-taxable), but that will probably end sometime this year. At this point, the secondary job income will be going to my emergency fund.

&amp;#x200B;

I am easily able to handle my monthly expenses with my main job with some leftover for discretionary spending. Budget:

Rent: $500

Groceries: $350

Phone: $78

Gas: $75-100

Renter/Auto insurance: $116

Pet spending: $200

Student loan: $79

Dining out: $150

Fun: $150

Gym: $50

&amp;#x200B;

The other $350ish/mo has been going to kill most of that debt. Now that's mostly gone I'm wondering if I should up my retirement contributions. I have to contribute 10% to CalPERS. I will be fully vested in about 2.5 years. There is no other match, but I can make payroll contributes to a 457b or Roth.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I also right in thinking that an e-fund for me, with a secure job, is about $5000 for 3 months? I'd prefer to get it a little higher, but I think $5k is a reasonable goal.

&amp;#x200B;

My other question is how to treat my student loans. I do have PSLF and I recertify every year. At this time, it seems like this is the most sensible option. If my income significantly increases, obviously I'll revisit.

I've already e-filed my federal with turbotax and am trying to recreate the same federal in FreeTaxUSA.

personalfinance,"Feel like I’m drowning, pondering bankruptcy","I apologise in advance for the length.

I am in trouble. My partner and I have gone through some tough financial times over the years, and now find ourselves in around $36,000 debt (credit cards and debt consolidation). I pay all of the rent and bills, he pays the debts. He works casually though so can’t always pay huge amounts - although we are meeting our minimum payments, sometimes more, and we are paying before they’re due. As it is, a lot of our wages are going towards rent/bills, he is spending a large proportion his wage paying the debts, leaving us short and falling back into the trap of using a credit card to get by. Life is tough.

I tried to refinance the existing loan and add in the credit card debts but was rejected. This would have made our monthly repayments going towards one debt, the repayments would have been lower than the collective amount we are paying over 4 debts and we would have been able to pay more and get somewhere without financially overcommitting and having to fall back on a credit card. The credit cards would have been gone for good.

The debts are in my name, partner and I don’t share joint accounts or anything. But, we’ve been together a long time. He’s not about to run off and leave me with the debts. We’re very much in this together.

I had always felt that bankruptcy was financial suicide and not an option. However, every waking moment is spent thinking and stressing about money. My car is 13 years old and there’s no way I would qualify to get a loan for a newer one if I needed to or even be able to pay one more debt anyway. I pray that it lives forever. I keep it maintained and serviced regularly. It feels like bankruptcy would be a financial reset but with huge consequences attached. We would go back to simpler times when we lived off what we earned and be able to save. We didn’t have a credit card. I could save up and buy a car with my own money if I had to. I know my credit score will take a hit. I received a copy of my credit report and no defaults reported, but a lot of enquiries. Not sure of the actual number score.

As it is, my partner needs a couple of surgeries, but we simply can’t afford for him to have the unpaid time off work to do it. I earn too much for him to qualify for temporary unemployment benefits, but not enough to support both of us and meet our financial obligations. I have $140K in superannuation that I can’t touch - the criteria to access this is so strict and I don’t qualify because I am employed and not receiving unemployment benefits. We also don’t have a mortgage as we rent.

I flit between thinking ‘we can do this! We can get rid of this debt by ourselves!’ to ‘holy shit, we will never get on top of this’. I have looked into the snowball method which is good in theory, we just don’t make enough between us to make that huge of a dent in it.

I don’t know. I feel so lost.

To break it down:

Loan is at $21,218 @ 11.99% (started at $25,527, 18 months ago. Have made payments of $8447). Minimum is $470 a month. 5.5 years remaining.

Credit card 1 is @ $6883 @ 11.99% fixed, $200 minimum a month. Not using this card.

Credit card 2 is @ $6068, $1932 of which is 13.99% and $4136 is interest free until May next year after which it reverts to 21%. $130 minimum a month. Not using this card.

Credit card 3 is at $2700 @ 11.99%. $40 minimum a month. Using this card.

My pay is $1690 a fortnight. Out of that I pay:
$620 rent
$93 gas
$70 electricity
$60 private health insurance
Then there is petrol, food etc.

Partner earns anywhere from $400 to $650 a week. He usually gives me more than half of his wage to put towards the debts. Because he can start work anywhere from 4am, I can’t always drop him to work and he has to rely on taxis which eats up a bit of money. He gets sick frequently so if he misses work, that’s no pay which increases the financial strain.

I have looked at and applied for second jobs but my lack of availability goes against me. They want people that are freely available or who are available at times when I work. Even nightfill jobs specify you must be available from 3pm which is not possible with my work roster.

Back in the olden days before credit cards, my partner had a much higher paying job. Everything was split 50/50. He lost that job through no fault of his own, was unemployed for a few months, then found lower paying, casual jobs which is where this debt all started. I’m shouldering all of the living expenses without reimbursement because his share has to go towards the debts. I qualified for all this credit on my wage alone. Without his wage, we are stuffed.

I don’t know if I would even be eligible for bankruptcy because I am meeting the repayments on time. I don’t have creditors chasing me. But I am acutely aware of the very precarious financial situation we are in. I filled out all the bankruptcy forms yesterday, determined to try and start fresh. But then I didn’t submit them, saved them and need to think. I don’t want to give up and admit defeat. I’m also concerned that I have been using the credit card and the company may say that the transactions were fraudulent. If that’s the case though, paying back $2700 is going to be far easier than $36,000. Yet I also recognise that we can’t keep going like this.

I plan to seek free financial counselling to see what my realistic options are, but thought I’d also ask here. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Tax brackets vs. withholding tables - Why were our withholdings so low in 2019?,"My wife and I got married last year. I got started on our taxes this week only to find out we owe over $6,000 in federal income tax because of severe under-withholding.

I understand there's an option to withhold more money from each paycheck, but why were we so far off in the first place? We both submitted W-4's to withhold as married filing jointly at the beginning of last year.

I guess I'm puzzled by the IRS withholding tables and why they're so different from the actual tax brackets. Annualized, they look like this:

&gt; $0-$11,800 - 0%

&gt; $11,800-$31,200 - 10%

&gt; $31,200-$90,750 - 12%

&gt; $90,750-$180,200 - 22%

But the tax brackets for married filing jointly, if you add in the standard deduction and divide in half, look like this:

&gt; $0-$12,200 - 0%

&gt; $12,200-$21,900 - 10%

&gt; $21,900-$51,675 - 12%

&gt; $51,675-$96,400 - 22%

Why do those not even come close to matching up? There's a gap of almost $40,000 where the tables say to withhold at 12%, but the actual rate would be 22%. That difference seems to be most of the reason for our shortfall.

Our incomes are not that different ($87K vs. $68K) and our pre-tax deductions did not appreciably change during the year, so I'm having a hard time understanding why the default withholding would be so different from what we actually owed when the year ended.",finance

As a result I got a tuition refund from the school for about $4,500 and I'm not sure what I should do with this money. Initially I thought I would just pay it back right away to start chipping away at my loan, but my mom mentioned that the interest rate on the loan is relatively low and she suggested that maybe I use the money to help get on my feet after graduation and invest it or use it to help buy a car, put a deposit on an apartment, buy work clothes, etc.

personalfinance,I owe $80K in federal taxes because of Uber RSUs,"Here's the basic information: I no longer work at Uber, but last year had $630,000 worth of Uber RSUs vest (this was at the IPO price of $45). At the time of vesting, my brokerage automatically sold shares to cover taxes (as it customary with RSUs). A huge mistake I made was not paying attention to the withholding rate for federal taxes.

When my W2 came in from Uber, it turns out that only $138,600 worth of my shares was sold to cover federal taxes. That comes out to a 22% tax rate.

Of course, because I had $630,000 worth of Uber shares vested and reported in my W2, it pushed me to the highest tax bracket for 2019. I believe this is the reason why I owe so much in federal taxes.

Later last year when the stock went down to about $29, I ended up selling all my shares. I do get to report a sizable capital loss but my understanding of tax laws states I can only deduct up to $3K of capital losses against ordinary income.

I ended up using that money to buy a house - if I planned this better I would have saved that money to pay the tax bill.

I wanted to know what my options, if any, are? The only hope I had was to use the capital losses to my advantage but I don't think I can. It really seems like my only option is to figure out a repayment plan with the IRS?

personalfinance,How To Get Approved For Any Credit Cards,"I am going to share with you the hidden gem that allowed me to get over +30 credit cards. This is the technique that I love to implement and has always worked out in my favor.

Let’s dive in. Have you ever wonder what happens when you apply for credit cards? Do you get automatically get approved? No, you don’t get approved in most of the time. Usually, banks give us a notice with 7-14 pending notifications letters via email. So how do we combat this long waiting time? Call the Reconsideration line to increase the odds of your credit card application approval.

Every credit card company has an underwriter who’s responsibility is to go over your credit profile.

4 Proven Steps to Increase The Odds of Application approval.

1. ​Contact the Reconsideration line of the credit card bank you’ve just applied

Right after you applied for the credit card, call the reconsideration line. More than likely, you’re going to talk to someone overseas like Indonesia or eastern Asia countries. When you’re talking to them, have a friendly conversation. The underwriters from reconsideration departments deal with people who are calling them with bad attitudes every day. More than likely, they are already fed up with people who are just complaining to them. So be different and make their day delightful.

HOW TO GET APPROVED FOR ANY CREDIT CARDS 

FYI: The goal of having a conversation with underwriters is to make good human connections.

*** HUMANIZE YOURSELF WITH THEM ***

Here are a series of questions I love to ask when calling the reconsideration line.

***HUMANIZE YOURSELF***

How’s your weather?
Which country and city are you located in?
What is the primary current event that is happening in your area?
What time is it there?
How was your last holiday? Were you able to spend some time with your family?
Where are your family located?
*** FYI: The underwriters have the authority to overwrite your approvals. They have the ultimate power of approving your credit card. So be kind to them***

2. Know the Benefits of Credit Card before Calling the Reconsideration Line

After humanizing yourself with the underwriter, your job is to phrase the benefits of the credit card. By phrasing the benefits of the card, you have another chance to humanize yourself on why you must need the card. You can tie your life to why you need this credit card and how much it can benefit your business. Thus, you can even talk about bringing more customer acquisition to the bank as well. Even if you’re automatically denied after applying online, that doesn’t mean you’re really denied. Every credit card companies have computer algorithms that automatically deny specific factors on applications. For example, you have more than 10 inquiries within 2 months and have acquired more than 10 different credit cards in the last 3 months. There are specifics that computer algorithms can catch and automatically denies. But it is okay because the underwriter ultimately can overwrite the system. So it is crucial to humanizing yourself with them.

3. Never Talk About Sign Up Bonus. Talk about your spending.

 Often credit card companies are dealing with people whose goal is to take sign up bonuses and extra cash-back, although it is obvious to know that people are taking this advantage. Many credit card companies don’t encourage this effort. So please, DO NOT TALK ABOUT HOW YOU’RE GOING TO GET SIGN UP BONUSES. 

 You want to sell yourself as a better candidate. Talk about how you’re going to spend more money on this credit card. For example, if I were to be on the phone with the underwriter, I would talk about how much I love this credit card and the number of X dollars I can put for such and such reasons. Remember, your goal is to sell yourself so that they can approve of you. You want to show them that you’re a top customer who can spend money and make them profitable. 

4.  Apply for the credit card with the same bank you already have a relationship.


 If the bank already has your information and you’re already utilizing their credit card, it becomes significantly easier to negotiate about your recent credit card application. For instance, when I am negotiating about the credit card application, I love to talk about history with the bank. I always mention how great the bank was and how much of great customer I am by spending money with no late payments. 

 If you already have a credit open with the bank, ask them to transfer your line of credit from the new account to the older account. For example, let’s say I have a Chase Freedom Card with a $20,000 line of credit. I can ask the bank to move the line of credit from Chase Freedom to a new credit card that I’ve just applied. In this way, the bank won’t be liable for giving me any more credit lines. Ultimately, you’re utilizing the same line of credit you have, which gives the bank no risk involved. 

If in an event, you’re still denied from credit card applications with the first underwriter, hang up and call again. You can always talk to new underwriters and increase the odds of your approvals.",finance

personalfinance,"Additional withholding as ""savings"" short term?","Hi all,

First of all let me preface this by I know it's stupid and overall a bad strategy. 

I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year now and we are starting to have serious dialogues about our future(marriage, etc). We are both in our mid-late twenties in a HCOL city. I graduated college with a bunch if credit card debt like an idiot, but luckily worked hard and now make a good money and am debt free, saving for retirement. She also makes good money and has been working to get debt free (about 6K left to go). She's super intelligent (evidenced by her job and engineering degree) but doesn't have good spending habits, no huge splurges but lots of little things all the time.

She's very open to change and this year has been working her budget pretty well. Something I was thinking about is having her withhold an additional ~$300 from each check which would result in a nice refund next year. Of course from a finance perspective this is stupid giving the feds a interest free loan, however I thought it would be a way to have her recieved a nice lump sum next tax season to either pay off any remaining debt(hopefully none) or as a nice mental ""reward"" for being debt free, as this money would be out of sight out of mind. I did this after college and it was an effective tactic. 

Anyways I know the key is addressing the root issue, which we are currently. Anyone think this is a good idea?

personalfinance,Is it worth refinancing Student Loans?,"Here’s the breakdown of my current balances:

Interest Rate: 6.13%
Principal Balance: 37,099.27
Outstanding Interest: 9,089.93

Total Balance of Loan: $46,189.20


————

As you can see, my interest balance is enormous (4 years of school plus 3 of deferment, kill me...)

By my calculations based on the current balances, with the APR of 6.13%, that’s adding about $2,832 per year in interest alone. In other words, about $236 per month is how much I’d need to pay to “break even” and *not* increase the balance from where it currently stands.

Right now I can afford $250 per month toward the loan. With an interest accrual of $236 per month, my balance would only be decreasing about $14 per month. If I kept this up for the life of the loan, I’d be paying for about 3,299 months - just over 274 years. Woo! 

Obviously my income will increase with time. But... here’s the heart of the question:

If I refinance my student loans, will my Outstanding Interest be added to the Principal Balance of the new loan? If so, does this mean I would actually be able to make principal-only payments on a new loan, since my outstanding interest would be $0.00? 

Obviously adding my interest to the principal balance would hurt, but if my rate drops a decent amount, would it be worthwhile?",finance
personalfinance,Negotiating Offer at Federal Laboratory,"Made a burner account for this post. I am looking for some advice with regards to salary negotiations. 

I work as a scientist at a US laboratory. I am not a federal employee; my organization is a nonprofit contracted to operate the lab. For the previous 3 years I have been in a temporary role (think residency for PhDs) with an annual salary in the $70-80k range. I just won out in a competitive candidate search (&gt;100 applicants, PhD required) for a staff position at the same lab and have been offered a position at $103k/year. This is exactly in the middle of the salary bracket for this position (based on internal grade #). I think I've been historically underpaid (maybe $5k or so) and promotions (ie. renegotiation opportunities) won't come up regularly. 

Thus, I'd like to negotiate for a higher salary but also wouldn't decline the offer as-is, since it allows me to pursue my scientific interests in a fantastic location. Most would happily relocate any distance for this opportunity.

In preparation, I have assembled the following points:

1. Past employment: I took a significant voluntary pay cut from a private sector position when I came here. Thinking I may say something along the lines of, ""While I understand private industry can offer more competitive compensation, I was expecting something closer to my previous baseline salary of $120k (not including \~$30k in yearly bonuses), since this is now a senior role with increased responsibility.""
2. Labor statistics: ONET and BLS list median incomes for similar job descriptions (including the private sector) at $100K-$110K. Unfortunately this includes all education and career levels. However, according to ONET 33% in my field have doctorates so maybe I can use as leverage (?). Of note, Fed. government GS rate in my area is nearly +30% due to high COL.
3. Historical performance: Every year I have received the highest possible performance review, including recognition as a key contributor one year. I have also participated in several duties not typically expected of my position.
4. Role fit: There were over 100 applicants (so I've heard), but the role perfectly matches my several years of advanced academic and professional experience. While my resume isn't particularly prestigious , I'd be surprised if any other applicant could match me on the number of preferred qualifications met.

Benefit negotiation isn't really an option here. The thing is, I have no idea how to present these points and then hold my ground if they just refer to private sector paying more (especially concerning points 1 and 2). Should I just focus on 3 and 4? Only on point 3? Also, is a call or email recommended? Maybe I'm over worrying/thinking? If anyone has suggestions, I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks!

tl;dr - Offered a competitive position at my current nonprofit/government employer and want advice on how to negotiate salary.",finance

personalfinance,[Debt] Seeking advice on medical school debt. Got offer from parents.,"I am a female physician with a large amount of student debt only from medical school (which is ridiculously priced). Currently my student loans are through the fed with principal of $320,629.65 which has been accruing daily simple interest of approx 7% for all since May 2015 when I graduated. Current value is ~413,000. Just recently I have come to realize I can't do the PSLF program because I can't work full time (due to various issues) so I have to switch to the 25 year forgiveness plan with my income-based repayment. However, forgiveness at that point is a taxable occurrence. As I was paying in residency for the past 4.5 years my payments were low with IBR and I've only paid about $8k total on my loans so far. My IBR payments starting this summer will go up to approx $1500/mo and it won't change a ton unless I switch specialties (Family Med doesn't make a ton). So with my math  and paying ~$1500/mo for the next 20 years until forgiveness I will have paid a total of (again this is all approximate) $367,897, then the rest is taxed. The amount forgiven will be about  $514k so at a 30% tax rate my taxes for just the forgiveness that year is about $154k. So grand total of forgiveness tax + total payments on my student debt will be $522k. 


I don't know if the government will try to take away forgiveness or if they will suddenly forgive a lot of debt. Most people in my boat don't know about forgiveness event being taxable, but I'm starting saving for it NOW or I'm screwed. 


My parents do pretty well and have given me an offer where I would refinance through a private company that has compound interest about 220k with payments of $2280/mo for 10 years and then get a ""loan"" from them for 200k that I start paying 1% measly interest on only after I've payed off the private loan. I would obviously start paying them RIGHT AWAY after the private loan is paid because pride. I would then save approx $47k in total if I did this offer from my parents. And there is so much up in the air with student loans with the fed that not having to think about that is nice. But what if someone eliminates all student debt tomorrow or soon, then taking this offer was a bad idea. What if...I just have no idea.

Are there any specific downsides to consolidating credit cards? Aka strong dings against Credit Scores, blocking access from certain types of lending, etc?

My credit history is actually pretty pristine (No missed payments in  15 years, I own a Condo) it's just low at the moment because of the outstanding amount of credit (around the  645 Experian Score, it was about 740 a year and a half ago before accumulating this debt)

personalfinance,First time homebuyer - need advice in HCOL area,"Good morning!

First time homebuyer here, looking for some advice for my situation.  I plan to get a pre-approval but want to make sure my head is in the right place first before I start.  Also sometimes it helps to write everything down to organize thoughts - anyway here goes.

Personal stats:  
$130k annual / $10,850 month gross  
780 FICO  
$200,000 downpayment on a house and still have an emergency fund (3 months rent/expenses)  
Have two car payments that equal $1,091/month, no other debt  
Married, my spouse is in the process of getting a job but has no credit score to speak of (recent immigrant) so I plan to try to qualify on my own.

The house I am looking to buy is $738,000 (Orange County CA).  My thinking is:  
$207,000 (28%) down  
3.125% interest  
Mello roos + tax = $630/month  
$128/mo insurance (guesstimate based on what I found online)  
PITI would be $3,033, or exactly 28% of monthly gross.

Now for DTI, it would be:  
HOA: $288/mo  
Car Payments: $1,091  
Which brings my DTI to 40.73%.

I was considering using $20,000 from a recent car sale to pay off one of my vehicles which would bring my DTI to 34.9%.  I figured this would put me in a very comfortable range, made even more comfortable once my wife starts working (background in accounting, should have no trouble getting something in the $40k/yr or more especially for the area we live in).

Now what I didn't realize are closing costs.  I don't want to use my emergency funds for closing costs, and I don't want to take closing costs out of my downpayment because I want to stay at 28% PITI or lower - not to mention I want to keep monthly payments at or below the rental rate in the area so I can rent it out if I decide to move back overseas again in the future.  Closing is estimated at $14k ($7,380 of which is to buy 1.315 points to buy down the interest rate to 3.125% from 3.5%) but I can't get accurate closing costs until I'm preapproved - but I don't want to submit for preapproval until I have my numbers right...  So now I'm thinking maybe I can try and risk the 40% DTI and use the $20,000 in cash for closing costs and throw the extra $6k into my emergency fund.  Or, pay the car off now and save $14k more, but risk interest rates going up.  So to recap I'm looking at 3 options:  
\-Have 40% DTI and use that extra cash for closing costs  
\-Pay down car to get lower DTI, take closing costs out of downpayment but go over 28% PITI  
\-Pay down car and save the $14k, but might take awhile and miss low interest rates

I guess I'm looking for advice on what solution is best.  Thanks in advance for reading!  If anyone wants to see my worksheet I made trying to figure it out I'd be happy to post it up.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan refinance,"Hello all, 

I just randomly applied for a student loan refinance with Discover Student loans (currently Citizenone serviced through Firstmark ($48k-6.5% variable) and DoDed serviced through Greatlakes ($20k-6.125% fixed)). The terms they gave me were 4.99% fixed with a lot lower minimum payments at $423 (currently $600 for both) and a 20 year term. I understand the details of refinancing student loans like not paying just minimum payment (I want to get this debt paid off) and the impacts of refinancing federal student loans into a private loan (I'm not interested in the security of the federal student loans just want the lower interest rate to pay it off faster), but what I'm asking is if Discover Student loans is a decent company to work with? I'll probably still get at least one more offer/rate from a different company but I wasn't able to get a clear opinion on Discover Student Loans from searching it on personal finance.

TL/DR: Is Discover Student Loans a decent company to work with?

5/$1,267/3.3%

7/$955/3.93%

10/$723/4.42%

15/$539/4.58%

20/$462/4.99%

The 20 year rate is the same but the payment is slightly higher (Discover is $423 I think). We can afford the 10/15 year option from Earnest but would we really save much money on interest (my math says $300/year in interest between 4.99% and 4.42% on a static $70k amount)? Considering the payment is $261 higher per month on the 10 year term that would give us less cushion if an emergency popped up.",finance

I think that his salary alone could cover the bills, and I could take more student loans to finish my degree over the next year, (Fall 2020, Winter 2021, and Summer 2021). 

I'm not sure if going down to part time will be an option at my job, but I will propose it. I have no interest in staying with my current company long-term. There are many jobs out there and I have about 7 years experience in this industry. I think that with a degree in hand, I shouldn't have any issues getting another full time job for more money than I'm making now.

Does anyone have advice on this plan? Or has been in a similar situation?

Specifically I'm worried about putting my career on hold for about 9 months and taking out more student loans to cover that. Will we even get approved for federal student loans this late in life, as a married couple? I've been paying out of pocket for university for the last 6 years or so. Thanks in advance!! :)",finance

personalfinance,"Medical student looking to start looking out for my future self in terms of saving and protection (disability, life insurance, etc.)","I'm currently in medical school and we get very little, if any, financial advice during this. I've been trying to look into various things that I can do now to make things work out better down the road but I'm discovering how complex finances are especially when you start trying to plan for the future. In general I have very little income (primarily just the federal loans we get which isn't necessarily income) but I have enough where I could put away a little bit here and there. 

I recently went to a session held by a financial adviser and learned that in my situation, since I can't really save into much, that it is all about ""building defenses."" He spoke about these 'defenses' being things like putting into disability insurance and a life insurance plan but I don't know where to start with that. He said to start doing this basically yesterday because by paying into small stuff like this I'll earn more value later down the road because a lot of things are based off of longevity and maximum amounts you can put towards different plans. Clearly based upon my vagueness here you can tell I don't know much.

That being said, in terms of saving I did open a Roth IRA recently with Vanguard and put some money into it and used it to get a few shares of apple. I'm hoping to be able to put a little bit in there here and there. If there is any other advice for saving please let me know as well. 

Overall, any help or advice would be appreciated and if there is a known resource that I should look into and read up on please point me in that direction and I'll be happy to do so. Heard the best time to do this was 5 years ago and the second best time is right now, so...here I am.",finance

I thought about treating it as a personal loan or credit card (even writing up some basic terms of agreement and having her sign them) and then charging her a high interest rate (because she doesn’t have a credit score, she’s 11) to really drive the point home that I’ve been trying to make both by example and through simply telling her.

personalfinance,"(22), Optimizing My Financial Situation for the Future","Good morning/afternoon/evening all,

After having been baptized into the world of FIRE and personal finance and analyzing all my expenses and income, I find myself in position where I would greatly appreciate some advice from the fine people of this subreddit before I go any further on my financial journey.

Short backstory: I grew up middle class in MN, did average in school, and then joined the military because I wanted to avoid the expense of college.

The only thing I remembered about money was that it was important to invest for the future. When I turned 18, I talked to my dad, and he set me up with an advisor who set me up with a Roth IRA. I had an auto-payment of $200/month.

When I was in the military, I didn't budget, didn't track my spending, I spent money on going out and partying on the weekends, and I didn't do really anything to take charge of my finances. The only thing I had going for me ,financially, was that I had no debt. I also kept putting that autopayment going toward the Roth IRA. When I turned 20, that's when I started planning for the future. I decided what degree I wanted to go for, which is a research analyst, and started looking at how to invest for the future. I was 21 years old when I was honorably discharged from the military.

A couple things happened when I got out of the military.

First thing I did when I got out of the military was buy a house. I was 21 when I bought my grandma's house on a contract for deed. I bought her house, no money down, for $277,000 with an interest rate of 3.5% over 25 years with a 5 year balloon to refinance. I rent out the basement for $480/month to somewhat offset the mortgage.

2) I got a job as a quality control tech. for a manufacturing company, it pays $18/hour.

3) I am going to school using my GI Bill and receiving $1400/month. I am planning on going to college until I get my MBA

4) I am transferring my Roth over to Vanguard and will put all of my funds into VTSAX going forward

5) I got engaged to the love of my life, and am looking forward to the wedding that is coming up! She has no debt and will be working as well. We will be living off of my income. I am planning on using her income to max out her own IRA and create an emergency fund(yes, she is in on the FI bandwagon)

Now, I'm reaching out to everyone on this subreddit for advice because I want to optimize my scenario for the future.

A couple numbers to look at 
Net worth -$12000 
Roth Ira-$13500(I stopped monthly contributions for now) 
My take home pay- $3300/month. 
Mortgage-$1400/month
Bills/living expenses/insurance- $1100/month
This leaves about $800 to save

I would like to have the ability to retire early so that I can spend as much time with my future family. What would you do to optimize my scenario?

Would you sell the house right away because you think it's a huge mistake?

Would you focus on maxing out your IRA account?

Would you focus on saving up for a potential down payment in 4 years to refinance?

Would you put a lot of money away for a big emergency fund?

Thank you all for taking the time to read this! I hope that others in my shoes can learn from the discussion.",finance
personalfinance,Save for a house or pay off student loans - will be applying for medical school,"Hi all,

I am applying for medical school this year, hoping to start in August of 2021. I currently have a savings account with 10,200$ in it. I've been paying ~$1500 towards my car payment monthly and will be finishing it next month, freeing up the $450 that I must make monthly towards it. 

I currently have $46,000 in student loans with an average interest rate of 4% - in varying amounts from ~$2500 to $8000. I will be unable to pay off a majority of these loans by the time I go to medical school, and once I enroll the interest on the loans will no longer be accruing interest. 

I am hoping to move back to Las Vegas for medical school, where average home prices are around $200,000 and rent prices for a place that will take my dog (a husky) will be anywhere from ~800-1000 - or the same as a mortgage. My question focuses on if it would be better to throw that $1500 a month towards a downpayment on a home, or to try to pay off one or two of the smaller balanced loans and try to pay them off. The likelihood that i'll have to take out roughly ~250,000 in loans for medical school is pretty much guaranteed regardless. Any advice is appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Advice Needed - Fraudulent Derogatory Remark on Credit History while Refinancing,"Hi r/personalfinance, 

My husband and I are beginning the refinancing process for our home. We bought the townhouse in December 2016 for $505k at 4.25% with an FHA home mortgage. We currently owe $465k, and would like to refinance to take advantage of the lower interest rates and also to remove the significant PMI built into our mortgage payment, which would save us total of nearly $1000 each month. 

I pulled my credit report last night via CreditKarma, and there is a recent derogatory remark claiming I owe $302 to Verizon...except I've never had a Verizon account during the time frame the collections company is reporting I did. I've never been contacted by this company. 

I've had ""debts"" for the same amount, also for Verizon, reported a few times in the past, and they've been removed after I disputed them to the credit agencies. I've tried contacting Verizon, but they just pass me around their various departments before informing me they can't discuss anything with me since it's been sent to collections. The collection agencies themselves are equally unhelpful. My thought is that once the report is removed, they sell the information to another company which then sends a new report to the credit agencies, which I dispute and we start this whole dance again. 

My credit is 685 but should be over 700 without this remark. All accounts are paid on time and my credit usage is below the 30% of available credit. My husbands credit is around 800. 

I've already disputed the account - but do I wait the 3ish months to have my score updated, or just pay the damn thing and be done with it? The loan officer (USAA) said we can proceed with just my husband's score, but I'm not a fan of that option. We'd have the same interest rate, just no PMI, and we wouldn't be saving as much...but I'm not sure if the savings difference is worth it. (Additionally, having our house in his name only is not ok with me, for a lot of reasons, especially considering I make twice his salary and paid most of the down payment to begin with.)

personalfinance,Do I need to report my 1098-T form on my tax return?,"Hi. I am a college student. I had a paid internship over summer and received a W2. I am trying to file my tax return using an IRS free file software. 

With only my W2 reported, I will receive money back from the federal government and state government in my tax return.

However, with my 1098-T form, I will be owing the federal government taxes. Essentially, the amount billed by my university is less than the total amount of scholarships and grants I got. Apparently, I do not qualify for education credits or deductions since my scholarships and grants already exceed my qualified tuition costs. 

At this point, for me as an individual, it is better to not report my 1098-T. I do not get any tax benefits from reporting it. I do not wish to claim education credits on my tax return.

I am getting mixed responses from online searches and people when I ask them about whether I need to report my 1098-T form or not. One of my family friend's accountant said that my scholarships and grants are tax-free and that I don't need to report my 1098-T. Some places online say that I need to report my 1098-T no matter what. Some are saying that excess scholarships and grants are taxable. Other places say that I should only report it if I get tax benefits.

* $2000 - Chad credit card, ungodly balance interest rate
* $4000 - Discover credit card, ungodly balance interest rate
* $12000 - student loans (deferred until July, avg rate = 6%)


Miscellaneous:
I am getting my second paycheck tomorrow. I kept my statement balance on all three cards at 0 for years. I had some expenses in my last 6 months of college, and needed to cover them, that slipped. I drive a fairly recent car - 2014 Mustang (salvage title, purchased 5 years ago, paid cash, 90k miles, zero issues). 

Most of thadebt was living expenses, some of that is tuition. I needed to pay back for a semester of classes + pay for the next semester, while I waited for my scholarship to reinstate. I had some mental issues that I've since had diagnosed, and I have gotten the help I needed.  The rest of that consumer debt is due to my irresponsibility. I'll be putting these cards on auto pay and charging a subscription or something to each, and leaving them out of my wallet for now. I don't want these balances to climb. 

Plan: 
Consolidation of credit cards: credit union is processing a personal loan for $10k with a 14% interest rate for 3 years. They will refinance in 6 months for a lower rate once my utilization drops. They are doing a direct-pay option for each card. In the meantime, I have a 4th card (with zero balance) with a $1k limit, and I plan to use it for all money activity, mostly as fraud prevention. I plan to pay this off in 18 months if I can help it. 

Employer benefits: $5k/year student loan repayment program - from what I understand, this will start 6 months after hire date, and covers up to $5k/ year in student loan debt. I plan to make my ~$350/month payments starting in July, in addition to the planned benefit from my employer. Its a new program for the company, and I haven't gotten all the specifics yet.  

Emergency fund: it's hard to save for a rainy day when my rainy day feels like now. But, I want to at minimum keep 1 month's expenses as a buffer to start with, and work up to 3 months in a high yield savings. 

I still need furniture for my apartment, but I have a table, 2 chairs, a bed, and a washer/drier to call mine for now. I'll have to make-do otherwise. 

Am I doing the right thing?",finance
personalfinance,Need suggestions in regards to investing a lump sum for parents who are retiring/retired,"Hello Reddit :),

I need some suggestions and understand different options for my parents who have just sold their house. 

Not sure who I should go to or ask, which is why I'm coming to the only place I thought would be worth getting an opinion!  I'm also thinking of maybe going to a financial advisor, but again not sure...

Here is some background info:

My parents just recently sold their house after 20 years. Since everyone (me and my siblings) moved out, their house has been too big for them to live in and both about to retire (one already retired), they decided to sell and look for something smaller.  Luckily the house value increased and they were able to sell for a decent profit. For this story, I'll say the house sold for $1 million. After paying the mortgage they owe, the realtor, and everything associated with selling the house, they're left with $900k.   


With this money, they are left to look for a new home and invest the rest. The price range for the new house if around $250k. I'm now trying to help them deal with finding a new place and handling the rest of the money but I am trying to understand what the best options are. The time frame for finding a new place is short. They have 1 month until they have to leave the house. Luckily one of my family members is on vacation for 3 months and offered them to stay in their house while they're away.

One of the decisions is should they buy a new house or rent for the next couple of months? I have been told that the housing market is great if you're trying to sell and bad if you're looking to buy. I know that the prime time to buy a house would be once the economy starts to show a downward trend, but whos knows when that will happen. So I'm looking for an answer to if should we wait to buy a house and just rent until house prices begin to fall?  Also, if they buy a new house, should they get a mortgage or pay in full? Are there any special interest rates on mortgages for people that meet certain requirements? At their age (mid 60s), I don't think buying in cash would be the best option here.

After resolving the living situation, there still comes investing the rest of the money. Once they retire, this will be the money they have to live off of. In regards to my parent's background, one still works and has a pretty decent paying job but the job is physically demanding and will now look for a part-time job somewhere near their new home once they find something. Both my parents are pretty risk-averse since they have never invested in any financial instruments and their house being the only thing they've ever invested in. After paying the mortgage, they have no other debt but not a lot of savings. The money made on selling the house is now their savings. They like the idea of investing in an apartment and renting it out, but again not sure if this is the right time to buy..  


Other options I have been thinking about have been:

1.Money Market Funds

2.Mutual Funds 

&amp;#x200B;

That's pretty much whats going on and would love to get some feedback and learn more about the different options.

personalfinance,Getting Continous Phone Calls To Refinance my Mortgage,"Hello,

Two years ago, I purchased a house with a down payment through a grant program which is an interest-free program. The grant will be forgiven after 7 years. However, the interest rate of the loan is 6.125.

At this time, I am getting a lot of phone calls from mortgage bankers urging me to refinance. They are pushing hard for me to refinance. I spoke with a few of them and I told them I do not have the cash to refinance. In addition, I shared with them if we do refinance, I will have to pay back the grant plus the program will back charge us interest. They told me not to worry about, we can just bundle the money that you need for the grant and the closing cost with the refinance. You will not have to pay a dime out of pocket.

I pulled out a couple of calculators online and I estimated $5000 for closing cost and also estimated $9000 for paying the grant back plus penalties (I did this by making the closing cost $14000 on the calculators). Most calculators showed that it will take 6 to 7 years for me to break even with a 4.0 interest rate.

My point of view, the grant will be forgiven in 5 years from now. It makes little sense for me to refinance due to what I mentioned above. I do not understand how they try to come across as they are trying to do me a favor.

Also, maybe refinancing in 5 years is a better option because then I do not have to worry about paying the grant and I will have easily saved for the closing cost.

personalfinance,Mortgage Question: is a deal too good to be true?,"I am buying my first home, and I shopped my mortgage around and thought I found the best deal. Lowest lender fees and the best interest rate of the brokers and banks I contacted.

However, a family friend knows a mortgage broker that offers a first time buyer program that includes $1,500 in the closing cost assistance and a $2,000 gift card to Home Depot. The lender fees are nominally higher (&lt;$200) and the rate is the exact same as my best offer. The catch is instead of the 20% downpayment planned, the program is limited to a 5% downpayment, meaning I'd occur PMI if I want this benefit.

The plan - and this lender's recommendation - is to pay the lower 5% downpayment, pay the first month at the PMI and then use the money I already have saved for the downpayment to pay a lump-sum into the loan and recast without PMI.

This deal seems too good to be true. I know I'd incur slightly higher first mortgage payment because of the PMI, but it seems clear that the lower closing cost would cover it.

Am I missing something? I already plan to ask about prepayment penalties, if the interest rate changes with the lower downpayment (meaning I would have the fully refinance for the great rate I have now), but I wonder if there's anything else I should be asking.

My closing date is in 30 days, so there's a lot of pressure to solve this fast. We have not scheduled the appraisal (currently in negotiation over home inspection content), but that will happen shortly.",finance
investing,Two reasons why stocks aren't as expensive as they look: DataTrek,"With U.S. stocks continually climbing to fresh records, some investors have latched onto fears that valuations are rising to levels that could warrant a correction.

But according to DataTrek co-founder Nicolas Colas, stocks today aren’t as overvalued as they look.

Traditional measures of valuation including price-to-earnings (PE) ratios do suggest the S&amp;P 500 is trading above its recent historical averages. The S&amp;P 500’s current forward P/E ratio is 18.6x, or well above the 10-year average of 15.0x. However, a combination of a low interest rate backdrop and shifting company composition of the blue-chip index today helps make the case for today’s rich valuations, Colas said in a note Wednesday.

First, interest rates have come down below their levels from the early 2010s, lowering the cost of borrowing for companies and giving them access to capital to grow their businesses at a cheaper price tag.

“From 2010-2013, when the S&amp;P’s PE was reliably below 14.0x, the average yield of the 10-year Treasury was 2.51%,” Colas said. “Everyone remembers when yields were low in 2012, often below 2.0% due to the Greek debt crisis, but bookending that were yields closer to/over 3.0%.”

Today, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield is hovering just over 1.6% and has not topped 2.0% since mid-2019.

“With corporate earnings stable in 2020 (i.e. no recession expected), valuations should be higher if discount rates are lower,” Colas said.

And second, more expensive valuations for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole make more sense when considering the most heavily weighted sector is now technology, with high-growth companies in this sector tending to trade at higher multiples relative to corporates in other groups.

Case in point: Technology sector companies are trading at 22.5x 2020 earnings, Colas said, while components of the financial and health care sectors – the cheapest groups – are trading at 13.2x and 15.9x this year’s earnings, respectively.

“Look back at how the S&amp;P sector weightings have evolved over the last decade and you get useful insight into why valuations are high just now,” Colas said.

“At the start of 2010, Technology was 18.7% of the S&amp;P 500. On an apples-to-apples basis Tech is now 27.5% (with Google which is now Comm Services but was in Tech in 2010, but not Facebook because it was only added in 2013),” he added. “Throw in Facebook, and you get a 29.4% weighting today.”

That outsized weighting for tech companies has come at the expense of sectors that tend to be lower-growth and trade at lower valuations, including the energy, consumer staples, industrials and materials sectors.

“Bottom line: U.S. stocks are expensive, but for understandable and rational reasons,” Colas said.

personalfinance,Tax prep: adding expenses on rideshare work decreases return estimate?,"So I'm just trying to understand what's happening in this case.

investing,A detailed discussion of using futures contracts to obtain leverage; holding a long position of the S+P 500 index,"In [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/eys2db/there_has_been_a_ton_of_discussion_about_leverage/), I reviewed some of the ways to obtain leverage in your portfolio. Here, I discuss futures specifically.

[Futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp) may be the most cost-effective way of obtaining leverage, or are at least comparable to options. With index futures, you enter into a contract to buy or sell the index at a future date (NOT optional), and the notional value contract can be 5x, 50x, or 250x the underlying index (in the commonly traded CME group contracts). Depending on how much capital you commit to the margin (a sort of good faith deposit), leverage can be anywhere from almost 0x up to 25x if your margin requirement was 4%. This position can be rolled forward quarterly, and leverage will increase if the index loses value and decrease if the index gains value.

You do not earn dividends, although this is reflected in the futures price (Future Price = Spot Price \* e\^((Financing Cost – Continuous Dividend Rate)\*Time to Maturity). When interest rates are high, the exponent is positive and the futures contract trades at a premium; you can end up paying a significant amount of roll adjustment in a market in contango. When interest rates are lower than the dividend rate, the exponent is negative and you get a discount for buying a futures contract; a market in backwardation is helpful for those looking to hold a contract long-term. Note that this roll adjustment does not occur when rolling a contract forward, but rather gradually over the life of the contract.

While all that might sound complex, the effect of contango/backwardation has not been substantial over the past 20 years as a whole because interest rates have been both higher and lower than the dividend rate. Let’s say we decide to trade the [E-mini S+P 500 contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emini.asp), where the contract size is 50x the index. If you were to enter into a futures contract in 2000 when the index value was \~$1400 and roll it quarterly, you would be forced into a margin call and essentially wiped out in 2008 with any amount of leverage &gt;1.5x (starting balance of ≤\~$47000). If you “rescued” your account and injected enough cash to avoid margin calls, you would have had to put up \~$4500 at the worst of the recession, and turned your $47,000 into \~148,000 in December 2019. This sounds great, but if you had simply invested your initial capital plus the $4500 in an S+P 500 index fund and reinvested dividends, you would have \~$164,000 with much less risk. “Rescuing” your account when starting with higher leverage has similar results, with higher ending balances, higher “rescue” requirements, and similar returns to the S+P 500 with dividends reinvested. By the way, releveraging or hedging your account by going long or short on Micro contracts (contract value 1/10 the Emini), you would do even worse.

Of course, if you started with $47,000 in 2010 and rolled forward 2 E-mini futures contracts (2 because this results in starting leverage of 2.36x compared with 1.2x for 1 contract) until 2020, you would have ended with \~$269,000 compared with the S+P’s return of \~$165,000. So, if you could somehow time the market, leverage obviously does well.

The only way I found of consistently beating the passive index holder since 2000 was to “double down”, or invest more money AND increase your leverage by buying additional contracts every time the index drops significantly. Let’s say you decided to start at 3x leverage with \~$24,000 committed, then trade an additional contract (increasing your leverage, requiring extra money to be injected into your account to avoid margin calls) every time the index dropped to 2/3 of its starting value ($952 for our example of starting in 2000 with the index at $1429), and wait at least a year to “double down” again. You would have started trading 2 E-mini contracts after the dot-com bubble burst in 2002, 3 during the 2008 Great Recession, and maintained those 3 contracts until December 2019. You would have injected \~$36,000 (more than the value of the initial account!) and ended with a final value of \~$427,000, compared to just investing your original $24,000 + $36,000 in the S+P 500 (reinvesting dividends) and ending with \~$191,000. Of course, this requires serious resolve and access to extra cash when the economy is at its worst. My next plan is to test this strategy over many time periods.

The final consideration is taxes. If you invest in a taxable account, you will be on the hook for only the long-term capital gains tax of 15% with stocks and ETFs, and you can realize those gains at the end of your investing period. LEAPs and futures are subject to the 60/40 rule, where 60% of your gains are taxed at the long-term rate of 15% and the other 40% is taxed as short-term gains (taxed as income), and you have to do this every year (although you can tax-loss harvest).

**TL;DR Leverage results in greater gains and greater loss, but can be expensive to obtain. Options and futures are the most cost-effective way of obtaining leverage. Holding a leveraged long position with options and futures is possible, but can be completely wiped out with severe drawdowns. An aggressive futures trading strategy of increasing your leverage and cash committed every time the index loses significant value could be profitable if the value of the index increases over time.**

Does anyone here use futures to obtain leverage?

**Edit:** Some of you are misunderstanding how leverage changes over time. Here is the link to some of the data ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hF1IXWXWZLZraVevnkL0oWVKuQMCQs6dXO46o8E7Zmw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hF1IXWXWZLZraVevnkL0oWVKuQMCQs6dXO46o8E7Zmw/edit?usp=sharing)).

personalfinance,Should I Liquidate my 401k to Pay off Credit Card Debt?,"TLDR: I have a ton of debt and impossible cash-flow. I want to liquidate my 401K to pay off credit card debt to fix my cash-flow problem, and then start rebuilding. Should I do this? 

\[Throwaway account for obvious reasons, and long post, but need some help, so thanks in advance for your help here. I appreciate it\]. 

Long story short with no excuses or explanation of how I got here financially, just the data points: 
* 38 years old, recently divorced single father, massive credit card debt, student loans, live in a major city with high cost of living and can't easily move because of child and divorce agreement. Debt and income numbers below. 

EDIT: Everyone is telling me I need a budget, which I understand. If this info is relevant: the credit card debt is a result of taking on my ex-wife's credit card debt as part of the divorce. I also incurred extra expenses as part of the divorce (for example, I had to fully furnish an aparment for myself and my daughter, etc.. I don't typically use credit cards to purchase things I can't afford.)

* I have a cash flow problem because of my credit card debt and student loan payments (meaning I am way underwater on income to debt payments each month) and am considering liquidating my 401k to pay them off, be able to survive, and start rebuilding my finances post-divorce.

The numbers:

**Debts**

* $57,880 in credit card debt. 

1. $25,647 on card A, 11.4% APR
2. $23,976 on card B, 19.74% APR
3. $8,257 on card C, 4.99% APR (balance transfer promo rate until Oct 2020, then 8.74%)

* $132,272 in student loan debt

1. Interest rates ranging from 4.66 - 6.8%

* $27,522 loan balance remaining to my own 401k that I took out to help pay off family finances pre-divorce (technically not a debt, but it's a large monthly payment).

My credit card payments each month are: $3,125.

My student loan payments each month are: $599

My 401k Loan repayment each month is: $828/mo 

**Assets and Income**

Income:

I earned $181,000 in 2019.

* I work in sales and am on a 50/50 base + commission split ($75K Base + $75K Commission = $150,000 On-Target Earnings \[aka OTE\], which is a bit below market rate for my city).
* I exceeded quota last year, but deals are slow to come in at my company, and I need every penny of my OTE (on-target earnings) in order to meet my expenses. As I head into 2020, I need (and want) to solve my cash flow problem once-and-for-all, because it is draining my energy and I'm living in fear. 

With just my base paycheck coming in (i.e. assuming I close no deals in 2020), I earn $75,000 annually, and **I'm upside down by $5,406 each month. I need an additional $5,406 each month to cover my living expenses and debt payments, and I'm paying a ton in finance charges each month.**

Assets:

$28,648 in cash (checking account, ESPP account, and etrade account).

$115,242 in my 401k ($84,643 from previous employer A, $30,599 from current employer B)

* $27,522 of this is already outstanding to myself / repayment to my 401k. If I withdraw the full balance of my previous employer A 401k, this will become a distribution, and this cash is already spent. 

**What I am considering / What I want to do:** 

* Withdraw the remainder from previous employer A 401k account as a distribution, netting me $37K.
* Take a loan against current company 401k, netting me a cash deposit of $15,184.
* All in, if I do this, I will be able to pay off all but $5K of credit card debt, and my loan payment back to my 401k will reduce to $263/mo. 

If I liquidate my 401K, pay off my credit cards, and reduce my 401K loan payment:

* If I close no deals in 2020 (an unlikelihood) and only earn my base salary, I have enough cash on-hand to survive almost a full year, when combined with my base salary. (I'll be upside-down just $2,492 a month, which is a savings of almost $3,000 a month from my current spend). Again, I should be able to cover that easily with deals that come in.  
   * This gives me breathing room to focus on work and generating business, which sounds like a dream to me. 
* If I do this, in addition to the breathing room, I can start working on rebuilding my finances and paying down my student debt, which I plan to put into a 3 year forbearance in parallel with getting these credit cards paid off.  

TLDR: Understand it is conventional wisdom to *never touch your 401k* but I don't see any other option. Am I crazy to liquidate my 401k?

personalfinance,USAA Car buying services not giving me the APR that I was promised over the phone.,"As a USAA insurance member living on Illinois I decided to use their USAA car buying services which is supposedly not associated by with USAA insurance.

The service offered me 3.59 APR if you don't go through their service which directs to car dealers, and a .5 APR reduction of you buy a car that you properly go through the channels and get a car that meets the criteria.

I thought I was doing everything right when I bought my car through them, but I didn't and I just found out today after having bought the new vehicle on January 15 , 2020.  The USAA Executive branch of the car buying service said their was a disconnect between their people who working with me on the loan and I will not get lower rate cause I did not properly go through the service.
I messed up and so did the people over the phone, but they won't help me even though they went over my phone calls and knew their workers messed up.

Is there something  I can do besides trying to refinance with someone else? Is there  an Illinois agency or Federal law or such that would help me.",finance
personalfinance,Discrepancy in taxes owed between FreeTaxUSA and Credit Karma,"Hey everyone so I did my 2019 taxes with both FreeTaxUSA and Credit Karma just to be sure nothing was way off. There's a discrepancy between the two with FreeTaxUSA having me owe $13,985 and Credit Karma having me owe $13,446 in federal taxes (I know I owe quite a bit of taxes but my income jumped significantly this year and I have already withheld as much as my tax liability from last year so I shouldn't be penalize according to one of the safe harbor rules).

I'm going over the two and it looks like the main difference is that FreeTaxUSA has me owing $12,672 of income tax while Credit Karma has me owing $12,133 of income tax. The self employment tax is the same for both. I'm not sure what to do. I'm considering having a CPA look over my work or should I just submit the one with the lower tax burden?

My friend withdrew all her 401k last year due to family financial hardship. She DID pay federal and state taxes as shown on her 1099-R form. When she was filing her taxes using turbotax, they asked her what the money was used for. The options ranged from death (I'm assuming family members) to other. She selected other and entered the amount she received and turbotax showed her refund jump from $263 to $1049. After double checking everything turbotax could not continue because apparently she no longer qualifies for IRS free file and has to pay to continue. She then used H&amp;R block to file, but they did not asked the same questions turbotax asked her after she enter her 1099-R info. Her refund amount was same as 263.

personalfinance,Helping my parents consolidate her student loans. Should they do it?,"Hello! I'm seeking advice on a current situation that I'm in. My parents have basically asked me to help them manage my mom's student loans. I'm really looking what's the best option here. Any advice is appreciated. If you need more information let me know. 

There are two federal loans: NAVIENT ($35,000 at 4.6%) and PIONEER ($137,000). The agent on the phone listed so many interest rates for PIONEER it was easily 10+ different rates.  She is 52 years old and has used student loans as a funnel for financial troubles over the years. I've learned they've only been paying on NAVIENT at $470 a month and PIONEER is just sitting there gaining interest. Since late 2018 her loan has gone up over $7,000 from them not paying on it. They're basically at a standstill after making a total of a year's payment. 

I'm looking if consolidating might be their saving grace to have one bill that they can pay on in a 20-year plan. PIONEER couldn't provide any monthly payment details where they haven't made any. I'm sure it's going to be a big chunk and they honestly can't afford both. What are there best options to do?

My mom's employer also offers a $150 dollar payment to her loan so having a longer existing loan over her work lifespan (15 years) seems like the best option. Their combined work income is around $80,000. Any advice is appreciated!",finance

stocks,Insider buying at Webster Financial Corporation,"John Ciulla, president and CEO of Webster Financial Corporation, bought $100,000 of stock on Monday

The purchase comes after the company reported decent results on January 23rd with full year 2019, earnings $373.0 million, (EPS $4.06) compared to $351.7 million (EPS $3.81) for the full year 2018.

Valuation looks also very reasonable with trailing PE of 11.8 and yield of 3.3%.

However, the great thing about Webster Bank is it is the parent company of HSA Bank, which provides banking services to consumers who want to save money for future healthcare costs with a health savings account.

The beauty of HSA banking is twofold. First, few people care about the interest rate they earn on their deposits into an HSA. Second, once opened, HSAs are one of the rare types of accounts in which the balance grows month after month and year after year.

With a fast-growing treasure trove of low-cost deposits, Webster can be a below-average bank in almost every other regard -- it could make more bad loans, spend too much on fancy offices, and so on -- and still eke out a higher-than-average return on equity thanks to its exceptional HSA Bank business.

personalfinance,Should I withdraw Roth contributions to pay down CC debt?,"Wife and I are finally addressing our debt issue. 

She's a recent grad while I've been out of school for about 3 years. Combined gross income is around $132k per year. 

We've got 15k in CC debt we are aggressively paying off before we roll into our two car loans $30k, her prialvate student loan $12k and then her massive ($270k)  federal student loan debt. We own our house and owe $126k on a $130k mortgage. House valued at around $165k or so.

I've a pensioned job with a local municipality that is very stable. She works at a multi-doctor practice as a veterinarian, the practice is thriving.

Her company matches 3% so we are taking that, however we are not contributing anything else to retirement prior to the debt payoff. 

Once the debt is gone (projected at 4-5 years) we will be able to aggressively save for her retirement so I personally feel that the extra little bit in the roth currently, isn't going to do much between now and 4-5yrs from now. 

Between our two Roths we have around $2k of contributions that could be withdrawn to hit this CC debt a bit, would it be that bad of an idea?

Edit: The 4-5 year payoff mark factors in a very likely $13k raise for myself in a month or two and $7.5k in bonuses that are pretty standard for the wife.

Obviously its optimistic to assume this will happen, however we aren't spending the money preemptively, we are pessimistically projecting a 7-8 year payoff and optimistically a 4-5.",finance

* My gross income for 2020 should be $100K + $10K bonus (taxes properly withheld by employer on the bonus) - Paid twice monthly
* My wife's income will be around $63K (paid once a month)

2. Do I need to add $2K to the line on Step 3 for our child? Its confusing to me that the pre-filled W4 doesn't have this already since I indicated that we have a child.
3. My state (CO) looks to be using the same W4 form for 2020, but I am not sure how to figure out our withholding for state using this form. Is there a good way to calculate this? Or just use the same number on line 4c as we did for the federal?

investing,Growth versus fundamentals,"Recently and most knowingly for the past year with low interest rates and REPO funding by the FED were seeing incredible appreciation of equity pricing in US markets. However this move is most noticeably seen for the TECH sector with Nasdaq beating other index’s in terms of growth in the past year or so. I was wondering however the true nature of Tech stocks ( high growth) and what investors are truly investing for. Most tech stocks, AMZN for one, are generating great revenue and have strong cash flow. They mainly stress the idea of reinventing profits into the companies future instead of paying a dividend,etc - leading one to call the stocks, “growth stocks”. However when catalyst for consumer spending decays what are investors truly getting from stocks such as AMZN, GOOG, etc. Its no longer about purchasing value but purchasing future value imo, hence why most analyst use forward earnings forecast ( a number which I think is frankly overrated, since it always assumes performance under a stagnant macro environment which is truly unpredictable imo). My prime question is are investors in growth stocks investing for strong cash flow or true value ( book value)? What happens during an economic downturn/black swan event to growth stocks? Should investors and portfolio managers be only shifting a small % of capital as the beta on them outweigh the possible gains they have in the short term ( 1 year or so)? 

For my personal portfolio would this be inefficient as the risk reward may be lower: 40% - value stocks with good divended payment, 20% growth stocks that have consistent cash flow/better tangible value, 35% treasuries, 5% gold and commodities",finance

personalfinance,Personal tax software that can split a Joint return into two MFS returns?,"Hello,

Please direct me where to post instead if this is the wrong subreddit! This seemed to be the best match I could find.

Because of student loans, my wife and I file MFS in both Federal and State (California) returns. We live in a community property state (California) so all income, taxes paid and deductions are split evenly.

I know some professional tax prep software for accounting firms allow you to prepare a joint return, click a ""split"" button, and then it splits it into two separate MFS returns, doing all the math and the community property worksheet for you. Specially, [Lacerte Tax](https://proconnect.intuit.com/lacerte/) does this -- I've seen it myself when I used the demo to check my math after doing it manually last year.

Are there any personal tax prep software (equivalent to turbotax) that support this? Otherwise, I'll likely have to do manually -- TurboTax still makes you adjust all the entries manually so not really worth it. But I'd happily pay another software company $100-150 if they do support it!

Other than MFS in a community property state, our taxes are fairly simple: W2's, interest income, itemized deductions, and that's it. The one time we paid a CPA, it seemed a waste.

Thanks!

Edit 1: 

Writing out the details in case anyone is curious, and in case anyone else out there is in this situation:

* Sizable Federal Student Loan
* Planning to have forgiven (PSLF)
* Married
* Loan holder makes less income

In  this situation, loan payments will be lowest if the loan holder is also  the lower wage earner, you used an income based repayment plan, and you  file taxes as MFS rather than MFJ. In our situation, it's a difference  of about $750/month in loan payments. Worth well more than any credits  or penalties we miss out on because of MFS instead of MFJ!

And  because we are in a community property state, we end up using alternate  income verification to Dept. of Education, not the tax returns when  calculating loan payments. But the rules still say you HAVE to MFS to  allow calculating loans on individual income, even if you don't use the  returns to verify income!

Info:
-I am 36, full time employed at about 115k/yr in California.
-I have a 403a/b account from a previous employer at about 100k, vested balance— not sure if I should roll that into my new employer account or leave it there.  It’s doing fine on returns.
-Current 401k is at about $10k and I contribute 9%, increasing by 1% annually, I don’t max out my contribution every year because it would severely impact my monthly income at this time. I’ve had this account for 1 year.
-I own my own home with a mortgage principal of about 400k 4.875% interest (best I could get at the time) and have no other debt (student loans or otherwise).  
-I own a newer vehicle, no payments
-I am in the process of opening a traditional IRA and will max out my contribution for 2019 and 2020.  
-I am opening a moderately-conservative cash management account with 40k
-I have 25k in a 529 account for my son who is 5 years old.
-I am having a baby in May and will open another 529 for him with 20k

I have an inherited IRA that has about 7k- I’m thinking I should just cash that out.

So with those things, I have about 75k left to play with.  I am going to open a HYSA but is there something else I should be looking at opening?  Should I take a small amount and invest more aggressively?

I would like to refinance my home in the next year or two for a better interest rate, but I’m currently just waiting on my fico to go up a bit more as some negatives fall off from several years ago.

This is the first time in my life I’ve been financially secure so I’m uncomfortable taking on too much risk right away.  I know virtually nothing about investing beyond the basics. 

Any input is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"Should I pay off one of my student loans first, or my car?","So I'm starting a new, higher paying job. I'm going to have about $300 extra a month to put towards some of my debt, but I'm not entirely sure how I should do it to pay everything off as quickly as I can.

I know this seems straight forward but I'm really confused on what I should do. Aside from other debts, I'm currently paying: 

$511 a month on my car ($16,194.05 left, 9.340% apr),  

And $81 a month to one of my student loans at Wells Fargo ($5,504.67 left, 12.49% apr). 

I also have another set of student loans with Nelnet (total of $16,401.50 with interest rates ranging from 3.760% to 4.450% but I'm not worried about paying that one down until my car and WF are taken care of)

Generally I know I should pay off the higher interest rate first, but I was thinking if I pay the car off sooner, then I'm freeing up an extra $500 a month that could then be put towards the student loans, in addition to the extra $300 I was already paying towards the car note. 

Any one have any input or advice to give here? I tried looking through the wikis but having trouble making a decision still. 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,How do I fill my taxes as a Canadian interning in the US on a J1 visa?,"I did a summer internship in Seattle last year and I just got my W-2 by mail. I live and go to school in Canada. This is my first time filling dual tax and I'd like a sanity check:

&amp;#x200B;

* Since I was working in the US under a J1 visa, do I need to fill both a US federal tax claim and a Canadian tax claim?
* Do I need to file anything for the state of Washington or just Federal?
* To receive foreign tax credit, are there any additional documents I need besides my US payroll and W-2?
* My W-2 box 1 includes around 20k in relocation, transport and housing expenses. But my employer already grossed up the tax on those benefits. Am I eligible to claim additional work deduction in Canada?

investing,"Is there really a ""dollar leak"" that contributes to inflation? Can someone help me understand a concept I recently came across in my education of treasuries?","I was listening to [a recent episode of TIP network's podcast We Study Billionaires](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/episodes/tip279-stock-market-melt-up-w-luke-gromen/) and having a difficult time following along to the subject matter as he discusses the value of other currencies compared to the dollar and inflation. This episode has taken me a long time to get through because I am frequently pausing to tab over to investopedia and brush up on terminology the guest speaker throws around. I had to rewind 4-5 times to try to understand the point that the guest speaker Luke Gromen makes regarding inflationary influences on the dollar.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Around 29:00 Luke is presented this question : ""Explain dollar shortage.""  

His answer is two parts:  
1) Foreign entities borrow dollars and experience a loss in value of their local currency in relation to the dollar over time, meaning their debt obligation increases over time in terms of their currency. (This makes sense, no problem here)    

2) His separate point is where I get confused. Luke says ""you're creating dollar loans with no base money to pay it back"". After listening a few times the only thing that can make sense here is if you interpret this sentence differently: ""you create a loan in dollars and provide it to an entity that eventually defaults on the loan"".  
&amp;nbsp;  
Is my rewording of the statement in 2) correct? This seems to imply that if someone (domestic or foreign) defaults on a federal loan- there is essentially a ""leak"" of that dollar value. Some amount of credit equity on the lender literally ceases to exist, while the liability equally disappears. (The point being that at some point the FED is required to print more money as these leaks accumulate)  
In the case of a domestic lendee the value of the borrowed dollars was likely used to purchase equity in some form which doesn't disappear, but the equity may have been purchased in a foreign market (such as buying manufacturing supplies from china). In the case of a foreign lendee, it may be the case that 100% of that  dollar value was used in a foreign market- essentially erasing those dollars from existence.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I would love to hear your thoughts and corrections as I grasp these concepts.",finance

personalfinance,$3000 in hospital debt and disabled,"Hello all. I need massive help :(

Last month I lost the ability to walk unassisted. Right now I’m using a walker and cane. I went to the hospital and then was ‘admitted for observation and testing’ into their inpatient, and while I was there I underwent many tests. Doctors determined I have basically nothing wrong with anything but my head - told me I have Functional Neurological Disorder, which is when there’s nothing on any tests but you’re still effed in some way.

They said that sometimes this heals on its own, so they declined giving me the paperwork for disability payments bc they can’t ‘guarantee I’ll be disabled for 12 months’. I had to quit my job because obviously I can’t work at a hotel if I can’t walk without a walker, so I don’t have any income.

I moved across state lines and applied for Medicaid where I’m at now, and got approved. The problem is that they won’t cover the hospital bills from my previous hospital, and I just talked to the hospital and they won’t set up any payment plan and literally told me ‘that’s not how it works anymore’ and that everything will go to collections if I can’t pay. I told them I don’t have a job and have no way to make money, but they don’t seem to give a shit.

This is going to completely tank my credit and I’ve worked so hard to get to 640. Please help. What do I do?",finance

personalfinance,Desperately trying to dig myself out of the financial grave I dug myself before my baby is born,"This is hard to write, but I am desperate for advice. I am 25 years old, and about to have a baby in 4 months. It was not planned, but I made the decision when I found out to step up and do what I needed to do to get my life together for this baby. It seems more and more impossible every day, though. I am so overwhelmed by my finances, and feel like I will never be able to give this baby the life it deserves. I feel like I am drowning because of my own poor financial decisions.

I have about $70k in student loan debt, all in collections. My dad had promised to pay them, but because of serious health issues (he is now a disabled veteran) and other circumstances that were absolutely not his fault, he was unable to, and they were put on the back burner. There is one loan that I pay $218/month that is still in good standing.

I work as an RN in pediatric home care making $33/hr in Rhode Island. My company offers absolutely no paid time off, and the health insurance is crazy expensive. It also does not cover mental health services. So I pay for private insurance, which is $425/month. To get insurance for my baby, as well, it will cost me about $800/month. No paid time off means school vacations or any time my patient does no go to school and I don’t work, I don’t get paid. I always ask if there are other patients who need coverage during these times, but sometimes they don’t have any other hours to offer me.

Three years ago, I got married. My husband at the time was unable to keep a job, had a terrible spending problem, and racked up tons and tons of debt. I dumped so much money into helping him fix his problems that I saved absolutely no money myself. I have no savings, no retirement fund, no emergency fund. We got divorced after 6 months (and 4 years prior together) because he cheated on me, and beat my dog. I also had a miscarriage during this time. Because of all of this, I spiraled into a depression, and tried to kill myself twice. Both times put me in the hospital and out of work for about a month.

I have a car with a loan that costs me $417/month. I am upside down on the loan because I put no money down on it, and have a crazy high interest rate. My credit is in the low 600s because of my student loans. Because of this, selling the car and getting something cheaper is not an option.

Between my boyfriend and I now we pay $1500/month for a one bedroom apartment-so about $760 each. We will need to move within the year to a two bedroom to accommodate the baby. We also pay for electric (about $200 during the winter months) and cable (I don’t know what this costs, my boyfriend pays this).

I have two credit cards with a $1000 limit. Between them, I owe about $800. However, this number is constantly increasing because I only make minimum payments or have to keep using them for food, gas, etc. I took out a $5000 personal loan a couple of months ago to pay them off because they were maxed out. I also used this to pay my car insurance off for the next 6 months. I pay $211/month on this loan. I pay $70/month to my mom for my phone, since I am still on her plan.

We have two large dogs who eat a TON of food. This costs me about $45 every 3 weeks. I also have to pay their vet bills. One has a bad leg which will most likely require another surgery soon. That will be about 3k.

I try to put money away in savings, but it seems like something is ALWAYS coming up. So, I end up making just enough money to pay my bills and that is it. I always have to take money back out of my savings after I put it in because something unexpected pops up (dog gets sick, I get a flat tire, etc etc). At the end of the day, I can’t save anything. And I am not paying anything at all right now towards my loans in collections. That is a huge issue that needs to be addressed.

My maternity leave will be unpaid, except for 4 weeks through the state of Rhode Island, and that will only be partial pay. We will not be able to afford daycare when the baby comes. If we don’t save enough, that 4 weeks is all I will be able to take. I have applied for per diem and part time jobs elsewhere for extra income, but not one place has even called me back, never mind hired me. I’ve been applying for months. My boyfriends parents offered me the name of their financial advisor, but I can’t even pay the fee to see them once. I don’t know what else to do. I grew up with a mom who makes overall absolutely terrible life choices and because of that, I have a lot of childhood trauma to deal with. I am so scared I’m going to do the same thing to my kid. I am willing to do whatever it takes to fix this and give my child the life they deserve.",finance

personalfinance,"Even though your caller ID says your bank is calling, remember that even legit business phone numbers can be spoofed.","Today I was woken up by a phone call. My caller ID says it's from my bank. So I answer, and they tell me that they found unusual activity on my debit card in Ohio, and wanted to verify it was me. I said no, as I'm in Florida, and they go on with how they're going to cancel my debit card and send me a new one. For security they're going to send me a code to my phone that I need to give them. You know the drill. Had I not been minutes out of sleep I probably would've caught the red flag, but I gave them the code without thinking.

She verify's my address for the new card, and that's when I notice on the text message with the code it says ""As a security measure, we will never ask for this number over the phone."" Hmm, that's interesting. Then I get an email from my bank saying that my login information has been changed. I tell the lady on the phone to hold on one second, then immediately try to log into my account and sure enough I can't. So I hang up, reset my password, and call the bank. Mind you, I'm calling the number on their website, which my caller ID says called me. While on the phone with the actual bank, I'm getting called from the bank itself, per my caller ID.

Long story short, they attempted to pull approximately $2100 from my bank accounts through a Zelle transfer and two wire transfers. Unfortunately for them, they didn't change my email address or phone number, so I got notification of that activity, and was able to stop it.

All this to say, stay vigilant when it comes to your money. Once I noticed the email saying my login info was changed, I was able to change my password within 20 seconds, but that was ~2 minutes after they changed it. I can only imagine if I wasn't as technologically savvy, or didn't have a computer right next to me, or something like that, how much actual damage could've been done. So keep in mind that just because your phone is telling you who's calling, it might not be correct. If you're getting a call from someone who says they're from your bank, or any business really, feel free to tell them you're going to have to hang up and call them at the number you have. And if you notice anything that seems even remotely suspicious, hang up and call a number you know to be correct.",finance

""What does it mean if I lock my rate today?”

“What rate lock time frame does this Loan Estimate provide?”

 “Is a shorter or longer rate lock available, and at what cost?”

“What if my closing is delayed and the rate lock expires?”

“If I lock my rate, are there any conditions under which my rate could still change?”

“If I lock my rate, and interest rates go down, what happens?”

Thanks for any advice or experience offered.

TLDR: Offered a 3.25% fixed home loan, is this a good rate.

personalfinance,31 YO - Need Advice - Settlement,"Hello,

Throwaway account here. Recently came into a $100,000 accident settlement. No tax obligations and already done w/ injury costs.

I've read the windfall section and all of the investment sections, attempting to use this 100k the best way possible. Wanted to run it by people here and get there takes on if I'm making the right moves or should modify them.

$100k settlement, so far I've:

\- Paid off the last $11,000 of a high interest student loan

\- Maxed out Roth IRA contributions for 2019 and 2020 ($12,000). Put into a Fidelity target fund for 2050

\- Invested $14,000 into a Fidelity Brokerage account using the 3 fund model. FSKAX = $6,500, FSGGX = $3,500, and FXNAX = $,3,500. I have $500 sitting in my Fidelity money market account as well. I have no plans for this money any time soon, should I invest more?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have a 401k through the company at 25k, fully vested and getting full employer match. 

What changes would you make? No other debt /obligations outside of Fed Student Loans and a lease that about to run out (not debt I know).

I now have around $62,500 left. I have $18,000 left on Federal student loans. That is made up of 4 loans, 2 with 6 and 6.5% interest and 2 with 5%. Do I pay them all off or just the 6% or none?

What about the balance? I plan on buying a house in the next year or 2 and would like to set $20,000-$30,000 aside for that. Best method? Also looking at a used 2019 jeep that would put $4-5k down. Live in a Low cost of living area and make $60k a year.

Would like input on how to best utilize the remaining $62,000 between house, student loans, and stocking an emergency fund of $10,000-12,000. I'd also like to set a tiny bit a side for myself to enjoy with a trip in the short term.",finance

personalfinance,Can someone PLEASE help me figure out general tax steps I need to take for a large federal school loan debt I settled last year? Totally lost!!,"Hi,

Here's the quick and dirty intro to my issue. My Federal School Loan went into default and collection late in 2019. At the beginning of 2019, I worked with the debt collector (Central Portfolio Control) who was representing the Dept of Ed to settle the debt for a lump sum smaller than the total. Now I need to know how that cancelled debt affects my taxes this year. It was my basic understanding that cancelled debt over $600 needs to be reported as gross income on tax returns.

**There are a few numbers to keep track of here.**

1) US Dept of Ed originally assigned a balance of $33,042.60 to CPC

2) My final Account Balance with CPC before settlement was $40,636.85

3) My settlement with CPC was for $29,129.87 to clear the debt

4) I received a letter from the Dept of Ed days later saying they had officially agreed to accept a settlement of $26,817.50 to settle my debt with the Debt of Education (when I called, they stated that the difference in settle numbers was the Debt Collectors share).

**Fast forward to Tax Season**

* I received a 1098-E Student Loan Interest Statement from the Debt of Ed in the amount of $851.26 of interest received.

* I have received no other documentation.

* Being under the impression that one or both of Dept of Ed and/or CPC would be filing a 1099-C for cancellation of debt, I called both places, and neither said they had a 1099-C form on file that they would be filing or would give me even an estimate of the cancelled debt that I might need to declare.

**Now I'm lost.**

The reason this is so important to me is that I planned on filing for insolvency to as to not have to pay taxes on the cancelled debt (which I've read requires Form 982). However, I don't know what the actual cancelled debt amount that might be applied to my gross income is. Is it the difference between what I paid CPC vs what I owed? Or the difference between what the Dept of Ed received and my account with CPC?

How do I declare the cancelled debt on my taxes, do I just include it as part of my gross income, or file something separately?

**What type of professional should I be looking for for help?** I'm guessing a basic Tax Prep person at H&amp;R Block might not be the most useful in guiding me through this, but there are many levels of tax help. Should I be looking for a more experienced Private Tax Prep business? CPAs? Lawyers?

I thought I had a decent understanding of this, and now I'm totally lost. Any help is GREATLY appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Debit card replacement fee of $15 too much? Are my credit union expectations too high?,"I've had a Florida Central Credit Union account for years now, but I recall the replacement card fee being $5 in the past.

I somehow lost my debit card, so I called to see if I could pause it. After waiting for over 30 minutes, I spoke to someone who told me they could only cancel, not pause, my card which would automatically cause a replacement card to be sent for $15 (not expedited, regular 7-10 business days). The only way to prevent the $15 charge is to call another number during business hours tomorrow and cancel it from being sent.

I'm wondering if I should cancel the new card and switch to a different credit union, or if the grass just looks greener on the other side. 

I'd rather not pay $15 now \*and\* in the future if I lose a card and have to wait who knows how long on the phone just to do so. I also went through too many hoops to claim money from a stolen card in the past compared to when money was stolen from my BOA debit card (learned that lesson and mostly use a CC now). Such a high replacement fee puts a bad taste in my mouth and makes me wonder how else they might screw me over. I have family in the military, so I think I'd be able to join Navy Federal CU.

personalfinance,which loan to fund capital improvement / renovations?,"^(I live in a small co-op. I don't think this affects the advice, but people will wonder probably. Being small, we decided decades ago to not have a reserve fund, and instead to have everyone be their own reserve fund--all 10 units are the same size and pay the same portion of expenses and same maintenance. So when there are major expenditures, we often simply assess each unit the multi-thousand-dollar amount, and people get loans or use savings, etc. Commercial loans can be hard to get and they have a high interest rate and lots of fees; most of the individual ways to get money have much less ""waste."" Plus this keeps our monthly maintenance fees low. Most people own their apartments outright (mortgage is paid off and plan to be there for a long time.))

The co-op apartment building I live in is going to redo the roof (required), and my share will probably be $50,000. I am trying to decide what form of loan to get (I don't think we have enough in savings, though we could use some savings and do the rest on a loan). We will probably be expected to pay the assessments in chunks as we go along, to correspond with the contractor's billing as stages of the job are complete.

Some other factors:

We will probably want to redo our two bathrooms at some point soon—maybe even this year. If the building's roof project qualifies for a state tax deduction (we're a landmarked/historic property, and if the roof qualifies, then every interior renovation done that year will also qualify). I have no idea how much that will cost, but I'm thinking about $20,000 for each.

The loan options I know about:

HELOC: I think if we go this route, it's best to get one for a higher amount than we think we'll spend, right? Because being too close to your credit limit dings your credit score? My bank (Chase) quoted me 6.75% amortized on $100K and 6.37% for $50K, so getting one at $200K might be a much higher rate.

FIRST MORTGAGE: We paid off our initial mortgage several years ago, so we could just take out a straight mortgage. Chase quoted me 3.25% on $50K and 3.75% on $100K (fixed). (we can prepay and recast the loan if we don't use it all). A credit union I can join has very similar rates).

Or is there any sense in combining solutions? Go w/ a first mortgage for the roof, and a HELOC for the potential renovations?

Or a HELOC for the whole thing?",finance

personalfinance,Am I thinking about car ownership incorrectly?,"I've always paid for my cars in cash and did some of the maintenance myself. I did not want to pay interest on a large car loan. My philosophy was buy a used, reliable car that has mostly depreciated and maintain it well. For example, in 2013 I bought a 2007 mazda3 hatchback with 120k miles for $4800. It was in great shape and we'll maintained. Now, about 7 years later I have spent $9k in repairs and maintenance and expect the car (currently at 212k miles) to reach well over 300k miles. My average cost of ownership is $0.15 per mile, with about $13-14k spent and 92k miles driven.

I estimate I could sell my mazda for around $3k currently as it has new suspension and new clutch, brakes, etc.

My parents bought a 2015 RAV4 for $22K and drove it for 40k miles before selling it for around $16-18k or costing them $0.125 per mile. I don't have the interest info on the loan which definitely plays a factor but generally the interest rate is below 2%.

That got me thinking that if I finance the purchase of a newer car and drive it for 5-6 years and then sell, I could potentially lose less money and drive a better, newer car and spend less dollar per mile.

personalfinance,My terrible car loan experience with DCU,"My experience with Digital Federal Credit Union was so bad that I created a Reddit account just to post about it. Yes, this is my first Reddit post ever. Long story short. Don't do it.

I purchased a used 2010 Nissan Maxima following college as a present to myself for working hard. I loved everything about the car, especially the sport mode. Driving fast with my sunroof down was something I always looked forward to. However, I quickly realized how fiscally irresponsible a 7% loan was. So, I sought alternatives. One of those alternatives was DCU.

I discovered DCU via Reddit (as most of us probably have) and decided to apply. Oddly enough, during my application process I was expected to fulfill some prerequisites. If not, I'd need to donate some money to one of their partner organizations. Spending money with a company I have no guarantee of working with felt weird at first but what's $10 to a boss ya know? $10 spent.

If you contact their customer service department you will be placed on a 30min hold EVEN IF you type your member number and PIN. I get on the phone, hear my lovely information about my loan, choose my terms, and feel the job is complete.

A few days go by and I found mail from DCU. These dickheads mailed the payoff letter and payoff check to ME. After explicitly discussing how this would be mailed to my current credit union, they somehow sent it to me. I try and squeeze in a call with them during work hours for about two weeks because someone that can't answer your questions always answers the phone, connects you to three other departments, then accidentally shoots you to the operator again. I get on the phone with someone and request my loan be cancelled. This dickhead tells me he can't cancel the check. I ask why , he says it's not their police. I pause.

Me: I understand you're just doing your job. But, human to human, does that make sense to you?

personalfinance,Paying off credit card debt,So when considering how to best approach credit card debt what is the most successful option? I have enough in my 401k to do a loan equal to my credit card debt with a 5% interest rate and a 3 year term. My portfolio grew by 16.5% in 2019. My other thought was balance transfer to a 0% interest card for 12 months with a 3% fee. I won't have it paid off in 12 months but that would cut the debt down and doing that a couple of times if necessary isn't hateful either. After the 12 month period those cards are 20%+ on remaining balances so I would have to transfer again. Current card interest is 9.99 until May then ~19% after that.

Make okay money but paying it all to the loans and not gaining any ground, with no room in the budget to save or make double payments. Credit is too bad for a consolidation loan with lower interest. Time for bankruptcy?

Greetings PF,

I lost my job near the end of '17 and started to use credit as a way to stay afloat. I also had (and still have) a small business that was not yet profitable, but has incredible potential, so that was funneling some of my income away as well.

Eventually I couldn't pay my CCs and I decided to take out, over the course of 2018, 3 high interest loans to a) keep the business afloat and progressing/ordering more inventory, and b) consolidate and payoff credit cards.

Poor choices have led me to this point where my C:D is 95%, my score is in the 550 range, and while I make about $3.5k/mo take home, I am paying close to $1300/mo for the loans and CC debt. I'm wondering if I have any good options outside of just ""keep on truckin""? I'm not really gaining any ground, I don't think my score is going to increase any time soon, and I can't qualify for any consolidation to help with the interest rates. Is bankruptcy a thing?

Monthly Budget Details:
~$3500/mo net income  
$750 rent  
$180 utilities  
$250 car  
$120 cell phone  
$80 insurance  
$400 loan A (balance $2700, APR 141%)  
$340 loan B (balance $2200, APR 105%)  
$180 loan C (balance $3200, APR 39.99%)  
$180 loan D (balance $900, APR 39.99%)  
$65 CC1 (balance $280, APR 34.99%)  
$45 CC2 (balance $440, APR 34.99%)  
$45 CC3 (balance $500, APR 29.99%)  
$30 CC4 (balance $260, APR 18.99%)  
~$850 for food, gas, and entertainment (lol, yeah right). Sometimes also need to pay for supplies for the business.

Note: for the business, I won't see any significant income from it until towards the end of the year, and at that point about $4k. I don't know if I can stomach waiting until that time to pay off some of these debts. I feel like all I do is work and have not much in the way of money to show for it.",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

economy,Central Bank of India strives to balance growth and inflation risks,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) left rates stable and left the door open to further easing monetary policy on Thursday, as it sought to maintain unsustainable economic growth and avoid raising already higher inflation levels.

https://preview.redd.it/4js91dyv6hf41.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9829bc9f82ebc004f72d254047903b44f6d2a336

The central bank has cut back on operations, as India’s economy is projected to grow 5% a year, ending in March, the lowest in 11 years. The rapidly spreading outbreak of coronavirus in China also casts a shadow over the global economy.

The downward risks to global growth have increased due to the outbreak of coronavirus, the consequences of which are still unclear and unfolding, said RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das at a press briefing after the decision.

Economists had expected the RBI Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave the key repo rate INREPO = ECI unchanged at 5.15% and the reverse repo rate INRREP = ECI 4.9%.

All six MPC members voted to maintain stable rates and maintain accommodation policies.

According to some economists, the RBI decision is not surprising, as the economy shows classic signs of stagflation. The sharply higher inflation prevented the RBI from playing a card of rate cuts, despite the continued economic weakness.

Indian shares .NSEI .BSESN strengthened, rising 0.55% immediately after the decision on the rate, while the 10-year benchmark bond IN064529G = CC and INR rupees = D4 remained virtually unchanged.

In an effort to accelerate lending growth, RBI has introduced several temporary measures that allow banks to get rid of the need to allocate additional cash reserves for individuals who receive additional loans, as well as for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).",finance

personalfinance,Previewed taxes and owe around 3k. Worth trying through a CPA?,"Hey everyone

Yesterday I started entering the data to have a look at my tax return for this year. I used H&amp;R online free version as I usually do every year, and so far the result is I need to pay 3k back to the federal government.

Now owing tax this year wasn’t exactly unexpected as I had my allowances maxed out last year. My wife only started working in the last quarter and I needed the extra tax money on a monthly basis to make ends meet. This year I updated my W-4 to make it more compatible with my situation, but I surely wasn’t expecting a 3k hit this year.

I have a pretty standard situation, married filing jointly (both W-2) and 1 small kid, a mortgage with PMI and that’s it. When H&amp;R ran the numbers, they said the standard deduction would be better as I wouldn’t go past it using itemized.

My question is do you guys think it’s worth trying to have a CPA do my return? Do you think he will be able to find ways to significantly reduce what H&amp;R is telling me I owe?

For the past three years I’ve worked as an EMT. I burned out super hard in December and worked my last shift at the beginning of January without a solid plan in place, I was feeling desperate to get out. I pretty quickly found a job teaching drums at a music store but the managers have been unable to find me students yet so there is no work. 

I’ve been doing a job delivering books for book fairs but it only adds up to four hours a week. Some of my earning has been coming from rock and roll gigs but that really only covers gas and some food. So I’ve been losing all my money.

In response I’ve minimized my grocery bill to $20 a week but I’m hungry and getting mad and making an effort to ration out the gift cards my Mom sent me for christmas.

I had to spend $180 to fix my car which killed my bank account and I’m waiting for the right time to ask my parents to help financially, because they require that I send them $100 a month as a security type payment in case I don’t pass my classes, so that complicates the asking for money.

I have been looking for a steady shift job but (no joke) I’ve been rejected from 16 jobs over the past month. All the jobs I’ve been applying to are basic retail/grocery store jobs, so I have no idea why I’m getting rejected.

personalfinance,"Tax preparation services (TurboTax, FreeTaxUSA, etc) optimize for federal refund, not total refund","TL;DR - tax preparation software optimizes for federal refund not total refund and by switching between itemized and standard deductions, pick the one that gives you the largest refund.

I discovered this while preparing my taxes last year. I noticed that my state refund was considerably lower than it was the year prior. After digging, I found that because I had taken the standard deduction for my federal taxes, my state had done the same. My understanding is that they must be the same for both federal and state. This is true in Virginia at least, maybe elsewhere.

Anyway, my itemized deductions were close to the standard deduction so I switched over to itemized and my federal refund went down but my state went up, for a net gain of a couple hundred dollars in refund. This was also true this year, where my itemized deductions were a couple thousand shy of the standard deduction. Double bonus was that I did not have to include my state refund as taxable income this year because I had taken a lower federal refund than if I had chosen the standard deduction.

I am unaware of a negative side effect of this, but if there is please let me know. Otherwise, check it out, you may get some more cash back than you were expecting!",finance

personalfinance,Illinois 529 Rollover Deduction Confusion,"I keep reading that rollover contributions from out of state 529 plans into one of Illinois's are tax deductible. But, I can't find a ton of detail. Can anyone help shed some light on my situation?

I rolled over about $1600-2000 (still need to find my actual basis) worth of contributions plus gains from a Missouri plan last year, but all of those contributions were in previous tax years. Most were while living in Missouri, so I already got a deduction there, and maybe a year or two while I was in Illinois before I opened an Illinois account. The information I'm finding online for Illinois doesn't seem to indicate that the contributions you roll over need to be from the same year or mention anything about if you already got a deduction in another state. And, it doesn't sound like Missouri would recapture anything from me doing this either. But that all just seems too good to be true. Right now my net federal + state return is like $40 so it doesn't seem worth paying a tax preparer to ask about this. So, I've turned to the folks here.

Excerpts:

&gt; There are 45 million borrowers who collectively owe nearly $1.6 trillion in student loan debt in the U.S. Student loan debt is now the second highest consumer debt category - behind only mortgage debt - and higher than both credit cards and auto loans. 

High-level statistics:

&gt;**Total Student Loan Debt:** $1.56 trillion  
&gt;  
&gt;**Total U.S. Borrowers With Student Loan Debt:** 44.7 million  
&gt;  
&gt;**Average Student Loan Debt:** $32,731

Interestingly, public school debt has increased significantly faster than private school debt:

&gt;**Public Colleges:** 66% of borrowers who graduated from public colleges have student loan debt. Average student loan debt at public colleges is $25,550, which is 25% higher today than it was in 2008.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Private Non-Profit Colleges:** 75% of borrowers who graduated from private non-profit colleges have student loan debt. Average student loan debt at private non-profit colleges is $32,300, which is 15% higher today than it was in 2008.  
&gt;  
&gt;**For-Profit Colleges:** 88% of borrowers who graduated from for-profit colleges have student loan debt. Average student loan debt at for-profit colleges is $39,950, which is 26% higher today than it was in 2008.

My commentary:

I'm not reflexively opposed to taking on debt; I took on $33k to get my MBA, and my total comp went up $40k/yr as a direct result. However, there's a big difference between my choice to take on debt as a self-sufficient, married 26-year-old and others' choices to take on debt as 18-year-olds who are going to college because they ""should""go. I learned yesterday that federal loans do not require the same plain-English explanation of terms, rates, payments, etc. that private loans do; even just having clarity for borrowers would probably help. 

I don't think it's a crisis that lots of people have debt or that the nominal values are high, but it is problematic that only about half of borrowers are on the standard, 10-year, fixed repayment plan - repaying undergrad loan well into one's 30s can certainly be a problem when people are trying to start families and buy homes.",finance

personalfinance,HYSA or moderate risk fund for after finished prime directive,"Hi, 

I have an account a relative endowed to me when I was a child. I never really took much note of it until recently. There's about 35k sitting in some mutual fund, and about 7.5k sitting in the sweep fund with an interest rate of 0.17%. To get better use of the 7.5k, I figure it would be best to either put it in a HYSA or potentially a moderate risk index fund. 

I've already followed the prime directive - My student loans are all paid off, have 6+ months emergency fund saved, I max out my company 401k/IRA, and have a downpayment for a house saved (&lt;2 year timeline). I also put ~25% of my paycheck into Vanguards total stock market index fund (VTSAX) and a little bit into I-bonds as a safer investment. 

I figure I could just put this money in with the rest of the Vanguard fund, but am not sure if I should be a little more risk averse and go with a lower risk fund, or just put it all in a HYSA/CD to be completely safe and still reap a better interest than what I'm getting now.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance? Too Soon? Too Long?,"So I just made my first payment on my refinanced student loans February 3rd. The details of said loan are 20 years, 5.09% Interest, and $239 payments.

&amp;#x200B;

I pulled up new rates for my loan:

I can get the same 20 year term, for 4.96% APR, $236 payments. (Yeah I'm not going to refinance for this)

15 year: $276.8, for 4.61% Fixed

10 year: $370.5 for 4.4% Fixed

7 year: $494.72 for 4.23% Fixed  or $489.09 for 3.89% Variable

The reason I did 20 years was because A. I was starting a new job in a new area and wanted to get used to the cost of living. and B. Just for a safe buffer zone as I didn't have an emergency fund built up. Since then, I have built up to an almost 3 month expense emergency fund in about 5 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

According to my Mint Trends I spend about $4200.  (Although my budget is $3600, travel is the culprit). I bring in about $4500 a month. With an extra $4500 throughout the year. I do expect a $150 expense increase due to being on IBR for my federal student loans. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that should give a fair financial picture of me. I'm looking to refinance probably after my bonus comes through in March or April and I pay off my 0% intro-APR card which has an iPhone on it.

Is this too soon to re-refinance my private student loans? I'm thinking of going for the 10 year loan just to have a buffer from the large payment just incase financial hardships were to happen, although this loan servicer does offer a defer option for job loss and the like. Paying extra as my budget allows.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?",finance
stocks,21 Y/O Seeking Advice on Investments,"I've recently inherited some money from my late Grandparent's, some of which I can only access if it were to be invested (\~$4,500). After doing some research on the best options for holding and investing this money, I've gone ahead and opened an Roth IRA through my brokerage. It's worth mentioning that my financial goals are completely rooted in the long-term, as in I have no plans to tinker with these initial investments for AT LEAST 5-10 years.

Thus far, my plan is to invest 80% of this money into ETF's and individual stocks such as: Microsoft (obvious reasons), Synopsys (will likely hold a monopoly on the data-chip industry as AI takes off), Visa (societal transition away from cash spending &amp; increasing online shopping transactions), Paypal (similar reasons for Visa + acquisition of direct payment services like Venmo), Disney (not as bullish, but I believe it has potential to grow substantially as the company continues to branch out internationally), and lastly, I'm interested in looking at investing in at least one marijuana stock (maybe CGC since it's tanking currently) because I believe the industry will explode in the next decade when it'll inevitably be legalized federally.

In addition to these individual stocks, I'm interested in putting 30-40% of this 80% allocation into a couple ETF's, such as: VTI (20-30 year hold), VT (security against potential US market crashes), QTEC (although Tech sector could be volatile short-term, I believe tech companies will only continue to grow and dominate the market throughout my lifetime), VOO (may wait until the bubble pops before buying in), and QQQ.

In terms of the final 20%, I'm either going to put it into Bond ETF's or High Dividend ETF's. Although, I'm open to advice/suggestions on how to allocate that 20%.

Lastly, I just want to add some background info, because majority of these investment posts for people in their 20s always emphasize having some liquid cash sitting around so you can buy stocks when they're ""on sale"". Aside from the \~$4,500 I plan to invest now, I have another $3,000 set aside in my Roth for future purchases. Also, I want to make it clear that this money is only accessible to me if I invest it. That being said, while I want to make safe investments, I'm also open to some higher-risk options.

Since I don't have any relationship with my parents, I've had to teach myself how the stock market works, financial responsibility, how to perform quality DD, etc. with very minimal guidance. Having said that, any advice/opinions/suggestions would be extremely appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Is the stock market going to crash in 2020?,"I just turned 30 last year. My spouse and I are both doing ok financially. My parents lost their home in 2008 while I was still in high school. Since then I have always been afraid of the stock market because of how volatile it is. I do not handle stress very well, so I would probably panic sell if the market crashes again. However for the past decade, the stock market has been doing really well. I wish I have started investing early. 

Here is my question, is it too risky to enter the stock market in 2020, given the trade war with China, election year, coronavirus slowing down Asia trades etc. I’ve talked to some friends about low risk investing, like only investing in tech ETFs or SP500 ETFs, instead of buying one specific stock. But SP500 ETF has increased 20-30% in 2019, will it still keep going up in 2020? I wish I had jumped on the bandwagon in 2019. Now I am just too scared to enter the stock market. 

Here is our financial situation. My spouse and I make about 250k a year combined. We work in k-12 education and tech. We have some student loan debts, roughly about 20k left for both of us, but we’ve been paying minimum monthly payment for about 7 years since we got out of college, and the interest rate is about 3%. So we just decided to keep paying the minimum payment for the last 3 years since most of the debts are now just principal payments from a 10 year loan. We bought a home in 2017, and the purchase price was 580k. I see some other homes being sold in my neighborhood for around 600-620k, we put down 20% when we purchased our home, but it looks like the housing market stopped going crazy since 2017. We wouldn’t make any profit selling our home since we have to pay realtor fees. We have about 150k cash saved in a high yielding MySavingsDirect savings account, but I feel like the return is low compared to stock market. We can comfortably save about 5k per month after monthly expenses, insurances, mortgage and debts. I have about 120k in my 401k, and my spouse doesn’t have a 401k but contribute 10% towards California teacher association for retirement (not too sure about that state education department retirement plan). And we both would like to retire early if possible, and move somewhere cheap and live off savings/investments. I only joined this reddit channel yesterday after I watched some youtube videos about personal investments. I feel like we should start investing in something, and we are always open to good financial advice. Thank you very much for reading!",finance

Then at 2 to 4 years they generally drop to only 2 or 1.8, not going back up again until 5 or 6 years. I don't understand the logic here.

Also, in general it seems easy enough to find high interest savings accounts at 2% if you have money for the initial deposit. Why would anyone lock money in a CD for the same amount of interest.

personalfinance,Tax filing: CreditKarma has been a massive headache. What do I do?,"This was my first year filing my tax through CreditKarma because it was free. My federal got accepted, but I still haven't gotten my refund. It was accepted almost 3 weeks ago but the status on the IRS website is still showing ""Your tax return is still being processed. A refund date will be provided when available.""   

&amp;#x200B;

In comparison, I recently submitted tax for my family members using Turbotax or H&amp;R Block and all of their refunds are already on the way.  

&amp;#x200B;

 I thought that I could refile using a different tax preparation website because I wasn't sure whether IRS even got my tax filing. I paid for H&amp;R Block and submitted but my federal got rejected because of a duplicate SSN already in the system for the tax year. Do I continue waiting for the refund? It hasn't change from the ""still being processed"" stage. I also saw that H&amp;R Block gives me $100 more in my return. Should I submit a 1040X for this $100 difference? My concern is that once I mail it in, it's going to cause an even longer wait and possible headaches down the line. I will never use CreditKarma again as I never had any issues like this using Taxact, Turbotax, or H&amp;R Block.   

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: 

1) I see that my return could be $100 higher. But do I bother with mailing in an amended return using the 1040X form? It says it could take 2-3 months for it to process.  

2) If I just stay with my original filing, why is my status on the IRS website stuck on ""Your tax return is still being processed. A refund date will be provided when available."" for so long? It never took this long ever when I used other tax preparation sites. Will I get my refund soon? I tried calling IRS today but it's hard to get through.  

3) For state tax filing, it was never accepted through CreditKarma. It is still in the waiting to be accepted for almost 3 weeks now. At this point, do I just submit my state tax separately through my state's tax website? However, the numbers don't seem to matching up when I go through the much less intuitive state's filing site so this is causing another headache.  None of the tax prep software allows state filing only. I looked into the mailing option but it looks complicated and requires too many supporting documents.",finance
personalfinance,Does it make sense to refinance out of a Cal-Vet mortgage ?,"Hi, 

I purchased my home back in 2014 through a Cal-Vet home loan at an interest rate of 3.75%. Since then I have started a family and we have outgrown our 1 bed 1 bath home. I discussed it with the wife and we want to keep our home and eventually use it as rental income but we would need to refinance out of the Cal vet loan since it would no longer be our primary residance. We plan to still live in our home for another 2 years but not sure if it would be in our best interest to refinance now to take advantage of the lower rates. We still owe about 220k on the loan. 

Thanks",finance

personalfinance,College Fees in german/british institute,"Hey reddit,
I live in germany and graduated high school last year. This year i want to start study music production. Since music production is not widely availible (only 2 univeristies), don't have many options to apply to. One university is a federal university which has basically no fees at all. But being responsible, i can not bet everything on one card. What if they won't take me? So i looked up the other institute, which is a private college. This college has locations in germany but with it's cores in the UK. And when i looked at their tuition fees, they were absolutely out of my price range. Up to 8000€/year you have to pay, studying at this institute. 
Here are my questions:
1. Being a british institute, is it normal that the fees are that high in other parts of the world and am i just spoiled by germany's educational policies?
2. How can someone, graduating from high school, with parents with an everage income afford such an education?

personalfinance,How to get out of a very bad car loan?,"I'm 27 and debt-ridden, though paying slowly everything off. When I moved out of my parent's home at 25 I wracked up credit card debt and was delinquent and had debt collectors chasing me for a while.  

I've slowly been paying off the debt, but my score is still in the low 500s. My car died, and the repair was more then the car was worth about 9 months ago. I felt stuck and my only option was financing a car with DriveTime and their own loan agency bridgecrest. The interest rate is excessive at 24% and the car was purchased on a 16k Loan.

The monthly cost is 502$ each month and i've never missed a payment but i'm going to be paying that bill for a very long time at this rate.

I feel stuck, and with rent, food, basic necessities, car loan, car insurance etc. I'm basically getting about 300$ in left over money which I've been using to pay off my credit card debt.

I don't really know what to do with this car loan. It's such a huge amount of my monthly income in fees and the apr is so high. 

How would people of personal finance suggest moving forward? 

Thank you for the advice.

It's been over two months and I'm only just getting to the point of job hunting and shaking myself out of it.

To help cover rent, I withdrew my entire 401(k) (somewhere around $2,300, I believe; I only had 90 days to to roll it over, anyway) and I received the higher of two withdrawal amounts (i.e. hardship vs. termination): $1,700. The confirmation indicates that I'll actually receive $1,400, though, because $350 is going to federal taxes.

The long story short of their plan for me was to move my funds into their money market, and then transfer money from that into a checking account to pay my monthly bills, and deposit more into a ""fun"" account. Also keep adding to my savings. This will allow me to ""save more"" as I am working with less ""fun money"".

I owe Sallie Mae about 39k at about a 5.5% interest rate. I also owe about 76k in federal loans at about 5.3% interest which I’ve been planning to have forgiven by PSLF in nine years. My monthly payment is currently $38.00 a month on an income-based repayment plan. Obviously, I didn’t go to graduate school to make 40k a year so I’ve been seeking new full-time employment aiming to making around 65k but in reality probably will end up at 50–55k (applying to government and hospitals hoping for a salary jump and to still qualify for PSLF). 

While looking for jobs, I found an opportunity at a local and well-known private practice with a good reputation for a part-time position. This employer would pay for me to go through extensive training in a niche form of therapy which is currently in high-demand which could be a great move for me financially and professionally in the long run. This employer is asking for a three year commitment and ultimately, would like to grow her practice and hopes that the position in the future could become full-time.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 10th, 2020.

# **Markets could see a turbulent week as investors watch coronavirus, economy and Fed testimony  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/markets-could-see-a-turbulent-week-as-investors-watch-coronavirus-economy-and-election.html)**
*****
&gt; The uncertainty around the coronavirus could continue to carry more weight in markets than corporate earnings or the consumer inflation and spending data expected in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday in his bi-annual appearance before Congress, and investors are watching to see if Powell looks ready to move away from the Fed’s neutral stand on interest rates.
*****
&gt; Trading was volatile in the past week, with stocks sharply higher four of the five days as investors viewed the virus’ progress to be less rapid than feared. But by Friday, the death of the doctor who discovered the illness and the addition of restrictions in Shenzen, a key manufacturing hub, were among the headlines that renewed investor fears. By Friday, 31,000 people were reported to be infected, mostly in China, but the amount of new cases slowed for a second day, according to the World Health Organization.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lower Friday even after a much stronger-than-expected January employment report showed 225,000 jobs were created — 65,000 more than expected. Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.
*****
&gt; “The data has been very positive, but it’s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn’t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week — Tesla.
*****
&gt; The electric car maker’s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.
*****
&gt; “I do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,” said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. “I really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it’s not as crazy as it was in 1999.”
*****
&gt; Maley said now that the stock has “washed out” on the upside, there’s likely more downside ahead.
*****
&gt; “Some of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that’s usually a sign of a top as well,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Brakes on growth
&gt; UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China’s economy.
*****
&gt; “Next week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,” he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.
*****
&gt; Thursday’s consumer price index and Friday’s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.
*****
&gt; The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing’s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.
*****
&gt; “I think there’s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,” said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. “Most of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.”
*****
&gt; Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.
*****
&gt; “With the strong jobs, I think it’s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,” said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. “They mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they’re thinking about that. That’s the main thing we’re looking for.”
*****
&gt; China’s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.
*****
&gt; Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.
*****
&gt; “If we’re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,” the economists wrote in a note. “We assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.”
*****
&gt; # Earnings Bonanza
&gt; Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market’s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.
*****
&gt; So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.
*****
&gt; Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.
*****
&gt; # Playing Politics
&gt; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa’s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire’s primary Tuesday will also be important.
*****
&gt; The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,” said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. ”[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates. Does that make him more or less electable? If he’s more that could be a market negative development.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has gained 55% since Donald Trump became president, and analysts say he is viewed by investors as having the best policies for the stock market. Some Democrats, particularly Sanders, would raise taxes sharply.

Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively.

# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020

&gt; U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.

&gt; Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg’s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December’s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December’s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market’s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kciking-off-2020-with-a-strong-rebound.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.

&gt; In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. “Today’s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “But the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.”

&gt; The one slight blip in today’s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.

# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls

&gt; China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market’s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.

&gt; In the above charts, the market’s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market’s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.

&gt; Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January’s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.

# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally

&gt; February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&amp;P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&amp;P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February’s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.

# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?

&gt; Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&amp;P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?

&gt; There’s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, “As goes January, so goes the year.” This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?

&gt; As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&amp;P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; It isn’t all bad news though. Remember the S&amp;P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. “Yes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.”

# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus

&gt; The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&amp;P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.

&gt; Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.

&gt; This year’s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&amp;P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&amp;P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.

personalfinance,Best Time to Refinance an Auto-Loan?,"I had to buy a new car about 6 months ago and have a pretty high interest rate, 13.94%. I've never missed a payment, on any bill for matter, and have a fair credit score - just under 700.  I can afford my payments but I would like to save more long term by lowering the interest rate as much as possible. 

When would be the best time to start looking into refinancing this loan to lower my interest rate without hurting my credit score? Should I wait until I've had the loan at least a year or is 6 months long enough?",finance
personalfinance,Tax help-1099-B after filing,"I got (what I thought was) all my tax papers and I filed at the beginning of February. I file in two states, so 3 filings total. 

Then I received a 1099-B after filing with some unreported income (under $1,000, but enough to be significant). I did not sell any stocks, but one of the funds I invest in got bought out so I guess the change over counted as a sale. 

What do I do now? I looked around and it seems like I need to wait for refunds and file an amended return. Will I need to amend federal and both states? Thanks in advance! 

I filed using free tax USA, btw.",finance

personalfinance,Is it worth paying off our home if we plan on selling in the next 1.5 years?,"I've tried searching this sub for similar questions and I seem to only find questions about paying off your home to keep... Not sure what the pros and cons for paying it off to sell are.

Our situation: My husband and I owe $55k on our current home. It's in a great location and we have no doubt we will be able to sell it for a profit. We make around $90k a year and have $50k in savings, as well as our own retirement/HSA accounts that are maxed out. I also have some investments my parents made when I was a baby but they total less than $3k and I've never touched them and don't plan on it.
We plan on upgrading to a larger house and do not plan on spending over $200k. In the market right now in the areas we like this is very doable but who knows what will happen when we are actually ready to buy.

Does it make sense to aggressively pay off our mortgage before putting it on the market? Or would a year and a half of essentially not adding to our savings/having to be mindful of big purchases and vacations not be worth it?

This is our first home so we don't really know how the selling process works.

Would we pay off our home and then just get a new home loan when we find a new one? Is it an option to pay off most of our loan and then kind of flip it to the new home so we can keep our low interest rate? I understand these are things I should talk to our lender about but wanted to get others opinions/experiences as well.

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my debt?,"So here is the situation. Graduated university a year ago with about 46k of student debt remaining stretched over two separate loans. One of which is sizably larger at 36k and the other Perkins loan at 10k. 

I also have about 8k of credit card debt (2 cards) which is largely due to having financial difficulties over the past two years. After I graduated the job I had lined up fell through and since I work in a very niche market I had to find something else while I looked for a new Job.

btc,Federal Reserve Board Governor: The Fed is Looking Into Creating Fedcoin,,cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Decentralized finance is now a unicorn: more than 1 billion dollars is now deposited in defi. But WTF is defi?,"For the first time ever, the total value of all assets currently deposited in decentralized finance has reached 1 billion dollars:

[ https:\/\/defipulse.com\/ ](https://preview.redd.it/mc4o7poiiqf41.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b481bc4dc4d0050776e95123221d962ea019369e)

**But WTF is defi?**

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is the umbrella term used to describe dozens of decentralized financial protocols that run without intermediaries on the blockchain. These protocols can be used by anyone, and include services such as lending, derivative markets, high interest-earning savings accounts, decentralized exchanges, and many more. These protocols are used by interacting with smart contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

The 3 biggest defi protocols are:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Maker**

Maker provides the Dai stablecoin, which is a decentralized cryptocurrency stabilized against the value of the US dollar. Unlike other popular stablecoins whose value are backed directly by USD, DAI is backed by crypto collaterals that can be viewed publicly. Maker runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

[More info about Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Synthetix**

Synthetix provides a derivatives market through its ""*Synths*"".

Synths are tokens that provide exposure to assets such as gold, Bitcoin, U.S. Dollars, TESLA, and AAPL within the Ethereum blockchain.

[More info about Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Compound**

Compound is an algorithmic, autonomous interest rate protocol.

For example, Compound currently has $30,000,000 of DAI deposited that benefit from a 8.81% annual interest rate. The compound protocol runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

[More info about Compound](https://compound.finance/)

&amp;#x200B;

**1 billion dollars have been deposited, so what?**

You might think that it's just another imaginary threshold, but it also means something way more significant:

Despite the bear market, the blockchain technology has managed to successfully grow a new major use case. A use case of a kind never seen before, that appeared at a time at which it's more than needed:

While many countries have started to provide negative interest rates, defi can offer high interest rates.

While more and more personal information is required by financial institutions to invest, defi leverages blockchain to allow an unlimited and anonymous access to similar if not better services.

And this fantastic growth happened in just 2 years.

Pay attention, because defi is booming.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: [this video](https://youtu.be/bRizf5uH2Oo) has just been released by Chris Blec, who provides the best videos about defi. If you're not fond of reading and want to learn about all major protocols, check his videos and give him a sub!",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinance to higher interest?,"Ok I know usual the rule of thumb is to refinance when you get a lower interest rate but looking for advice on the following scenario. 

I own a condo that I used to live in. I closed on it with a really good interest rate (3.25). Been paying on it for many years now. When I moved away I rented it out for about market value, which is less than my costs (PITI+HOA). I’m losing money on it monthly (several hundred). 

I received an offer in the mail recently to refinance the condo with a higher interest rate (3.375) and no closing costs or anything out of pocket. After refinance, I would finally net positive cash flow on this property. 

Does it make sense to make this move? Refinance to a higher interest rate for positive cash flow? Seems like a good move since, from that point forward, I don’t have to pay into the property anymore. It will be entirely self funded as long as there is a tenant. Any thoughts or concerns from the audience?",finance
personalfinance,Should I plow through my student loans ASAP or go Public Service Loan Forgiveness?,"Hi all, and thank you to anyone willing to share their advice and suggestions!

I am in my last year of med school and want to pull myself together financially. I have $200k in student debt (all federal, subsidized and subsidized) and I am thinking of what is the best way for me to approach my personal finance plan.

I believe my options are: 1) Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and 2) Just pay off my loans ASAP

Key info: I've been working within the VA hospital system for a few years now. Over the next two years I will be working full-time as a resident (\~50K salary, pre-tax) and am very confident I plan to stay within the VA system for the rest of my career (i.e., at least 10 years, thus meeting the PSLF requirements). Following those 2 years of residency, I am pretty confident I will be in a position making \~100k. 

Here is where I need help understanding/some advice on each option:

1) Should I just begin applying every year for the PSLF program and putting down the minimum payment towards my loans? That way in 10 years the balance will be wiped clean. My thoughts on this is that I can just start dumping as much money as I can towards retirement/investing/savings so that compound interest could work its magic faster and harder so that I can enjoy an early retirement. All the while just doing minimums on my student loans so that the rest is forgiven in 10 years.

2) Should I just try to pay off the loans as soon as possible to get a clean slate ASAP? Essentially my thoughts are just to live on a budget and within my means so that I can pay off my debt ASAP (goal is &lt;5 years). In 2 years when my pay would \~double post-residency, I don't plan on ""giving myself"" a pay raise. The extra income would be used just to pay off that debt ASAP so that I can start pouring more money into 401(k)/TSP, HSA, and the like for a few years before I start giving myself pay raises.",finance
personalfinance,Does Velocity Banking Work?,"I am about to buy a 500k condo and I currently have a car loan with $21k balance on it and a student loan with $8k left.  I also have a house with $170k mortgage left on it.  Starting May or June of this year (after I close on the condo), I'm going to be applying for a checking or personal line of credit to start the velocity banking strategy.

My plan is to payoff my student loans (which will be reduced to about $4k by then), then my car loan, then the first house ($170k) and then the $500k condo.  I'm basically paying off my debt from the smallest to the highest balance, regardless of the interest rate, but using the velocity banking strategy.


Is that a dumb idea?  Should I just forgo using the velocity banking strategy and apply extra payments on my debt.  I'm eager to pay off my debt as fast as possible, but I don't want to get myself into more trouble.


I do have positive cash flow every month and I do consider myself disciplined.  I also have a 800+ credits score on Credit Karma.  Although I think the velocity banking strategy works, I'm slightly concerned that I might be missing something.

personalfinance,Tax Question re: Cash Distribution from deceased father’s 401K as death benefit,"So, my dad died and there is roughly 60K in his 401K, to which my sister and I are the beneficiaries of. 

We are choosing to get a lump sum payout of 30K each vs rolling into another IRA, getting yearly payouts, etc. 

The fine print on this is that they will withhold “20% of the taxable portion of the distribution will be withheld as a pre-payment toward your federal income taxes.” 

So my question is - what is the taxable portion? The whole thing? A certain percentage (if so, what percentage)? Or does that only apply if the owner of the account liquidates the account, and does not apply in the in the event of a distribution to beneficiaries as a death benefit? 

A trusted, smart person told me it was the latter. That 0% will be withheld because I’m a beneficiary of  a death payout. 

Additionally, will this be counted as income next year when I file taxes? The Life Insurance payout will not be, from what I understand. I don’t know about the 401K.

Bitcoin,Senator Eric Brakey (Republican - Maine) position statement on cryptocurrency freedom (Bitcoin &amp; Monero mentioned),"I recently spoke with [Eric Brakey (R-Maine)](https://ericbrakey.com/) and he has provided me with a position statement on the topic of cryptocurrency freedom (specifically mentioning Bitcoin &amp; Monero) which I am including further below.  Brakey plans ""to support legislation to eliminate all taxes on 'like-kind exchange,' stopping the federal government from taxing conversion between cryptocurrencies.""

I encourage everyone who values their cryptocurrency freedom to strongly consider donating to Eric Brakey and supporting him.  I am confident that if he wins, he will be our champion for cryptocurrency freedom (and many other freedoms) in the United States House of Representatives.

During Eric's Maine State Senate campaign in January 2014, he visited the [Bitcoin Center NYC](https://bitcoincenternyc.com/) (founded by Nick Spanos) to raise money and became the [first candidate in his state to accept campaign donations in bitcoins](https://www.ibtimes.com/new-yorks-bitcoin-center-where-cryptocurrency-elite-newbies-gather-1547823).

I've written a short bio of him below, and further below, I've included his official statement on cryptocurrency.

\---

Eric Brakey (R-Maine) is a libertarian from Maine who is taking Dr. Ron Paul's message of liberty, peace, and prosperity to the next level, and his work is making a real difference.  Eric was the Maine State Director for the 2012 Ron Paul presidential campaign.  He led Ron Paul supporters to win a majority of Maine delegate seats to the 2012 Republican National Convention and won key seats on the Maine Republican State Committee and National Committee.

After working for Ron Paul's 2012 presidential campaign, Brakey led Defense of Liberty PAC, a libertarian political action committee in Maine.  He also ran and won a seat in the Maine State Senate, serving from 2014-2018.

At the 2016 Republican National Convention, he sponsored amendments to the platform including supporting legislation for ""Right To Try"" medicines not approved by the FDA for terminally ill patients, auditing the Pentagon, and abolishing the IRS.

During his time in the Maine State Senate, Eric Brakey helped pass a constitutional carry bill which removed Maine's requirement for law abiding citizens to obtain a permit to carry a concealed firearm.  He also helped pass welfare reform legislation to prevent the misuse of welfare funds.  He helped pass Right To Try legislation, was the only ""no"" vote against the crony capitalist Maine Capital Investment Fund, opposed credits and exemptions (corporate welfare), and supported the elimination of Maine's business income tax.

Brakey has also sponsored legislation to repeal restrictions on medical marijuana, and supported the Maine Marijuana Legalization ballot question which ultimately legalized the adult usage, cultivation, and sale of marijuana in Maine.  He opposes civil asset forfeiture, and introduced legislation that would require a property owner to be convicted of a crime before the government could forfeit that property.  He has also proposed criminal justice reforms including the expungement of certain non-violent criminal records 5 years after completion of the sentence.

&amp;#x200B;

Eric Brakey is currently running as a Republican candidate in the U.S. House of Representatives 2020 election for Maine's second district against incumbent Jared Golden (Democrat).

ERIC BRAKEY POSITION STATEMENT ON CRYPTOCURRENCY FREEDOM

\----------

I believe in cryptocurrency freedom.

&amp;#x200B;

When I ran for State Senate in 2014, I was the first candidate in state history to accept cryptocurrency donations. During my time in the legislature, I sponsored the first ever bill in the nation to study the use of blockchain technology to make elections more secure and transparent.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I am running for Congress and I am committed to cryptocurrency freedom. Whether your coin of choice is Bitcoin, Monero or any other, your freedom to buy and sell in cryptocurrency should be as unrestricted as your ability to buy and sell in federal reserve notes. That's why I intend to support legislation to eliminate all taxes on ""like-kind exchange,"" stopping the federal government from taxing conversion between cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

If you would like to have a champion for cryptocurrency freedom fighting for you in Congress, then please invest in our campaign. We accept donations in cryptocurrency and federal reserve notes.

Bitcoin,[Call to Action] Make your political contributions in Bitcoin (HowTo),"As the political season heats up I've patiently waited for politicians to install BTCPay servers to allow bitcoin contributions.  I'm now realizing that the wait will likely take forever.  Then I realized I didn't need to wait.  I can send anyone bitcoin anytime I want using an expiring paperwallet.  It's all totally legit.  Works like this:

1. Any ""gift"" to a campaign is an ""in-kind"" contribution.
2. Disclosure of personal information is only required for contributions above $200.
3. Paper wallets can easily be mailed to the campaign headquarters just like checks.
4. You should keep the private keys and revoke the funds after 90 days (or whatever).
5. The more paper wallets they receive, the more likely they are to favor bitcoin.

Be aware, your contribution will likely just get stolen by a volunteer, so don't go overboard.

If everyone on this subreddit who plans (or can) vote in the upcoming elections were to give 11,000 SAT to the candidate of their choice, eventually they would have enough to warrant getting an exchange account KYC'ing and going through all the same pains we go through to comply with US AML/KYC law.  Possibly provide them a way to walk a mile in our shoes.  It will also show these candidates that bitcoin can be used ""for good"" and isn't just for drug runners.

Although you don't need to fill out a disclosure for small ( &lt; $200 ) contributions, it is still probably a good idea to do so.  What you should disclose is Name, Address, Employer, and Occupation.  You will also need to sign a statement attesting that you are not contributing on behalf of a labor union, federal contractor, or foreign national (unless a lawful US resident).

As warned above, care should be taken in how much you put on the wallet.  It's just like cash, so any volunteer opening mail could swipe it.  You also need to be careful to only use a trusted wallet.  The `bitaddress.org` is broadly trusted and a good default choice.  I ported it to python in the `pypaperwallet` module, but  most people will likely stick with `bitaddress.org` as it has had years to build trust and reputation.  Obviously you should download the zip and run it locally so as not to trust a web server with private keys.

## Basic `bitaddress.org` HowTo:

1. Download zip from https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org/tree/v3.3.0
2. Download PGP key from https://www.bitaddress.org/ninja_bitaddress.org.txt
3. Import Ninja's expired key that you downloaded in [2] into GPG.
4. Verify Ninja's key fingerprint matches the fingerprint in his [BitcoinTalk post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=43496.0)
5. Unzip the zip downloaded in [1] and enter that directory
6. Verify the file `bitaddress.org.html.sig` using Ninja's expired key
7. Open the `bitaddress.org.html` file in Chrome
8. Print the paper wallet and fund it with a few dollars worth of BTC
9. Include a letter attesting that you aren't a foreign influencer, with a union, or contractor
10. Include your Name, Address, Employer and Occupation in the letter and sign it
11. Make a copy of the wallets private key to void the wallet after 90 days
12. Mail the wallet and signed letter to the campaign of your choosing
13. If the funds haven't moved after 90 days, sweep them back to yourself

I've [produced the form letters](https://github.com/brianddk/pypaperwallet/blob/master/disclosure.pdf) in `pypaperwallet`, but as I said, it's a new repo from some random redditor.  In any case, here's the howto for my module:

## Basic `pypaperwallet` HowTo:

1. Find latest release at https://github.com/brianddk/pypaperwallet/releases
2. Expand ""Assets"" and download the ""Source code (tar.gz)"" as `pypaperwallet.tar.gz`.
3. Download the `*.tar.gz.sig` file naming it `pypaperwallet.tar.gz.sig`
1. Download my key from https://brianddk.github.io/darkweb/brianddk/pub.asc
2. Import my key using `gpg --import pub.asc` or whatever you named it.
4. Verify download with `gpg --verify pypaperwallet.tar.gz.sig`
5. Extract the contents of the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file to any directory
6. From Python 3.7 run `pip install pypaperwallet.tar.gz` to install dependencies
7. Review the `README.md` on how to install the GTK `cairo` dependency
8. Modify `test.py` to your liking and run from python 3.7 to produce the PDFs.
9. To change wording, modify the contents of `template.py`

personalfinance,Pay Off Mortgage or Invest?,"Hey everyone - I (32M) am seeking advice on paying off my mortgage or not. Here's some back story. 

My wife and I have two full time jobs with a combined income of about 120K and no kids. We also have a successful side hustle that brought in just over 94K last year. We only use the side hustle money to pay for vacations, but we had to buy two new cars last year, as well as pay for a graduate degree. All of those expenses were paid in cash, so our only debt is our mortgage. 

Our mortgage currently has $183,899 left on it. For the past two months, I have been paying an additional $1,000 a week to it from our side hustle. At this rate, I calculated we would pay off our mortgage by February 2023. While it has been great seeing our principal amount fall, our interest rate is only 3.75%. I am wondering if it would make more sense to stick the $1,000 a week payment into a low cost ETF that tracks the S&amp;P or another safe investment. When the time comes that our investments washout the mortgage, I think I could sell them to pay off remainder of the mortgage. I am wondering which one would be faster or the wiser move. 

Any feedback you have is greatly appreciated.",finance

datascience,Did I make the right decision turning down a Data Analyst position at an Agency I want to work at for a Data Scientist position somewhere else?,"Hi All,

I've been struggling with a decision I recently made, in terms having some regret that has been bothering me.

**Background:** Last summer I was supposed to be at a fairly famous three letter agency for an internship. Unfortunately for this internship I needed a very intensive security clearance and it did not finish in time for the internship. I was given the option to continue the clearance for a internship during the year, which I accepted.

After not hearing literally anything, despite my attempts to contact someone, I decided to start my job search again as I graduate this year. I was able to get a spring internship at another federal agency (no security clearance required) and a job offer (I accepted) for a data science fellowship (3 year term) after I graduate with a very nice compensation package that works in the defense sector.

**What happened:** The day my new internship started I get a call from the previous agency that my clearance had gone through and asked when I could start. I explained that I was at another federal agency at the time and they said they would contact me about other options. I then get an email that I'm on their for-hire-list and I start getting job offers from this agency that for the past year and a half I've been thinking about.

Unfortunately, none of the positions were for a data scientist and the compensation was over 25k less than my fellowship so I turned it down.

**Conflicted:** I would love to work at the agency, but I just don't think the entry level position they would give me would help me grow in my career. I have student loans and the higher salary is also super compelling to me. I just keep regretting turning down an opportunity that for so long I wanted/still want?

Did I make the right decision, or did I throw away something I should of taken?",technology

My husband is a federal employee and a starting salary of a little less than $38k. We’re expecting our second child(becoming a family of 4) in a month.

and $30 copays for insurance now and that’s with a federal employee “discount” 

We’re under the impression that federal employees are not eligible for Medicaid? Is this true? We live in Michigan if that changes anything. 

At this point we’ve gotten rid of a lot of things to stay afloat like going from 2 cars to 1, no cable for now, contract expired and haven’t renewed it yet, potty trained our son as early as possible to save on diapers. 
We’re still about -200 a month after bills, mortgage, food, insurance and car payment.

investing,"What role, if any, should junk bonds play in a portfolio?","In a bull market, junk bonds do reasonably well due to low credit risk, but this is tempered by inflation risk and possible interest rate hikes. In general, during good times, junk bonds would be expected to under-perform the stock market. During bad times, credit risk becomes problematic, so junk bonds will underperform investment-grade bonds. So while junk bonds are not the ideal asset to hold during a bear market or a bull market, they'll have better returns than investment-grade bonds during a bull market, and they won't incur as much loss as stocks during a bear market (unless, of course, a very bad downturn leads to a wave of defaults). Thus, they seem like a good ""stabilizer"" for any scenario except a very bad credit crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems to me, that there are a couple scenarios where junk bonds would be a particularly good asset to hold. I'd expect them to do well (relative to stocks and investment-grade bonds) during a stagnant period, or during a stock market correction amidst a reasonably healthy economy. Am I correct in my view that a 10%-ish allocation to junk bonds is appropriate for a young investor with a long time horizon? The risk/reward characteristics of junk bonds seem pretty similar to REITs, so I'm wondering whether it would make sense to think of junk bonds and REITs as jointly constituting a ""stabilizer"" portion of a portfolio, in addition to the investment-grade bond and equity portions.",finance

personalfinance,Raising credit score after parental identity theft?,"My mom has always been terrible with finances, and it has consistently affected myself and my younger sister for many years. She talked me into financing my first car in my name at the age of 17 with the promise that she would make payments. The car was gone one day when I came home from  a friends house and she fed me this story about how it must have been stolen and that she filed a police report, but I didn’t find out until later that she was just not making payments. She has gone to jail many times for writing hot checks and petty theft. 
Around the age of 18 I made a Creditkarma account for the first time and discovered that I owed $3500 to debt collectors for the “stolen” car and also large amounts on two separate unpaid credit cards even though I have never had a credit card in my life. I’ve confronted her about all of this many many times and she denies and deflects every time. It’s almost like she believes it all herself. I’m weary and drained because of all of this I’ve had to deal with for years now.

Here is a summary of what I found:

1.  Stock Market Performance DOW Jones 1918 +10%, 1919 +30%, 1920 (-33%)  https://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart

2.  1918-19 saw annual 15-20% inflation, followed by a short period of 10% deflation.  https://inflationdata.com/articles/inflation-consumer-price-index-decade-commentary/inflation-cpi-consumer-price-index-1913-1919/

3.  Little impact on unemployment, however employee absence was often 30-40% impacting manufacturing.

4.  Many retail sales fell by more than 50%.

5.  Healthcare Equipment Sales did well during this period.

Notes:  For 3-5, I used information from a Stlouisfed.org .pdf titled ""Economic Effects of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic"".  Also, it is difficult to tell how much of the stock performance and inflation was due to the ending of WWI.

Bitcoin,Will the Halving Create a Drop in Network Hash Rate and Security?,"Currently, miners receive 12.5 btc plus transaction fees, to be reduced to 6.25 btc plus transaction fees this year. This would naturally mean miners will lose profitability and many may leave the network I would assume, *unless* the drop in 6.25 BTC is dwarfed by what miners make in transaction fees each block.

To calculate this, if I assume an average of $0.65 fees per transaction (source:  [https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#1y](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#1y) ), and the current average transactions per block of 2,300 (source:  [https://blockgeeks.com/guides/bitcoin-halving/](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/bitcoin-halving/) ), then that results in $1,495 per block from fees, or \~0.15 btc right now. Compared to 6.25 btc, 0.15 btc is nothing. If correct, this would imply that the *vast* majority of miner income is from block rewards. With profitability effectively cut in half, the hash rate should fall by half, or at least until enough miners leave that it becomes profitable again (I assume half, but I don't know). Transaction fees would need to be on the order of 42x what they are now to have the same block rewards for miners, which would not happen. Am I missing something, or is this a huge potential issue? Especially long term, fees will need to be *very* high to provide incentive to enough miners to keep the network safe, which could only happen with smaller blocks or much larger transaction volume.",cryptocurrency

coal,Coal Use Dropping Dramatically in both the EU and US,"Coal use is dropping like a rock in Europe and the United States but roaring in Asia.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-17/coal-endures-as-world-s-favorite-fuel-for-electricity-generation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-17/coal-endures-as-world-s-favorite-fuel-for-electricity-generation)

Here's how bad things are getting for coal in Europe.

""The EU member states that added the most new solar and wind generation capacity also recorded the biggest declines in coal use. Solar arrays and wind farms accounted for 18% of electricity generation across the European Union in 2019, at 569 TWh, while coal-fired capacity fell to just 15%, for 469 TWh, the thinktanks said, noting coal generated twice as much electricity as solar and wind on the continent as recently as five years ago.""

[https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/02/07/solar-and-wind-generation-outpaced-coal-in-europe-last-year/](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/02/07/solar-and-wind-generation-outpaced-coal-in-europe-last-year/)

The drop in coal use is widely attributed to the a combination of the Emission Trading Scheme which priced CO2 at 25 to 30 Euro/MT for most of last year and into 2020, mild weather, cheap gas and strong winds. An additional factor that makes the drop in coal all the more impressive was the significant drops in hydro (down 49 TWh) and nuclear (down 27 TWh) seen by Europe last year.

[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/011520-gas-displaced-coal-in-europes-shrinking-thermal-gap-2019-enappsys](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/011520-gas-displaced-coal-in-europes-shrinking-thermal-gap-2019-enappsys)

Here are some projections for wind and solar growth in the EU over the next few years. Wind is expected to add 12.2 GW in 2020 through 2023. Solar is expected to add 21 GW in 2020 and ramp up to an installation rate of 27 GW in 2023. These additions of RE from 2020 to 2023 will add roughly 300 TWh of annual generation. If you plug in similar installation rates out to 2030 you'd get up to around 900 TWh of new generation so you'd have to think most of the coal and gas could get pushed off the system. This is remarkable.

&amp;#x200B;

**The US Isn't Far Behind**

On an absolute basis the drop in coal use in the US (173 TWh) narrowly beat out the drop in the EU (159 TWh) last year. The monthly projection statistics reporting by the EIA indicate that coal is going to have an extremely bad year in 2020. We're only 40 days into 2020 but coal is down roughly 30% year to date compared to last year. There are several factors causing this.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Gas was running at $1.862/MMBtu on February 6th. (This is 80 cents lower than last year)
2. We're having a mild winter and a mild summer is expected.
3. The US is expected to add 50 to 75 TWh of new wind and solar generation in 2020.
4. North America had the wettest January in the Columbia River Basin since the 1990s.

&amp;#x200B;

It's far too early to offer a reliable guess for where coal will end up. A simple extrapolation of the year to date data would indicate a drop of 300 TWh. This seems far too drastic but I wouldn't be surprised by a drop of 200 TWh.  Gas generation is already up by \~25 TWh in January 2020 compared to January 2019. I can't imagine gas maintaining this market share gain for the entire year but given the strong start to the year and the low gas prices I could definitely see 150 to 200 TWh of new gas in 2020. Add in 50 TWh of new RE and sprinkle on some extra hydro and you come up with around 200 to 250 TWh that mostly has to come out of coal's market share.

Can you imagine what a 21 to 26% drop in electricity from coal will do to the coal mining regions in the US? Here's the EIA data for leading coal production (million short tons) by state in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

* Wyoming—304.2—40.2%
* West Virginia—95.4—12.6%
* Pennsylvania—49.9—6.6%
* Illinois—49.6—6.6%
* Kentucky—39.6—5.2%

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia recently released a report identifying 9 states at risk of recession in 2020 -  West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Montana, Oklahoma, Vermont, New Jersey, Kentucky and Connecticut. I'm not surprise 3 of these states are big on coal. I'm very surprise Wyoming isn't on the list.",energy
personalfinance,Sale of investment properly capital gains tax,"Hello,

In August of 2019 I sold my condominium that I was using as a rental property. I've looked into the rules regarding being exempt from capital gains tax and unfortunately (for me) I don't think I qualify for any of them (no life event made me sell it, I did not live in it for 2 out of the past 5 years).

The property was purchased for 164,000 and was sold for 284,000. That nets me 120,000 dollars. But, I've read in multiple places that you then first away fees associated with selling it. Title fees, realtors fees, etc. I calculated that to be around 19k after looking at my seller's statement. That would leave me at 100k of taxable income. I live in the state of Oregon, which taxes capital gains at 9.9% I think and our normal income puts our federal liability into the 15% bracket. Entering this into credit karma yields what I believe to be close to the right number, 23,000k owed (14k to federal and 9k for state). I got that number as we did owe 3500 before I added this (taxes on rental income, 1099-int forms), but I took that out.

We have gotten an estimate for having a CPA do our taxes, around 700-800 dollars, as we also purchased an electric vehicle and have 4 1099-int forms.

Does this seem right? Should we get a CPA involved when dealing with this much money?

All other areas of our taxes I am confident in, this one I just keep going back to as it's the most money and I have never sold a house before.

Thanks!

personalfinance,"HSA over contribution with a bunch of funk, help needed","First, let me be clear that I screwed up and this is my fault. I’m going to be throwing a lot of shade at my old HSA company, but I know it really boils down to me. Anyways, the issue:

I had an old employer at the start of 2019 that I left in February 2019. They contributed $1800 to my employer-sponsored HSA (through a company called TASC) plus I had 3 paychecks with a $200 pretax contribution on my part, for $2400 total. 

When I left that employer, TASC changed my HSA from an employer sponsored plan to a “universal benefit account” (aka a personal account not connected to an employer). Even though my log in was the same, I no longer had access to my old records - the account simply showed it was “funded” with my entire balance in February. That was the only entry. 

(As an aside, the universal benefit account is so fucked up - I didn’t realize that TASC had also pulled all my investments out and put them in a cash holding account for 7 months so they weren’t earning anything. Then when I got so fed up and started the process of transferring the account to Fidelity, I realized there is no place online for me to obtain a statement - all I could get were screenshots to share with Fidelity for the rollover.  When I called customer support to be like “where can I get a statement,” they told me to HIGHLIGHT THE SCREEN, COPY THE TEXT AND PASTE IT INTO EXCEL. This is not hyperbole - I have an email from them with these exact instructions)

Anyways, in December 2019 I contributed $3500 to this HSA with after tax money, because my new employer doesn’t have an HSA option (but I do have an HDHP and I do qualify to contribute to an HSA). I totally forgot that my old employer had put in $2400 in January because my online records didn’t reflect any contributions - they only have one entry, and that’s for February when the HSA was “funded”.

When I made this contribution is when I realized TASC has no statements, I got skeeved out and super irritated so I decided to move my HSA to fidelity. I’m doing my taxes this weekend and realize on my old W2 that I have now over contributed. 

Here’s my questions: I basically had 3 different HSAs in the last 12 months - TASC employer plan in Jan 2019, TASC universal in Feb 2019 and Fidelity in Jan 2020. As far as I can tell, transaction records aren’t shared between the various plans. With that being the case, it seems “easier” to leave the excess $2400 in Fidelity, allot it to my 2020 contributions (essentially roll it forward into a later year) and just pay the 6% penalty on it. So in 2020, I’ll only contribute $1150 to Fidelity.  The instructions for IRS form 8889 seems to imply I can do this. I just ... don’t understand HOW. When do I pay the 6% - now, or when I file my 2020 taxes? Where on the form do I indicate this $2400 is from a fuck up from a previous year?",finance

personalfinance,Problem Refinancing Home,"I bought my current residence in 2015 as a property because the house was in a state of disrepair that no bank would mortage. I was told by the loan officer that I would be allowed to refinance once repairs were made so a 5/1 arm loan would be fine.

After making some repairs to refinance a flood hit my area. It was called a 1000 year flood and even though I am well outside of any flood zone my house was flooded and had to be gutted and redone out of pocket since I didnt carry flood insurance at the time.

Fema offered some help but no where near enough to make my home livable. The Small Business Administration stepped in and offered a low interest rate loan (1.8%) to fix my home. I took the loan and they placed a lien against the property.

Fast forward to today. My wife finally graduated nursing school and is working full time at a hospital so our debt to income ratio looks much better now. It is also getting down to the wire to refinance the original ARM loan.

Am I correct in thinking that as long as the appraised value of the home and property is more than the two loans combined that I am in good shape? I have another property I own outright that I was told could be used as collateral but I'm not sure how that works.

personalfinance,How to best utilize additional money?,"So I’m trying to figure out what to do with some additional money I have in my checking account.

-	I have about $7,000 left of student loan at interest rate around 3.4%. I could pay it off, but I’m debating since interest rate is low and I would take a hit in my credit score.

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Questions,"My wife and I purchased our home in 2018 during the spike in interest rates. We got a 4.25% interest rate. About a year later, we refinanced and got a 3.75% interest rate. We refinanced through better.com and it cost us about $1,200 to refinance. As we saved about $250 a month, we have already broken even on the refinance. 


Because interest rates have continued to drop,  were considering refinancing again. It would cost about $1,800 for us to drop our monthly payment by around $100 a month (3.5% rate). Are we crazy to consider doing this? I know this would extend the length of our mortgage by about a year as we would replace our current mortgage with another 15 year mortgage. Here are some relevant facts:


We currently have no other outstanding debts outside of our mortgage and don't see ourselves going into debt anytime soon (we've both finished school, have an emergency fund, have savings to purchase a modest car in cash when our car dies etc.). 


This is not our forever home. It's likely we will be here for the next few years until the market drops and we can buy in a more desirable area. Depending on where our finances are at that point, we may rent our current home out or sell it.",finance
personalfinance,Pay off or pay down,"I know these get asked a lot. I also know the answer to the question is usually ""pay off the highest interest rate card first.""

 Right, got it..but... 

Here's where I am at currently.  I can pay off my highest interest rate card  right now. I just paid off my second highest rate card last week. My third highest rate card has a bit too much to bite off at at once right now  but this card is a traditional VISA card. That is whats causing my hesitation. 

The money in which I have to pay off one or pay down the other is essentially all I have set aside right now.  If I pay off the highest rate card I will, for the foreseeable future, have no emergency fund. If I pay down 2/3rds of the second highest rate card it will significantly lower my monthly payment and balance but also could be used in the case of an emergency. I won't be able to do that with the first card since it's just a store credit account. 

I have a house and a truck that I need to maintain. If something goes wrong, knock on wood, I won't have anything to bail me out on short notice. Obviously going further into debt defeats the purpose of getting out of debt but going into further debt due to late or missed payments because I have to fix my furnace or water line or axle or transmission puts me in a worse situation than just charging the emergency on the Visa, no? 

I want to fix my situation without making a horrible choice in the process.

personalfinance,Accuracy of federal taxes withheld?,"How accurate does an employer have to be on federal taxes? Recently I started to learn how to program. For one of my first computer programs, I built a calculator to figure out how much my net pay should be based on gross wages. Everything that my employer is taking out of my paycheck is accurate, except for federal taxes(FICA and Medicare taxes are correct). My employer is taking out about $5 more than what I calculated. 

I know it's not a big difference, and at the end of the year when I file taxes it will even out. I used the formula directly from IRS pub 15-T and also checked my work against paycheckcity.com and my program matches to the penny against what paycheckcity says federal withholding is supposed to be.

Like I said, I know it should balance out when I file taxes, but its more a curiosity and an annoyance that a computer program that I built doesn't match.

dogecoin,Mastodon giveaway,"One of the reasons why I chose Dogecoin is because it’s decentralized. It does not depend on any single individual, corporation or government. No one gets to tell me how I can and cannot use Dogecoin. Another reason is that I enjoy Dogecoin community, for which the biggest hub is probably reddit. There is also presence on Discord, Twitter, Steam, freenode. Each of these platforms is controlled by a corporation, though so far this seems to work okay for Dogecoin. But I think we should expand to more platforms, and preferably less centralized ones. Today I want to promote Mastodon and Fediverse.

[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) is a microblogging social network, similar to Twitter. It is more centralized than Dogecoin, but it is not controlled by a single organization. Mastodon creates a network of websites (instances), and each instance is operated independently. Users of different instances can interact freely. You can create your own instance and connect it to the network. Mastodon seems to be somewhat popular already, so I think it’s a worthy target for Dogecoin expansion.

[Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) is a collection of social networks like Mastodon that use compatible protocols, such that users of one network can interact with users of another. So you may be able to participate in this giveaway using an account in another Fediverse network. Android app [Fedilab](https://fedilab.app) supports accounts from multiple networks.

I'm turning 40 in May and feeling late to the party. I only began to learn about personal finance during the last 12 months of my life and am looking for some insight regarding how to move forward with an unexpected influx of money.

To set the stage:

* My wife and I have a combined household income of around $100,000
   * Wife is an clergy member and receives part of her salary as a housing allowance, meaning about 50% of her income is tax deductible. This means she operates as an independent contractor, so no taxes are withheld from her paychecks. We (over)paid estimated quarterly taxes throughout 2019
* We have about $40,000 in student loan debt: we pay $750/month + we've been paying an additional $250/month, doing debt snowball (average interest rate: 6.3%)
* We are 4 years into a 30-year mortgage and owe about $120,000
* We have a $10,000 emergency fund 
* My wife has about $25,000 in a 401(k)
* I have about $30,000 in a state pension fund from a job I left in 2019
* We want to purchase another home within the next 1-2 years and turn our current home into a rental - and to add more rentals in the coming years

I got my taxes done the other day and found that, between our federal refund and the surplus of money we'd set aside from each of my wife's paychecks to pay her taxes, we have about $10,000 in-hand that we were not expecting. How did this happen? I'm not entirely sure. We'd never done the clergy housing allowance prior to 2019 and we're learning as we go.

My questions:

* How would you suggest we apply this $10,000?
   * Put it towards the student loan debt? If we did this, we'd pay them off a year earlier than current pace (3 years instead of 4).
   * Invest?
      * If so, fund a ROTH? Dump it in 401(k)? Something different?
   * Use it as seed money for next home purchase?
* Suggestions on what to do with the $30K in my state pension fund?
   * Invest this in coordination with the aforementioned $10K?
   * Is there a good way to direct this toward our future real estate interests?

I am not in a good living situation or a good work situation and am getting increasingly stressed due to both to my own detriment; I feel pretty trapped about where I am in life right now but don't see a way out.

Should I unenroll from my job's ~~401k~~ 403b until I'm old enough to be matched (provided I'm still working there)? Should I open a Roth IRA, and if so, what's a reasonable monthly amount to contribute to it? Should I forget about retirement altogether and just continue slowly paying off my debt?

CryptoCurrency,[Call to Action] Make your political contributions in Bitcoin (HowTo),"As the political season heats up I've patiently waited for politicians to install BTCPay servers to allow bitcoin contributions.  I'm now realizing that the wait will likely take forever.  Then I realized I didn't need to wait.  I can send anyone bitcoin anytime I want using an expiring paperwallet.  It's all totally legit.  Works like this:

1. Any ""gift"" to a campaign is an ""in-kind"" contribution.
2. Disclosure of personal information is only required for contributions above $200.
3. Paper wallets can easily be mailed to the campaign headquarters just like checks.
4. You should keep the private keys and revoke the funds after 90 days (or whatever).
5. The more paper wallets they receive, the more likely they are to favor bitcoin.

Be aware, your contribution will likely just get stolen by a volunteer, so don't go overboard.

If everyone on this subreddit who plans (or can) vote in the upcoming elections were to give 11,000 SAT to the candidate of their choice, eventually they would have enough to warrant getting an exchange account KYC'ing and going through all the same pains we go through to comply with US AML/KYC law.  Possibly provide them a way to walk a mile in our shoes.  It will also show these candidates that bitcoin can be used ""for good"" and isn't just for drug runners.

Although you don't need to fill out a disclosure for small ( &lt; $200 ) contributions, it is still probably a good idea to do so.  What you should disclose is Name, Address, Employer, and Occupation.  You will also need to sign a statement attesting that you are not contributing on behalf of a labor union, federal contractor, or foreign national (unless a lawful US resident).

As warned above, care should be taken in how much you put on the wallet.  It's just like cash, so any volunteer opening mail could swipe it.  You also need to be careful to only use a trusted wallet.  The `bitaddress.org` is broadly trusted and a good default choice.  I ported it to python in the `pypaperwallet` module, but  most people will likely stick with `bitaddress.org` as it has had years to build trust and reputation.  Obviously you should download the zip and run it locally so as not to trust a web server with private keys.

## Basic `bitaddress.org` HowTo:

1. Download zip from https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org/tree/v3.3.0
2. Download PGP key from https://www.bitaddress.org/ninja_bitaddress.org.txt
3. Import Ninja's expired key that you downloaded in [2] into GPG.
4. Verify Ninja's key fingerprint matches the fingerprint in his [BitcoinTalk post](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=43496.0)
5. Unzip the zip downloaded in [1] and enter that directory
6. Verify the file `bitaddress.org.html.sig` using Ninja's expired key
7. Open the `bitaddress.org.html` file in Chrome
8. Print the paper wallet and fund it with a few dollars worth of BTC
9. Include a letter attesting that you aren't a foreign influencer, with a union, or contractor
10. Include your Name, Address, Employer and Occupation in the letter and sign it
11. Make a copy of the wallets private key to void the wallet after 90 days
12. Mail the wallet and signed letter to the campaign of your choosing
13. If the funds haven't moved after 90 days, sweep them back to yourself

I've [produced the form letters](https://github.com/brianddk/pypaperwallet/blob/master/disclosure.pdf) in `pypaperwallet`, but as I said, it's a new repo from some random redditor.  In any case, here's the howto for my module:

## Basic `pypaperwallet` HowTo:

1. Find latest release at https://github.com/brianddk/pypaperwallet/releases
2. Expand ""Assets"" and download the ""Source code (tar.gz)"" as `pypaperwallet.tar.gz`.
3. Download the `*.tar.gz.sig` file naming it `pypaperwallet.tar.gz.sig`
1. Download my key from https://brianddk.github.io/darkweb/brianddk/pub.asc
2. Import my key using `gpg --import pub.asc` or whatever you named it.

personalfinance,Personal Injury Settlement Money Utilization - Student Loans/Investment?,"I was in an accident and after a long period of time I received a  personal injury settlement of close to $50,000. I had approximately  $10,000 in credit card debt and $48,000 in student load debt (yuck!). I  paid off all of my credit card debts as I couldn't take having those  over my head anymore. I now have about $40,000 left and don't know if I should put all of that towards my student loans (various interest rates between 3.4-6.2%) or put the money  into an investment account. I am fortunate that I don't expect any  additional medical bills to roll in and am not anticipating any high cost medical bills in the future based on the time period that I have  waited. I do have a mortgage on my house  which I plan to continue to pay monthly comfortably with my existing  wages.  My vehicle is paid off so the only debt I have is my mortgage and my student loans. I would greatly appreciate any advice!!",finance
personalfinance,"Internship overpaid me, asking for a refund, what are the tax implications?","My Internship in 2019 overpaid me a 3 weeks of wages totaling $3393.19 pre-tax. Of course, federal, state, and local taxes were taken out. My net pay after taxes was $2547.45

I knew the money wasn't mine so I kept it untouched in a savings account and waited until they asked for it back or automatically withdrew it from my account.

It's now February 2020. They're now asking for me to repay it. I don't have a problem repaying it but they're asking me to cut a check for $3133.61 pretax (I believe they were able to recover FICA taxes which is why it's less than the pretax amount above).

The paper I got in the mail says:

&gt;**NOTE:** Per the IRS, repayments made after the year of overpayment do not adjust income taxable wages and we may only adjust FICA taxable wages for the year of overpayment. Therefore, the amount you would repay would be higher since we would not be able to account for Federal and State Taxes. 

My main question is, how do I recover the taxes that I've overpaid on this amount? I tried putting the repaid amount into TurboTax but TurboTax tells me to stick with Standard Deduction. I'm not exactly sure what to do. 

Another note... My employer's payroll company (ADP) has already sent me a W2. The W2 form includes the overpaid wages and taxes withheld. Will they send me an updated W2 once I pay back the wages adjusting that I was paid less and I should get a refund for the federal taxes withheld?",finance

personalfinance,feeling a lot of anxiety about money,"Hello everyone,

forgive my formatting, on mobile

Recently, Ive been feeling anxious about how I handle my money, was wondering if theres anything grossly wrong that i might be doing.

I graduated around 3 years ago, found a job after a couple months right before my deferment ended.  been at the same job since then.  Going from this, I mismanaged a lot of my money, eating out a lot, going out on weekends, etc.  I started seeing someone and then that added on but I looked at my spending habits a bit ago, and it really appalled me.

Background: 24, FT job, 47k/yr 50w/ OT.  Live with parents (no rent, car insurance, phone bill) $2800/mo take home.

main concerns: student loans/car payments(lease)saving

this is what i’m currently paying per month as of late last year (nov or so)

Payments:
Parent Plus (Dads name but i’m paying it): $500

personal student loans (all federal): $564 ($282 minimum)

car lease: $350

parents - $100/mo

Savings

vacation savings (nov 2020 plan): $150

car savings: $300 (will have to buy car out most likely, currently a lease, on track to be over miles, being on here made me aware of this horrible move)

general savings/emergency: $250

401k: 8% w/matching (unsure of actual percentages)

Other:

Food: trying to limit myself to $150/mo

Dates/partner: usually under $100/mo

Gas: $100-120/mo

subscriptions: $31/mo

which leaves me with about $185 for random expenses that might come up in the month.

I’m not sure if this is bad, something in me thinks i can do better but i also feel like I’m not necessarily drowning, its really helpful that I don’t pay rent right now and my parents still help out with some of my expenses (insurance + phone).  

my main goal is to move out and get rid of my personal loan, it started at about 28k and is now at 18k, trying to tackle this as fast as possible.  next would be my car (3/2021), I will most likely have to buy it out of lease which is another lesson learned, but I’m trying to save now to see how much ill be able to put down.

Pretty much if anyone sees anything glaring and would like to tell me, that would be great.

 thanks in advance.",finance

financialindependence,Another Chapter in my Story....,"So I have posted a few times here about some bumps in the road on my career trajectory and how my saving early on has worked in my favor.  I have a new chapter in my story.

NW:  $1.6M
Age:  43
Married with one child

Back story:  six months ago I received a glowing letter from my immediate supervisor on how well I was performing.  All the metrics the admin types look at, I was doing extremely well.  Had a good working relationship with my coworkers too.  Was extremely happy at the time.

Fast forward five weeks:  we have a facility closure in my region.  I am not being laid off but asked to relocate.  It felt like a gut punch and was without question a step down.  They told me they would keep me in my current role for another three months, despite being overstaffed, “as a courtesy”.  

In time I was given some schedules and assignments on my way out that seemed punitive and were unacceptable to me.  

How I would have handled this if I didn’t have decent savings:  Tuck my tail between my legs and keep working

How I handled it given my current situation:  I got confrontational.  I told them this was unacceptable.  I provided ample evidence my peers were not given such assignments/schedule in short time.  I demanded them to make some changes.  They refused.  I resigned abruptly and told them to find someone else to do their grunt work.

Three months later, I have started my own business and found flexible side work I can do from home as I grow the business.  New business has been a bit slow to take off admittedly but we are progressing and increasing our marketing strategies.  I wish I could be more specific but it would potentially reveal my identity.

My income is right now a fraction of what it was before, but growing week to week.  I did have a moment or two after I was in the early stages of my new career path where I briefly felt panic.  But mostly that has not been an issue.

What has gotten me through those occasional moments:  reminding myself that my entire career thus far, saving aggressively for a number of years, was in order to help me in a moment like this.  Coming to that realization, I was able to accept the short term drop in income.  I recognized that if I let stress eat me up during this time then my entire career saving for the future has accomplished nothing.

So today ironically I spend zero time stressing about money.  Month to month when my income was an order of magnitude higher I was far more meticulous about it all.  I have given myself permission to relax and focus on the next chapter.  And it feels great.

Today I work on my own terms.  My side gig is enough to support my family month to month and my new business if it takes off will be more lucrative.  I still have a lot to accomplish but today I believe in myself and I believe I will look back on my last job and the way things went south as a blessing.",finance

#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, February 10th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/10/futures-steady-trump-new-budget-and-coronavirus-deaths-exceed-sars.html)

* With coronavirus concerns still very much in the mix, U.S. stock futures point to more losses for Wall Street following a Friday sell-off. The major averages all had their best weekly gains in months despite that Friday drop, but the trend is clearly negative as we head into the new week. The Nasdaq’s weekly gain last week was its largest since November 2018, even after a 0.5% fall on Friday. Tech has been February’s strongest sector so far, and the Consumer Staples sector finished last week at a record high. (CNBC)
* The Trump administration will release its fiscal 2021 budget today, which will show the economy growing at an average rate of 3% for the next 15 years. It’s also proposing to continue tax cuts for individuals through 2035 at a cost of $1.4 trillion, a figure that serves as a rough placeholder for President Donald Trump’s promised “Tax Cuts 2.0.” (CNBC)
* Treasury yields move higher ahead of Trump’s 2021 budget (CNBC)
* No economic releases are on today’s calendar. Two Fed officials have public speaking engagements today, with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman making a morning appearance in Florida and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker speaking this afternoon in Delaware. (CNBC)
* Allergan (AGN), Edgewell Personal Care (EPC), and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) are among the companies set to release quarterly earnings this morning. Callaway Golf (ELY) and XPO Logistics (XPO) issue numbers after the closing bell.
* Tesla (TSLA) shares were up 9% in the premarket this morning after a tumultuous week, which saw the stock move more than $100 per share in either direction in three of five sessions. Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)
* China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country. The U.K. has confirmed four further cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country to eight. (CNBC)
* Factories in China remain shuttered as some regions extend shutdowns (CNBC)
* As virus deaths top SARS, survivor tells of treatment (WSJ)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders remains at the top of the Democratic field in a new NBC News/Marist poll of tomorrow’s New Hampshire primary. Sanders gets 25% of likely Democratic primary voters in the poll, while former Mayor Pete Buttigieg receives support from 21%. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, comes in at 13%. (CNBC)
* Biden predicts he will ‘take a hit’ in New Hampshire primary after ‘gut punch’ in Iowa (CNBC)
* Mike Bloomberg is the only Democrat to top Trump in Gallup poll of small business owners (CNBC)
* The Iowa Democratic Party allocated delegates based on the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses, giving Buttigieg the largest delegate count, followed closely by Sanders, though many news outlets remained unable to declare a winner. Sanders’ campaign plans to ask for a “partial recanvass” of the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses. (NBC News &amp; AP)
* Sen. Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr’s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)
* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)
* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria’s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It’s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he’s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. (CNBC)
* The federally appointed oversight board in charge of Puerto Rico’s ongoing record debt restructuring saga announced they have come to terms with bondholders of around $35 billion, which accounts for nearly 50% of the bankrupt island’s total debt load. The deal will cut the Commonwealth’s outstanding bond debt from $35 billion to approximately $11 billion. (CNBC)

personalfinance,Debt consolidation and engagement ring guidance,"Good afternoon; using a throwaway. 


Last year around this time my credit card debt peaked around $23k. I was able to balance transfer $14k or so to a card with 0% intro period. 

Over the past year I have managed to work that down to around $18k while also saving up $6k in cash for an engagement ring. 


That 0% intro period is about to be up and I feel I need to make some financial moves inorder to keep the progress moving. 


Situation: I have $6k cash.  $6k on an Amex. And $12k on a discover card (balance transfer 0% intro) 


What I was thinking of doing is moving the $12k to a signature loan through my credit union since it's about to move out of the 0% intro period. 

The next question is should I take the $6k cash and pay off the Amex and finance the ring separately or try and debt consolidate the Amex and discover card and just payoff the ring in cash. 


Basically I'm financing $6k either way for the ring or the amex but which would make more sense? 


My biggest hangup is which route impacts my credit score less. It's sitting at 718 right now. Paying off the $6k amex makes my credit score jump a bit. I could then use that bump in credit score to get a better interest rate on the rest of it. But I wasn't sure how financing $12k would impact it negatively.

personalfinance,Complicated US tax return- Should I use software? A Professional? Do it myself?,"Hey everyone! I know that some version of this question has been asked several times before, but after reading through some past responses, I am still unsure what is the best route to take. 

I know that if you make less than $69,000 you are eligible for free federal filing programs *(This is me!)* Last year, I used a free program I found through the government website, but my personal situation was too complicated for the site, and I ended up having to pay more money in taxes after I submitted my original filing because it was done incorrectly. Below are some specifics (without revealing too much information)

* I graduated from my university in the Spring of 2019. I received a full scholarship, which means that I have to pay taxes on the amount that was not related to tuition or books (aka housing stipend, etc.)
* I went to university and worked in one state, had a summer job in another state, but am a resident of a third state. 
* I worked as waitress while I was studying and will have to pay taxes on my tips.
* After graduation, I moved abroad with a grant from a US government program. My salary here is low by US standards (around $700 per month), but due to the specifics of my grant, I am supposed to treat this as income. The government hasn't taken any taxes out of this number. 
* I have several thousand dollars in investments. I moved them into a Roth IRA this year. 
* International postal service does not really exist in the country I live in. The price to send a single envelope to the US is around $45 minimum. I can probably find a family member to mail in tax forms for me, but it wouldn't have the physical copy of my signature. 

Does anyone have a recommendation for a free filing site that will allow me to input all these variables? I am not opposed to paying a professional if that is the best option, but I don't make much by US standards here, so I don't want to pay too much if it's not necessary!

BUT--this is more money than I have ever seen, and I am VERY nervous about dumping millions into the market all at once. I'm also pretty nervous about bond price risk with interest rates being so so low.

My initial thought was to put 80% into short term bond fund and dollar cost average over the next 2 years into a more normal asset mix but I'm open for any and all thoughts here.

So...2 things:

1. Is the dollar cost averaging idea reasonable or is it common knowledge that I'm just playing into my emotions?

personalfinance,Refinancing and Car Affordability Questions,"Hey Guys,

Need your help with a refinancing and Car buying situation.  Now the interest rates are low, I am looking to refinance my home loan. First part of the post is that I would like to know if it makes sense to refinance the loan to 10 years or 15 years and refinance at all. 

We are married and my wife does not work as of now. My income is: 80k before taxes. 

**Expenses :**
Take home pay: $4600/month. 
Mortage :  $1350
Monthy expenses : $1000
Car paid off. 
Savings : $50K
401K:  $300 (Literally just started this month). 



**Home Situation:** Bought he home for $155k in April, last year. I put 30K down and current loan balance is  $119K
  Current Interest = 4.125%
   Current monthly payment = $925(mortage) + $425 (Tax &amp; Insurance) =$ 1350
  New  interest = 3 %
  Closing cost for Refinancing = $2K
**Savings when refinancing with 10 yrs vs 15 yrs:**
 With 15 year refinancing, I'll be paying $66/month less than what I am paying now. With costing cost into consideration, Ill be saving $2700 in 25 years. 
  With 10 year refinancing, I'll be paying $260 more, but will save about $12.8k in interest in 10 years. 

We are not expecting any other expenses at this month. Now to the second part. 

 My wife is looking for a job and she will most likely start a job pretty soon with 30K per year. And we need to get a new car.  I am driving a 2011 camry with no issues so far and has put only 70k miles on it. I only drive less than 5 miles a day to work and my wife would do the same too. 

As far as the second car, I am looking to get either 2019 or greater Rav4 hybrid or 2019 Acura RDX since I like them and has all the new features I need. I won't regret that I bought something that is behind technology. 


**Car buying choices** : 
1) Buy a 2019 Rav4 Hybrid: OTD 35K. Put down 10k and Finance 25k at 2.5% interest. 
2) Buy a car for less than 10k for my wife. After a year, trade in my camry or my wife's car to buy either 2021 Rav4 Prime (with 7.5K Federal credit) or 2019 Acura RDX (With all the bells and whistles) for 35k OTD sinxe these are currently priced at 40K OTD. 


If my wife to goes to job, we will have to spend another $1250 for daycare. 

 Ill be refinancing whether my wife goes to job or not, but the question is does it make sense to refinance 10 years or 15 years.  Can I afford a 35k car and and refinance to 10 years?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Order of Operations Question / Factors that determine Interest Rates,"Heyhey,

&amp;#x200B;

A question about which should be done first/is this relevant: refinance now, or refinance after paying off the highest interest rate loan? 

&amp;#x200B;

A student loan debt of $347,000 is owed by my SO, all US federal loans at the moment in an IRB program. The federal loan with the highest interest rate is $27,000 at 6.9%. The average interest rate is 5.9% overall. The plan is to refinance this sum of money with one of the usual suspects (e.g. SoFi, Laurel Road, etc). This will lower our overall rate for great success.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if we had the means to pay off the high interest loan first before refinancing, would this make a significant difference in our student loan refinancing interest rate?  Sure, a lower overall loan sum would be helpful as well as a good credit score, debt to income ratio, etc. I was curious about **whether the average interest rate of debt makes a difference for refinancing interest rate offers.**

personalfinance,Non-deductible IRA contributions question,"I'll try to keep this brief. 

I opened a traditional IRA when I was in college earning money through internships which I fortunately didn't need. For two years I contributed the maximum of $5,500 and deducted that amount on my tax return. This year I was hired full time and continued contributing the federal maximum ($6,000 this year) thinking I could again deduct the income but as I was doing my taxes I found out there is an income threshold which means I cannot deduct this contribution on my taxes. 

I'm perfectly happy making this a non-deductible contribution but I want to make sure that when I eventually go to withdraw this $6,000 I am not getting taxed on it again.

Can deductible and non-deductible contributions go into the same IRA? Do I need to move this money or classify it in some way on fidelity so that fidelity knows this $6,000 was post-tax money?",finance

Wife's credit history is very young, only started a year and a half ago, and has one credit card and an auto loan. Otherwise, her credit score is good.

Wife and I are in the process of getting a HELOC on our home. Bank's appraisal came out to $140,000, there's $97,000 on the mortgage (bough with FHA back in 2015). HELOC application is pending a few documents at the moment, but is offering $28k for 7.8%. Not bad.

 The mortgage and title for the house is cosigned between myself, my mother, and my father. Wife and I got married in the past year and it isn't in her name at the moment.

Here's where the drama starts. Mother and Father are getting a divorce, which is leaving father with a smaller income. Applying for his own credit card has an issue with an debt-to-income ratio being too high. The Mortgage on my home (that he is cosigned on) is the reason the ratio is too high. He wants us to refinance the home to just my wife and I, so that he and my mother are no longer tied to the debt. This would then fix his debt-to-income ratio for his credit applications.

However, I'm in progress of obtaining a HELOC, how would refinancing at the moment affect that. Should I wait to refinance until after the HELOC, or refinance first, and restart the HELOC application?

Secondly, my interest rate is 3.5%, which I'm fairly certain is going to go up a good bit if we switch off of their nearly perfect credit scores, to mine and my wife's. Is there a way to solve this without refinancing at all?

I was thinking about withdrawing from my 401k and using that money (and money from my tax refund) to pay off my CC debt in order to boost my credit score, and use that new, higher score to refinance my loans to have some breathing room for monthly payments.

Anyone versed in Va tax law able to fill me in on this?,"Based on everything I have read on the subject I believe an employer who has a W2 employee in Virginia is required by law to withhold Virginia state taxes!

personalfinance,Student Loans Refinancing,"TL:DR The advice in regards to student loan fiance here is 100 times better than what i found via the google, but are there any other majors points I over looked? 

40k dept at 5.99% combined,  about 30k at 6.7ish, about 10k at 4.9ish

So I graduated in 2016 with 2 BS degrees, minors, and an Engineering Licence, the young naive me though i would easily land a $80k job.... I did not. I have been working for several years now, salary ranging from $40 to $50k in that time period, but living with parents so no expenses except a car that is more than i should have bought, but cars are my hobby and passion so I did it. I did keep in mind a budget of what was plausible, so i have consistently been overpaying my student loans. As of writing this I am at just under $40k with a combined rate of 5,99%.

I had been flirting with the idea of refing the loans so it was all under one company and not having to send 3 different payments to two companies. TBH still considering it just so I no longer have to deal with Navient, they are notorious for being some of the worst with handling student loans, and it honestly takes about half an hour to jump through all their hoops just to make a payment. But anyway, looking online, google, school financial aid offices, banks, refinancing companies, the list goes on.....and they all were useless. They either were trying to get all your information subtly enough that you do not realize you are several clicks away from authorizing the refinancing, making absurd claims, giving information so generic, a high school economics class could tell you that, or just flat out blocking all the info until you provide everything short of refi approval.

Reading the conversations here, I was able to learn that Fed loans have a toooooon of protection that you will lose if you refi, and that the general thought is that paying off higher interest loans will naturally bring your loans down more or as much if you average in the end and refing now will (at least doing the quick mental math for my numbers). So I wanted to take a moment to thank all that have contributed to those conversations, shared their knowledge, and asked the questions that started the threads.

personalfinance,"University charging me nearly $2,000 after graduation.","So, I graduated in December, and all of my payments were in order, otherwise I would not have been able to graduate. Last week, I checked my account, and I was being charged with nearly $2,000, with due date of October 2019. The charge was not there a few weeks ago. 

When registering for the final semester, I received $954 of federal financial aid, as well as $2637 subsidized loan. My tuition for the semester was $1338, so I was refunded $2,254 in September of 2019. 

I also noticed that there is a discrepancy between the amount that was paid by the loan, and the amount that was refunded. Under the Payments section of my account, it is listed that $700 of loans were paid toward tuition, and $954 of federal aid were paid toward tuition as well, so $,1,654 were paid toward tuition, even though the tuition was paid off and the remainder refunded.

Not only this, but in my loan manager account, my outstanding balance is still the full amount of the loan, that paid for the tuition.

So in summation, it looks like my refund was only supposed to be  $317, but I was refunded the full amount of the loan, and the university is demanding the difference, even though I already owe the difference to the Loan Management company. 

My question is what can be done about this? I have a job lined up that will request a transcript, and the university will refuse to release the transcript if I don't pay the balance, and I have less than $100 for the next 5 months. I can't come up with that much money with no job.",finance

personalfinance,TEXAS - Credit card Collections - Zombie Account?,"My wife and I just applied for a mortgage - not sure if that triggered something (or not), but I also just received a letter from a credit card debt collector saying I owe $1000+ on an old GE Money Bank account. We won't be closing on the mortgage until later in the year.

I believe this might have been an account from Discount Tire (who uses synchrony a division of GE Financial).

The letter gives me options to pay 1 payment of $416, or multiple other options to resolve the account.

At the bottom of the letter, in large font is the following:

&gt;TEXAS LAW REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE: THE LAW LIMITS HOW LONG YOU CAN BE SUED ON A DEBT. BECAUSE OF THE AGE OF YOUR DEBT, CACH, LLC WILL NOT SUE YOU FOR IT, AND CACH, LLC WILL NOT REPORT IT TO ANY CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY. THIS NOTICE IS REQUIRED BY LAW. PLEASE NOTE, IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, THAT BECAUSE OF THE AGE OF YOUR DEBT CACH, LLC CANNOT SUE YOU FOR IT.

This seems pretty straight forward that they can't sue me for the debt. I'm guessing they can't report it to the three major credit bureaus either - is that correct?

The Texas credit card debt statute of limitations is four year (which seems low). So, can I throw this letter in the trash? All I'm concerned about is them reporting to the credit bureaus that I have a debt in collections - that will really screw up my loan app and interest rates I'm sure.

I know that I haven't had this account in at least the last three years... (that's when I bought my current house, and all of my credit was clear and clean at that point). It's probably closer to seven years since I had the account, but I'm not exactly sure.

personalfinance,"I found myself with $42,500. I have $40,000 in student debt. Suggestions?","Hey there folks.

I’m a grad student. I have 40 grand in student loans. 12 grand are at a 4.6% interest rate, 27grand are at a 7.6% interest rate. About half of this overall isn’t accruing interest yet, but I’m graduating in May, after-which it will begin to do so.

While I make a small stipend for my research, it isn’t particularly much-it covers costs of living, and let’s me save ~$300 per month after expenses.

I invested that money in the stock market, and got lucky- I’m up 20,000 this past month or so on an investment from a few Microsoft calls. $6,000 of that is within the last week.

This was unexpected.

My stock portfolio is now around 32,000. It’s actually pretty well diversified- the vast majority is split between a number of ETF’s, though I’ve kept about $5,000 in $190 Microsoft calls expiring in April. Unless a recession or major correction comes, they’re genuinely a series of relatively diverse, safe investments for the near future (bar the Microsoft calls). It’s nearly equal parts $GLD, $SPY, $VGT, $SPYD, $SCHG, and $ONEQ, as well as ~$1,000 each of AMD, Apple, and Raytheon stocks. 

I have 10 grand in my savings, and another $500 In my checking. If I cashed out of all of my current positions, and liquidated a good portion of my savings, I would be able to pay off my student debt entirely.

Would you think this is a wise course of action? Or, should I wait until my loans start accruing interest? As of now, potential stock market gains might outweigh any interest accrued over the next couple of months (while a subsection of the loans are still subsidized). It’s still very much a bull market- but then again, this past month has been very, very volatile.  

On the other hand: if I sold everything now and paid off my debt I’d have $2500 to my name, but would be entirely debt free. $2500 is enough for a minor emergency, or three months of rent ($730/month+electricity). I have no other recurring bills beyond food costs. Assuming I don’t get appendicitis or in a major accident, there are few risks here- and realistically, those would put me horribly into debt even given my current savings. 

As a side note: I haven’t forgotten about taxes! I don’t owe anything for 2019, but realizing my gains right now would cost me ~2,500 on my 2020 return. This will happen anyways, given the strike times of the options I purchased.",finance

personalfinance,"Crippling Debt, Feels Like an Endless Tunnel.","Hello,

I am currently employed full time, I make about 900-1100 weekly, and my total expenses are around $2600 a month. I most recently moved into my own place, paying 1280/month (that's included in my expenses for the month). My previous living situation was not good at all, the house was condemned  and amongst other things it just was not a good situation.

So several years back I had a few credit cards, I was doing everything correct for them and I dealt with the lose of my dad, so I left my job. I had no income at that point, and what I know now, I wish I knew then and just contacted those companies because they probably could have done something then.

My total debts are about 14000-15000, and my FICO score is a 527 (it's embarrassing I know..) and the damage is ultimately done. I opened a credit card (recently) in order to try and get my credit up a bit because what if I eventually want to buy a house and other things etc. Yes the interest rate is high but I pay off the full balance every month especially since I have a solid income. 

Another reason why my credit score is so low is because my student loans (federal) were supposed to be in general forebearance, they were when I got out of college and then I had no source of income at the time. I was watching my credit score pretty frequently then one day I saw a hit to my credit for about 100-150 points. It said I missed 12 different payments (12 different loans although you pay one payment for the month). I called them immediately and later turns out that they were sending correspondence electronically because that's what I enrolled in during college. They end up applying me into a general forebearance and it still showed 90 days late on my credit report. I've been making payments on them for almost 24 months on time. Issue is the payment is so low that I've only been paying the interest on the loan. That's the same for my car. Been paying on time for 24 months and the interest rate is so high that I've literally paid $3000 of the balance off even though I give them nearly $500/month.

That's my fault for getting into this mess that I'm currently in. I contacted National debt relief, but I don't know if I should go through with it or if I should put money to the side each month and contact debt collectors myself. One of my debts is for nearly $9000. I really don't know what to do about that because again that was for a private student loan that my school ended up sending me payment schedules to my school email that they closed almost immediately after leaving school. The collection fee on that loan was nearly $4000 and I'm just at a loss for words.

Some of the other debt was for medical.. I'm just not sure what to do at this point. The apartment I have, I signed a lease for 12 months and I'm living well within my means, they said they were going to check my credit but I think they just based my ability to pay on my income. I had hoped of refinancing my car for a lower interest rate but I do not think that will be at all possible with the way my credit is looking currently. I'm frustrated that my student loans could take so much of my credit away yet not give back in at least a fraction of what it took.

I seriously need help, and this is a cry for help. Thanks everyone for the responses.",finance

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

financialindependence,"UPDATE (1 year in and loving it!): 35, $1.1M - Luck, Stumbles, Dedication, and Thrift - An 11 Year Journey to FI","So it's been a full year since I've been RE and wanted to give a quick update on my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/adj08l/35_11m_luck_stumbles_dedication_and_thrift_an_11/). Spoiler: I'm loving the FIRE and don't have any plan to go back to work at all!  I've put the TL;DR up front, but I've got a lot more details below if you're interested in reading those!

* After taking an 11 month Leave of Absence, I officially gave my notice and my last day of employment was in early January.
* My net worth went from $1.10M to $1.40M with a few paychecks, cashing out a ton of PTO, a small annual bonus, and a surging stock market. With my current budget of $33K/year, this would amount to a 2.37% withdrawal rate, which for someone who is risk averse (especially given the long bull run in the past decade and valuations where they are currently at) is very comforting.
* 2019 Actual budget was only $500 above planned and I found that a lot of my planned budget categories costs were higher than my actual spend.
* Overall, I'm extremely happy with my decision to RE - I can spend more time with my hobbies, friends, and [pursue things that are bringing more meaning to my life](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/dbcrtr/giving_after_fire_1_month_volunteering_at_summer/). I know there have been a few recent posts about not being happy after RE, but I'm truly enjoying all of it and not finding any boredom whatsoever!
* I applied and got accepted to a second LGBT summer camp as a cabin counselor! I've got 3 days at a spring camp, 3 weeks with Summer Camp #1, and 5 weeks with Summer Camp #2.  With training for each of the camps, it'll be 68 days of volunteering this summer!
* Major goal this is to get better at climbing (leading sport and trad climbs outdoor at 5.10b-5.10d level) so I can apply to be an outdoor instructor at Outward Bound or NOLS (National Outdoor Leadership School).

In the rest of the post I will cover the following topics: Major FIRE actions, Quality of Life Update, Budget in FIRE, Goals for Year 2 of FIRE,  Notable Experiences Since my Last Update, and Notable Events/Trips for 2020. So read on for more details!

# Major FIRE actions

* Moved 401k to Vanguard IRA rollover account. This gave me some anxiety because a mid 6-figure check was sent via snail-mail. o\_O
* Changed taxable investments to not auto-invest to get a cashflow source not that I'm not generating a salary.  I got $18K in dividends from my taxable accounts last year, most of it qualified.
* After lots of research and debating pros/cons, I decided to balance health care costs, present taxes, with future taxes and am targeting an AGI of $30,200 next year.  I will have the roughly $18K in dividends (based on 2019) and $12,200 of of IRA to Roth IRA rollover income. If dividends come in lower than $18K, I will sell of some mutual funds to get LT capital gains to make up the difference. **My estimated 2020 tax at that income level will be $975 ($400 Federal and $575 State).** The $30.2K AGI puts me in the top range for the Silver 73 CSR subsidy range. I hypothetically had the option to keep my premium to $1/month with super low deductibles and out of pocket costs, but it didn't leave any headroom to convert IRA to Roth IRA. Ultimately, I chose to pay a higher health insurance premiums ($474/year instead of $12/year), which is effectively a 3.80% tax to rollover $12.2K to Roth IRA.  
* Signed up for ACA covereage started Feb 1st for $39.50/month for a Silver 73 HMO with CSR with $3700/$375 deductible with fixed fee co-pays for normal doctor visits and labs/tests. There were issues with the website so I had to call in via phone to continue the application. Also, I had to talk to them and insist/clarify that I no longer had health insurance at work  - they input it into the system that I still had a job and it was going to cost me something like $500+/month.

# Quality of Life Update

I definitely don't feel any guilt about not working or feel bored (I've seen a lot of posts recently commenting on either or both topics) - I've got so many things I do outside of work that I enjoy and I've been able to spend so much more time with friends and family post-FIRE.

**Downshifting**

I have a much more laid back attitude with life. Before FIRE I was very much a ""always on the go"", Type A kind of person, feeling like I had to optimize every bit of every day, partially because I had limited time at home, but also because I wanted to ""maximize life"". While on a 3 week vacation, I actually had 1-2 days where I actually just lounged around at my hotel swimming pool instead of seeing cultural sights and exploring the city. If you bet me a year ago that I'd spend an entire day not doing anything besides laying at the pool and eating, I would have thought you were crazy. With the ability to do slower travel and therefore less pressure to squeeze everything in, I've found that FIRE has given me a a stronger sense of calm/relaxation from the normal frantic life and resulted in a lot less stress.

**Decisions and Structure**

From time to time, I found that there was a lot of things to do and it was often tiring to choose what to do. Making decisions takes energy and effort (see the book ""The Paradox of Choice"" for further information on choice and loss aversion). With a large lack of defined work schedule and structure, it was taking energy to make those decisions. What I've done to combat having to make so many decisions is to create a shell structure so I'm doing the things I want to avoid suffering from decision fatigue.

For example, Monday nights are always board game nights at my lcoal store, Monday and Thursday afternoon are my lead climbing days, Tuesdays are my puzzles or cheap movie nights, and Friday are my theater nights. Nothing is set in stone of course, but having the structure relieves me from having to make decisions all the time over things that I want to do and can let me spend more time on meaningful decisions.

# Budget in FIRE

I spent more on travel and some other areas, but surprisingly my spend was still only &lt;$500 greater than my planned budget, despite paying for (effectively) Cobra Health Insurance for 6 months. The following are a few random musings of some areas where my budget has decreased as a result of FIRE:

**Lower expenses as a result of FIRE:**

* Saving on airfare by travelling on non-peak days/times.
* Taking advantage of $5 Tuesdays at AMC and other matinee movie prices.
* Lower food costs because I'm eating more at home more often.
* Lower transit costs because I've been riding my bike much more. Previously, I felt pressed for time so I would take the bus or train to places or Uber/Lyft, but now I get on my bike for more exercise and fresh air, while saving money.
* Will get about 2 months of ""free"" food (\~$1100 based on my budget) while volunteering at summer camp. Note: I'm doing the camp because I love it and it's not really ""free"" since I'm donating a lot of my time, but it just happens to be a side perk for volunteering.

# Goals for Year 2 of FIRE

* Lead a 5.10D sport route and lead a 5.10A trad route.
* Get in even better shape, mostly so I can become a better climber. Aiming for 3 climbing days a week and 2-3 cardio/strength conditioning. Specific goal is to get to 13% body fat and 145 pounds (currently at 16%/152).
* Volunteer more with LGBT summer camps than I did in 2019 (I already have 68 days for 2020 planned compared to 24 in 2019).
* Apply and get accepted to work for NOLS or Outward Bound as an outdoor backpacking/climbing instructor.  I would especially love to guide some LGBT/POC affinity groups.

# Notable experiences since my last [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bqv9i4/100_days_on_loa_a_quantitative_view_of_my_time/):

* Ate at Blue Hill at Stone Barnes.
* Mountain biked for the first time, including some pretty difficult (for me) single track.
* Did a 5 pitch multi pitch route, leading 3 pitches (it was super soft). Climbed 2 different 6B+ routes (\~5.10D) on top rope without any takes. Those are the hardest grades I've ever climbed.
* Saw a 7 hour play, The Inheritance, which was absolutely incredible.
* Visited Thailand for 3 weeks, my 38th country.
* Saw Harry Potter and the Cursed Child!

# Notable planned events/trips for 2020

* Disneyworld and Universal Studios for a 10 days.
* Brazil trip for a month to travel/climb and to see my new niece (I'm a first time uncle!).
* Volunteer at two summer camps (including training, 68 days).
* Text/phone bank and canvas for swing states in September/October.
* Laos and Cambodia trip for 3 weeks to climb in Thakkek.

personalfinance,State is taking a joint refund for child support that's owed to me. Can I file an injured spouse claim?,"My ex and I are separated, but still legally married. He is about $3300 behind on support as of right now which is more than the entire refund we expected to get and split. This is a federal return. We live in Texas where theres no state income tax. 

This support is owed to me, but can I file as an injured spouse even though the state is taking the money to give to me? Last year it took until July 31 to get that money. I'm desperate for some financial relief as he hasn't paid in months. 

If it's legal to file an injured spouse claim can anyone tell me how to do it? I only know about it bc my mom used to do it when my dad had bad debts, but they're not around for me to ask anymore.

It's 1175 a month with no utilites included... I make $48k a year after bonuses from my job. I also plan to make about $18000 from my own online gigs, will prob pay about $2k-$3k in fed/self empl taxes on that.

I currently have two chase checking accounts, one of which I use as a ‘savings’ account, because I couldn’t afford the fees for a proper saving account when I opened it.

personalfinance,*New* to fine tuning W4..Help!,"After reading some posts about fine tuning your W4 to get the most bang when it comes to paychecks I want to make sure I have the right idea before submitting to my employer.

As of now I have my file status set to Married but Single Rate, reason being is my wife doesn't work (stay at home mom 1 year old) but has student loans which to my understating are deferred. Kept as single in the event they were not deferred causing my tax refund to be taken. Loans looking to be deferred for awhile it seems which tells me I can possible look going into the route of my file status being married filing jointly. So my questions are

1. If I were to set my file status to Married filing jointly does it automatically readjust my federal tax payments? After completing a tax withholding estimator with the IRS.gov I'm expected to receive an estimated payment of $6,186 for the year of 2020 which I would rather have spread out throughout my bi weekly checks. After adjusting the slider to a approximate refund of $3,000 I get to download a pre-filled W4 with extra steps stating for me to enter $2 in additional withholding. Which leads me to my next question

2. ""To get your desired refund amount, you will need $146 withheld"" Is this the amount I need to tell my employer I would like taken out my checks? Or does checking ""Married filing jointly"" with adding ""$2"" in additional withholding just automatically do this for me? I am able to adjust my federal withholding online but only shows 3 sections as apposed to the W4 document. Sections being Martial Status, Number of Exemptions (0), Additional deduction amount.

Maybe I'm just not good with taxes but it seems like if the system is designed to ensure everyone pays more than what they should be. Thank you for your help.

personalfinance,Student Loans and PSLF/Loan Forgiveness Planning,"Thinking I already know the answer to this one but wanted a little bit of feedback. I have $29k in student loans that are in Income Based Repayment (REPAYE). These loans are all between 3.4 and 6.8% interest. I will include a breakdown of the loans below. I pay $140 each month. Of the $1700 that I've paid in the last year, about $1400 has just gone to interest. I've been fine with this as I'm a teacher working towards Public Student Loan Forgiveness.

The end of this school year will be my fifth year working towards PSLF. I just had my employer certify this and sent all documents out to be confirmed. I know that I can't qualify for both PSLF and Teacher Loan Forgiveness but I will also qualify for TLF at the end of next school year (TLF is one year behind PSLF for me). I've always thought that PSLF was the way to go but the more I've been looking into it, I think TLF forgiving $17,500 next year might be the better route. 

If I do Teacher Loan Forgiveness at the end of next school year, I will reduce my owed amount to  $11000. With my current income, this shouldn't be too hard to pay off within a year or two afterwards. I'm a little confused on how TLF will forgive my loans and if it will be possible to prioritize the ones with higher interest rates.

If I choose to wait for PSLF, my payments will continue to primarily go to interest and I will just be waiting for the 10 year mark. My income, along with my payments, will increase each year as I continue to teach. I've had a hard time figuring out how much I would pay total as IBR increases, but using the government's REPAYE calculator, estimate between $8500 and $10000 as my salary increases.

While I have a year to decide what I'm going to do, I'm wondering if there's anything I'm overlooking. To me, spending potentially $1000-$3000 more to have the loans paid off sooner is worth it. I'm not too concerned with losing my job as I'm a tenured teacher in a high need field and teaching at a low income school. I am concerned that PSLF won't always be an option but that I may be grandfathered in.

personalfinance,Traditional vs Roth IRA for high earners?,"Hi! I tried to figure this out on my own, but the more I read, the less I get it. I know mega backdoor/back door IRA are super popular on here so I'd thought I ask!

I started looking into IRA's when I rolled over an existing 401k to a Betterment Traditional IRA almost 2 years ago when I switched job. I found out later that converting it to Roth would hit me with a hefty tax bill so I didn't.

Now - my understanding is that a Roth IRA makes sense when you plan on having a high tax rate during retirement. I am currently in the 32-35% federal tax bracket and 6.5% NY State tax bracket - I anticipate to be in a lower bracket when in retirement. So, for me, Traditional should make more sense, do I understand this correctly?

I know that Roth IRA also offers more flexibility in the terms of anticipated withdrawal of past contributions and also age requirement, but aside from this - would it make sense for me to open a backdoor Roth IRA at all? And if yes, why?

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my debt?,"Hey there folks, long time since I've posted on here. A lot has happened, and I'm in a much better place financially than a year or two ago. I won't go into a **whole lot** of specifics, but right now my problem is that I have debt in too many different places / accounts, and want to create a clear and simple path to finally being debt free. Here is the breakdown:

&amp;#x200B;

**Income:** $115,000 / yr gross (this will likely increase to closer to $140k in the next few months)

**Monthly Expenses**: Roughly 3500 - 4000, leaving over around 2k/mo in ""funny money"". I could probably go way down on my spending if I wanted to, but I spend a fair amount of time doing fun stuff in the city (I work &amp; play in D.C., and those who are familiar will know that this place can pull you into its nightlife with a vengeance!)

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** To be clear, I'm not blowing a large part of that 3500-4000 on nightlife! My rent is 1800, my other expenses total around 700-1000, and a hamburger and a beer costs probably double what it does anywhere else in the country with maybe SF, NYC being the exception. Altogether, I am probably out on the town maybe once or twice a week, and my pool league is every tuesday. So out of the monthly budget, I would say probably $200-300 is the **most** I would spend a month on entertainment. Given the cost of living, that number might look high but isn't.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current accounts**

Navient - $11,000 spread over 4 loans varying from 1500-3000. Interest rates are between 7% and 11%

Wells Fargo - $2800 (26% interest) and $900 (23% interest) - in the next month or two I want to pay these down

Apple Card - $2700 - I always pay this down every month as this is my revolving line of credit for regular purchases. I get 1-2% cash back on everything and always pay the maximum to avoid interest charges

&amp;#x200B;

Simply from a standpoint of consolidation, I hate having 4 loans with Navient for a variety of reasons, but the main reason is that I don't want to have to interface with them every month to apply certain dollar amounts to the principal, and right now because I'm focused on the WF cards, I have been paying the minimum, which means that about 40% of my payment goes to interest. Obviously not ideal.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also cognizant of the gigantic interest rate on the two cards that I have left over from WF. I'd like to squash these in a month or so, but I'm getting hit with a tax bill in April for about $1k, so they might end up languishing for another month or so. Also not ideal, but I guess I need to be patient.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I have about $2k in savings and $2k in checking. I need to grow my savings and create an emergency fund, which is something that I am working on doing with a portion of the 2kish I have left over every month. I try to at least throw 1k towards my savings every month, but with these debts hanging over me, it's hard not to throw every spare dollar I have at them. I hate them and want them to die in a fire. But I am also aware that if something were to come up, I'd be in a hard position. I know with my industry, I could land another job very, very quickly, but that's still a risk.

They've stayed at a combined balance of ~14k for a long time. I took a backseat going through the motions just to make payments on time without taking seriously how much interest I was actually paying.

I often brushed it off by telling myself it's not as bad as some have it, insisting I just don't make enough yet to get myself ahead instead of taking ownership and asking for help. (Woe is me..)

I don't make a lot but no matter how much money you have it adds up and it can definitely get you somewhere. Albeit, stopping unnecessary spending is of course a huge factor. 

Set up a loan with an advisor, closed my highest interest card, have a super doable smaller payment that I can increase later (with a MUCH lower interest rate) and set up a TFSA and RRSP for my future. After leaving my appointment I couldn't believe the relief I felt and kept asking myself why I hadn't done this sooner.

In August, I was okay to go back to teaching one class, but my physical issues were still very much a problem, so I was issued Medicaid WDI (working disabled insurance). In November, I began working in a higher-paying work-from-home position and reported to Medicaid, so I stopped receiving Medicaid WDI as of December 31 (less than a month after my first paycheck from the new employer). I double-checked with the Income Support Division staff that everything was reported correctly.

Here's the issue: When I try to do my taxes through TaxAct, even though I never lapsed in insurance coverage and didn't have income over $22,000 for the year, they are reading 100% of the Marketplace subsidies as ""Excess advance payment of premium tax credit."" (Note: Because of the new job, my income WAS higher for the year than I'd originally thought it would be, but it's still low enough that I should have at least $200-250 per month in subsidies--so I should not have all of that tax credit listed as ""excess."") And when I called Income Support Division, they told me the 1099 forms for Medicaid won't be available till March. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do, because this reduced my estimated federal return amount by $1350. :( And I have HUGE medical expenses right at the beginning of the year because of my disabilities, so I really need that money. 

Any feedback would be appreciated. TIA!",finance

In my opinion, the headline is misleading. While total debt is up and that is a metric worth keeping an eye on, ""the level of household debt service as a percentage of disposable personal income is at [all-time lows going back to 1980](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TDSP). ""

So we have more total debt, but as a % of household income, debt loads seem low. Of course, servicing could be low in part because of low interest rates, which can turn around fast.",finance
personalfinance,I'm in the market for a car loan with some credit debt and extra cash. I'm looking for advice.,"I want to get a new (used) car and consolidate credit debt. I plan to use the car to bring in some extra money, therefore bumping my $30,000 income. I'd like to shop loans and have been trying that for a few weeks now. I plan to use my tax refund to help me, but I'm not sure of the best way to go about it. I will have $5,000 from my refund. I have a 648 FICO score. 632 Trans. 654 Equifax. Not sure which comes into play. I have a 70% credit usage at roughly $5,000 in debt. Here are the options that I have come up with.

1. I can take the $5,000 and put it down on a car loan and take the interest rate with my current credit score. Then concerning my credit debt, I would attempt to take out a personal loan to pay off credit debt at a lower interest. 

2. Pay down my credit debt to the recommended 30% usage using my return and (fingers crossed) bump my credit score, then use the left over cash (roughly $2,000) on a down payment for the car.

Any suggestions which of these is best? Is there a better option? (Please note that the extra income from the car is vital, I'm a single parent and have to work with whatever free time I get to make ends meet.)",finance

Forex,An extremely simple carry trade strategy,"Actually, “carry trade strategy,” is a slight misnomer.  This is not a strategy that aims to profit from the interest rate differentials themselves.  Instead, it profits from what economists call the carry trade puzzle.  Simply, it exploits the stylized fact that the currencies of economies with higher interest rates tend to appreciate against the currencies of economies with lower interest rates.

Only USD, CAD, AUD, NZD, JPY, CHF, GBP, and EUR are used in this strategy.  These are the most liquid and least volatile currencies.  Less volatility means a higher likelihood that the carry trade puzzle will hold.

Using these currencies, a currency basket is designed.  A basket consists of seven currency pairs.  Each of these currency pairs has a base or “main” currency in common.  So, all eight currencies are used to build a basket of seven currency pairs.  The reason for trading in a currency basket is to smooth out risk and to simplify the fundamental analysis process.

The basket’s main currency is determined first and foremost by looking at interest rates.  An above average interest rate is a potential long main currency and a below average interest rate is a potential short main currency.  Currencies near the top and bottom of the scale are preferred but not necessarily always considered the best option for a main currency. Other factors are also considered.  

How the currency’s central bank intends to treat interest rates in the near future is the second screen.  If, for example, a currency presently has an above average interest rate but it’s central bank is expected to cut interest rates at its next meeting, the currency is less likely to be the best choice for use as a main currency.  This screen is important because the greatest probability of currency appreciation or depreciation due to rates, and so also the greatest risk of trend change due to rates, is immediately after an interest rate change.  

Equally important is to consider the date of the last interest rate change.  In order for a main currency candidate to make it through this screening, its central bank must have changed interest rates within the last 2 or 3 years or so.  The reason for this is that at about 3 years after an interest rate change, a mean reversion becomes increasingly likely to occur.

The final screening is that of trend with the goal being simply to determine if a trend favoring the trade of the basket exists.  An easy method for this screen is to place the seven pairs on a single comparison chart and see if the majority of pairs within that basket have been trending in the direction of profit.  Multiple time frames are examined from a week to a year or longer.  Ideally, a trend should exist for a majority of pairs on a majority of timeframes.

Once a trade basket has been determined, trades are opened. Each currency pair is sized at 10% of account balance.  For most baskets, 30:1 leverage is used but for baskets with AUD or NZD as its main currency 20:1 or less leverage is used. 

After opening trades, the account value is watched closely.  When the value of the total account (including the 30% of the account that was not included in the trades) has increased by at least 3.7%, all trades are closed and then immediately reopened to rebalance each pair again at 10% of the new account value.  

If prior to reaching the 3.7% profit goal the value of the total account decreases by 10%, trades can either be closed at a loss or can be kept open depending on fundamental indicators.  Aside from central bank stance, the most important indicators are changes in the trends of employment and inflation as they have the most direct impact on interest rates.  However, a basket is closed regardless of trader discretion or fundamentals if the account balance decreases by 20%.  After a basket is closed at a loss, a new basket with a new main currency is designed for the next set of trades.

.



*Using this system and after 581 trades, the following performance metrics exist at the time of writing:*

*Baskets reach or exceed the profit goal 92.8% of the time.  The average profit per basket is 4.6% of account balance and the average loss per basket is -12.6% of account balance.  The average profitability per basket is 3.3% of account balance.*

*The average duration of a basket of trades is 7.8 days, the shortest has lasted less than an hour and the longest has lasted 41 days.*

*On average, an account will deviate -3.9% prior to a basket becoming profitable.  Also on average, if an account deviates -10.7%, a basket will not end up producing profit.*

.


I’d expect degrees of success to vary by individual trader using this system.  Most traders should produce strong profits using carry trade strategies.  That said, this particular strategy has obvious limitations.  It doesn’t lend itself well to algorithm and therefore is difficult to backtest.  Also because it is not algorithmic, it requires faith, intelligence, and emotional discipline on the part of the trader.  I’d recommend only intermediate or advanced traders with some experience fundamental trading to start trading this strategy and only with a small account.  The strategy has a high turnover and so after compounding a small initial investment is really all that is needed.",finance

I'm 31 and wife is 26.. we have a 3 month emergency fund saved up and are saving monthly for a future vehicle purchase expected in 2-3 years. Relatively low amounts of debt (student loans ~300/month and autoloan 200/month). After maxing out 401ks/employer matched accounts we are debating on how to spend ~$2k in leftover pay. Living off a single income. Three options we are considering are: 

1) Maxing out an IRA account(s?) and whatever is left of the 2k into a low fee taxable account/indexes/some other investment. 

2) Taking the full 2k and our current monthly rent and spending it to buy a house/pay it off as quickly as possible (&lt;10 years?). Interest rates are low and my credit score was ~780 last I checked. Her preference. 

3) Paying off car loan and her balance on student loan (~10k total or ~300/month). I'm 5 years in on qualifying payments towards PSLF loan forgiveness so I will stick to my income based repayment plan. This is my preference as I'm extremely averse to any type of monthly payment.. but once this was done it it's back to option 1 or 2 or something else.

personalfinance,Am I missing something? Chase Card cash balance transfer,"Edit: For clarification, I have had this Chase card for years.

I have heard of a typical balance transfer, never the latter. Option #2 has piqued my interest as I'm working to get out of a CC hole. Currently paying off a consolidation loan (17%) and multiple cards around (25%) - so it seems like a no brainer to take advantage of the offer and crush these bills. Has anyone ever used this option? Any downsides? I understand the APR of 0% is only for one year, but this is a huge help in paying down a consolidation loan that I have, as well as getting a jump start on other cards. And then coming back to finally pay down the balance taken out from Chase at (hopefully) a lower interest rate. 

TLDR: Chase offers a Credit Limit balance transfer to convert to cash in a checking account. APR is 0%, balance transfer fee 4%. Am I missing anything?",finance

personalfinance,Considering selling our house to buy a bigger one. Does it make any financial sense at all? Help!,"Hello r/personalfinance, long time lurker, first time poster here looking for some advice. 

First off, obligatory apologies for formatting and spelling, as I am on mobile.

So here's my situation. I bought my current house in the midst of the great recession, in 2010 when the housing market had just about bottomed out.  Since then, I got married in 2017 and we just had our first child last March. The economy has made a large upswing, and we are now sitting with some decent equity in our house.

 I was not making very much money when I first bought my house.  I was also young and foolish and ended up with some credit card debt when unforeseen issues inevitably popped up.   Three years ago, I was able to switch to a new career where I have been earning quite a bit more than I was previously, and have been working on getting into a better position financially, paying off debt, building up savings, etc.

We took advantage of some of the equity in our house by doing a cash out refinance to a lower interest rate 2 years ago. We used the cash to knock out a big chunk of CC debt and for some needed maintenance around the house.  Additionally, we got rid of monthly PMI by switching to a conventional loan from FHA. I though this all seemed like a no brainer. 

With a little more financial flexibility from my new job, my wife &amp; I have been exploring the idea of selling our house and using the equity to pay off the rest of my credit card debt and for a down payment on a larger house with a little more space.   Currently,  I have been dropping about $600 a month into paying down credit cards.  I have a total balance of about $7000 left.  I also have been working to build up our savings. We are sitting on just about a months worth of emergency savings right now, and I try to add more when I can. I could probably bump the $600 up quite a bit if we were more disciplined with our spending, but sometimes it's hard with a new baby and both of us working full time. 

Our house is currently worth about 2.5 times what I bought it for,  and if we sold it we would walk away with about $100k. When I bought it, I looked at it as more of an investment than my home.  I was in a place financially where I could buy it and I knew it would eventually be worth much more than I had paid. It also meant no more rent money down the drain each month. 

No that I'm married with a kid, it feels much smaller. It's 4 bedroom, but all but the master are on the small side.  I am also from a rural area where houses typically are on at least an acre of land,  and my current house is on less that a quarter acre in a subdivision.  I would prefer some more space as our family is growing, and more land to separate me from my neighbors. Subdivision life just isn't for me. 

So I have in my mind 3 scenarios to approach my middle term financial goals:

1.) Sell current house, use cash to pay off high interest CC debt, buy a larger house. For the houses we are looking at, this would raise our mortgage about $500-$600 a month. CC debt would be gone, which would free up some monthly spending. Continue to build up savings.

2.) Instead of selling, start paying the extra $500-$600 on our current house. The house would be paid off in around 9 years. This is of course after the CC debt is eliminated, which will add a year or so. Then we could sell &amp; buy something bigger with more money down. 

3.) Just keep doing what I'm doing. Put the $500-$600 into CC debt,  then into savings &amp; retirement. Deal with the house we have because that low, low mortgage payment is too nice to lose. 

I am leaning hard toward option 1. Am I insane?  I have lived in my house for 10 years and it just feels like my bachelor house to me.  We will probably have additional children and the space is filling up quickly. A friend of mine proposed Option 2 and it does seem like the more responsible thing to do, but is option 1 really that much worse?

Let me know your thoughts.  Please don't crucify me if I am missing something obvious, I am here for advice &amp; always happy to learn better ways to look at things! 

Oh, just thought I'd add,  my DTI currently is about 24%. If we get the increased mortgage payment &amp; paid off all my CC debt,  it's still at 24%.  This is all based on my income alone as we prefer to leave my wife's finances out if the equation.

Thanks for reading &amp; any advice you can offer!",finance

personalfinance,increase take home pay. W4 assistance?,"Hello. I just finished submitted my tax returns and am due about $5k from fed and state (CA). I've been getting larger refunds previously and would like to get smaller (maybe total $1k to $2k fed and state) refunds now and increase my take home pay. Here are my details:

Married, filed jointly, 1 toddler, 1 dependent and we each have 1 job. 
Me=projected $150k, $10k tax deffered retirement, $1k FSA. Most recent paystub = approx $850 federal, $380 state taxes taken out and 3 allowances claimed.
Spouse=projected $75k to $85k (depending on number of shifts worked). nothing else.
Standard deduction

The W4 calculator is confusing as it shows I will owe several thousands, which I suspect is because my spouse's salary is not set in stone. So the most recent paystub info that was inputted for the spouse was lot smaller since the spouse worked less shifts. Spouse will work more or less throughout the year. Last year total salary was approx. $80k

The other option is using the chart which is less accurate. I selected $13990 as the point for the lower paying and highest paying job intersection. so $13990/26 (every 2 weeks) = $538. 

Do I put that into 4c since I have the higher paying job and my spouse doesn't have to fill out the w4, correct? how much will that decrease my federal and state taxes a paycheck? thanks fellow redditors",finance

personalfinance,Repayment of first time homebuyer credit on federal taxes following divorce?,"I got a letter from the IRS after having filed my taxes informing me that I made an error calculating the amount deducted from my refund for repayment of the 2008 first time homebuyer credit.

My ex-wife and I bought the home in 2008 and took the $7,500 credit, which I believe gets repaid at $500/yr.  We divorced in 2018, and as part of the divorce settlement, I bought her out of the home and have been the sole owner since that time.  When filing my federal return, TurboTax seemed to indicate that I would only be responsible for repaying ""my portion"" of the initial credit since the funds went to both of us, so they deducted $250 from my refund.

The IRS mailed me a letter stating that this was in error and I owe the full $500.  They adjusted my refund amount before it got direct deposited to my bank account.

Both of my parents are CPAs so I asked them about this, unfortunately they didn't seem to know the answer.  Doing some research, I came across  [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/first-time-homebuyer-credit-questions-and-answers-homes-purchased-in-2008](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/first-time-homebuyer-credit-questions-and-answers-homes-purchased-in-2008) , which states:

If you (transferor spouse) transfer your home as part of a divorce settlement, your former spouse (transferee spouse) who keeps the home is responsible for making the rest of the repayments and you are not responsible for making any remaining repayments. 

This seems to be pretty clear and confirms that the IRS is correct and I am responsible for repaying the full $500/yr.  I'm just looking to see if someone more familiar with this can confirm so I can be absolutely sure I'm reading things correctly.

personalfinance,Lump sum payment into mortgage combined with recasting - is my reasoning sound here?,"I have $60,000 cash right now that I'm looking to invest. One option is obviously to put it into the stock market and get the expected historical 10% return (before inflation), but of course with significant exposure to near- and mid-term variance.

Alternatively, I could put the money into my mortgage for an effective risk-free 4% return (the mortgage has a 4.0% interest rate). This significantly beats the risk-free return of ~2% of T-bills, which seems like a solid investment. And I should note that outside of my house, ~90% of my assets are in stocks, so this would represent some diversification as well.

But the problem with that is once I make that payment, that money and the 4% 'returns' are no longer liquid, effectively unavailable until I sell the house or pay off the mortgage. And while I do have what I believe to be a sufficient emergency fund, every additional available dollar reduces personal cash flow risk. Plus who know what near future opportunities might arise.

However, what if I can make that $60,000 mortgage payment give at least some immediate payback? Enter the mortgage recast, which is something I hadn't heard of until recently. A mortgage recast re-amortizes your loan at the same interest rate and same pay-off date as your current loan. This does exactly nothing if you've always just made the minimum payments, but if you've made significant extra payments, your monthly payment will go down. And unlike a refinance, which will cost thousands of dollars, a recast is typically between free and a few hundred bucks when combined with a large lump sum payment (it's $250 for my lender).

Another important details of my situation: $60k is also (not-so-coincidentally) the exact amount of money that would remove my PMI of $90/mo. Getting rid of PMI would be an effective 1.8% yearly return on my $60k.

Add that to the 4.0% mortgage interest and this early payment is effectively the same as a 5.8% return on a $60k investment. Guaranteed. With the interest coming back to me monthly as cash flow and the principal being returned when I sell the house. That seems like a great investment opportunity.

An alternative is a refinance combined with the bulk $60k payment which will give me further cash flow benefits ($25-$125 depending on rate, 3.5-4.0%), but even if I get rates at 3.5% the breakeven return on fees is right around the time I expect to be moving, which is ~7 years.

Anyways, in conclusion it seems like putting the $60K into my mortgage and combining with a recast is a very good opportunity for me. That said, I'm not super confident that my calculations and reasoning are sound, which is why I'm putting this idea up for critique here.",finance

I then went to a wholesale lender, who explained things a bit more clearly (or seemingly, atleast) and then offered a rate of 3.125 at -.875, in turn taking my closing costs (with them, my closing costs were under 6k) down to $2090, a much more manageable number.

Well we applied for a mortgage through Quicken Loans. They told me my TU score was in the low 500’s, Experian was mid 500’s, and Equifax was mid 600’s. Why Experian themselves (I pay for credit monitoring) tells me that their own score and the other two bureaus’ are between 100-130 points higher is beyond me. 

My questions: How do I even accurately check my credit if Experian is reporting their OWN credit score as 100 points higher than what lenders see? How am I supposed to even hope to track my my credit better if the bureau itself is reporting something so different from what lenders are seeing? I have a credit card and I’m keeping balances low. I’m making all payments on time. I’m an authorized user on one of his cards. I’ve recently paid off a bunch of charged off accounts that I was working with a debt assistance company on. Is there anything else I can do to help increase my credit?  

(Everything beyond this point is a total rant) 

So after hearing my credit scores, I’m told by the loan adviser that the FHA only requires a 580 for a 3.5% down payment, and I’m thinking, “Great! We’re in business!” But nope - he didn’t notice our student loans. Between my husband and I, we have about $450,000 in student loan debt. He is a clinical psychologist which requires 8+ years of schooling, and I’m halfway through an MBA. About 75% of the debt is his, but obviously that leaves a good chunk for me as well. These degrees aren’t cheap. 

Apparently FHA loans count 1% of your total loan balance as your monthly payment amount, which completely tanked our DTI. We use income based repayment, and between our car payments, credit cards, etc. we SHOULD be netting out at a DTI of 20% or so, but instead this drives it up to over 50%. 

This means our only option is a conventional loan, as some do only take your true monthly payment into consideration for your DTI, but with my (apparently) horrendous credit, that isn’t even an option for me. The only other route would be for just my spouse to go on the loan, but that cuts our income in half essentially, reducing the loan amount we can be approved for dramatically. 

Our combined incomes are well over six figures. We went to college, earned valuable degrees, worked ourselves to exhaustion to earn a better life down the road, and we’re ready to move on to the next phase of our life. We have enough income to pay TWICE our student loan payments, a mortgage with a decent interest rate, property tax, and all other expenses while still saving 30% of our income. It’s seriously tragic to me that student loan companies will shell out $450,000 in debt to students in their late teens and early twenties, but then mortgage companies turn around and deny you for a house cheaper than that based on that student loan debt. 

Basically, he and I will continue to rent until my credit improves and we can put in a joint application to a lender. But I need to be able to accurately check my credit in order to do that.",finance
personalfinance,"Questions about the (new?) online W-4 calculator, including in the context of a new job","I am taking on a new part time job (high school coach) and was trying to fill out the W-4 for that. I have a job, my wife has a job, and this would be my second job. Had some questions about the online W-4 calculator...

I wasn’t sure how to fill out that second job wages/taxes withheld section since... it’s a new job and I haven’t received a paycheck yet! I know I’m just getting $2K for the season, so I chose paycheck date as 1/31/20, fed tax withheld $0, paid monthly, $2K. Is there something else I should put here instead? Seems like a chicken/egg situation... how are you supposed to complete a W-4 for a new job where you haven’t yet received a paycheck??

I filled in all of the other stuff, which took a while. The results were that I would owe a few thousand. With the refund slider set to $0, I got the following:

First job (highest wages):

“To get your desired refund amount, you will need ... $138 more than your current tax withholding”

Second job (new one): “... $0 more...”

Spouse’s job: “... $9 less...”

If I do $138 - $9 = $129 x 22 remaining pay periods = $2,838. 

$129 x 21 remaining pay periods = $2,709

The calculated shortage that I would have to pay is between those two numbers, so depending on how long it takes to for new W-4s to affect future withholding, this all makes perfect sense.

Now if I download the personalized W-4 forms for each of those 3 jobs, the amounts it populates for 4(c) don’t match up with numbers above. They are:

First job: $100

Second job: $0

Spouse’s job: $73

4(c) says “Extra withholding. Enter any additional tax you want withheld each pay period.” So shouldn’t this match up with the numbers displayed above?

$100 + $73 = $173 x 22 = $3,806

$173 x 21 = $3,633

Why is it so much higher? Won’t this result in a refund of around $1K?

Back to my original motivation... do I really just fill out the personal info in Step 1 and then write 0 in Box 4(c) and leave everything else blank for the new W-4 for my new job?? I’d been meaning to adjust our withholdings anyway so it wasn’t a complete waste of time, but sheesh!

My husband (29) and I (30) are selling our house and moving into my parents house with our kids (1, 3, &amp; 5) while we look for another. We’re going to get $50k out of our house on top of the ~$10k we have in our savings account right now so we’ll have a little over $60k in our savings after all is said and done. 

We won’t have many bills while we’re at my parents and have no debt other than my car loan which is $19k. We currently pay $650 a month and the interest rate on the car loan is 2%. We already max out both of our IRA’s and my husband contributes 12% to his 401k through work as well as buying company stock each week. I am a stay at home mom. 

While we’re living at my parents house we’ll be able to save about $7-8k a month after paying for food, gas, cell phone and maybe a couple other small bills I’m forgetting.

*I am over/pre-paying on an income-based repayment plan that sits currently around \~$410/mo.*

**CURRENT PAYMENT STRATEGY**

I am allocating \~$3,000/mo from my take-home and targeting the highest interest loans first (as evidenced by the lower accumulated interest on the 7.65% loan. Additionally, I plan on throwing around 90% of my stock sale proceeds (\~15-20k depending on stock performance) every 6 months into the balance as well.

My next stock vest will be tomorrow, and given the great performance recently, I will get around $22,500 after taxes are taken out from the sale -- of which, I will pay off the 7.65% loan in its entirety. I am debating on whether to put the remainder into my emergency funds (or allocate some of it to the 6.96% loan).

**REFINANCE OR NO? Specific questions below...**

***Important*** \-- I am aware of the loss of federal protections if I were to refinance through a private lender like SoFi/Earnest. While I am currently on an income-based plan, I was and am still ""over""-paying on the loans. The purpose of staying on IBR is for the worst-case scenario.

I am exploring options and want to weigh the pros and cons beyond just ""losing federal benefits."" I am not really using those benefits. Whether I want to refinance or not will be weighing the value between the money saved vs. peace of mind from having a fallback on IBR if things go wrong.

Currently, I am in a stable job, and I'm very happy. But, I don't take current employment for granted and so I do value those federal benefits (but that has a dollar value attached to it too).

So, I know with my current way of doing things, I can chunk down my loans within 5 years. Probably a year or two earlier even. However, my exploration of refinancing options made me wonder if I'd save a noticeable amount of money by negotiating a lower rate.

For example, I only did an initial rate offering calculation from SoFi and was offered an interest rate of **4.48% for a 10-year term**. According to their website, this means a monthly due of **\~$2,300**. *Of course, assuming I am fairly consistent with my payment plan, I will be overpaying on this using my monthly salary and bi-annual stock vests.*

*Personally, I don't want to take on the lower rates/terms because my monthly expenses may fluctuate (often unpredictably with 2 kids and a home I own). So I am moving forward with the assumption that if I were to refinance, it would be around that interest rate.*

**Specific questions:**

(1) Currently, my loans' interest rates are applied on the principal only (simple interest, not compounding on the total balance). As I already have a sizable amount of accumulated interest, I stand to be applying the newly refinance rate on the total (via capitalization). As far as I know, SoFi's calculations on how much I would save if I refinanced with their rates does NOT take that into consideration (it never asked for the principal/interest breakdown). As such, I don't know how much exactly I would save. **Is refinancing still worth the capitalization?**

(2) Because the interest rates of my existing loans are so varied and split apart, I can individually knock out the highest interest loans (though there is a literal $60,000 block that will take about a year to get through at 6.96% right after I close up the 7.65% loan). Whereas, if I refinance into a single loan I can't do that. **How much money do I save between my current snowball method and refinance using my existing payment plan above?**

I realize that I may be asking too much from everyone here -- **I don't mind opinions of those who would do quick ""back of the napkin"" calculations and give me a one-liner on whether I should refinance or not.** I partly want to get a feel of the temperature of my current situation from a third party -- to see whether I am thinking through this right.

**What I am NOT after is how to better allocate my finances so I can pay it off sooner or things like that.** There are reasons for my current payment plan and I think its fairly aggressive for a single-income household w/ mortgage. I appreciate the advice given here in this area on this subreddit but I am just seeking some answers to those who might have a better read on my situation by numbers.

Thank you so much in advance!

**TLDR --** Single-income household w/ wife + 2 kids, \~$230k in student loans with varying interest rates from 5.16% to 7.65%. Accumulated \~45k in interest. Taking into consideration that refinancing = capitalization of that interest, should I refinance to terms around 4.5%? Math calculations are desired, but will take quick advice too. Want to gauge the temperature of the situation (sanity check).",finance

personalfinance,Need help figuring out what the best ROI will be between negating debt and owning a home.,"Hi all long time lurker first time posting so any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Currently having a hard time figuring out what the best path would be towards a sound financial future, apologies for a long post. Tl;dr at bottom.

A little backstory - over the last 2-3 years the careers of my wife's(31f) and I(30m) have finally taken off and the new income has allowed us to think of new strategies for our future. Due to the high stakes in front of us I'm having a hard time deciding on any one path, afraid that committing to the wrong one could set us back later. We have been living below our means most of our time out here in LA (est. 8 years) renting and keeping our living expenses below a 3rd of our take home pay, usually around closer to a quarter. The only reason we move is because rent gets too expensive and we keep getting priced out. My wife walks and ubers to work now to curb costs, she used to use a bicycle but our new apartment is not in a bike friendly area.

Breakdown of current finances and  financial plans at the bottom. We live in LA and I drive roughly 50 Miles daily, I bought a motorcycle to split the driving and lower maintenance/gas costs. I have owned it for 3 years and it has paid itself off already in savings.

- gas [about $8 bi weekly, [est. 208/y]
- insurance [132/y]
- registration [100/y]
- est total - 540 - 740

**uber costs:**

- $30/d - We carpool as much as possible so I would say 1/3rd of the year [est. 600/y]

**Rent:**

- 2,341.67/m - if we sign another year it would go up to 2,498.24
- total $28,100/y or $29,979 for 2020

**Living expenses:**

- 1k/m average across meals and outings
- 600/y fitness

**Debt:**

- No CC debt, we pay it off every month, we only buy what we can afford. Most purchases are from amazon using our co-use amazon prime card, we buy everything on that card, every month or so we get about 80-100 cash back. 

**income:**

- total $11,650/m
- pretax 230k/y combined
- I contribute 10% of my income to a 401k with 3% matching

**Savings:**

We have been saving between 20-50% of our take home over the years to try and buy a house

- 25k emergency fund
- 65k in 401k
- 6k in Roth IRA
- 70k in savings - 10k in checking's for bills

**Student Loans:**

A little background - I was making my monthly payments to Navient roughly 2.3k/m thinking I was making a dent in the loan. stupid me did not watch the loan properly because I wish I had caught on earlier that over 65% of those payments were purely going to interest and over years i had barely dinged the principle. Not anymore, a Sofi refinance later I plan on being very aggressive to get rid of this debt as quickly as possible. 

- ~~over 80k in loans paid off for my wife~~
- I just refinanced a 200k parent plus loan under my name from %8 interest rate to %4.87, 7 year term
- est student loan payment [3k/m]

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**THE GOAL: pay off 200k of student loans as quickly as possible and still live a somewhat decent life**

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Plan A: CONTINUE RENTING** - With this plan things remain consistent and we can guarantee similar spending habits for the next 5 years but then we are signing up for about 30k/yr + 7% rent raises every year =/, of which we would never see a dime back. Then we hunker down and try to snowball the loan down, we would take 70k in savings and throw it at the loans to drive the principle down to 130k, Any and all extra income(not touching the e-fund) would go towards loans, between 5-7k monthly. This could include bonuses which could add more funds. The goal would be to be completely debt free in 3-5 years. The idea behind this one is that in 5 years our earning potential will be going up, possibly to 270k/y and would make regaining our funds back by the time we are roughly 37.... in this scenario only the debt goes.

**Plan B: PURCHASE A CONDO/TOWNHOME** - Start to build equity, looking at comparable rates to what we are living off currently. Pre approved for 600k but looking closer to 400k, with a 20% down our monthly expenses would remain around 2.3k. Properties in that range have gained gained anywhere from 50-100k in value over 5 years. This plan would drain our savings, thus removing the massive blow to the loan extending the pay off time closer to the full term which is 7 years. But this could potentially earn us a small amount of equity into a property we could then rent out for passive income in the future. Our quality of life would improve significantly since it is LA we have lived 4 years in a studio apartment and 3 in a 1 bedroom, never more than 900 sq ft. Most homes we look at have 2-3 bedrooms, 2 car garages and 1,100+ sq ft. Though it would add miles to my commute and would ultimately end up with needing to purchase a second vehicle thus increasing our overall monthly expenses as well. 

**Plan C: PURCHASE A MANUFACTURED HOME** - This seems like the best option overall but the stigma and depreciation on manufactured homes seem scary long term. We can potentially purchase a 200k home with 3-4 bedrooms 1700+ sq ft, where we can comfortable put 20% down AND also pay down the loan with the remaining savings. The monthly payments would be a fraction of what we pay now including the plot rent, about 1.3-1.5k/m. Obviously utilities and maintenance costs would go up due to how big the home is but even then it seems reasonable. A second vehicle would definitely be needed as well. This, in theory, would even allow us to snowball the loans and still continue investing in our 401k's comfortably. THE FEAR - we pay into it for 5-7 years, it depreciates a lot or we are incapable of selling it, we have seen some be on the market for close to a year(the stigma of buying a mobile home is strong in LA). We do not want to pay down a student loan and then end up with a manufactured home loan as an anchor immediately after...sigh. What we hope is that even if we sell at a loss that we can reclaim some money where as renting gets us no money. 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


**IN CONCLUSION** - we have been working ourselves very hard for the better part of 8 years. Pay seems great but we do not feel wealthy at all because all we have been doing for close to a decade is try and pay down student loans. We don't wear expensive clothes and we don't drive luxury vehicles because we can't justify anything until we feel this burden lift from our shoulders. Gotta be honest guys, this feels like its never going to end. Typing this and knowing that we have almost as much time ahead as when we started working before we can rid ourselves of debt is soul crushing. We also cannot foresee kids until the debt is gone, because on paper a kid makes absolutely no sense right now. We can see the light, faint and small, at the end of the tunnel and if any one can offer any insight on how to navigate this, we would be sincerely appreciate it. 

**Tl;dr : rent&gt;pay off loans&gt; crawl out of debt in 5 years with no equity but no debt OR Buy Townhome&gt;pay off loans in 7 yrs&gt; crawl out of debt with an investment property. OR Buy Mobile Home&gt; Pay off loan &gt; crawl out of debt 3-5 years with a home that might not sell or appreciate.**",finance

A quick Google suggests some people pay for everything on their CC then pay off the amount on time each month which appears to have some reward or benefit for them. This only seems to make sense if you're not paying purchase interest and the annual fee is quite low.

personalfinance,Debt Snowball Interest Rate Confusion (Budgeting Newbie),"**First off**, I have an old personal (I guess payday) installment loan with a ""payoff"" balance of $3,065.75. I pay $256.82 twice a month for a total monthly payment of $513.64.

On the loan website, it says it will be paid off in November 2020. However, when I go to plug it into my debt snowball (which I use [undebt.it](https://undebt.it)) with the listed APR of 159.56% from the loan contract, it says that my projected payoff date is March 2021.

Am I wrong for thinking that it *should* be paid off around November 2020 because of the snowball from my other debts being paid off? Or am I doing something wrong with the APR?

**Secondly**, I have a line of credit with Affirm. My purchase total was $240.36. It says the APR is 29.92% and my account details state that the interest adds $40.73 totaling up to $281.09. My monthly payment minimum is $23.42. When figuring out my snowball, am I correct for plugging in my actual balance as the $240.36 with the interest? Or do I put in the $281.09 with a 0% interest rate since my minimum payment accounts for the added interest?

* After a decline that took the major averages well off their Tuesday session highs, U.S. stock futures point to a strong Wednesday open as investors become slightly less concerned about the coronavirus. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq did manage to eke out record closes Tuesday despite the fall from their highs, and both are up in six of the past seven sessions. (CNBC)
* On today’s economic calendar, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will be back on Capitol Hill today, this time before the Senate Banking Committee in the second day of his semi-annual testimony on monetary policy. The Mortgage Bankers Association is out with its weekly report on mortgage applications at 10 a.m. ET, while the Energy Department releases its usual Wednesday look at oil inventories at 10:30 a.m. ET. (CNBC)
* Bitcoin hits highest price this year, above $10,000 as Powell discusses cryptocurrencies (CNBC)
* Powell says Fed ‘closely monitoring’ coronavirus for hit to China and the world (CNBC)

* Shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) were losing about a quarter of their value in the premarket after the home goods retailer said same-store sales were down a greater-than-expected 5.4% in December and January. The company blamed increased promotional pricing, lower store traffic and issues with inventory management. (Reuters)
* Shares of Lyft (LYFT) were down over 4% in the premarket despite a strong fourth-quarter report. The company’s earnings beat estimates on revenue and active riders and a lower-than-expected loss per share. However, Lyft did not give an update on its profitability timeline as its competitor Uber (UBER) did during its earnings report last week. (CNBC)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders will win New Hampshire’s Democratic primary, NBC News projected, setting him up near the top of a fractured presidential field.

* The flu-like coronavirus that has sickened more than 44,500 people in over two dozen countries now has a name: COVID-19. The new virus that emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, China, likely originated in bats and then jumped to an “intermediate host” before infecting humans, World Health Organization officials said. (CNBC)

* CDC says ‘mix-up’ led to early release of coronavirus patient in California (CNBC)
* Nissan filed a civil lawsuit against former Chairman Carlos Ghosn today, seeking an initial amount of $90 million. The claimed damages are linked to Ghosn’s “breach of fiduciary duty as a company director and his misappropriation of Nissan’s resources and assets,” the Japanese automaker said in a statement. (CNBC)
Airbnb reportedly lost money last year as costs outpaced revenue, casting doubt on the company’s private valuation and the timing of its planned public debut this year. The home-sharing start-up reportedly lost $322 million over the first nine months of last year.
* Google (GOOGL) today will seek to overturn the first of three hefty EU antitrust fines at Europe’s second-highest court in a landmark case that could determine how EU enforcers take on U.S. tech giants for abuse of market power. In the U.S., the FTC said it will examine prior acquisitions by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. (Reuters &amp; CNBC)

personalfinance,Federal tax refund taking too long,"Severance pay plus new job bumped us to about 220k last year. Itemized, one child. No actc or eic. 5% charitable contributions. Filed Jan. 27, return accepted same day. And then nothing. I know it’s 21 days and part of the refund is an overpayment of social security tax but state refund came in 5 days. Anyone else’s return taking so long?",finance
personalfinance,Extra To Mortgage or Elsewhere?,"Greetings!

I'm electively taking a substantial pay cut to move to a more engaging line of work. My wife (32) and I (33) recently started putting extra towards our mortgage to make up for low downpayment - and I'd love the sub's thoughts on if that's the right choice. I've followed the roadmap this

Background
- 33 and 32 yr old with no kids and no desire for ones
- Live in DC Suburbs
- Wife - 156k/yr Federal PM
- Me - Will be 97k/yr (down from 125)

Retirement:
- Both maxing out 401k/TSP and backdoor Roth

Debt:
- 3 yrs into 30 yr $370,000 mortgage at 4.5%, now paying an extra $500/month. Did a 3% downpayment and would like to gain equity
- $39,000 left student loans (4 yr left) paid off 50k of high-interest ones, max now at 3.5%.

Assets:
$75,000 liquid-ish savings/emergency fund (We're YNABers and have 50k earmarked as true earth-ending emergency)
$225,000 in 401ks/Roth IRAs 

We don't really have any goals in the next 5-7 years, perhaps a rental property someday in the future. We've had a rapid rise in incomes in the past 4 years that has allowed us to max out retirement. I don't see FI/RE in our future given the CoL in DC and the fact that we don't like feel strapped. 

Continue with the extra mortgage payment with the lower salary, or redirect? 

Many thanks!",finance

So my wife and I got married this year and are both engineers (salary \~80k each).  We updated our status with our employers but didn't add any additional withholding (Married Filing Jointly, 0 allowances).  This resulted in us having to pay 1500 taxes this year on our Federal.  TurboTax is putting out the 1040-ES forms for Estimated Tax Payments for this year.  My question is if we update our W-4 to have more withholding, do we need to make these payments? Or regardless do these need to be made?  Very confusing since TurboTax doesn't really give any information about these payments.  Thanks in advanced ya'll!",finance

personalfinance,Condo refinance--feedback,"Hey all!  I've always gotten very good info on here.  I'd appreciate hearing people's perspective, particularly if this loan agent is being a bit shady.

Original amount: $390,925,

30 year conventional with PMI.

**Refinance offer**

Property value: $548,000 (done without a physical assessment)

Loan amount: #363,500

30 year conventional

3.5 interest rate/3.553 APR

Here's where it gets interesting and why my spidey senses started tingling.  So the loan officer sent me the offer to review yesterday, but I did not have time to review it until last night.  This morning he emails me and says that rates went up overnight.  His message to me: ""I will have them resend with updated figures. 3.5% has $672 in points.. I will have them send the 3.625% with $1,450 in lender credit. This will at least make the transaction cheaper for you.""

Thoughts?  Is the guy using pressure tactics? Is this a worthwhile refinance even with the 3.625% rate?  I'm not sure I understand the ""$672 points"" and ""$1,450 in lender credit.""

Edit: It's come up in a couple of replies.  I did my due diligence and got rates from my retirement company, Charles Schwab, and USAA.  My retirement company has had the lowest rate.  The quote I got from them is currently *NOT* locked.",finance

Monthly payments: $1118 rent, $370 car, $800 combined minimum credit cards, electric, phones, internet, etc. $5.4K auto loan matures April 2021. Might be replacing the $6K sedan with a new-to-us truck/suv in December.

Given the numbers, is home ownership feasible in 2020? Our estimated budget is $225K but we're window shopping move-in ready town homes at $200K. Are we jumping the gun? First time buyers, local gov employee, not military, no children.

personalfinance,Tough decision on investment property in my building in Boston with negative cash flow.,For my current situation I live in a duplex unit in Boston (Brighton). I own the lower unit already and have owned it for about 5 years and have appreciated quite a bit in value. The building itself was originally a two family before being converted to condos in 2009. The current owners in the upper unit (3 Bed + 2 Bath 2000 SQft) want to sell to me and we have an offer to purchase for $700K. The potential plan would be to rent out the upper unit. Getting a loan will not be an issue but as we would be putting 25% down we would need a jumbo investment mortgage. It seems that interest rates for 30 fixed are from 3.9-4.25 %. After running some numbers the range I would pay for mortgage+property taxes on a 30 year fixed would be $3100-$3400. If I did a 5/1 ARM it would range around 3.4% and be around $2890-$3000 but would likely have a $9000-$1000 fee in 5 years when we refinance. Current ranges on similar properties in our neighborhood are from $2800 (crap holes) to $3400 (brand new luxury units). I feel like we could get $3050-$3100 comfortably though I doubt rents in Boston will rise too much as they have recently plateaued a bit. On top of  that we did have an inspection done and we see at least $6000-$8000 worth of projects that need to be fixed up on that units part of the building. Given the fact that we would likely have negative cash flow for at least 2-3 years and the extra maintenance work that HAS to be done in that period is it worth it or should I pass?,finance

personalfinance,How do I Handle this Balance Transfer Card Dilemma?,"I have decided to be more aggressive in paying down my debt (\~$7,709.50, as I write this) and I’ve been attracted to a balance transfer card as a way for me to avoid the high interest rates I’d be paying month over month. Most of my debt is consolidated to a Chase Sapphire Preferred card (\~$6,603.47) and the remaining at a regional bank, BMO Harris (\~1,106.03). I have not missed a payment and have a credit score in the 750s. Stats below for each Card. 

I have been approved for a Citi Simplicity card but for only a credit limit of $2,000. I have reached out and asked for a credit limit extension of $5,709.50 - I was told being as exact as possible helps with these sorts of requests. I have not activated this card yet because I’m waiting on the decision to extend my credit limit.   
As I wait for Citi’s decision on the credit extension, I receive a notice from Chase stating that I have been approved for the Chase Unlimited Freedom card. The Unlimited Freedom card comes with a credit limit of $8,000, more than enough to cover my debt. 

Because I pay $600/mo in credit card payments anyways, I would be able to pay off my debt in &lt;13mo, so before the 15mo of 0% APR expires. 

Do I take the Chase offer on their balance card? Since the Citi card has already been “opened” I could just keep it but would acquiring the Chase card impact my credit score drastically or is the hit ultimately worth it? 

**Chase Sapphire Preferred:**

* Debt: \~$6,603.47
* Monthly Payment: $300
* APR: 21.49%

**BMO:**

* Debt: \~$1,06.03
* Monthly Payment: $300
* APR: 15.49%

**Citi Simplified:**

* Credit Limit: $2,000
* APR: 0% for 21mo
* Balance Transfer Fee: 5%
* Late Fee: NO

**Chase Unlimited Freedom:**

* Credit Limit: $8,000
* APR: 0% for 15mo
* Balance Transfer Fee: 3%
* Late Fee: YES ($39)",finance
personalfinance,Worried paying off student loans completely will hurt my house-buying prospects,"Sounds dumb and probably is (I hope), but here's my thought process.

I'm trying to buy a house in about 3 years. My credit score is decent right now, 760, but I'm worried about how that might change. 

I'm paying off my student loans and plan to have them gone in 2 years. In total I have 9 separate loans (5 federal, 4 through USBank/Firstmark) over 10 years old. Besides that I only have two credit cards each about 2.5 years old, and a car loan about 2 years old as well (which will also be paid off by house time).

My worry is that I will pay off my loans (sweet!), but in doing so the average age of my credit will go down quite a bit (shit!). Is this true or am I missing something? If it is true, any idea how much average age of credit affects your score, especially the way mortgage lenders look at it? Would it be beneficial to plan on buying while my accounts are still open, but have a small amount left on them?",finance

personalfinance,Woke up to a 1700 charge on my debit card I didnt make,"First off I wanna say I'm not sure if this is the correct sub to post this too if there is a better one I'll delete this post here and repost it there. strap in kinda a long post


Anyways for context/background information I'm 19M / 2nd semester freshmen in college and yesterday i woke up to a text from my bank saying I had a charge that had been made for 1700 from google mountview California (I live in kentucky) and wondered if it was me I of course said no and immediately called my bank to let them know so. They cancelled my card and said they couldn't begin the despute until the charge had gone fully through (I asked them why they couldn't just stop it they said it was debit or something along the lines like that so they couldn't)  they recommended me to call google in the mean time to cancel the payment there. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Google I find out that they had ordered 2 google pixel 4 xls and they lady I was on the phone with attempted to email a form or something never got it even though she sent it 3 times apparently.



fast forward to today early morning, I wake up check my account see the charge has done fully through and call my bank again and say can you despute the charge and they say yes and tell me they're gonna begin the investigation and will let me know something within 10 business days.




fast forward 4 hours later (basically the present I found about this 2 hours ago as I'm writing this)  my mom (who I told about the fraud and what happened and what they bought all the good details)  calls me and says a FedEx had a package with my name on it that she had to sign for (as I mentioned before im a college student and I live on campus 3 and a half hours away from my home address) and she opened it and low and. behold the 2 google 4 pixel xls were in the package. now this I'm obviously quite confused by because how are you smart enough to steal my details but incompetent enough to not ship them to your house or po box. I automatically assumed it's because since it was my card and my home address is linked to said card it automatically shipped there? or since my card is linked to my google account and google has my address on file that's why.



and this brings us to the present where my friend has suggested it was no mistake at all, that they intended to send it my address and that by doing so it would be harder to be proven as fraud. and when I go to ship it back ups / fedex shows up to return it bh the return address is actually the criminals address or their po box. and they went on to say dont ever let a package you didnt order be returned by a carrier you need to return it in person. this never even crossed my mind I had just thought the criminal was a idiot but this makes sense. now since I am 3 and a half hours away from home my mom is going to be the one to return the phones and she obviously can't return them in person if it's from california because we live in kentucky.


would like any advice you have on what to do, things to do next, how to get the phones back to google safely and my money back. I have not informed my bank of my new discovering of the phones being at my home address although Im going too later today after I get out of class.",finance

When I was offered the job there was a promise of monthly bonuses which never materialized, and after a particularly huge delivery milestone the owner showed up at my house late one night and handed me an envelope with $3000 in cash thanking me for my hard work. He did the same for another employee and told us both taxes would be handled. Neither of us examined our pay stubs in enough detail because when I entered my W2 I was surprised to find I owed a significant amount. I went back and saw that the accountant had issued a ""paycheck"" for $3000, with no deposit, and withheld social security and Medicare amounts but $0 federal. It's my understanding that even if he hadn't verbally promised to handle the taxes he's required by law to withhold the taxes? Not sure how to even go about handling this. I've confirmed with the other employee the same thing happened with his pay stub.",finance

personalfinance,Pay off debt while trying to save for a house or keep the debt?,"Currently 27 yrs, been at my job for about 2 years and since I’ve been there I’ve managed to pay off almost $10k in credit card debt I accumulated in my younger years which I’m super happy and proud of.

Current debts:
$3k on my car (6.5% apr) 
$2500 on one credit card and it currently has 0% interest until I think August this year. This is my only CC debt now
$21k in student loans, with varying interests between 2.5% and 6.5%

My spouse (who has no debt) and I want to buy a house within the next year. I have enough in savings to pay off the car and the credit card completely, but my spouse thinks it’s better to leave the CC balance there until the 0% interest ends and then pay it off. But my savings account has such a low interest rate anyway does that even matter?

The car loan has kind of a high interest at 6.5%, got the loan 2 years ago and I’ve paid off about $8k of it already and it’s sooooo tempting for me to just pay off the rest. BUT I’ve read that when trying for a mortgage it’s better to have a diversified loan portfolio so keeping the car loan active with a balance is better until we’ve gotten the mortgage. 

So with all this said is it better to just pay off these debts in full with my savings, increase my student loan payments and then just save as much as possible for the down payment on the home? Or keep those balances there for now?",finance

Assuming my home has enough equity to get all or almost all of it with either a HELOC or a home equity loan at a lower interest rate seems like a good idea. However, I do not personally like where I live for a variety of reasons and would ideally be looking to sell and move within a year. 

I will note that aside from the pure numbers aspect, I personally prize the freedom of being able to walk away from a debt in a crisis (I can walk away from my house, but I cannot walk away from my student loan).

All of these ranges from countless debits ranging from 42.42 to 860.00.

investing,The Race to Zero and Boom/Bust,"I’ve held a theory, that I’ve somewhat mentioned in other posts/comments, that recent actions by large, online discount brokers is setting the stage for a potential speculation boom/bust cycle.

No, I’m not calling a market top. No, I’m not calling for a recession. However, I think there are a few different factors that have contributed to the recent surge (if you will) in equity prices. And no... no Fed talk here.

First, the actions I am speaking about in the first paragraph are zero commission models. This was of course popularized by the start-up Robinhood but in a race to hold onto/obtain assets, other brokers have followed suit. I do not find it coincidental that there has been an incredible surge in options volume ever since the major brokers moved away from trading commissions (there are still small amounts of commissions for options, but no trading fees).

Additionally, retail money funds reported by the ICI on a weekly basis have ballooned from $700 billion in 2018 to $1,000 billion recently. This, to me, can be attributed to a two factors: 1) a general confidence improvement in the economy and ones own personal financial situation and 2) heavy marketing by brokers around higher interest paid on idle cash balances.

Lastly, and I have no data to support this part, but given fees from brokerage firms are racing to zero, one has to wonder what standards are being applied to retail clients applying for margin. What could be of concern, but again no data points at present, is a reduction in standards firms may have related to accepting margin applications. As the commission model is dead, margin interest becomes ever-more important for generating revenues for brokers.

Forex,Tips From A Lifer,"I’ve been reading these posts on an off for quite some time now and it saddened me to see someone had recently posted their “I quit the game” statement. We all walk through fire to stand in the green valley...and the journey has to be made on foot. And alone. And it’s tough. 

In response, I wanted to add a list of pointers for people starting out in this insane game and to address what I’ve learned from over a decade of trading Forex. It’s long-ish but it’s based on reality and not a bunch of meaningless retail junk systems and “insider knowledge” by nitwits on YouTube or some 19-year old “whiz kid” who apparently makes ten billion dollars a week with a mystical set-up that’ll only cost you $1,999 to buy! 

I became a profitable trader by keeping everything simple. I lost thousands when I started out, but I look back now and realise how easily I could’ve avoided those losses. 

Keep Everything Simple. 

For the sake of disclosure, I worked for Morgan Stanley for over a decade in fixed income but learned almost everything I know from the forex guys whom I got to know as good friends. They *make* markets but there’s still a lot to learn from them as a small fry trader. I got into all this as a hobby after annoying the traders with questions, and all these years later it still pays me. There are still occasional nightmare accidents but they’re far rarer to the point where they don’t affect my ROI. 

Possibly the most clear statement I could make about Forex trading in the large institutional setting is actually a pretty profound one: Forex traders are not what you think they are: every single forex trader I ever worked with (and who lasted the test of time) had the exact same set of personality traits: 1. NOT ONE of them was a gung-ho high-five loudmouth, 2. Every single one of them analysed their mistakes to the point of obsession, 3. They were bookish and not jocks, 4. They had the humility to admit that many early errors were the result of piss-poor planning. The loudmouths last a year and are gone. 

Guys who last 5, 10, 20 years in a major finance house on the trading floor are nothing like the absurd 1980s Hollywood images you see on your tv; they’re the perfect opposite of that stereotype. The absolute best I ever met was a studious Irish-Catholic guy from Boston who was conscientious, helpful, calm, and utterly committed to one thing: learning from every single error of judgement. To quote him: “Losing teaches you far more than winning”.

Enough of that. These points are deliberately broad. Here goes:

1. Know The Pairs. It amazes me to see countless small account traders speak as though “systems” work across all pairs. They don’t. Trading GBP/CHF is an entirely different beast to trading CHF/JPY. If you don’t know the innate properties of the CHF market or the JPY or the interplay between the AUD and NZD etc then leave them alone until you do. —There’s no rush— Don’t trade pairs until you are clear on what drives ‘commodity currencies’, or what goes on behind currencies which are easily manipulated, or currencies which simply tend to range for months on end instead of having clear trends. Every pair has its own benefits and drawbacks. Google “Tips on trading the JPY” etc etc etc and get to know the personality of these currencies. They’re just products like any other....Would you buy a Honda without knowing a single thing about the brand or its engine or its durability? So why trade a currency you know nothing about? 

2. Indicators are only telling you what you should be able to see in front of you: PRICE AND MARKET STRUCTURE. Take everything off your charts and simply ask one question: What do I see happening right here and right now? What time frame do I see it on? If you can’t spot a simple consolidation, an uptrend, or a downtrend on a quick high-versus-low time frame scan then no indicator on the planet will help you. 

3. Do you know why momentum indicators work on clear trends but are often a complete disaster on ranges? If not, why not? Do you know why such indicators are losing you tons of trades on low TFs? Do you actually understand the simple mathematics of any indicator? If the answer to these questions is “no” then why are you using these things and piling on indicator after indicator after indicator until you have some psychedelic disco on your screen that looks like an intergalactic dogfight in Star Wars? Keep it simple. Know thy indicator.

4. Risk:Reward Addiction. The greatest profit killer. So you set up your stops and limits at 1:1.5 or whatever and say “That’s me done” only to come back and see that your limit was missed by a soul-crushing 5 pips before reversing trend to cost you $100, $200, $1000. So you say “Ah but the system is fine”. Guys...this isn’t poker; it doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. Get over your 1:1.5 addiction —The Market Does Not Owe You 50 Pips— Which leads to the next point which, frankly, is what has allowed me to make money consistently for my entire trading life...

5. YOU WILL NEVER GO BROKE TAKING A PROFIT. So you want to take that 50-pip profit in two hours because some analyst says it’ll happen or because your trend lines say it has to happen. You set your 1:1.5 order. “I’ll check where I’m at in an hour” you say. An hour later you see you’re up 18 pips and you feel you’re owed more by now. “If I close this trade now I could be missing out on a stack”. So what?! Here’s an example: I trade in sterling. I was watching GBP climb against it’s post-GDP flop report and once I was up £157 I thought “This is going to start bouncing off resistance all morning and I don’t need the hassle of riding the rollercoaster all day long”. So I closed it, took the £157, went to make breakfast. Came back shortly afterwards and looked at the chart and saw that I could’ve made about £550 if I’d trusted myself. Do I care? Absolutely not...in fact it usually makes me laugh. So I enter another trade, make another quick £40, then another £95. Almost £300 in less than 45 mins and I’m supposed to cry over the £250 I “missed out on”? 

£300 in less than an hour for doing nothing more than waiting for some volatility then tapping a keyboard. It’s almost a sin to make money that easily and I don’t “deserve” any of it. Shut off the laptop. Go out for the day. 

Does the following sound familiar? “Okay I’m almost at my take-profit...almost!.....almost!....okay it’s bouncing away from me but it’ll come back. Come back, damnit!! Jesus come back to my limit! Ah for F**k’s sakes!! This is complete crap; that trade was almost done! This is rigged! This is worse than poker! This is total BS!!” 

So when you were 50% or 75% toward your goal and could see the trade slipping away why wasn’t $100 or $200 enough? You need more than that?...really?!

So point 6:

6. Tomorrow Is Another Day. Lordy Lordy, you only made $186 all day. What a disaster! Did you lose anything? Nope. Will the market be open again tomorrow? Yep. Does London open in just four hours? Yep. Is the NOK/SGD/EUR whatever still looking shitty? Yep. So let it go- there are endless THOUSANDS of trades you can make in your lifetime and you need to let a small gain be seen for what it is: ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL PROFIT. 

Four or five solid but small profits in a day = One Large Profit. I don’t care how I make it, I don’t care if it’s ten lots of £20, I don’t care if I make the lot in a single trade in 30 seconds either. And once I have a nice sum I switch the computer off and leave it the Fk alone. I don’t care if Brexit is due to detonate the pound or if some Fed guy is going to crap all over the USD in his speech; I’ve made my money and I’m out for the day. There will be other speeches, other detonations. 

I could get into the entire process by which I trade but it’s aggravatingly basic trend-following mostly based on fundamentals. Losing in this business really does boil down to the same appalling combination of traits that kill most traders: Greed, Impatience, Addiction. Do I trade every day? Absolutely not; if there’s nothing with higher probability trades then I just leave it alone. When I hit my target I’m out for the day- the market doesn’t give a crap about me and I don’t give a crap about the market, if you see my meaning. 

I played poker semi-professionally for two years and it’s absolutely soul-destroying to be “cold decked” for a whole week. But every player has to experience it in order to lose the arrogance and the bravado; losing is fine as long as you learn from it. One day you’ll be in a position to fold pocket Kings because you’ll know you’re dead in the water. The currency markets are exactly the same in that one regard: if you learn from the past you’ll know when it’s time to get out of that stupid trade or that stupid “system” that sounded so great when you had a demo account. 

Bank a profit. 
Keep your charts simple. 
Know the pairs. 
Be patient. 
Touch nothing till you understand it inside out. 

And if you’re not enjoying the game....STOP PLAYING.

personalfinance,Need some tax help,"I'm married and me and my wife received a large tax bill after filing our taxes (around 700$ we file jointly). First thing is first...on my W4 my previous employed fucked up my federal allowances and put me down for 2 instead of one. When i file alone it says I owe about $100, which seems right. However my wife only claimed 1 federal allowance and she owes $580. Math wise that also sounds right looking at her Federal tax withholdings. My question is why is there such a difference? Did this happen because my employer claimed 2 or is her employer/payroll company just not properly withholding federal tax? 

I would think that with the incorrect higher number of allowances my tax bill should definitely be higher than hers right?",finance

personalfinance,How To Invest Somewhat Large Savings,"My wife and I saved up about $325k in cash. We are looking for different ways to invest and generate a return on our money.

We have outlined some of our options:

1. Our first thought is to use the money to buy a home in our area and pay it off in full and then rent it out. $325k is enough for a home in our area. On the high end, we expect to be able to rent it out for $2500/month and $2300/month on the low end.

2. Alternatively, a friend of ours suggested that instead of using all $325k to buy 1 single property we can split it up to use as down payments on 2 (or 3) properties, then finance those properties and then rent it out for approx $2500/month and $2300/month on the low end. We estimate interest rates to be around 3.75%

3. A different option is to put enough down payment for 1 property (rather than paying in full) and keep the remaining to invest in stocks/bonds/mutual funds etc..

4. Last option is to stay away from real estate all together and invest entirely in in stocks/bonds/mutual funds etc.. We’re still trying to figure out what to invest in and we’re open to suggestions

I remember reading somewhere that if the irs sees that something was left out they’ll let me know. Or if they don’t they probably fixed the problem themselves. The amount of interest was barely $25 or so I think. 

I feel like I know the answer. But I imagine this is going to be a hassle. So if I can avoid it I’d be more than happy to. So do I need to file an amended tax return and enter this info? I already received my tax return. Both state and federal.",finance

personalfinance,Federal tax refund was deposited but not the whole amount. No indication of offsets.,"Hello,

I just received my tax refund in the amount of $2971.97, however, I should have received $4,101.00. I called the IRS, they said that they issued the full $4,101.00 and did not see any educational offsets or any other type of offset that would explain the difference of $1,129.09. They recommended I call my bank. My bank said they only see the $2971.97 as being deposited. My bank has filed a trace number with the IRS to see where that money went.

My taxes are pretty simple. Just income tax and some minimal educational expenses. **Are there any other steps that I should be taking?** **Should I be worried about identity theft?** I am immensely confused. I have laboriously paid off all my old debts (school loans, loans that were in bad standing, etc.) so there is no reason any of it should have been offset to pay off anything along those lines. I am also receiving money back from the state of Illinois this year so, it's not a state tax problem. In summary, I don't owe any money anywhere that should be taken out of my tax refund.

personalfinance,Payroll Tax Calculation,"Payroll Tax Calculation

Hi r/personalfinance, I’m a CPA working for an automotive supplier, and I am trying to figure out my paycheck for the period, as I just started last month. Because I started after the first of the year, I was required to use the 2020 W-4, and I seriously can’t figure out how much the federal withholding should be for my paycheck because my own calc is not tying to what each of the online payroll calculators (ADP, for example) are calculating. My company’s payroll department is currently overwithholding, as it looks like they are basing their calculations on the 2019 W-4 to an extent, but even still I can’t figure out how they calculated the Fed withholding.

Facts:

$2,884.62 per biweekly pay period

$3.05 taxable life insurance per pay period

 $173.08 deferral to 401k (not Roth)

$68.31 medical premiums

$7.85 dental premiums

$50.38 FSA contribution


My initial calc is that, subtracting all of my deductions for fed tax purposes, the base taxable wages for fed is $2,588.05, base taxable wages for FICA is the same as fed except add the 401k deferral (2,761.13). 

Using Pub 15T for the 2020 W-4 withholding, $2,588.05 gives a withholding amount of $305 for the standard withholding column for single taxpayers.

Therefore, assuming an extra $25 federal withholding per pay period would result in the following withholdings:

Federal: $305 + $25 = $330

Social security: $2,761.13 * 0.062 = $171.19

Medicare: $2,761.13 * 0.0145 = $40.04

State (MI): $2,588.05 * 0.0425 = $109.99

Therefore, I would think my net pay for the period would be: $2,884.62 - 173.08(401k) - 68.31(med.) - 7.85(dental) - 50.38(FSA) - 330(fed) - 171.19(S.S.) - 40.04(Medicare) - 109.99(state) = $1,933.78.

personalfinance,How to report untaxed income (fellowship) and estimated tax payments in FreeTaxUSA?,"I am a post-doc and the bulk of my income comes from a fellowship awarded by the federal government. The fellowship income has no tax withheld and is listed as ""Stipend"" on my paycheck.

personalfinance,"Scratched someone’s bumper when pulling out of a tight driveway. They got a quote for $450 and I intend to pay cash out of my emergency fund to avoid filing a claim. They want me to pay them directly, but I would rather pay the shop directly. How to proceed?","**Thank you everyone, I’m going to draft up a release of liability form, pay him the $450, and move on with life!** 

Long story short: Scraped someone’s bumper pulling out of work on Monday, left note, they called back, I offered to pay to have it buffed out, they got a couple of quotes and it ends up that the scratches are too deep to buff and they need to do some sanding/painting, he sent me pictures of the quote he got from a local shop. $450. 

My deductible is $500, so it doesn’t make sense to file a claim. I have accident forgiveness but would rather save it in case of a more serious accident occurring. 

Anyways, I asked him when he was getting the work done and if I should stop by the shop to give them my information, so I can pay them directly when the time comes. He responded that he can meet me himself and, I assume, receive the payment from me in cash. 

I don’t feel entirely comfortable paying him in cash because the work could end up costing less than quoted (or more) and also I would have no idea if my money was used to even fix the scratches. They weren’t too bad and I personally know quite a few people who would rather pocket $450 in cash than get some scratches on their car fixed. 

How should I proceed? Should I stay firm with my plan to pay the shop directly or just give him the cash and be done with it?

personalfinance,Saving for my 3 year old daughter,"I have a question for those parents who've actually managed to save money for their children. 

This is something I wished my parents would've done for me, but unfortunately were not able to do. I want to save money for my daughter and put into a savings account that she has no access to until she turns 18. She's currently 3 and a half, turns 4 in August. 

I know this is primarily based off of ones budget, but how much is a good amount to put into a savings account for a child each week until they're 18? This money will be for her, whether she decides to use it for college, trade school, or neither. 

She will have a separate savings for when she starts working or getting money for chores, including other odds and ends. That money will be allowed to touch. 

But this other savings account I want to use as like a high school graduation gift, a surprise that she wouldn't know about. At this point the amount I could put in each week isn't a significant amount, but I want her to have something for when she actually decides to live on her own one day, or use it for college, whatever. 

What's a decent amount to put in each week? I'll also add that we bank through Wells Fargo, I cannot remember the interest rate off the top of my head for a standard savings account. I've looked into opening an online savings for her. I've also considered a trust fund.",finance

personalfinance,Tackling law school debt...are we going to be okay?,"My (25F) husband (26M) graduates from law school this May. I used to work (in a non-lucrative career) but now I stay home with our infant son and will for the foreseeable future. Just some background for people who know a little bit about law school -- he went to a top school with 90k in tuition taken off. Tuition, books, and some living expenses totaled about 117K. I'm not 100% clear on interest but the loans range from 5% to 7ish%, I think. I should say, we are figuring out all this financial stuff all on our own. We're trying our best but we've already made mistakes. We've used YNAB religiously the past year and budgeting/financial discipline is not our problem (goodness, the things we do to save money sometimes). Moving on--

He is on the litigation side with special interest in appellate work. It's important to him to have good ""exit options"" in the long run -- elite boutiques, DOJ work, and in the long run maybe a judgeship. His first job post-grad is a federal circuit clerkship. Fantastic for career development, horrible for finances. Take home will probably be about 50k-ish that year (Aug 2020-Aug 2021). After that he has a job secured at a BigLaw firm. Salary will be about 200k/year and there is a bonus for doing a clerkship, but we don't know how much that will be -- word seems to be anywhere from 25-50k. Salary increases by about 10k-20k with each year he stays on, but after about the 6th year they sort of expect you to either make partner (rare) or exit to develop your career in other ways (can mean a lot of different things). Some people crap out of BigLaw sooner rather than later. My husband and I have a feeling that won't be him, but we don't know the future.

He has interviewed for a federal district clerkship for the 2023-2024 term, and we're pretty sure he has the job and we're just waiting for confirmation. That would be another year of (relatively) peanut pay. Again, less than ideal financial move, but we're taking long term viability of his other ambitions seriously. We expect a return to high-paying private law after this clerkship.

Our plan/questions, concerns year-by-year:

2020-2021 (first year post-grad, clerkship takehome \~50k): ~~refinance loan if we can qualify for lower interest rate~~ use income driven repayment plan, rent apartment in temporary city, make reasonable loan payments, live and die by the budget

2021-2022 (move cities, start in BigLaw with 200k salary, bonus \~25k-50k): refinance if we qualify for lower rate, send off massive chunks to loan, still live and die by the budget...~~but question: could we buy a house this year? How does saving/investing factor in? We're taking a big income cut again the next year...~~

EDIT(I accidentally left out this year in the original post!): 2022-2023 (still BigLaw, salary around 220k): keep paying off loan, maybe finish paying this year? Maybe have leftovers to build significant savings? Buy a house?

2023-2024 (clerkship #2, don't have to move this time; 50k salary again): ~~probably still paying off the loan? If the bonus was big enough and we did well enough in the year prior, maybe we're close to paying it off? Or is this a pipe dream?~~ Loan is either paid or whatever remains can be paid off with savings from last couple Biglaw years.

2024+ (hopefully private practice for several more years): continue saving and investing, maybe we can breathe finally?

For anyone who's read this far, thank you!! Hopefully you're not judging us too harshly. I'm ashamed that we know so little at our age, but then again, I don't think we teach financial literacy so well in America. Sometimes I feel like we'll be fine, other times I'm panicking about how big the loan is and the massive interest it accrues! Any advice is appreciated!!",finance
gaming,Picking up on an old save after a long absence?,"I have a tendency to switch between games a lot. A while ago I was playing through an game (which I will not name here for the sake of avoiding spoilers) but quit after I hit a snag (this one core mission I couldn't complete no matter how many times I tried). I have thought about trying again, but with how elaborate the controls are I don't know how that will go. I'm not sure I could even remember where I needed to go. 

When I do return to a game, I normally just delete my previous save and start a new one, just for the sake of not having to re-learn the game without the tutorial. However, I tend to get sick of re-playing the beginning of a game over and over again and never seeing the ending before I either tire of the game or get fed up with it for some reason.

Is there a way you can get back into a complicated game without having problems like you're playing the game for the first time, but you're playing someone else's save file that's fairly deep into the game. I really wish I could just finish games and not have to replay their beginnings over and over. I remember in Oblivion I got REALLY sick of playing through the tutorial over and over again (though that was because I was trying to find SOME viable character build that could actually make it into the mid game before things became futile, I never did succeed, that's why you NEVER make a game where the difficulty increases exponentially).",technology
personalfinance,Roth IRA as a Savings Means,"Hi All. Looking for some opinions here. Could be that this is a horrible idea. I have a high yield savings account that I keep my emergency fund in at the moment. It’s about $10k. I’m trying to build up to 3 months income since I read that’s a good start. I’m getting close to that but it will still take some time. My question is about my Roth IRA. I’m wondering if it makes sense at the beginning of the year to take the federal maximum (2020 is $6k) from my emergency savings out and put it in my Roth IRA. I know there is inherently more risk in doing this, however, it seems that earning a ~10% gain on my money faster is more valuable to me than eating ~1.5% in my savings. My thoughts are also that if something happened where I needed that cash I could withdraw the principal put into my Roth IRA (right?) penalty free. 

Anyway, looking for feedback on this thought even if it’s a terrible idea. Thank you in advance.

personalfinance,Saving on student loans with the same monthly payment (w/ example),"If you currently have student loans and are able to easily change your repayment plan \*and keep the same interest rates\*, it may be possible to save yourself hundreds, if not thousands of dollars AND pay your loan off early while keeping the same monthly payment!

&amp;#x200B;

This is possible if you have:

\-Multiple loans at different interest rates

\-Multiple options of repayment periods \*with the same interest rates\*

\-Ability to afford monthly payments for a shorter repayment period than the longest offered

\-Ability to choose which loan/s you apply additional payment to

&amp;#x200B;

This seems too good to be true, but it isn't. The only real catch/es are the 4 points above. The short explanation is to choose the longest repayment period possible with the same interest rates as the shortest repayment period possible (or that you can afford), while continuing to pay the monthly payment of the shorter repayment period. Then, since your lender allows you to choose how to distribute the extra payment, you apply all of that extra to the \*highest interest\* loan. Once you pay off the highest interest loan, you switch down to the next highest interest loan and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

[This example](https://imgur.com/fPs5kPV) is based off of my actual interest rates, but the principal amounts are theoretical. In this example, while paying the exact same each month as the normal 10 year payment while on the 25 year repayment plan, you save nearly $700 and pay the loan off 4 months early, just by spending 5 minutes to rearrange some numbers online. This could be dramatically more if you have a bigger spread in interest rates or much higher student loan debt. My actual principal amounts are larger and I will be saving well over $1000 over the course of the loan...for 5 minutes of my time. Sure $1000 isn't that much when we're talking about tens of thousands of dollars in loans, but hey...it's free ~~real estate~~interest reduction

&amp;#x200B;

It's important to note that, as always, paying off the highest interest loan first will ALWAYS save the most money, \*regardless of principal amounts\*. This is really what makes this work.

&amp;#x200B;

One added benefit on top of this is that if you get a bit behind or take a pay cut, you'll be paid ahead in the eyes of the lender and should have options to lower or skip payments easily.

btc,Providing Some Clarity on Bitcoin Unlimited's Financial Decisions,"&amp;#x200B;

# Introduction

As promised in our [previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/f1v60o/bitcoin_unlimited_response_to_the_claim_that_our/), we wanted to provide some extra clarity on Bitcoin Unlimited financial choices. We wanted to do this as there has been a lot of confusion and misinformation within the community as to the reasons behind these choices.

It has been claimed by a small number of influential people in the ecosystem that Bitcoin Unlimited does not support BCH ([see the previous article debunking this claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/f1v60o/bitcoin_unlimited_response_to_the_claim_that_our/)) and that BU’s holdings are supposedly evidence of this. Background Bitcoin Unlimited was founded in 2015, and was set up as a response to the Bitcoin block size debate. More specifically, it was created to provide software that allowed on-chain scaling as originally proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto. As we all know, on-chain scaling is a vital component required for peer-to-peer electronic cash to serve the world’s population. Without it Bitcoin would be limited to serving only a small number of people willing and able to pay exorbitantly high fees. Our organisation was created to make Bitcoin unlimited. This prediction of high fees and limited capacity was played out in the BTC we know today as we predicted.

Bitcoin Unlimited received a large anonymous donation in BTC in 2016 from supporters of the ‘on-chain scaling’ movement. This donation allowed our organisation to remain independent and focussed on building software that allows on-chain scaling.

As you all know, in August of 2017, Bitcoin Cash was created after an unsuccessful multi-year effort to allow Bitcoin (BTC) to scale on-chain. Bitcoin Cash was created with the goal of on-chain scaling to support the world’s population right at its heart and BU has been supporting it since the idea was originally formulated.

Once Bitcoin Cash was created it also meant that all funds Bitcoin Unlimited held (BTC) were forked into two equal sets of coins, BTC and BCH. This put BU into a position where we had to make an important decision on how to handle these funds in a way that was in the interest of both BCH and BU.

# Financial Prudence

Any organisation that wants to be effective in its goals must aim to always be financially sustainable. Without money, achieving anything becomes significantly more difficult. Cryptocurrencies only magnify this issue even further. Highly volatile asset values, opaque and dynamic tax and regulatory environments, and the unique properties of cryptocurrencies all contribute towards making the financial operations of an organisation an extreme challenge to say the least. Navigating this challenging landscape is a necessary requirement for the success of any organisation within our industry though.

While Bitcoin Unlimited’s primary goal is to make sure peer-to-peer electronic cash (as set out in the Bitcoin white-paper) becomes a reality, a secondary goal must be to make sure that it has the resources required to make its primary goal achievable, and an important part of these resources are its funds.

After Bitcoin forked into BTC and BCH, Bitcoin Unlimited then held an equal number of both. Although a BUIP was passed to authorize some extra conversion, significant practical obstacles to doing so exist (although this is still being worked on). However, since the overarching reason to convert a significant number of BTC to BCH is to maintain financial prudence based on the reasons outlined below and the poor BCH price performance has heavily skewed our holdings, we do anticipate some rebalancing when these obstacles are resolved.

We will further expand on these reasons below. Historic Volatility It is a fact that BCH has historically been more volatile than BTC. An organisation that wishes to maintain a lower level of risk must aim to hold a majority of funds in assets which will maintain their value over time, i.e. be less volatile in their price. It is unfortunately true that BCH has been a more volatile asset than BCH since its creation. While there has been lots of progress and maturation of the BCH ecosystem, this price volatility is likely due to BCH still being a smaller and less developed ecosystem than BTC. The graphs below show levels of volatility in the two coins compared.

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC](https://preview.redd.it/o4tltyke9rg41.png?width=2794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=468c53ca0b986dcea6075a4056cbe4bfddecba09)

[BCH](https://preview.redd.it/5s1f88cg9rg41.png?width=2784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d82658b9664db57182dde6dab440e28d13cfb50)

This higher volatility in BCH has meant that to significantly increase BU’s holdings of BCH would expose the organisation to a higher level of risk for ideological reasons. BTC is already a high-volatility asset and to expose the organisation funds to even higher volatility and further risk is a decision that should not be taken based on simplistic ideology, but rather with the strategy of maximising the ability for the organisation to achieve its primary goals. This meant making the decision to not take on a higher exposure to price volatility, and instead maintain a more conservative risk profile.

# Lack Of Say In The Protocol

One argument that has been put forward to suggest that this decision does not make sense because it is analogous to a CEO of a company holding more shares in their competitor’s company. This analogy does not accurately reflect the current scenario for BU or BCH. In this analogy BU is the CEO and BCH is the company. Ignoring the shareholders, A CEO is able to have the largest impact on a company compared to any other stakeholder. Their actions have a direct impact on operations of the company and therefore its value and the value of the shares.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin Unlimited currently has little to no input on the BCH protocol. It has no way to directly influence the direction or success of BCH. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, BCH has a mining software homogeneity that is as centralised as BTC (i.e. essentially all miners and pools run a single client, BitcoinABC). This means that, all though BU has a slight majority in non-mining and in-consensus nodes, BU has no say in protocol decisions unless a collaborative and decentralised development model were to be used by BitcoinABC. This is an unfortunate situation considering the fact that the community split from BTC for this very reason and is [strongly in support of decentralised development](https://twitter.com/BitcoinUnlimit/status/1227618603610071040). Secondly, BitcoinABC does not take a collaborative approach to development. All decisions and features are dictated by BitcoinABC.

In fact the situation is unfortunately even worse than this. BitcoinABC has decided to take an actively hostile position against Bitcoin Unlimited (and many other valuable participants in the ecosystem) and would rather that it did not exist at all.

While a number of members of BitcoinABC were previously members of BU, they unfortunately used their privilege as members to try (but fortunately failed) to sabotage the organisation.

These three voting records show members of BitcoinABC voting for the purchase of BSV coin, voting for an unfeasibly large block size increase (10TB), and voting for implementation of and miner-activation of BSV features into the BU client.  None of these actions were implemented in the ABC client, and the inclusion of BSV features is likely the single biggest criticism certain ABC affiliated people have made against BU, yet members of BitcoinABC voted for it.

While it is important to assume good faith, under no interpretation can this be seen as anything other an act of bad will towards BU. Unfortunately this kind of behaviour is rather the rule than the exception and has likely been [a major factor in BCH’s struggle to attract quality developers into the ecosystem](https://read.cash/@SharkySharkdog/attracting-more-bitcoin-cash-developers-9ab50474).

Regardless of the hard work done by members of BU to create useful software for Bitcoin Cash, and its continued commitment towards peer-to-peer electronic cash for the past 5 years, ABC will unfortunately never allow any of BU’s work to go into the BCH protocol willingly.

If BU were to invest all its funds into BCH it would be making a highly risky bet on BitcoinABC’s leadership, a leadership that has not only been historically unsuccessful (when looking at the price of BCH since its creation, both in dollar terms and BTC/BCH ratio terms), but also actively hostile to our organisation. A more cautious approach that takes these factors into account is to keep the funds held where there has been less volatility.

Regardless of all of this, BU is still 100% committed to supporting Bitcoin Cash.

# Game Theory: The Strategy of Betting Against Yourself

Counter intuitively, a strategy where you bet against yourself can provide a beneficial low-risk profile. When you bet against yourself, if you lose you win and if you win you win.  With BU’s current asset holdings of BCH and BTC the organisation is financially hedged in a way that it wins if BCH wins, and if BTC wins then BU lives to fight another day for worldwide peer-to-peer electronic cash.

If BTC goes down and BCH goes up then it means BCH is succeeding, and our funds in BCH will sustain us for longer. Not only that, but there would likely be more funds available for BCH development in this scenario. If BTC goes up and BCH goes down then BU will be sustained for longer to continue the fight for BCH and peer-to-peer electronic cash.

This is very similar to the strategy of BCH-supporting miners mining on BTC and then converting the BTC block rewards into BCH in an effort to use BTC gains to support BCH price. BU is similarly using its gains in BTC and converting them to efforts and initiatives in support of BCH. In doing so Bitcoin Unlimited is able to turn any BTC win into a positive for BCH.

# Incentives

It has been suggested that the situation created by holding a larger portion of funds in BTC than in BCH creates negative incentives that push BU towards supporting BTC. It is important to keep in mind that Bitcoin Unlimited is not a profit driven organisation. While an increase in value of its assets is of course beneficial to the organisation, our primary goal is to accelerate the global adoption of peer-to-peer electronic cash as described in the Bitcoin white-paper, and the officials, membership and [founding articles](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/BUarticles.pdf) of Bitcoin Unlimited are the driving force for this.

It is also important to point out that there is no evidence to support the claim that BU is in support of BTC (or BSV). In fact the [voting record](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/voting/) clearly shows the opposite of this. BU has continually worked in support of peer-to-peer electronic cash, and specifically in support of BCH since it was created. This is thanks to the strong commitment by the BU officials and members, all of whom are long time Bitcoiners and supporters of the ‘on-chain scaling’ movement. The only members who receive any payment from the organisation are those who provide significant value in the form of various skilled services, and all of these are voted on by the membership.  The BUIP record also shows that compensated individuals are often compensated at far under market rates for developers of their caliber.  Should the price of BTC increase, no member receives any direct benefit from this beyond any appreciation in value of any BTC they privately hold. Therefore there are no strong incentives for BU to drive the price of BTC up and push the price of BCH down as this would be counter to our primary goal.

# Has This Strategy Been Successful?

Bitcoin Unlimited and its members, all being long-time Bitcoiners, are acutely aware of the need to play the long game to make sure a globally adopted peer-to-peer electronic cash becomes a reality. BU is the oldest entity within the BCH ecosystem and with good reason. The financial strategy of BU to date has been highly effective in sustaining the organisation over a long period of time, and allowing it to independently support BCH development initiatives. This is made clear by the fact that BU continues to have enough funding to provide value to the BCH ecosystem for the foreseeable future.

Had BU converted all funds to BCH at, or at almost any point after, the time of the BCH/BTC fork in August 2017, then for much of the time since it would have been forced to either scale back operations or shut down support for BCH developers completely. We now see development teams such as BitcoinABC facing the prospect of being unable to fund their development of BCH, and their financial strategy may have contributed to this reality. This is despite the fact that nearly all the funds donated in the recent community funding drive sponsored by bitcoin.com were directed towards BitcoinABC.

Lack of a sustainable funding model also seems to have been a major factor in pushing BitcoinABC to make the highly controversial decision to support a change to the BCH protocol that would [divert 12.5% of the block reward to themselves](https://read.cash/@deadalnix/on-the-infrastructure-funding-plan-for-bitcoin-cash-bd372a10). Being financially prudent and sticking to its principles (as defined in the founding [Articles of Federation](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/resources/BUarticles.pdf) has allowed Bitcoin Unlimited to steer clear of any conflicts of interest such as this.

# Summary

Through its financial strategy Bitcoin Unlimited has been able to maintain its independence and financial sustainability and has therefore remained in a strong position to support Bitcoin Cash. BU’s officials and membership have continually made good decisions that have allowed BU to provide long-term support for the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,If the interest rate is high on one loan will it likely be high for another lender?,"Hi! I have a student bill to pay that’s due very very soon and my parents can’t afford to pay it (neither can I). I went to take out a private student loan because FasFa has given me barely anything. However, the interest rate on the loan I applied for is 12+%. This is obviously very high. And it would have to be deferred which would make it higher. I heard interest rates are based on the markets. Does that mean that other lenders will have very expensive rates? I was wondering I should look somewhere else. I really REALLY don’t like the interest rate of this loan...but the bill is due next week. My mother thinks it’s more important to just pay my bill now and worry about it later but the rate means I’ll be paying triple what I took out in the first place (like $18k). That’s not even taking into account the other loans I have that have accumulated interest since freshman year.

personalfinance,Is it important to build a relationship with a credit union for possible future loans?,"Hi everyone, growing up the first savings account my family ever made for me was a federal credit union to put birthday money in. Eventually I opened an account with a big bank for convenience sake when I got a high school job. The credit union was miles away and only convenient for my father to go to on his way to work. Anyway, for the longest time I wanted to close the account because using it was extremely inconvenient for me. My parents would always tell me “you don’t want to do that, because if you ever want a loan, you’ll want to go to this credit union for a good rate. You’ll have built a relationship with them, so they’ll give you a good rate.” So I never closed it. For years I used it to store emergency money that I never really see. I eventually realized that the interest rate vs fees made it so I loss a little money over time. 


Anyway, I’ve recently moved across the country and I plan on closing that account and opening an account elsewhere. I’m trying to decide whether to put that money in BIG BANK A or a different credit union? Was there any validity to what my parents told me about getting a good loan rate?

personalfinance,Filing my Federal Taxes before checking my NY state e-file options was a mistake. FreeTaxUSA is basically holding my free state e-file option hostage,"Writing this mostly because maybe it will help someone else avoid the same mistake as I don't think I could have fairly seen this pitfall coming. Here's what I did and why it messed things up:

-Made an account on FreeTaxUSA.com and put my federal taxes through as an e-file. All was well. I expected to pop over to the NY state website after to do my state taxes over there. I haven't had to file NY State tax for a few years but I'm pretty sure the last time I did, they had their own in-house forms that I used to e-file.

-On the [NY State website](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/efile/default.htm), saw that FreeTaxUSA was a free e-file option that I would be eligible for. Score, right? All my info is already in there, I just declined to use the paid option the first time around so I'll use the free link this time (you'd think they could automatically detect if you're eligible for free file though...).

-Logged in to FreeTaxUSA from the ""You must access the FreeTaxUSA Free File website from this page"" link. Went back to the state part, found that it still only had an option to add the option back and pay to use it. Huh?

-Deleted the state filing information in my account and re-did it. Came to the same thing, only option was to pay. At this point I wrote to support. Also, in the middle of all this I got an email saying that my federal return had been accepted by the IRS.

-Support tells me that I need to make a new account and gives a kind of bullshit-sounding reason that it is necessary to have seperate accounts in order to meet the IRS' qualifications to be an e-file service, and that it will be necessary to use the paper file option. In my haste to be done with this I misread that to mean that I should select the paper file option for the federal so I can just skip it and submit the state. I mean, that's why I'm here, right? My state told me to use this service because they want me to e-file.

-I put all my info again and come to the submission options. After selecting paper for Federal, the page tells me that I can only e-file state if the IRS has already accepted my federal taxes (which they have). But when I click the button to continue, it just loops me back to the same page telling me I can't do that, presumably because the only way for the system to see if my federal has been accepted is to check my account status. The page also confusingly directs me to mail in my state return based on having selected mail for federal, but then gives a boilerplate message about NY State requiring that returns prepared with software must be e-filed instead of mailed. At this point I go back and re-read the support message and clarify that they had instructed me to use the paper option for both.

-I write to support to clarify this contradiction between being told that I should use the mail option and being notified that I am required to e-file. I get a response saying that I should mail it in and basically include a note blaming the software not being able to handle this issue with needing a different account, and that apparently this is acceptable to bypass the state mandate.

-I picked out another option from the state's website and ran through the whole thing with them, only to find at the end that it was similarly set up that in order to file state I would have to submit federal at the same time. (If anyone happens to know that any of the ones in the list do *not* require submitting federal in order to submit state, please let me know. My enthusiasm to try all of them is low.)

I think what I'm going to do is just use the [State-issued version of the IT-201 form](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/ads/efile_addit201.htm) and fill it out myself from scratch and mail it in, because frankly I don't trust the advice I was given at this point to not result in the state rejecting my filing because it's got barcodes on it that for all I know will cause the system to say ERROR:THIS NEEDS TO BE E-FILED. 

I'm not sure whether to read this snafu as incompetence on FreeTaxUSA's part or malice because *of course* they can handle e-file if I do it on the account that needs to pay. Maybe a little of both. Not that it's a huge fee but I'm pretty ornery about the principal of the thing here.

tl;dr for NY state and maybe others, if you think you're eligible for free e-file, sort that out before touching federal",finance
personalfinance,"Filing Federal/State Taxes when you're married to a foreigner not living in the states, need general help/advice, more info in post.","Hey all, cheers ahead of time for anyone who reads this and offers help. I'm a little in over my head, I think.

I've lived in Western NY all my life. I always file my own taxes and it's always been very easy and simple for me, being single and no dependents, yadda yadda. Until 2019's taxes. Oof.

In Feb of 2019, I married my magnificent Canadian wife, who has never lived or worked in the USA. I lived in western NY for ALL of 2019, moved to Canada to finally be with her full time in Jan of 2020. Now I'm trying to file my taxes online (which HRBlock, which I've always used before).

At first everything seemed to be okay, until at the end HRBlock told me I could not e-file because my spouse did not have a SSN or ITIN. This is something I did not anticipate her needing, since she's a Canadian and never worked/lived in the USA. However, fine - I can print and file by mail if I really need to, but then I started reading up about our situation and I'm no longer at all certain about what we're supposed to do here.

Does she need to file a US federal return just because she's married to me, a US citizen, even though she does not work/live in the states?

I was going to file married/separate because she's filing her own Canadian income taxes, but now I'm not sure if that's the right idea. Should we be filing joint in the USA just because she's married, with her applying for an ITIN? What about future years? We do not plan to move to the states and I'm in Canada for good now - do I still need to file US taxes every year, reporting both her and my income even though we don't work in the USA? Seems crazy to me!

Does this affect my NY return at all for 2019, since it will be the last year I lived/worked in NY?

I asked a lot of questions and this is turning into quite a wall, so I'll stop there for now. I can provide any more details that may be important if asked, but the main thing is I am very suddenly feeling overwhelmed by this. Just looking for clarifications on how I should file in this very niche scenario.

personalfinance,Can a guy like me actually refinance my student loans? Looking for other advice too..,"So my student loan(s) balance is sitting at \~52k right now. I consolidated them about 5 or 6 years ago into Federal loans which are split almost equally between subsidized and unsubsidized. Fixed rate of 6%, but with auto draft 5.75%. At the time of consolidating I had just taken a job for my state govt. and wanted to be eligible for PSLF (loan forgiveness) but have since left that job for private sector almost 4 years ago. My current repayment plan is set for 20 years from now (ugh). I overpay every month too (is this stupid?). 

Capital One says my TransUnion score is 762, but Discover says my FICO is at 665. I only have cards to try to help my credit, I use &lt;10% available and always pay in full. We also bought a house almost 2 years ago, and one car payment is the only other debt we have (married). 

A year or two back, can't remember, I looked at SoFi and they quoted me a higher rate than my current one. I also want to avoid hard inquiries asking a bunch of places to quote me a refi. Since then rates have continued to (mostly) fall.

I should probably consider changing my repayment plan with the same servicer first, but am somewhat wary in case we fall on harder times and couldn't afford the higher required payments. Although we are quite stable now and have decent savings, it's just something I can't get out of my head. But I'm just wondering if there's anyone out there like me who has successfully refinanced and saved some money. If freaking kills me paying $500 a month only to see my balance reduce by less than $3000 over the past 12 months.

Another couple of questions: we are planning to apply a bulk payment of like $5k to the loans soon. I need to just talk to the servicer directly about all this stuff, but is there any downside to this? In general, would I be better off just sticking to the payment plan amounts and putting the extra money in savings? Here's another one: what if I could get a loan somewhere to pay the unsubsidized portion (not even sure if that's an option) at a drastically lower interest rate?

Just thinking about all this gives me so much anxiety / depression. I made a lot of bad decisions during school but am just trying to handle it the best way possible now. Thanks for any advice y'all.",finance

Just your daily reminder that **this is not the flu,** sars, ebola, or really anything else we've seen in our lifetimes. At the risk of beating a dead horse here.... this is not being priced into markets right now. At all. And at the risk of sounding alarmist, I am going to put my neck out there and say that this thing is the inevitable shock that always seems to kick off a recession (get your remind me's ready). With that said, it's going to take a little bit of time before markets digest the supply shocks that are going to come through from China's shutdown. And past that point, I really don't think anybody is pricing in the fact that this is going to start to mandate shutdowns elsewhere away from China as it spreads.

The funny thing, is that from a data perspective, we actually were starting to get a mild recovery in the macro regime, suggesting the Fed may have actually engineered a sort of soft landing, at least for a short bit. Given, that soft landing would have been heavily stimulus and debt fueled, but, the means don't matter in the short term, and that's often how things go anyway.  But this item is coming at a very very very bad time, and the economy just is not prepared to handle this even slightly. The markets obviously are not reflecting this right now for a variety of reasons, but markets aren't always the great discounters people would believe.

I will say, we likely will see some sort of massive wave of additional stimulus, or at least an attempt at it. But the transmission mechanisms of getting said stimulus to the people who need it is going to cause this to falter when it's needed most from my view.  


**Edit:** For those who don't understand the seriousness of this, here is a relevant quote from a highly respected authority - Mark Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at Harvard.

***""I think it is likely we'll see a global pandemic,"" said Mark Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""If a pandemic happens, 40% to 70% of people world wide are likely to be infected in the coming year. What proportion of those will be symptomatic, I can't give a good number.""***

He comments on this directly at: [https://twitter.com/mlipsitch/status/1228373884027592704](https://twitter.com/mlipsitch/status/1228373884027592704)

[https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/02/harvard-expert-says-coronavirus-likely-just-gathering-steam/](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/02/harvard-expert-says-coronavirus-likely-just-gathering-steam/)

So look, is there a chance this will blow over? Sure. 100%, and I'm not an epidemiologist. But when leading epidemiologists collectively view this as being more likely to be a pandemic, yet markets are completely brushing this news off, I view that there is nothing being priced in here at all except perhaps stimulus. Even if there was only a 5% chance of the above scenario happening, I would expect markets to price in some of the massive risk that would be associated with this scenario, but that's not happening.",finance
personalfinance,Masters degree or am I crazy,"Hi,

I work as a Registered Nurse pulling in around 80,000 a year, I have 80k in student loans at 5.3% interest rate currently on a 15 year repayment schedule at 675$ a month. I recently put 4k towards loans so it's not like my monthly is my only option.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to return to get my masters and probably do a three year program to get my nurse practitioner that would end up costing me 60-80k. I would very likely have to do roughly half or more of that in loans. That would probably land me around 120-140k in debt when all was said and done and I'd be making between 90-120k vs my 80k now. Edit: I also would be able to work full time still for most of this program. 

I feel that waiting longer to go back to school and doing work on my current loans will inevitably lead to me not going back to school and I will miss the opportunity at this point in my life, but I already know how crushing my current student loan debt is and adding more to that just seems crazy. I was hoping to see what others experiences and thoughts are on this matter.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Seeking advice for possible move from VA to CA for a job,"Hey everyone. I'm considering a job offer I received. I'm currently in Richmond, VA and the position is in Sacramento. I know there are other factors that I need to think about for a big move like this, but I'm primarily interested in if you think I would come out ahead financially if I take the CA job? Any other advice or suggestions would be great too.

In VA for 2018, rounded values: (2019 was similar)

Gross pay: 48k, no yearly increase

It's a contractor job so no benefits. They offer some benefits that are a monthly deduction from your pay. For 2018, I spent $1600 total on medical and vision. However, even those limited benefits aren't that great and I had some bad experiences in processing my claims for some doctor visits.

Fed income tax: 4900
Fed social security: 2880

Fed medicare: 670

VA state income tax (5.75%): 2260

If I subtract the above from the gross pay, my net pay was around 36k.

----------------------------------------------

CA job:

Base pay: 72k and expect to receive some increase each year

CA state income tax is 9.3%, which is higher than VA.

I assume all the federal items I listed would be higher too.


Overall, I don't know what my net pay would look like in CA but I'd be open in hearing your estimate.

Other considerations: Things like sales tax and gas prices are also higher in CA. However, I expect to utilize public transit in CA and my job would reimburse most of my public transit costs each month. We would be renting a house and the rental prices are actually around the same as we see here. Buying a house is a different picture though and that would be something for later down the line.

Additional costs: The move itself will be expensive. We would be moving a lot of things from a single family house. I'm not sure if we would fly or drive (we're thinking of doing a road trip if things work out time wise). We currently have 4 cars and may sell 2 of them off (both have over 100k mileage), if it means saving some money for the move. Otherwise we'd need a big trailer.


Let me know if any additional details are required. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Tax question help!,"For the past several years, I have claimed exempt on my W4 and had a certain amount taken out of my paycheck every 2 weeks. With the new tax laws, I saw that the I can no longer claim exempt. Instead, it asked me to multiply my dependents by a certain amount and write that number in. I did that and turned in the W4 to payroll. This morning, I checked my pay stub and see that about 300 was taken out for Federal taxes. Previously, I had 50 taken out of each check and still received a refund after filing. How should I fill out the W4 so that it is more in line with what it used to be? Is that even possible anymore? I make 40k a year and have 2 disabled dependents. Taxes are confusing. Thank you!

\*\* Update\*\* I emailed with my payroll rep and explained the situation. I told her I used the IRS calculator to determine what should be on the form. She is out of the office but said a mistake might have been made when it was inputted on her end and she would look into it first thing Monday morning. When I put everything into the calculator online, it shows that it should be around 30 dollars being withheld each check...not 300. So I don't know what she did.",finance
personalfinance,Just read flow chart- making sure I'm on the right track,"Hey everyone. 

I am feeling pretty comfortable financially lately and like I need to put my money somewhere other than my savings account. I just read the flow chart in detail and I just wanted to make sure that I am correct in my thinking for what would be the smartest place to put my money. 

Income: Just under $50k (last year is was about $43k, $37k the year before that, and below $30k for most of my adult life)

Monthly take home: $2200 + $200 + $600. My job covers domestic partner health benefits so my partner gives me $200 per month as his share of our premium costs. The $600 is a side hustle (it's usually closer to $900 but I have to account for taxes at the end of the year so we'll call it $600).   

Lifestyle: Frugal 

Expenses: I bought a house about a year and a half ago which my partner lives in with me. The expenses on the house are $841 per month. He and I split our other critical monthly expenses (utilities $240, car insurance $140, streaming services $30, groceries/essentials \~ $350, and gym membership which we consider critical $140). For the sake of making this easy I'll round up and call my expenses about $900 a month. 

Retirement: I just started my first job with a 401k option (I'm 30 y/o). My employer offers 5% if I contribute 6%, which I do. My parter is a little older than I am (36 y/o) and he started his first 401k last year and also contribute 6% with a 4% match. 

Debt: Only the house. I have one credit card with great rewards that is always paid off in full and on time. I've never pair interest on this card. 

Savings system: My direct deposit goes into a checking account. I pay the balance on my credit card (in full) first and then bring my checking account to $1500 by putting all excess funds into my savings account (medium interest rate) which I never touch. As a result I save between $200 and $1200 per pay period depending on any fluke expenses that might come up, extra lifestyle expenses, travel, etc. 

Accounts: Checking, usually about $1500. Savings, $35,500.

&amp;#x200B;

So if I'm reading the flow chart correctly is my next move to open an IRA before April 15th and max it out with a $6000 contribution? 

And if so...any thoughts about whats next? I have been very low income for most of my life so when I have money my instinct is to keep it and not risk losing it. But even if I max out an IRA I still have like... 3 years of living expenses that's not really doing much for me. 

What's a very low risk way to make my money work harder for me? 

Thanks for help :)",finance

personalfinance,Workplace 401(K) -- Restricted at 95% to BrokerageLink -- Where to put the other 5%? High risk options?,"So, like the title says -- My workplace funds are limited and/or have high expense ratio. I am utilizing the BrokerageLink option which only costs me $100 annually in fees.

I am putting my payroll deductions into a Vanguard Target Date 2050 Index w/ low expense ratios (only available via the BrokerageLink option).

However, I am only able to put 95% into the BrokerageLink account. This leaves with this weird 5% leftover in the 401K. I feel like I have the option to do something high-risk, high-reward with this small amount?


EDIT -- See below for what some of the options available are for that 5% investment.

* There is one Target Date Mutual Fund (with varying target years) from American Funds [Example](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/rbhex/quote) -- I was trying to avoid this 1.19% expense ratio. Hence, the use of BrokerageLink
* 7 options for bond investments
* 1 ""Short-Term Investment"" in a federal money market
* 15 stock options that I'll break out below
* 4 ""Large cap""
* 3 ""Mid-cap""
* 3 ""Small cap""
* 4 ""International""
* 1 ""Speciality""

Admittedly, I don't know much about those options. I went with the Target Date fund because it is simple to understand and doesn't require a lot of research. (More risky at first, risk tapers down the closer to your target date you get.) 

What do you think puts me at the best position? I feel like I can kinda play around with this 5% and do something a little risky with it. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing Student Loans Led to a 47 Point Credit Score Drop,"I refinanced my student loans last month to get a better interest rate and a shorter repayment timeline. I was happy with the rate I got and was excited about the money I’ll be able to save. However, when I checked my credit score this month, it took a dive from 806 down to 759. Everything still looks good, but my average age of credit is much lower now since my oldest credit accounts happened to be my student loans and those were all closed when I refinanced. Since average age of credit was the main thing I was fighting to get my credit score up to where it was, I’m a bit bummed now that I am taking this step backwards. Has anyone else experienced this sort of drop when refinancing loans of any kind? I tried googling this to see if it was a common problem, but I didn’t see anything about it. People mentioned the hard inquiry having an effect when refinancing (which I also saw, but was a much smaller impact). But nobody mentioned the average age of credit change. Is this normal?",finance

personalfinance,Updating W4 &amp; IRS Witholding Calculator - Numbers Don’t Match,"Some quick facts: Married filing jointly. I currently claim 1 federal/1 state and wife claims 2 federal/0 state. No kids, no home, no real deductions. Our incomes pretty much even and combined gross around $300k.

I input both our W2s into turbo tax and we are going to get absolutely crushed this year on 2019 taxes. Upon inputting my wife’s W2 it says we will owe around $13k federal/$2k state. Fuck. Think issue was she should not have had a 2 for federal. Ok lesson learned, have to fix things so this doesn’t happen again.

My employer doesn’t use a traditional W4, you just input your withholding number and what if any additional tax you want taken out. So I can update to 0 withholding if I wish. My wifes work uses the traditional IRS W4 which is different for 2020. 

First question: is there anyway to have her employer change her federal witholdings from a 2 to a 0? Since form doesn’t allow it anymore not sure how to do this.

I filled out the new IRS Witholding Calculator and found it to be very helpful. Told me exactly what to enter on W4 for me and my wife to get a $0 refund. However I am confused by the math behind the numbers. 

Second question: For me it said for a desired refund of $0, I need $1,053 withheld from each paycheck or $464 more than currently withheld. However it then says enter $125 in additional withholding to accomplish this. My question is why would it only say $125 if I need to withhold $464 more total?",finance

personalfinance,Wife was overpaid. Employer demanding gross repayment.,"My wife was overpaid on December 1st. We noticed it immediately and reported it to her payroll Dept. It was a $24k deposit. Her payroll Dept didn't address it until this week and are requesting the recoup plus the federal taxes, ss, medicare, etc. amount as well. Which comes out to ~$4k. So they want $28k now and are telling her that the IRS SHOULD refund the $4k when we file taxes later this year after they (employer) send us an amended W2. So we will be out $4k from now until we get our tax return and I honestly have little faith that this won't cost us anything. Is this really how this works? Pardon my ignorance, but why can't they amend the pay AND the deductions? Then recoup from the federal govt themselves. This was their mistake, not ours, and it seems like they are the ones getting an easy way out while we are being penalized. Luckily we have savings set aside, but it certainly wasn't to be used to cover the mistake of a billion dollar industry. I would understand if they requested the deduction amount after we file and receive our tax return, but they are telling her that is not an option. I would appreciate any feedback from someone who has experience in this from either side.
**Edit: this money was deposited directly to a checking account and not moved to savings because we obviously knew it was a mistake. We did not gain interest from this. 

**Update: In a comical twist, today employer has offered a repayment plan involving garnished wages for a period of no more than 7 months for the $4k. 

Update 2: Thank you r/personalfinance. I do feel more confident moving forward. I have called the IRS, requested a meeting with her HR Dept where we will discuss the options of deferring repayment of the withholdings amount until tax return is completed, and been given the ammo of calling Texas state Labor board if all else fails. I will post an update when I have one.

Update 3: Called state labor board and they advised to talk to a legal professional. I asked her personal opinion and she said this sounds unethical at best, fwiw.",finance

personalfinance,"Spouse HSA ""Rollover"" Question","My wife has had an HSA through work for years, partially funded with payroll deductions.  Some years (depending on finances) at tax time, we've made an additional cash contribution for the previous tax year in order to bring the contributions up to the family maximum.  I just made such a contribution for 2019 a few days ago when filing our taxes.

I've since begun to think about opening a new HSA account at Fidelity in my name instead of my wife's name (as I'm the main administrator of our finances - the fewer accounts in her name, the happier she'd be).  The plan would be to stop her payroll deductions, and simply fund my HSA account with the full yearly family maximum each year going forward.  I realize that this means that her payroll deductions will no longer be lowering her FICA amount on her paycheck, but she'll be hitting the social security cap either way, so the only downside is that we'll be taxed 1.45% for medicare on the amounts she'd previously been putting in her HSA - but, due to the fees at the HSA through her job, we're better off forgoing that reduction and switching to the no-fees Fidelity account.

We had been just using our HSA for medical expenses as they came up, but I'd like to start investing the new account for the long-term while saving receipts for future reimbursements.  But to simplify things, we'd prefer to just liquidate the original account on medical expenses until it's exhausted, instead of needing to keep track of 2 accounts.  The one issue here is that I just put in a $3k to hit the 2019 max before really thinking about this.

I'd obviously prefer that $3k to be in the new account, but can't roll it over since one account is mine and the other is my wife's.  So my thought was that I could go ahead and put $3k into the new account, and then submit the paperwork to remove an excess contribution of $3k from the old account.  My understanding is that, since this is all for 2019, there'd be no penalty or excise tax, and I'd just have to have the original account custodian cut me a check for the $3k that would be excess (plus earnings, which couldn't be more than a few cents, since it's just earning savings interest rates).  I would think that, theoretically, you could do this kind of backdoor ""spousal rollover"" for as much as the entire $7k contributed for 2019 if done before April 15.

I thought I could dig us out over time, but I feel like I’m just slowing the speed at which we sink at this point. 

I was looking into getting a debt consolidation loan a while back, but because of our issues, my credit has been slipping over the months. I was in the low 700s last year and am now in the low 500s. I can no longer qualify for a loan that would be worth taking on the extra monthly payment. We’ve talked about how a one time injection of a few thousand dollars would 100% turn things around and get us back on our feet completely. We’ve recently started talking about taking $5-6,000 out of one of our retirement funds to get our issues sorted out. I know there’s a 10% early withdrawal fee, as well as the taxes that would have to be paid on it. My question is, how does it all work, and is it worth it? 

I feel like I’ve exhausted all other options at this point. We’ve borrowed money from family, but never more than $300 and we’ve always paid it back. I don’t want to keep relying on people and would really like to just get this whole mess behind us. Like I said, I can’t really qualify for a loan without an astronomical interest rate, and the ones I do qualify for are only for a few hundred to a thousand dollars at this point. I’m constantly getting calls from debt collectors who are never satisfied with “I’m working on it” anymore.

long story short, 

1. my mom bought her current home at height of the housing boom in late 2007/early 2008
2. She had hard time making payments. Ending up getting couple refinancing i believe, which also led to defaulting from 2010 to 2012 while the government modification was going through.
3. Her new mortgage plan through the gov modification started April 2012, with first payment due May 1st 2012.
4. been making monthly payments up today without being late or defaulting.

she lives paycheck to paycheck. I help pay monthly bills.

this is her mortgage. (mom is 59 years old)

* ""Unpaid principal balance"" 345,518.99
* Deferred Principal Balance 59,903.84
* Interest Bearing Principal Balance 285,615.15
* Interest Rate 4.625%
* **40 year term**
* Currently, looks like home is valued at ~$500k according to zillow.

Lets assume downsizing is NOT an option. (although that would be ideal i think. but for now, i want to focus on my questions asked below first)

currently the interest bearing principal balance is $262,303.67 after almost 8 years of payment. (knocked down $23k after 8 years.)

From the mortgage plan, the $59,903.84 gets deferred and does not accrue interest. HOWEVER, this amount is due in full at time of maturity (other conditions exist as well. i.e. I think if she refinances, this amount will also be due)

She does not have any downpayment. So her monthly payment currently is $1,307.06 + like 360 for escrow stuff. this changes yearly it seems. 

with this current plan, and using an Amortization calculator, it seems like she will pay (on payoff date of April 2052) a total of $285,615.15 + $341,773.03 (total interest paid) + $59,903.94 = for a total of $687,292.12

if she refinances, and we assume she gets a 30 year mortgage plan and interest rate of 3.5% (or 100 basis points decrease) looking at the amortization schedule, her monthly payment will be 1,448.18 + 360 (im guessing the same 360 for escrow stuff).

she will pay a total of (with estimated payoff date of feb 2050) $322,502.28 + 198,842.29 (total interest paid) = $521,344.57

So long term, obviously its better to refinance. but ( And lets assume downsizing is not an option. although that would be ideal i think. but for now, i want to focus on my questions below first))

1. are my numbers correct here? 
2. is my the mortgage calculation/comparison done correctly as well?
3. Long term, the refinance is worth it. but how long is the ""long term"" do we have to consider? (I mean my mom is 59 years old right now)
4. what factors do i have to consider? I know closing fees are one (how much will that be?)

thank you. any help is greatly appreciated.",finance

Bitcoin,16th Amendment and The Grace Commission,"We have previously encountered Senator Nelson Aldrich in the context of the [formation of the Federal Reserve in 1913](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEFlPwA8uEE):

Well, it turns out he played a pivotal role in another significant piece of legislation.

The 16th Amendment...

The 16th Amendment states that:

**""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.""**

Now an income tax amendment to the Constitution was first proposed by Senator Norris Brown of Nebraska.

He submitted two proposals, Senate Resolutions Nos. 25 and 39.

However, the amendment proposal finally accepted was Senate Joint Resolution No. 40, introduced by Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island, the Senate majority leader and Finance Committee Chairman.

Clearly, as we have seen in the Federal Reserve story, Aldrich was a man of significance with some pretty powerful friends. The 16th Amendment became part of the Constitution on February 25, 1913. This is the same year in which the Federal Reserve Act was passed, on December 23rd 1913.

The Sixteenth Amendment exempted income taxes from the constitutional requirements regarding **direct taxes**, after income taxes on rents, dividends, and interests were considered direct taxes and ruled to be illegal.

Some would say that Federal income tax on labour has been unlawfully imposed on the American people and kept in place for over a century, contrary to various rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.

But why? And where does the money go?

**Well, it exists such that successive federal governments can continue to pay the interest on money which, since 1913, they have been obligated to keep borrowing from central bankers, and which the government previously could print independently.**

Now of course: the Federal Reserve *is* the Independent Agency that controls the money supply. Don't just take my word for it, this is confirmed by [former Chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w4AUAdN12c).

In 1984, US President Ronald Reagan requested an investigation, authorized in Executive Order 12369 on June 30, 1982.

President Reagan used the now famous phrase, ""Drain the swamp"".

The focus was waste and inefficiency in the US Federal government, and became known as **The Grace Commission.**

Its head, businessman J. Peter Grace, asked the members of that commission to ""Be bold and work like tireless bloodhounds, don't leave any stone unturned in your search to root out inefficiency.""

Members of his team included one hundred and sixty-one top executives, assisted by 2,000 volunteers from the private sector.

They contributed more than $75 million worth of their time and resources to examine all major federal programs and agencies.

In January 1984, the Grace Commission’s work culminated in a report.

The conclusion of that report?

**""One third of all income taxes is consumed by waste and inefficiency; one third is not collected due to the underground economy; and 100% of all income taxes are absorbed by interest plus government contributions to transfer payments.""**

In other words, all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services that taxpayers expect from their government...

So i got my W2 and start looking on TurboTax and I Owe 2$? According to my W2 I made 28646.47, Federal withholding is 1774.83, And i Claim 0. I contribute 4% pre tax/3% post tax to my 401K.

Why would i owe money, i mean i've always gotten a tax return and never owed so i just don't understand.",finance
personalfinance,Will a refinance appraisal trigger a tax assessment?,"I’m thinking about refinancing my home. We did a major renovation on it when we bought it a few years ago with permits through the city, but the current market value on the tax roll doesn’t seem to reflect that. I’m guessing the appraisal for a refinance will find the value is maybe 50k higher than what the city currently thinks it is. The property taxes are high enough as it is, but if they increase, it won’t be worth the savings of the lower interest rate. Will this appraisal trigger a reassessment done by the city and will my taxes go up?",finance
personalfinance,Advice on where to put my money,"I'm looking for advice on what I should be doing with my money. I'm 33 y/o married, no kids, living in NY.  Probably will have a kid in the very near future. I make $160k, wife makes about half that. She pays for housing costs (owned apartment before we met) while I tackle student loans, so thankfully my overhead is low.

One overarching question I have is how to invest my money, especially considering that there is possibly an economic downturn on the horizon. Should I slow my investing; put a lot money it at once/in bulk, or contribute a small amount monthly as I am now?

&amp;#x200B;

* My federal student loan balance is approx. $83k (I've paid off the super high interest loans - the next one is $15,000 at 6.1%. The monthly student loan minimum payment of $1,247.
* I have about $70k in a savings account with a 1.58% interest rate.
* 401k balance is about $33k; I just made a change to do half 401k, half roth 401 up to the max for the year (not sure if right move)
* Vanguard mutual funds of about $19,000. I now auto contribute $1k per month.

I would appreciate any insight as to how best to invest some of the money I have sitting in the savings account (while also tackling my student loans). Thanks!

Edit - should also mention that another option is refinancing my student loans for lower rates. Of course, the i would have the federal student loan protections though.

Update: I just paid over $15k to knock out that 6.1% loan. Really hurts, but thanks everyone!",finance

CryptoCurrency,How does DeFi offer distinctly better interest rates on the same assets than banks? (stablecoins),"Just wondering how a range of different DeFi platforms all seem to be able to offer anywhere from 6-10% APY interest on stablecoins, when so many economies and banks are at record low interest rates?

I know that some like Nexo or Celsius can offer it due to the profits from lending, but how do other platforms without lending afford it?

And for those that lend, doesn’t that mean the interest for the borrower is really unattractive?

Personally I’ve been really happy with what I’ve earnt back from DeFi, and would love to put more capital in but there must be significant risk somewhere in order to offer such high rates? 

What is it that I am missing? Educate me!",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning February 17th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning February 17th, 2020.

# **Stocks expected to rise even as virus creates volatility: ‘The market thinks the worst is over’  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/14/stocks-expected-to-rise-even-as-virus-creates-volatility-the-market-thinks-the-worst-is-over.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks are likely to remain hostage to developments involving the coronavirus in the week ahead, and even so, the market could continue to hit new highs.
*****
&gt; Economists have been reducing China’s growth outlook for the quarter, with some seeing little or no growth and then a bounce back in the high single digits next quarter. The U.S. economy is not expected to take a big hit, but the question for the stock market is how will corporate earnings be impacted.
*****
&gt; “It does feel as though the market thinks the worst is over,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “The pace of change is slowing. None of us really know, and there’s a lot of skepticism, including in Washington that they can’t believe what’s coming out of China.”
*****
&gt; Keon believes the market looks poised to head higher and it is trading as if the virus will not make a big dent in the economy or profits. “The market didn’t really get much of a drawback, compared to SARS or other episodes. There’s no doubt he world will suffer a hit over the first and second quarter and maybe longer,” he said.
*****
&gt; Companies reporting earnings in the coming week include Walmart Tuesday; ViacomCBS Thursday, and Deere on Friday. Hyatt Hotels reports Wednesday, and Norwegian Cruise Lines reports Thursday. Economic releases include Tuesday’s Empire State and Thursday’s Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys, as well as Markit PMI on Friday.
*****
&gt; There are also a parade of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.
*****
&gt; # Profit warnings
&gt; Some companies are already raising warnings, like Cisco which said orders were down and that the forward-looking numbers were not factoring in potential supply chain disruptions. Nvidia said it would take a $100 million hit from the virus, but its revenue forecast was still above expectations.
*****
&gt; Under Armour said its sales will be impacted by the virus, when it projected disappointing revenue growth this week. Estee Lauder said its sales will be hit by a decline in travel-related luxury sales.
*****
&gt; “This is going to start to show up because it will affect supply chains” and exporters, said Keon. “It will have a negative impact. But at the moment, at least, it doesn’t look like it will be a huge deal to companies in the U.S...It will be a factor. The question is, is it a lasting factor that will hurt them through the year, or is it a quarter or two and then gets back to normal. None of us know.”
*****
&gt; About 64,000 people, mostly in China, have been infected and about 1,400 have died from the virus.
*****
&gt; Barry Knapp, Ironsides Macroeconomics director of research, said he sees only a minor impact on U.S. corporate earnings.
*****
&gt; “There will be some hits in some of the consumer companies that have reasonably big businesses in China. I see this as being a fairly small effect on the U.S.,” Knapp said. He said the disruption to the supply chain should not be nearly as bad as it was when Japan was hit by a tsunami and earthquake in 2011.
*****
&gt; He expects stocks to continue to move higher, ending the year higher, but he says the market could run into turbulence in the spring when the Fed discusses cutting back its purchases of Treasury bills.
*****
&gt; For now, the Fed asset purchases, a strong U.S. consumer and the positive benefit to business spending from the trade deal should help drive stocks higher. But by April or May, the Fed could become a negative. “Could we go up another 3 or 4% between now and then? Sure, we could,” he said.
*****
&gt; Knapp said since World War II, market corrections fanned by Fed policy changes have resulted in brief pullbacks, averaging about 8%. He said the market should then rebound. “It trades in a range for a quarter or two and then resumes its uptrend,” he said, noting the uptrend could coincide with the presidential election this year.
*****
&gt; # Resilient market
&gt; Even with the negative news and doubts about the virus, analysts say the market has the momentum to move higher. But Robert Sluymer, technical analyst with Fundstrat, said the market may stay range bound for awhile until there’s more clarity on the virus.
*****
&gt; “I had a 3,340 to 3,360 [on the S&amp;P 500] as the point where the market starts to consolidate, and we’re there,” said Sluymer. “I don’t have a year-end target but I think it’s higher. I think we’re in a sloppy range. I think it’s range bound.”
*****
&gt; But Sluymer also said he thinks the market is just pausing. “Stocks are consolidating above support. The market is acting incredibly resilient and it still looks like an intermediate term pause, a consolidation,” he said.
*****
&gt; Keon said he’s looking for more gains though the market will continue to be swung by virus-related headlines. “I think it’s going to work its way higher, not at the pace you saw last year. But that’s the way we have our portfolios positioned — the market will work its way higher this year,” he said.

# February Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 Up 12 of Last 14

&gt; February’s option expiration day has been down more often than not over the past 26 years with an average loss of 0.20% for S&amp;P 500. Despite a bumpy finish, expiration week as a whole has fared better, but nets an average gain of just 0.47% on the S&amp;P 500 since 1994 with 17 of 26 winning weeks. More recently, S&amp;P 500 has advanced in twelve of the last fourteen options expiration weeks. The week after, has been down 13 of the last 26 years. DJIA and NASDAQ have similar patterns over the same timeframe.

# Trading After Presidents’ Day Weekend Still Weak

&gt; Yesterday’s post, showed improvement the two days before Presidents’ Day Weekend the past 10 years. But the two days after still display a lot of red. Since 1990 Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 12 losses for median gain of 0.14% and an average loss of –0.22%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is net loser down 18 of 30 years with and average loss of –0.50% and a median loss of –0.21%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has greater magnitude of decline. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 30 with an average loss of –0.08% and a median decline of –0.16%. S&amp;P 500 is down 18 of 30, average –0.04%, median –0.11% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 30, average –0.04%, median –0.14%.

# Closer Look At February

&gt; A late month selloff in January saw the S&amp;P 500 Index close marginally lower for the month. But stocks have taken off in February, with the S&amp;P 500 up nearly 4% this month, as US economic data remains strong and fears over the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus appear overblown.

&gt; Historically, February has been a month when stocks tend to take a bit of a break. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat, on average, during the second month of an election year. What is most interesting, though, is how weak October has been historically leading up to presidential elections, yet how strong stocks have been in November and December as political uncertainty clears following elections.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SP-500-index-average-monthly-returns-during-an-election-year.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Maybe the big gains so far this month shouldn’t be a total surprise? “Yes, February historically has been a troublesome month for stocks,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Yet over the past decade, no month has seen better returns.” In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained 2.34% on average in February over the past decade, compared with the second best month of October’s gain of 2.29%.

# A Record Pace of Records

&gt; Let's preface this with the fact that it's still early in the year and the rest of the year is unlikely to closely follow the path we have seen so far, but the S&amp;P 500 is currently on pace for its 11th record closing high this year. While we're just 29 trading days into the year, in the post-WWII period, 2020 already ranks as the 33rd highest number of record closing highs for the S&amp;P 500 in a given year (out of 76). What's even more notable, though, is that at the current pace the S&amp;P 500 would have 96 record closes this year, which would dwarf the total from every other year. For reference, the highest number of record closing highs in a given year was 77 in 1995, and there are only four other years (1961, 1964, 2014, and 2017) where there were more than 50 record closes.

# US Continues to Gain Share of World Market Cap

&gt; The United States dominates the rest of the world in terms of its share of total equity market capitalization. Currently, US stocks make up over 40% of global equities' total market cap. No other country comes even close to this size with the next largest country being China with just 8.47% and then Japan with 7.09%. Hong Kong is the only other individual county with a share larger than 5%. While France is the largest European Union country stock market in terms of the percentage of world market cap at only 3%, the total share of all EU countries shown sits at over 10%. Former EU member, the United Kingdon, is also one of the larger countries but has consistently lost share over the past decade. So far this year it has lost another 0.2%.

&gt; One interesting change that we noted at the end of last year has been the massive increase in Saudi Arabia's share thanks to one of the world's largest companies, Saudi Aramco, hitting public markets. Although it has led to a massive jump over the long run, since the start of the year Saudi Arabia's share of market cap has fallen 14 bps likely due to Saudi Aramco being a one-way trade lower off of its highs that were put in place only a few days after its IPO. Meanwhile, the US has taken another 1.17% of the world's market cap in 2020 alone.

&gt; While there are several individual countries that are actually outperforming the US so far in 2020, generally speaking, the US has outperformed the rest of the world which is why the US has taken more market cap this year. Whereas the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.93% YTD as of yesterday's close, MSCI's World Index excluding the US is just about flat. That trend of US outperformance has been in place for much of the past year well before the coronavirus hit Asia in December.

&gt; Another interesting country to note is China. 2020 has been off to a rocky start thanks to the coronavirus. This had sent the country's share of global market cap plummeting down to ~8% on February 3rd. That was its lowest level since February of last year. But as this month has progressed and the situation surrounding the virus has improved, China has regained some of those losses and is now sitting with a larger share of world market cap than it ended 2019 with.

# Things Are Looking Up

&gt; Stocks had their best week in 8 months last week, as the worst of the coronavirus fears subsided and the US economy showed some impressive resolve. Last, the LPL Strategists discuss why international stocks could finally be close to having their time in the sun after lagging the US for much of the past decade.

&gt; # DEVELOPED MARKETS ARE LOOKING BETTER
&gt; Developed markets have lagged the US for more than 10 years now. Although we aren’t ready to fully invest in these areas, we are starting to see signs to warm up to international equites. As the LPL Strategists discuss, values are historically cheap relative to the US, global growth is stabilizing, growth leadership my start to weaken, and the US dollar should be pressured lower. Should any of those four reasons begin to take place, it could create a nice tailwind for international stocks.

&gt; # THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS
&gt; Equity markets bounced nicely last week, as fears over the coronavirus appear to be calming. The loss of lives is devastating, but markets are focusing on this fast spreading, yet low death rate of this virus versus other dangerous outbreaks. The LPL Strategists noted that China could very well see flat GDP growth in Q1, a big pick up later in 2020 could be likely. Additionally, don’t forget that the US economy actually got stronger during the SARS outbreak in 2003.

&gt; # SOME MORE GOOD NEWS
&gt; Further supporting stocks last week was a trio of solid economic data in the US. The jobs report in January showed a very solid 225,000 jobs created, well above expectations. Additionally, much better than expected manufacturing data and solid services data show an economy that continues to defy the naysayers. Last, productivity in Q4 bounced and for the year it was the highest nonfarm productivity since 2010.

# Another ""Delay"" in the Value Trade

&gt; How many times over the last few years have you heard something to the tune of ""The time for value stocks to outperform is now."" Well, we're still waiting. The chart below shows the relative strength of the S&amp;P 500 Value Index versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index going back to 1995. A quick warning: if you have a sensitive stomach you may want to skip the chart altogether.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/021220-Value-vs-Growth.png))**

&gt; From 1995 right up to the bull market peak in 2000, value stocks couldn't catch a break as they steadily underperformed growth stocks. Those were the days when Energy as a sector was 'dead' and investors couldn't get enough of tech IPOs with trendy sounding names. The low for value stocks on a relative basis came on 3/27/00, and from there the reversal was swift. By April of 2001, value stocks had regained nearly all of the ground they lost relative to growth during the late 1990s. Unfortunately for investors in both types of strategies, the outperformance in value wasn't the result of a monster rally, but instead a massive decline in growth stocks.

&gt; From April 2001 through late 2002, value stocks underperformed again as the Worldcom and Enron accounting scandals cast a pall over sectors like Telecom Services and Utilities - two sectors traditionally comprised predominantly by value stocks. As the dust settled on those two scandals, though, and the economy stabilized, value stocks rallied again as Energy, Financials, and Materials stocks boomed.

&gt; As the Financial sector began to unravel in 2007 and oil prices peaked in 2008, value stocks once again cratered relative to growth. Growth has maintained its lead over value ever since. Outside of some periods where value stocks briefly popped and strategist after strategist came out and said this time the rally is for real, growth stocks have left value stocks in the dust. Just last year, the underperformance of value stocks marked a major milestone as they took out their lows in relative strength versus growth stocks. While the S&amp;P 500 Value Index saw a modest bounce towards the end of last year, any momentum it had has quickly been erased in 2020 as the ratio between it and the S&amp;P 500 Growth index is now at fresh lows.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful 3-day weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,1099-DIV form for less than $10 in dividends,"So in August 2019, I opened up a regular Vanguard taxable brokerage acct. Bought one share of VTI for shits and giggles and couldn't really contribute anymore as I was maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA.

Per the 2019 Summary Report, I had **$1.66** in total dividends ($0.07 from Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (settlement fund) and $1.59 from VTI). 

Now it's tax time, and obviously not getting a 1099 div but they said ""You're still required to report that income to the IRS.""

If I'm not mistaken, the $0.07 from the money market fund should go into **Total ordinary dividends (Box 1a).** But does the remaining $1.59 go into **Qualified dividends (Box 1b)?**

Should I not even report this? It's more annoying than anything. I know Qualified dividends have lower tax rates so maybe I should throw the whole $1.66 into Total ordinary dividends to play it safe?

Any help/advice would be much appreciated. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Another one of those ""how much house can I afford"" posts","Husband and I are both 26 years old, been married for almost two years. Husband and I make 122,000 combined before taxes, which equates to $6,499 take home pay. I put 8% of my salary into retirement (5% match, plus 3% to a ROTH IRA), not sure of the balance on these accounts. He has about $10K in retirement savings, not exactly sure of what he's putting away for that right now. We both have stable careers, and both can retire early. I can retire at 50 with a full pension, and he can retire at 58 with a full pension. I get a raise every six months, and he gets a raise yearly. 

Current bank balances: 

$51,500 in savings 

$2,800 in checking 

$5,000 in a separate car savings for me 

retirement accounts unknown, but probably each around $10K and growing. (which we will never touch) 

Current debt:

$69K mortgage (house is worth approximately $95K, completely new interior, dry basement system, and limited maintenance at this time). We have been paying $800-$900 on the house per month, instead of the minimum. 

$60K my student loans (through the government, will be forgiven in 8 years due to my job). I pay approximately $400 a month for the loans. One of them is almost done, which will drop off $60 a month. 

$80K husband's student loans. We have been putting $1,000-$1,200 a month toward them. They've gone from 105K to 80K fairly quickly. I think the interest rate is 5% with Sofi. The minimum payment is around $750

$8,100 personal loan for waterproofing the basement. We are planning on putting our entire tax return toward this balance, which will bring it down to around $5,800. We have been making double payments on this, and have paid down the balance from $10,500 (starting paying in July or August of last year) to current. Interest rate is 9% so we are trying to be pretty aggressive. 

No credit card debt or car payments. 

Current bills:

$689 mortgage (taxes and insurance) 

$212 for a personal loan for the basement (minimum payment, we hope to have this paid by summer)

$1,000 husbands student loans (minimum payment is $750) 

$400 my student loans 

$125 gas bill (average)

$65 electric bill (average) 

$135 per month dog food (it seems like a big expense to me) 

$150 gym membership for me (never giving it up, I like what I like) 

$250 cellphone and internet payment 

$20/month trash (60 every three months) 

$26 water/month

$48 sewer 

$160 car insurance for both of us

We do eat out a fair amount on the weekends/go to bars, but we have been cutting back on this lately to put more toward debt/his student loans and the basement loan specifically, and we have been fine with it. We are also fine with cutting back more. 

Total bills including mortgage: $3,280. We have been toying with the idea of buying a new house. The houses we are looking at are for forever homes. Our loan officer said we are approved up to $400,000 if we have a renter in the house and we DON'T sell. We were looking at 250,000-300,000 homes, which for 300,000 we could definitely get a forever home with most upgrades. 300,000 would be about a $1,700 mortgage payment, and by the time retirement rolls around we would have it mostly paid.

financialindependence,"""FIRE after Windfall"" Scenario","I was thinking about different hypothetical FIRE scenarios and I came up with one where it seems too good to be true so I decided to make a post and see if there are any holes in my understanding. The two areas of consideration are federal taxes and health insurance.

Situation: As a married (filing jointly) couple you end up with a windfall (inheritance/selling a business/crypto gains/etc) that nets you 3 million dollars in a lump sum after any applicable taxes have been paid. You invest that money using the three-fund approach with the intent to have a safe withdrawal rate of 3% (90k per year to start) and you quit your job. The first year you pull out 90k over the course of the year. However, a minuscule amount of this is taxable since the initial 3 million was already taxed and there are small capital gains relative to the initial investment. Your taxable income from the federal and state government is essentially zero and none to very minimal taxes are due.

Further let's say early on in your retirement the market does very well and you end up having a portfolio of six million after a few years. Let's say you are now pulling 100k out per year due to inflation. Roughly speaking your taxable capital gains would be about 50k. However, since you don't have any other income you'd be paying still zero capital gains tax on those 50k gains as it's below the 78.51k + 24k standard deduction before capital gains kicks in for a married couple. In fact, you could presumably pull out up to 200k total (100k basis + 100k gains) and still not have any federal income tax (although this wouldn't be advisable as it would divert from your 3% SWR plan). Do I understand how this works correctly? Note that state income tax might still apply dependent on the state you live in.

Secondly, health insurance is now no longer available through your employer after quitting so you have to find some through a marketplace. However, because your MAGI is less than 4 times the poverty level you qualify for a subsidy. Further, during the first few years of retirement you actually are below the poverty line since the lion share of your yearly money is taken from funds in your investments that already have had taxes on. So you actually are eligible for Medicaid in the early years, followed by a long stretch where you are eligible for subsidies.

Of course, the initial setup here is the oddity in that you end up with a lump sum of 3 million after taxes which is not a common situation. However, if that was the case, is there something regarding federal taxes or the current health insurance marketplace that I'm missing?",finance

personalfinance,Saving all my money ultralow risk treasury ETFs?,"Banks (online or brick and mortar) do not offer high enough interest rates when it comes to savings accounts, CDs lock up your money and laddering CDs, even though it frees up money, unlike CDs, accrue less money compared to a long term CD.

So I was thinking of investing the majority of my savings in low-risk treasury ETFs (like iShares Short Treasury Bond ETF ) that pays (irregular) monthly dividends, reinvesting the money leads to higher returns because the interest rate is way higher than those offered by financial institutions. And making it an investment means I have liquidity and can pull out any time.

I am being quoted interest rates of 2.8% (15 year) to 3.5% (30 year) for mortgages. But all of the calculators seem to show my payment on the 15 year loan will be about the same as it is now (less than $100 a month difference). I have no desire to start the clock over on a 30 year loan. Am I missing something here? Is there some reason to refi? I can't see it. But I've refi'd loans on other houses before to save money. I guess when I was younger I saw no problem having a new 30 year loan, but that makes no sense now, for what I can see. And the 15 year loan nets me so little in savings, it seems not worth it.

Honestly I could pay it off a few years sooner if I buckled down a bit but it's not a huge deal, I'm fine with that timeframe. I enjoy traveling now while I'm in good health, I'm not waiting for retirement to pursue my passions and hobbies. 

I'm fairly conservative, overall financially, my savings are in a Vanguard 401K and some index funds of other savings. I feel pretty set there. I have no desire to play the market or invest in MJ stocks or rental property or do any other risky schemes I see around, for people who want to FIRE early.

Got promoted at the same company the first week of Jan 2020. I got a good raise but went from hourly (non-exempt) to Salary (exempt). 
My paychecks have been smaller than expected and i think it is due to my federal tax, which seems to have increased. I believe my raise puts me in the next tax bracket (22%-&gt;24%). The increase seems a bit more than that. Especially because i believe my OT was already taxed in the higher bracket.

My previous position had overtime built into my schedule, three 12hr days one week, four 12hr days the next. In my state anything over 10hrs in a day is OT.  

Does this increase seem like something is incorrect? I made no change to my exemptions or anything involving payroll so i don't understand the increase. Is the increase simply due to all my normal hours now being taxed at the higher rate?

personalfinance,seeking advice on my portion of a retirement account.,"My mother died last August and I am to inherit 1/3 of her retirement fund, a sum of roughly $64,000.

I’m relatively young (33), my own retirement savings is on-track. I have a mortgage on a tiny 2-bedroom house. My wife and I are expecting a child this year and we plan on having at least one more after that. My wife has roughly 40k in student loan debt. We want to move into a larger home within the next 5 years.

According to the investment bank who currently holds the money, I have these options:

1. Roll-over into an inherited IRA, either with them or someone else.
2. Receive the money in installments, over a time period I can specify.
3. receive the entire account balance as a lump sum.

If I choose 3, which is what I'm leaning towards now, the bank will withhold 20% of the balance for federal income tax and 6% (or whatever I specify) for state income tax. I live in Massachusetts. My initial plan is to take the lump sum and use it to pay for my wife's debt. With her debt gone, we will definitely be able to save enough money to move into a larger house in 5 years. It may even cost significantly less than 40k to do this, since one of her loans has agreed to settle for a much smaller amount, and she might be able to get the others to settle as well.

My main concern with doing this, is what will happen to my tax bill next year. Our gross income last year was $124k, assuming we do about the same this year, this inheritance will put us at $188k for 2020. I'm worried that 26% may not be enough withholding, and I will wind up with a huge tax bill. I have a healthy savings that would hopefully provide a safety net if that were to happen. But I'd prefer to avoid that situation if possible.

I have no idea who to talk to about this situation. My father is vehemently against the lump sum payment because he says I will be screwed at tax time. My brother has no idea what is best for me. He himself chose to roll-over the money into his retirement fund. But he's already well settled with a house a no debt (besides a mortgage). 

At this point, I'd be willing to pay someone for some decent advice, who could actually crunch some numbers to give me a clearer picture of my options.

I contacted HR at work to see if there was anyone I could talk to about this and there is no one. Who should I talk to? A CPA? H&amp;R Block? On Monday I will call my credit union to see if there's anyone I could speak to there. In the mean time... Anyone here have a suggestion?",finance

personalfinance,"Are my calculations on future tax withholdings correct, or am I thinking wrong?","So, last year was single 0 for tax deductions from my pay check. Also had from 8% to 12% withheld for 401K.

I made $110K and total adjusted income was at $86K after standard deduction and 401K contributions. 

I am receiving about $1,250.00 refund.

My thinking is,  I raised my 401K to %16 and changed my tax status to single 1.

Instead of loaning IRS money I thought investing it in 401K to be the wiser choice.

I will keep contributions at 16% or even up it to 20% as I will be 50 yo at the end of this year.

So more money I contribute less total adjusted income.

So I would have  like $18K to $22K less the projected $110K (ish) I plan to earn this year.
Plus the standard deduction of $12,200.

Is this good thinking or should I return to single 0?  Which will leave me shorter on weekly payroll.

I would hate to end up having to pay the IRS at the end of the year,  but also hate to loan IRS money when I could invest in 401K.

He said I would be paying $13,500 in April and June.

That timeline doesn't really match up with what I'll be paid when since by April 1st I'd only have made $18,200 and I have roughly $4500 per month in expenses, and by June I would have even less at my disposable.

I could dip into savings to make the quarterly payments but I would *really* prefer not to.

Why are Q2 and Q3 payments so close together???

Is there a way I can just pay the taxes on a shorter interval (like monthly)?

EDIT: Also, I already filed my W2 and received my return for 2019 taxes.  Not sure if that makes a difference.",finance
personalfinance,Recieving calls from debt collectors several times a day. Have yet to have a reported delinquency on credit report.,"I have a feeling I know what the debt may be about. Its a medical bill about ~$500 that wasn't covered by insurance and its from almost 3 years ago. I couldn't afford to pay it off at the time and I sorta forgot about it. The doctor had never contacted me about it and neither did my insurance company (I only found out about the bill by casually looking at online claims sometime after the bill was apparently posted) ... so it kinda slipped my mind over the years.

Anyway, I never picked up the phone when the debt collectors called, but sometimes they leave an automated voice message saying someone has debt and to call them back. I was wary (and kinda hopeful) of calling them back because I assumed it was spam like those fake IRS phone calls with foreign accents lol.

But assuming there is some legitimacy to my bill being sent over to collections ... how should I move forward? I know I effed up my credit report/score for 7 years if the debt is reported as a delinquency, but since  it's actually yet to have been marked in credit report ... how should I proceed with the situation?",finance
personalfinance,When to think about refinancing?,"Hello,all.

Wondering when/if it makes sense to refinance?
I bought in Jan 2017 for $124,000.
Loan amount was $117,000.
Current balance is $111,581.
The interest rate is 4.25 for 30 years. The PMI is $36.32 per month.
Similar houses on the street have been selling for 139-140K.

This was my primary residence in Texas until I moved to the East Coast in Jan 2019. I bought the property on my own. My husband and I do not own a home on the East coast and don’t plan to buy either. Our household income is 140K and as we work in the public sector and are very happy in our roles, we don’t expect any large increases in income anytime soon. 
My in-laws along with property manager and housekeeper are running the Texas house as an airbnb and we’re in the process of leasing out the house full-time.

At what interest rate would it make sense to refinance? What are typical fees and how do those get added to the calculation?
Is it better to refinance at 30 years or 15 years?

btc,My top 5 (and more) arguments against the mining tax as implemented in ABC 0.21.0,"These are mine, but I'd like to hear yours in the comments!

---

1. __Corrupting influence__. Mixing monetary policy (money supply regulation, in Bitcoin: coin creation) and fiscal policy (roughly: government spending and taxing) is what central banks already do, and we know the results. Bitcoin was not designed to deliver such a mix - the newly created coin was, up to now, fully __owned by the miner creating the block__, and matures after a certain time when it can be spent. Miners can voluntary spend their coinbase outputs to other parties already. In this way fiscal decisions are decentralized as much possible - meaning every miner / pool gets to decide how to spend 100% of their mining block reward (or share thereof). Do you already see how Bitcoin's design removes all possible financial intermediaries - including any trusted ""government"" or ""fund"" that decides how to spend other peoples' money? If so, you already get my first point. Peter Rizun has mentioned the legal concerns around directing colluding miner funds to certain entities with expectation of results. IANAL, but I think the argument that instituting such a change on protocol level could bring BCH into conflict with security law (Howey Test) should be seriously examined.

2. Due to how information is distributed, __a centrally planned economy cannot match the efficiency of the open market__. A free market is all that is needed to fund things. Miners and anyone else can already fund any kind of development (or other activities) through the existing protocol. Furthermore, we know there are successful methods of funding public goods in voluntary ways through Assurance Contracts. These have not been deployed on Bitcoin Cash before (early crowdfunding systems didn't implement them properly), but are basically ready to go now (Flipstarter) and could offer BCH an improvement even over other successful systems like Monero's Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) due to the fact that we can do this non-custodially via Bitcoin Cash scripts. Going for a miner tax based ""dev fund"" with nebulous administration and all the accompanying hazards seems a poor choice before we tried the voluntary route which preserves the original economic freedom and incentives of Bitcoin Cash.

3. __Increased centralization of mining and development__. Going with the plan would work counter to a decentralized protocol client environment, and centralize even more power with the dominant client (ABC). The donation address whitelist is hardcoded into the client. Miners/pools who don't obey the new rules of contributing 5% of block reward to active whitelisted addresses have their blocks orphaned, lowering the chain hashrate (security) and driving away small miners who might not be able to afford the margin. This centralizes mining on BCH beyond what's necessary. Again, a free market will deliver better security and service!

4. __Sold with a veneer of false pretenses__. We are told that other (non-BCH) SHA256 miners will effectively pay the cost, but this argument has been effectively debunked. The cost is paid for all BCH holders, as it comes out of the agreed upon money supply inflation. It comes at the cost of lowered BCH chain hashrate = security, with the concomitant increased risk of other miners executing attacks on BCH. Yet, holders don't get to vote right now, except by selling their BCH or converting it into hashpower. Did you know financial markets can offer instruments to let holders express their opinion about possible futures (whether they'd prefer one outcome or another) with slight or no punishment in the case of no split - i.e. actually could facilitate a no-split outcome that many BCH users &amp; holders recognize as preferable?
Another pretense is that the plan, if successful, would terminate after a limited time. This is not what regularly happens in taxpayer-funded government programs, and it is paradoxical to assume that a measure to support ongoing maintenance and development would, if deemed successful in a trial run, be expected to be terminated. Especially if the people receiving the funds are literally the ones deciding and writing the rules. In governments we at least came up with separation of powers (legislative, judicial, executive). Why should be mix up powers again? Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Serious developers also recognize that the dollar amounts we are talking about in the proposed plan are too low to expect completion within the previously announced limited timeframes. Giving a good hint that the limited timeframe was a nothing but a public pacifier when planners already expect it to continue.

5. The proposal is __poorly conceived in terms of safety against malicious activation__. Only 66% of hashrate need to vote for it over a two week period. Previously, BCH miners objected to any form of hashrate voting on BCH with the argument that it is still a very-low hashrate minority fork. That has not changed materially, but suddenly we are supposed to accept that hashrate voting on our minority coin is safe. Can't have it both ways.
As an additional point, there is __no 6 month sunset clause__ built into the implementation, and it seems removed from the plan agreed between ABC and miners (as per recent ABC website post). This completely reneges on the ""update"" previously presented to the community in that regard, re-affirming that there is no serious commitment to ending this after a limited time.

I probably squeezed in too many explanations.

Originally my aim was to get a short summary. I should try to sum it up better, but I know there are many people who could do a much better job at that. Please speak up, correct me where you feel I'm wrong, and add points that you think are missing!

P.S. I fully realize that the ones pushing this plan are not likely to be swayed by any of these arguments.

I am presenting mine here in hopes to encourage further discussion, and I hope you will do the same, so everyone is armed with knowledge, going into what looks like it could be an escalating dispute within our community.

Perhaps though, there is a minute chance that backers of the plan could see the danger in the split that they are creating. I still have hope, but I'm also prepared to act.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Two USPS Certified Mailings have gotten lost en route to a debt collector.

personalfinance,"Do you pay taxes on income, or profit (less mortgage +improvements expenses) on a personal rental?","Hi!

My wife and I are thinking about trying to rent out our house instead of selling it this year. We still have a mortgage on it of $1,000/month. We think we can rent it for $1,300/month.

ethereum,A DAG size re-consideration proposal,"I understand how it is going to be in the Ethereum community discussing Proof of Work issues, I mean a community based its security on PoW and ironically indifferent about it.In this community nobody has a clue about PoW, why should he or she? They are killing themselves to get rid of it and build a stupid reputation-based system and start printing money out of thin air, without consuming energy just like how feds are doing this, why not? It is so easy peasy, deposit some coins (PoW generated coins by the way), be an honest player (By running EF client software) and dada you are a member of the club.

But even as a stupid PoS enthusiast, one should reasonably understand that PoW is there and is doing its job and will continue to be in charge for a long time and deserves close attention instead of being considered an abandoned topic.

It is why I bring forward my proposal: Improve Ethhash for recycling 2 gig Dag size to avoid retiring 4 gig  GPUs.

An educated person, with a deep understanding of what PoW is about and what it is not, can easily figure out the reasoning behind this proposal and a stupid one with a mind full of garbage rhetoric about how bad is PoW and how good is PoS or an irresponsible person who does not understand how critical it is to take care of mining issues in Ethereum won't be satisfied with any form of reasoning.

Although we have ProgPow proposal that looks to be a sign of responsibility, I'm telling you, it is not! The way this proposal, ProgPoW, has been handled from the first day dramatically proves me right: ProgPow is biased toward Nvidia while a significant majority of GPUs in mining scene of Ethereum are AMD and ProgPow is designed to keep the current bloated DAG file AS IS another sign of NV bias because their cards tend to be 6 gig and more.

Briefly speaking: Ethereum DAG file is growing and it will retire a significant portion of GPUs currently keeping it safe,  in favor of NVIDIA cards and ProgPoW is making it even worse, fix it ASAP.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Tips on getting out of debt,"When I was starting my Startup I ended up bootstrapping and it took a huge  toll on my financials which ended up leading to me almost 50k in debt. However I am grateful that I am out of it now. Thought I'd share some tips:  


* Put your debt in an excel sheet. Pay off minimum for all of them and start focusing on the smaller ones and tackle them one by one.   

* Go over your bank accounts and look for re-incurring subscription of services you do not use such as gym memberships, Netflix, Cable, and the list goes on.   

* Bank fees may not seem a lot but they slowly add up. See if your Bank offers any free accounts or having a minimum balance to waive the fees.   

* If you have maxed out credit cards that you cannot pay with high interest look for promotional credit cards with low interest. So if you’re paying 20% interest and can get a promotional rate for a year on a new credit card might as well transfer over your debt and save that interest.  

* Line of Credits are great as well as they usually have lower interest rates compared to Credit Cards.  

* Call your Cable,  Internet and cell phone provider and negotiate a better  plan. Most of the time if you tell them you are cancelling to go to another provider they’ll transfer you over to retention and offer you a cheaper and better plan.   

* If you need to buy something look for discount coupon codes, wait for sales, or see if you can get a used product for much cheaper on Kijiji. Please do note that time equals money so don’t be spending all day looking for a deal where you could have been spending that productive time else where.  

* Use Reward cards to collect points. They may not seem like much but they do add up in the long run.   

* Cooking and Making Coffee at home. This saves a lot of money. I know my coffee runs were just adding up.   

* User eBates to get some cash back when doing online shopping.   

* Stock up on products that are on sale. If you usually buy some sort of product every month such as hair gel and its for sale why not stock up? Also just buying in bulk at Costco helps out as well.

personalfinance,Car Loan: Short vs Long Term; Personal vs Automotive; More vs Less Down,"I’m looking into buying a car and have a couple questions on how to go about it. 

The car I’m looking at is $15K USD, and last I checked (~9 months ago when I applied for a new credit card) my credit score was ~815. I currently don’t have a car so trade in isn’t an option, and that’s also why I can’t really wait until next year to buy. 

**Short vs Long Term:** I’m going to pay off the car by April of 2021 no matter what. Just based on what I have in my savings specifically for the car and what I am basically guaranteed to make in bonuses this year, this won’t be a problem. As such, is there an advantage to getting a short term loan over a long term one? With long term I would have lower monthly payments which would be nice so that the added expenses of insurance and gas won’t make my budget too tight. And then when my bonuses come in this year I can just make large payoffs. 

**Personal vs Auto:** looking around, it seems like I can expect 3.5-4.5% interest on both a personal and auto loan with my credit score. Assuming they are comparable, is there any reason to go with auto over personal? My main reason for asking is that with a personal loan I could purchase the car with my credit card (assuming the dealer allows that) and then immediately pay that off with the loan. Ultimately I’m just reaping free points with that scenario. 

**More vs Less Down:** is there a benefit to putting more or less down (basically getting a larger loan over a smaller one)? That is, if I have $8K to put down so I’d only need a $7K loan, should I do that? Or if I got a larger loan ($2K down, $13K borrowed) would I potentially get a better interest rate (because they’re more likely to make money off me)? At which point after the interest is locked in I can just add the extra $6K I intended to put down into the first payment. Basically, is there an optimal % of the car cost that I should put down pre-loan?",finance

I have been in the US for 8 years. I come from a country where you work to make it through the day and there is not much retirement planning since savings is not doable. Coming to the US has been a culture shock and I have had to learn so much throughout the years. 

Although I don’t make a lot of money right now, in 2020 I want to work on my finances and planning for my future.I want to start making smarter choices and start working towards financial stability. 

I’m 32y/o. I have a stable job, I’ve been working there for about 4 years. Here is info about my current financial situation. I’m listing just my income. I’m married and we do split mortgage payment, and bills. We combine both our incomes, but I wanted to list just mine to see what I can adjust to prepare for the future. My wife has a lot more in her 401k since she’s from here. I only got a 401k since I started working at my current job.

Annual Salary: $41,000 
401k: Current balance $5150 (contributing 2%)
Pension: I don’t know exactly how pension works, but on my paperwork it says that based on 3% annual increase at age 65 I should have $32,294.

Car loan $1500 balance. I’ll probably be done by sept 2020

I was also thinking about paying extra $200 on my mortgage. My current principal and interest payment is about $544.99. According to Ramsey mortgage calculator, if I were to pay extra $200 a month I could be done paying my mortgage in 12 years. Should I do this or refinance my mortgage for a lower interest rate?

My W4 is married with an allowance of 2 for federal and married with an allowance of 1 for state.

I figure this is because of we've crossed the boundary into a higher tax bracket and the withholdings throughout the year weren't enough to make up for it.

- Started working from 16 and saved almost everything. (My NW was $1.5k when I started school, and I was SO proud. Started reading /r/personalfinance.)
- **Silver lining:** got lots of scholarships/grants because of my economic status.

**Ages 18:**

- Enter university with intent to **study English and Rhetoric** because it suited my poor, broken heart and I was GOOD at it. Not living at home–""fuck that shit,"" was my thought at the time–cut off all contact with parents.
- After years of being underinsured as a child, finally diagnosed with a heart problem. Get a pathway in heart zapped closed. $17k medical bill after insurance. Wrote a letter explaining my financial circumstances... final bill down to $5k, paid off over next couple years.
- Obsessively read /r/personalfinance and /r/financialindependence because I wasn't going to get into the financial clusterfuck my parents got into. Our family fell apart because of money. I won't let that happen again.
- **On food stamps with $300 in my checking account** halfway during freshman year, thinking during a moment of despair with the medical bills, *there's no financial future with what I'm studying*.

**Ages 19-23:**

- Took up a coding challenge from Google after taking a couple CS classes on the side while juggling Rhetoric classes. Did well, got an interview at Google for a FULL TIME position software engineering... at 19! They wouldn't let me interview for an internship because it was too late in the internship cycle. Bombed the first interview because was nervous (it was GOOGLE!) and because it was my first tech interview... ever. I laugh about this now, but it was *devastating* to me at the time. But that was the moment I thought, ""maybe I COULD do this,"" and went all-in for the CS degree.
- **Struggled immensely through computer science degree** and depression/anxiety/ADHD/PTSD. I didn't like CS.  I had to take 2 semesters off because CS at school was so hard, and I was still struggling emotionally with my past. During my breaks I worked to keep me afloat. Eventually reconnected with my mom, which was really good, because I lived with my mom and her fiance during my first semester off. (So other than those 5 months, I lived outside ""home"" since I was 18.)
- Work as an undergraduate TA teaching computer science which paid $30/hr through college.
- Got two software engineering internships (paid $30-40k each)
- Started Roth IRA, couldn't max the first couple years but did the last 2? years.
- **Graduate at 23, 5 years after entering school** due to semester breaks and major change. 
- Got a software engineering job at one of the places I interned at. 
- Paid off **$30k in student loans** over the years. Final nail in the coffin was the signing bonus. Debt-free, all by myself!

**Age 24:**

- Spoil mom with tech gadgets and things she's always wanted.
- Happy, two-year (and more, hopefully) relationship with loving boyfriend and asshole cat.
- Unhappy at work, but learning to cope. Wanting to shift away from backend work to frontend/mobile/UX.
- Just got an offer to reinterview at Google, 5 years after my first interview... roles seem to be a good fit for me. Wish me luck! :)

**Goals:**

- FIRE at 35 with SO who FIREs at 45. He wants to be a high school teacher, I want to be a vet. 

**Other info:**

- Yes, I'm unhappy in my job and suffered greatly through my degree. **Would I have still switched to computer science if I could do it again? YES.** The initial surge of post-graduation income is fucking worth it, the skills are valuable, and there are good people in tech. I'm a scrub in the software engineering world but after a couple years I could transition into something more fitting for me (UX design or frontend engineering hopefully!) 
- Yes, SO is a filthy tech person too. We split finances. Our relationship is good. Our first 1.25 years were BAD. Again: MY mental illness is not pretty, and I'm so thankful he saw the best of me through these years.
- **Yes, I'm still mentally ill and it doesn't go away with money.** I'm being treated with ADHD med (non-stimulants) and probably need an anti-depressant soon, because work sucks and my current medications kill my appetite. **Dealing with my mental illness has been much harder than transitioning into computer science from English**–and the suffering has been twice as great. Let that sink in a bit.
- I'm really proud of how far I've gone and I'm grateful to the /r/financialindependence and /r/personalfinance subreddits for providing the info required to get me here! I wouldn't have done it all without you! I recognize I was fortunate because I started from $0, not the negatives, and had a lot of financial (self-)education from the internet before adulthood.
- Yes, I didn't transition into CS with 0 background knowledge: I knew HTML and CSS coming in (no actual programming languages). But anyone in the field would tell you that HTML/CSS isn't anything like software engineering–it's for formatting websites–so in many ways, I did start from scratch. :) I took the couple CS classes my freshman year as a breadth requirement because I thought it'd be ""just like HTML/CSS"", but man, like HTML/CSS it is not...",finance

investing,Understanding TMF (x3 leveraged US treasury),"If you are someone who thinks leverage is scary, feel free to stop reading now.

I'm interested in the TMF fund (x3 leveraged long term US treasury) but trying to understand the performance. Mainly, it has a yield around 0.7%, why?

It appears that the fund has capital / price appreciation in place of yield, since the price is up x3 since 2009. I would have initially expected with a x3 leveraged fund that you would get x3 the yield (minus leveraging costs).

Is it low yield because the exposure actually comes from derivatives and such that do not actually hold the bonds and get the yield payouts? Or is the fund structured in such a way that it doesn't pay out the yield? I tried to read the prospectus of the fund and didn't find anything on this (but its very long and dry so I could have missed it).

As someone in a high tax bracket and very underweighted in bonds currently, the fund is appealing because I don't really want yield/income and would prefer capital gains. Plus US treasuries are just about the safest thing you could leverage on, so there is only interest rate risk. Personally I see potential for more downtrend in the rates and very little chance of rates increasing unless inflation shows, at which point I would exit this position.",finance

I called Sallie Mae a couple weeks ago and the only help they mentioned was forbearance, which itself sounds like a vicious circle of me not being able to pay $800 a month, the interest still goes up, and it keeps repeating.

personalfinance,Best strategy for paying off an interest only mortgage?,"I recently purchased a home and am struggling to determine the best strategy to pay off the mortgage.  The loan is for $840k at an interest rate of 3.0%.  It is a 30 year mortgage with a 10 year interest only period, after which the rate adjusts to max of 8% (12M LIBOR+ 2.25% margin). There is no penalty for early payments.   As of now, I do plan to stay in this home at least 15-20 years as I raise my children.  In addition to the interest/escrow payment, I also hope to set aside about ~$60k per year to apply towards principle (this money does not include money that I will also be investing directly into retirement accounts).  The 3 payment options I see are as follows:

1) Each month set aside money in a savings account and make lump sum payments towards principle on an annually or semi-annually basis.  The advantage to this is that my interest payment will gradually decrease over time so with each payment I will have more available money to apply towards principle or other investments.   

2) The money I set aside each month is invested.  Rather than gradually payoff the loan over the first 10 years, my investment will grow over that 10 year period.  At the end of the 10 year i.o. period I can either make a large lump sum payment towards the principle or refinance the loan.  The advantage is that I can potentially significantly grow my net worth over that 10 year period so that the ~600k set aside can be enough to payoff the loan in entirety with a surplus.  I do realize the risk involved with this if there were a market downturn, but I would aim for lower risk investments. The downside is that my interest payments stay the same over the 10 years so I have less money available to spend, save, or invest.  Also, I will need to account for capital gains tax when I withdraw the investment to pay off the mortgage.  

3) Invest the money as in option #2, but at 10 years just begin interest+principle payments for the remaining 20 years as the loan is structured.  This does not seem palatable, as my monthly payments will be quite high starting in year 11.

investing,Where to park cash while waiting for market correction?,"I'm a total dumbass. I've let a pretty large chunk of cash build up in a HYSA since 2017. It started because I was planning on buying some more rental property and this was meant to be a down payment. I never bought anything, so I figured I would just hold the cash out of the market for the correction I thought was for sure coming and then dump it all into the S&amp;P 500 or buy more rental property. With the fed juicing the market and cutting rates again, the correction I thought was coming never came. What's worse is the HYSA rates have dropped from around 3% to 1.8%. Now, I'm stuck with this pile of under-performing cash that I want to put to work.

My plan is still to hold off on dumping it into the S&amp;P 500 because I feel that's way too risky at this point. What would you recommend I do? I'm thinking of moving it all into a total bond market index and every month I'll move 5% or 10% over to an S&amp;P 500 index to DCA it into the market until we do hit a major correction. Then, I'll dump it all into an S&amp;P 500 index, or sell to buy real estate. Or, if there is no major correction, I'll at least have DCA'd into the market. 

Outside of the pile of cash I have sitting in the HYSA, I'm in great financial shape. No debt outside of mortgage, wife and I max our 401ks, have real estate investments, have a 6 months emergency fund set aside, and up until 2017 I was using DCA to make regular contributions to a 90/10 stock/bond mix of Vanguard index funds.

personalfinance,Bed &amp; small auto loan to get good credit history established in addition to secured CC?,"I recently posted about my 400 FICO score (medical debt + late student loan payments that are about to go back into deferment) and the small inheritance I’ve received. 

In addition to paying off or settling a lot of the debts, I know I need to get good credit history established. 

I’m planning on opening up a $500 secure credit card and keeping my usage to 30%. With my inheritance, I had planned on buying a car for cash (budget: $12,500) and a new bed for cash (budget: $1000-$1500). But, if someone will actually approve me for the credit (doubtful on the car, solid maybe on the bed), would it be better for my credit to do that instead of paying cash? 

On the surface it would seem so, but I don’t know if this will make things worse due to DTI ratio, or some other thing I haven’t thought about.

For clarification, on the bed I would need to go to a place like Conn’s that’s more likely to approve me with bad credit, and who reports to the credit bureaus. The downsides I can see to this: Not necessarily getting the bed I want due to limited selection and being shoe-horned into a place that will approve me vs going anywhere I want to buy for cash, and paying a little to significantly more due to inflated prices and interest. But if the trade off is helping my credit, is it enough to make it worth it? 

On the car, depending on what the dealer is willing to negotiate, I would be looking at a $15K used car that I would put a very large down payment on ($7k - $12.5k) and lease the rest to keep the monthly payment as low as possible. I’m not sure if this is even possible with my credit score, but the salesperson I have a meeting with Tuesday knows of my bad credit and how much I can put down and still thinks it’s worth coming in to see what they can do. I would imagine that my interest rate either way will be very high, so I’m not sure if it’s worth it for my credit to have a car loan at all, or if I should just wait for a lesser car I can afford off the bat (12.5K out the door) and not even try to lease at all.

I am defending my thesis in a couple of weeks, and to top it all off these are both jobs back in my home state. One of these jobs after some research would likely land me a salary of $55k and the other which was the interview would potentially be slightly more but in a less ideal location (much farther from family and friends). 

I entered grad school with about $30k in student loans and was of course anticipating taking on some more debt for this degree. Despite my best efforts to attend a relatively affordable school that also is highly respected, I find myself where I am now at $80k. I am aware this is less than ideal given the salary I mentioned. This is why I am a bit frustrated since it is so hard to tell exactly how much a graduate degree is going to cost you in the end when you are applying to schools and making your decision. My bachelor's degree was in Community Health Education prior to this so I don't think I need to elaborate as to the limited career aspirations I would have had without furthering my education and branching into some technical skills. Looking back I am not sure how else I could have gotten to where I am and have my debt be any smaller.

* Deferred Principal Balance 59,903.84
* Interest Bearing Principal Balance 285,615.15
* Interest Rate 4.625%
* First payment date May 1, 2012
* 40 year term

(basically a loan of $345,518.99. $59,903.94 of it is deferred from interest. and will be due at the maturity date or when loan ends. So only 285,615.15 gets hit with the interest. And once the ""interest bearing principal balance is all paid off, the deferred value is due in full.)

monthly payments are P&amp;I of 1307.06 and 375.88 for escrow for total of 1682.94

after 8 years, currently the interest bearing principal balance is $262,303.67 after almost 8 years of payment.

with this current plan, and using an Amortization calculator, (on payoff date of April 2052) a total of $285,615.15 + $341,773.03 (total interest paid) + $59,903.94 = for a total of $687,292.12. 8 years of payment, so as of Feb 2020, total interest paid of $99,552.04 so far.

if refinancing, and getting 30 year mortgage at 3.5% interest rates,

* new mortgage loan will be ""current balance + the deferred amount"" = 262,303.67 + 59,903.84 = $322207.51 on principal balance for new loan
* 30 years
* 3.5% interest rate

This comes to a P&amp;I payment of $1,446.86 and 375.88 for escrow for a total monthly payment of $1822.74.

after payoff date, February 16, 2050, a total interest of $198,660.54 will have been paid. for a total overall cost of $322207.51 + $198,660.54 = $520868.05

if i refinance right now, this will save me $43560.45 at maturity date (Feb 2050). (basically, if fees + closing costs + appraisal fee + etc fees are less than $43,560.45. refinancing is worth it)

is this correct? is mortgage calculations and deciding if refinancing is worth it really this simple? or am i missing something? is my math here right?",finance

personalfinance,Car Loan Payout Amount Keeps Increasing Daily Plus general Advice,"Hey guys. So earlier on in life I was reckless and screwed up my credit. I had no idea how it worked and didn't care until last year when it was time to upgrade my car as I blew up the engine and wanted something more fuel efficient as I am now in school. I then learned about credit and saw my score at 528. My plan was to finance a car and refinance and upgrade the car a year later hoping my credit would be good by then getting a reasonable interest rate. My last collections went off my statements in December and my score went up to 686 Equifax and mid 600's Trans since. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am approaching 1 year in June and i just logged into my finance account which I've never paid attention to and just realized that apparently my pay off gets higher every day?? It says my per diem is 5.93 and I am unsure what that means. I remember it was $6.93 at the start of the term. 18.99% rate. Attached is a screen shot. my payment is 139$ bi-weekly. Did my screenshot just not account for that payment on the 20th or how does this work Im slightly confused. Im a student but I saved quite a bit last year. Should I bother putting in a few grand towards the sum now and what would that affect as like i said I plan to refinance in a few months here. Should I use the money on the next car as a down payment. Ill be paying 139 \* 8 until then and I dont care about making the most out of these payments as its quite little. Hopefully my scores can be in the 700s by June. I have 3 cards that I keep under 10% and I could take out more if I needed I guess but I think this should be sufficient to raise my credit . A Fido bill. And an installment loan at 45% utilization from MoneyMart. Should I try and refinance now or wait until my credit is a bit better?

personalfinance,How should I be addressing my current bills/planning my savings?,"It's taken some time but I've finally gotten myself into a stable financial situation. Now I wonder what's the best way to handle my current situation.                

**Overview:**   
I'm 30, single, employed and currently make $60,000 a year on salaried position.    

Recently purchased a home in November 2019 after spending 2018/2019 getting my credit score back up and building up $12,000 in savings. Used about $8000 from this savings for my down payment and misc expenses/fees with buying/moving into my new home.      

From 2016-late 2019, I was enrolled in a debt consolidation program to settle credit card debt I had gotten myself into. The debt was around $28,000 (not including the accumulating interest the combined debt would have continued to accrue).      

Currently owe about $13,000 on a monthly repayment plan to consolidation program (more info on this below).

**Current Savings:**  
$5000 ($4000 in my savings account and $1000 in a Fidelity Roth IRA that I just started in December 2019)     

I also plan to add about $3000 from incoming tax returns and security deposit from my apt that I moved out of.       

**Gross Monthly Income:**       
$3700        

**Approximate Leftover Income After Mortgage/Car Payment/Bills/Expenses:**      
$800        

My questions are how much and where should I be putting my savings on monthly basis?       

The $13,000 I owe in repayment plan to debt consolidation has a high interest rate (22.9%). If I stick with the standard payment plan ($412 a month), it comes out to me actually paying closer to $20,000.      

I want to build my personal savings back up since I feel a little exposed at the moment with only $5000 (soon to be closer to $8000 after tax returns/security deposit from old apt) but not sure how much should be going towards Roth IRA and my regular savings account.      

I also have a rolling estimate of $1500 in my checking account that fluctuates depending on which bills are due throughout the month.      

I think at some point in 2021 or 2022 after building up enough savings, I plan to make additional payments towards the principal on the $13,000 debt consolidation repayment.     

Please let me know if there's additional info that would help with your feedback.",finance

personalfinance,Difference in tax refund state vs federal?,"I filed my taxes recently, and I'm a little confused about the difference between state and federal. 

I got a pretty large refund on the federal (like $2k). The confusing part is that the state is almost $0 (I owe like $20). I claim single and 0, so I don't understand why there's such a difference.  Shouldn't claiming 0 take out more taxes than necessary? 

And if I want to change my withholdings to get both state and federal close to $0, would this mean I should change the federal to 1 but keep the state at 0?

personalfinance,"How do I catch up? I'm 52, way behind, and own a small business.","I'm 52 and my wife is 55.  We are basically starting over financially after achieving a Pyrrhic victory against a patent troll that wiped out our savings and resulted in me filing Chapter 13.  I run a small business that makes $80K - $100K per year, with growth opportunities ahead.  She has a day job that pays about $30K plus benefits.

We only have about $10K in savings, and we're trying to figure out how we get to a decent retirement.  Our house has 16 years left on the mortgage ($249K to go at a high 6.5% interest rate), probably worth $300-310K, but I think we will have to invest about $40K in the house to sell it (a few projects, plus a bathroom and the big one which is the septic).

According to our social security statements, if we retire at 67, I'll have $2500 per month and she'll have $1500.  Plus I have a small pension from a previous employer of about $1500/month.

I complete the Chapter 13 in December 2020 which will free up $1800+ per month, so then I plan to repurpose that payment to savings.  I don't want my wife to have to work until she's 71 when the house will be paid off.

My thoughts are to sell the house and downsize as soon as I can file for a mortgage refinance, which is in about ten months, plus GROW THE BUSINESS (I think this is the biggest opportunity and where I really need to focus), keep working until 67 and then look for an inexpensive place to retire with a modest lifestyle.

I need someone who will help me put together some type of ""catch up"" plan, but I really don't know where to start.  And I don't want to spend a fortune on putting a plan together.

personalfinance,Seeking investment advice to purchase a second property or other vehicles.,"Hi PF, thank you for taking the time to read through.

My wife and I have about 30k and growing in the bank and we're unsure where we can invest it to make the most sense. 

Some background info:

My wife and I recently purchased a home about 1 year ago in a city where housing prices are rising, the city is growing in size, and it is a premier destination for regional tourism. 

We bought the home for 325k at an interest rate of 4.375%. We have 320k left on that loan. It's a VA loan. 

We both have good paying jobs with opportunity for advancement. We bring in about 10k/month. We each invest about 9% in our company 401k plans, including company match.

We have two vehicles, both older. One is paid off, the other is at 7k currently on a 36 month payment plan at 4.74%. We pay about $400 a month in student loans. 

We're expecting our first child later this year. 

In the past year we've paid off a lot of debt from credit cards, furnished our home, and been somewhat loose in our situation of income compared to the cost of living in the area. 

With the way housing prices are growing in the area, I am very reluctant to ever sell this home. Long-term I'd love to make this a long-term rental property (which our area desperately needs). Based on a cursory search, we can likely start renting out our home now to cover all or almost all of the mortgage and property taxes. 

We're open to living just outside the city on more land with our two dogs and growing family, but I just don't know if that's the smart way to grow our wealth. We have not invested in any Roth IRA plans (and I'm unsure if that's a viable option for us considering our income may grow past it), only the 401k through each of our companies retirement plans. We have no other investments currently. 

I am reluctant to work with a large company, I've worked with Northwestern Mutual for a short period, and I want someone to manage our wealth smartly, not sell me a product. I'd love to hear what you all think, to include who I can seek out in the area to manage our wealth. 

Let me know what other info would be helpful.

Thank you all",finance

personalfinance,Doing Taxes and Owe a Lot. Where Did We Go Wrong?,"Hello everyone!

Just wanted to get some help in figuring out where my wife and I went wrong with our taxes this year. I have a pretty good idea about what it was, but I want to just make sure and also figure out how to avoid it this year.

So, in 2019, my wife and I made a combined income of $71,574 and we are filing jointly. This year, we owe $646 federal and $129 state. 

My allowances for Federal are set to 1 and my allowances for state are set to 0. Before my raise in September, I had ~$341.34 taken out in taxes. After my raise in September, I had ~$374.09. Both of these numbers have a -/+ $5 variance.

My wife is a different story. She left her job as a barista, making $2,304 for the time she was there this year, and she started working for one of the top 5 financial advisory groups in our city last February. Fast-forward a 3 or 4 months and we find out that the guy that processes payroll, the tax advisor, hadn't been taking out any taxes. I sat down with him and we did the math of how much I have taken out each paycheck and how much we need to be taking out of hers to get us as close to $0 as possible. I don't remember what the number was, I should have written it down, and he says he will get it fixed. Well... he never did. It totally falls on my wife and I for not seeing it. it also falls on us for not hounding him about my wifes paystubs, we never got any of them until a couple weeks ago.

Looking at the paystubs, taxes were being taken out but it was in extremely varying amounts. I'm talking upwards of $50 differences. One pay period was $15 in state, the next was $30 in state and then $50 in state. This is where I believe our tax discrepancy happened. 

Next year will be extremely different as we are having a kid and my wife will be quitting her job in May. To make sure we don't have this surprise us again, how do I calculate what my wife should be having taken out of her paycheck? Guesstimate what she will have made in May, add that to mine, and math the brackets?

EDIT: I've gone through and done our taxes through both FreeTaxUSA and H&amp;R Block and gotten around the same amount owed.",finance

Bitcoin,"The slippery slope of ""I'm fine with KYC in Bitcoin, I'm not a criminal.

This is the seed of tyranny. There are too many examples in history to count, and even modern examples in countries such as North Korea and China. We don't need privacy, until we do.

In 2013, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) revealed that it had selected political groups applying for tax-exempt status for intensive scrutiny based on their names or political themes.

personalfinance,Sick of WF's low interest rate -- what can I do?,"I have a question about interest, credit, and how changing banks works in general.

I have been using Wells Fargo ever since I first put my money into a bank and I always stuck with it just because it works. However, I realized recently my interest rate was really, really low -- like 0.05% for my savings account. I have 8,000 dollars in my account right now and I know I will make significant enough money if I find a bank with a better interest rate. I know they always say it's key to start early when you are working with compound interest.

A month ago, I spoke to a WF banker to see if there was any way to obtain a better rate. She said if I get $25,000 in my account, my rate will go up to some amount over 1%. However I don't think I will have $25,000 for a while, and I know that I can get better rates than that right now at other places.

So why not just switch now? Seems like a no brainer, except I also have a checking account and a credit card with Wells Fargo. I have heard that your credit score is hurt when you close a credit card and I don't know how complicated it would be to keep my WF card and set up auto-payments from another bank. I also don't know if you can move your savings and not your checking account -- my credit card is auto-paid from my checking and I manually replenish my checking from my savings if it starts to run low.

I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to dealing with major banking decisions, but I understand a decent amount of the basic process. I am looking for opinions on how important interest rates are right now -- and if anybody has been in a similar situation and knows how easy it is to switch. If I can't switch everything without losing credit, then how easy is it to switch just savings/checking to somewhere with better interest and transfer the money between banks to my WF credit card?

personalfinance,I'm 45 and I just want to ask about retirement funds and exiting the market down the road.,"I'm 45 with wife and kid. Sitting on around 4.5x my annual salary in my 401k. Been contributing 10-15% with varying amounts of matching funds since early 2000s. Also have a Roth IRA with some money in it, though not as much as the 401k, only about half my annual salary. I have some short term debts related to home improvements that will be cleared in a year or two and then after that it's just the mortgage and whatever college expenses the kid ends up having.

For the most part I've put the whole amount in my 401k into S&amp;P 500 Index funds, because, from what I've read, most funds have a hard time beating an S&amp;P 500 index fund long term. Also, since interest rates have been so low for so long there hasn't really been a way to make decent money it seems unless you are in the market (I could be wrong, but there aren't a lot of 401k options other than stock funds or bond funds).

I'm realizing that I'm only 10 years away from when I could actually take distributions from the 401k if I felt like retiring from whatever position I'm in at that time. At the same time I'm a tech lead for teams that do end to end business software development so it's unlikely that I would find myself out of a job at 55.

If I think I'm not going to retire at 55, I'm assuming I should probably not take distributions even if I could.

I'm wondering what I should shift the funds into though as retirement age approaches. Targeted retirement fund? Also, when do you make the shift and is it incremental or all at once? The obvious time not to shift funds out of the market would be when it is way down, but that's an extreme case.

If I have no need to withdraw until 59 1/2 I also have the option of taking the money and putting it into a traditional IRA and letting my investment adviser take care of it. I probably should have poured more money into the Roth IRA over the last ten years, but it's much easier dealing with 401k contributions since that money never makes into my slippery hands.",finance

personalfinance,High Yield Savings - AmEx a good option?,"Hi PF! I'm new to this sub, but I'm finally planning to open a high yield savings account so I can do something with the money that's been sitting in my current low yield savings for a while. 

I've been looking at the various options for a while and been incredibly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information, so I finally settled on American Express's high yield savings. It's sitting at 1.75% APY right now, and I know some banks are offering anywhere from 1.85 to 2.2, but at the amount I'm depositing, that would mean a \~$10 difference and I'm not very concerned about that. My main concerns apart from interest rates are ease of access and reputability, especially regarding how easy their website/mobile app is to use, customer care effectiveness, etc.

All in all, I'm wondering- before I settle on Amex and open the account, are there any other things worth knowing or better options worth checking out?

Expenses include $700 rent, $70 phone bill, and $300 in commuting, I spend about 2k on food and random crap. I have no credit card, student loan, or automobile debt. Credit is 790 and rising.

I know interest rates are really low and I’m pretty sure I could put away 20k in cash by the end of the year to help with a down payment.

I have two high interest credit card accounts, both at 24.49% APR that had a total debt of about $8k.  Two months ago I opened a third credit card account with a 0% APR through March of 2021 and transferred $3800 with a 3% transfer fee.  After March 2021, the APR is 19.61%.  The total debt sitting at 24.49% is now about $4.2k.

I’ve been thinking about opening a fourth credit card with 0% APR to transfer the rest of the high interest debt.  Would there be any negative effects to my credit score?  Should I open a new account with the intention of closing it once the balance is paid off (there are a few cards that offer no benefits besides the 0% APR for balance transfer purposes)?  Should I call my current companies and try to negotiate a lower interest rate on those cards?

I’ve been making payments 100% on time for the last 5 years.  Before that I had a few delinquent accounts that are either closed or in good standing today.  Credit score just jumped to 693.  Total utilization is down to 53%.

personalfinance,Filing Taxes: W-2 Box 14 Explained,"Hi Everyone,

I just personally filed my taxes for the first time. I used H&amp;R Block as they have free Federal returns AND free State returns, as long as your Adjusted Gross Income is $69,000 or less (most of the other services offer free Federal returns, but charge for state returns, as can be seen on the [IRS website](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/)).

For the most part, the process was quite simple. Then came W-2 Box 14. My job had two rows in Box 14, each of which had a number and a dollar figure (the number categorized what the dollar figure represented); sounds simple enough until I saw that H&amp;R Block, for Box 14, had a Description tab, which when pulled down had 25 different codes  – none of which were explained what they represented (however, some did have titles that were self-explanatory).

So below I have inserted the Box 14 codes that H&amp;R Block had, with their respective meanings/purposes.

CASDI: **California** state disability insurance

CAVPDI: **California** Voluntary Plan for Disability Insurance

DI: Disability Insurance

FLI: Family Leave Insurance

IRC125S: Pre-Tax Benefit Programs (e.g. HCFSA) subject to **NY** tax

IRC125N: Pre-Tax Benefit Programs (e.g. HCFSA) NOT subject to **NY** tax

KPERS: **Kansas** Public Employees’ Retirement System

SEC125: Employer’s Benefit Program (Cafeteria Plan) receive certain benefits on a pretax basis (e.g. Insurance)

SNY: Start-Up **NY**

STPICKUP: **State** Retirement/Pension Employee Contribution

SWF: Supplemental Workforce Funds (**NJ**)

Two notes: If a code is for a specific state I bolded the state name, also I was unable to figure out what 612B relates to, so if anyone knows please let me know and I'll put it in.

personalfinance,Early 401k (Roth) Withdrawal,"I was gone for military training From Nov 2018 to March 2019. During that time, my previous employer closed a 401k plan I had through fidelity because It had less than 1k in it (like 975 I think). They closed and mailed me a check sometime during december, but it was sent to my parents, so I had literally no idea at all until I got back. I was completely tax/retirement fund illiterate at the time (but have since read up through this subreddit and other places to gain a decent understanding), so when I got back in march/april 2019, I just took it and cashed it because I had no idea what else to do with it.

I know now that you can roll them over into an IRA within a certain time period, but even then, the time period had well past since I got the check mailed. Even if the date starts when you deposit (and not when they send it) then it's obviously too late.

The two 1099s I have for them say that around $130 in federal tax was withheld from my part of the contributions ($630), but on the second 1099, there was no tax at all withheld for the $320 in employer contributions. I'm assuming i'll pay tax on that this April?

I know there's also like a 10% early retirement penalty or something. Is that just 10% of the retirement checks?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I have my home loan setup in multiple mortgages:

1x 1 year fixed @ 4.05% 100k (expires 2020)

1x 2 years fixed @ 4.15% 175k (expires 2020)

1x 4 years fixed at 4.95%  - $200k  (expires 2022)

current interest rates are significantly lower than they were when these loans were signed up for.

the 1 and 2 year fixed rates are likely to drop 0.5 % when they are re-signed in a few months.

I have any spare cash going into the 4.95 % 4 year term as it has the highest interest rate and will stay that way the longest

(likely when the term comes up the rate will be higher again as our reserve bank has signaled rates will be increasing again soon)

my question is if i should be really be paying into the longer / higher interest loan first or if i should be paying the lower rates off first ?",finance

personalfinance,"Debt, low income, crappy location","Edit: thank you all for taking the time to read through and give me advice. It's been extremely motivational.

A few things... Alcohol is bad. I can reduce spending by at least $100/mo with my phone, net, and power (there's a program the power company runs that will reduce your bill to a 12-month average, but you keep a rolling balance.) A few other things as well.

My level of debt isn't the end of the world (as long as I keep making money and don't add more.) It will only go away faster if I make more money. So I need to increase my earnings potential.

The plan forward is to continue making minimum payments and build a moving fund over the next year. In the meantime I'm going to build a portfolio, take on some contract work for experience, hopefully pick up a few certifications, and see where that takes me. I'll be on the lookout for any tech-related job locally, and sooner rather than later I'm going to start applying to tech jobs out of my area.

Again, thanks!

Original post:

Hi, so, I'm in a bit of a mess. 26, live alone, rent, \~$9k in CC debt, no other debts. My credit score is 680, as I'm able to make minimum payments on time. I work 32-36 hours a week (variable, I could pull more hours, but my mental health is *suffering* and I barely cope with what I'm already doing.) I currently work as an assistant manager at a chain restaurant for $12.22/hr plus bonuses based on net profit (anywhere from +$70-$150 a month.) My gross earnings for 2019 was $25k. I claim $0 withholdings because my tax bracket is low, I got a $500 federal refund for 2019, my effective overall tax rate is 9.1%. That worked for 2019 but I'm paranoid 2020 will be a different story. If I pay the regular 23% my employer cuts I literally can't afford to live where I'm at. I keep track of all of my spending via a spreadsheet, here's a rundown:

(this is my sheet for February)

[https://i.ibb.co/RBry8QV/EXCEL-j-Zg-Iir06hq.png](https://i.ibb.co/RBry8QV/EXCEL-j-Zg-Iir06hq.png)

Profit/loss is per month, while rollover includes the profit from the entire beginning-to-date. I should end up with around $600 left over at the end of this month.

(Here's a more complete sheet from November '19 where I worked 10 hours OT. OT is very, very rare and only happens when my boss takes extended time - 3+ days - off.)

[https://i.ibb.co/3dbdMjr/EXCEL-DWgdagi-INX.png](https://i.ibb.co/3dbdMjr/EXCEL-DWgdagi-INX.png)

I've since updated the sheet to have more info, but the gist is the same. Debt payments are around $300 (I forget to pay sometimes and hit a late fee,) rent is $400, power is expensive as fucking shit, can be anywhere from $130 to $200+ (I rent a house, so there's a water heater, well with a pump plus water softener - salt is provided by LL. AC is fucked so I use electric heat - oil heaters provided by the LL ... freeze most of the time, my house is 65° as I'm typing this. Not that I don't have enough heat potential, I don't want a $300 power bill!)

Food is a topic. I was diagnosed with celiac disease in 2017, been eating gluten free ever since. I (thankfully) live extremely close to family who are considerate and include me in their cooking, so most of the time I have a meal waiting on me after work at either my parent's or my aunt's. My aunt is my LL, by the way (lol.) They are all within 1000ft. So I mooch a lot. But I still spend upwards of $200/mo on food for just me. My location is shit and there is one (yeas, one) grocery store that sells GF products. $7 for 9 slices of ""bread"" (quotes because it's ...bread, has the same texture, but a different flavor.) Can you imagine? Bread, sandwiches, pretty much any pre-processed product is a delicacy to me. I try to stick to $50/week, buying whole foods and cooking myself. Hell, frozen pizzas are $6 each and I can only get them at Walmart. They're pretty shitty, too. My boss lets me eat free at work (salads, string cheese) because she feels sorry for me. Although I don't get to eat there most of the time. Shifts are 8+ hours and busy as fucking shit because of understaffing, I don't take breaks.

A bit more about rent. My family is ... separated, that's the best way to put it. My mom does things, my aunt does things separately. I rent my grandmother's old house to get away from my parents (homophobic, religious, my dad is narcissistic, etc.) $400 is so fucking cheap in this area. The house was built in the '70s though, and none of the wiring has been checked. One of my subordinates at work pays $650/mo for an APARTMENT, and that's considered normal in these parts (southeastern Kentucky.) The only way to make it around here is a relationship with two people working towards a common goal. I haven't been that fortunate to meet a like-minded individual, but I've surely lucked out with a stable job and supportive family, so I'm able to (just barely) make it all by myself. And that's really important to me, being self sufficient. (My mom still pays my car insurance, I pay it occasionally when she's hard on cash. It's cheaper to keep it in her name than have separate plans.)

$30-50 in gas per month depending on where I have to go (I sometimes need to travel \~300mi for work, which is reimbursed). Internet and phone bill are as low as I can get them.

Entertainment is a bit high, but it stays for sanity reasons. The rest is alcohol (Big Daddy's) and household expenditures like trash bags, cleaning supplies, etc. I have a dog, so dog food, bones, toys, etc.

I had to replace the breaks on my car this month (the $270 AutoZone charge) luckily my dad and brother are very kind and did all of the labor for a case of beer ($24.)

My marketable skills, besides food service, are programming. Yes, programming in Southeastern Kentucky. I dunno, affinity for computers, I guess. I have years of ""hobby"" experience in Java, C++, PHP, etc. I'm actually wasting time on making a 3D game engine from scratch. I think it'll be a nice portfolio piece, once it's in a functional state. (It WORKS, but, ya know, 100k cubes with the same texture aren't fun to look at.)

I have an associates degree in science thanks to the pell grant, but that's about it. I have plans to start freelance programming, but I'm scared that my skill level isn't quite there so I keep putting it off. For reference, I've been working in C++ almost daily for over a year.

Can't move off for better opportunities because of my debt. My town doesn't have a 4-year school. I made a lot of mistakes in my late teens/early 20s. Just looking for some advice, suggestions. I'd like to be debt free by 2021 but god damn, I dunno. I feel like I'm living the college student lifestyle and I'm not even in college. Do I just not eat and pay off my cards? Consolidate? Go freelance while working my job? Not sure what to do at this point.",finance

Forex,Fixing Rate vs Outright Rate for NDFs,"Hi,

I'm currently interning at a Trading desk in a bank.

Could anyone here explain to me the difference between the 1 month outright rates and the 1 month fixing rate for NDFs?

Here's an example of what I want to figure out:

Suppose the following NDF for USD/TWD:

USD/TWD Spot is currently trading at 30.000 (mid rate)

The 1 month forward outright points are trading at -55/-65

From my understanding, the forward outright points above are derived mainly from interest rate parity and a slew of other factors. 

However, the NDF traders at my workplace also trade the 1 month fix rate for USD/TWD and they are usually a different rate relative to the 1 month forward outright points, and could be trading at -70/-80.

The daily fixing rate for USD/TWD is published 1100hrs (+8 GMT)

&amp;#x200B;

Could anyone here help me understanding the reason behind the divergence between the points? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",finance

Going to simplify the income numbers here:

While living in Minnesota I made 10k in income from my job.

Thing is, my new job is based in Minnesota, but the job is 100% travel and I got lucky and have been able to work from home for the whole time. So, where does that 30k get allocated to? We have to report where we worked as a part of our billing/timesheet process, and i'd list it as Wisconsin.

personalfinance,Refinancing my home? Good or bad idea?,"Hello. I bought my home a year ago with a 5.6% interest rate. The guy who helped us buy our home reached out to me this week saying that interest rates are now at/around 3.4% and he was trying to push me into refinancing. From what he says, refinancing will make it so his company pays the balance on my current mortgage, then they will give me a new one at the lower interest rate.


Is there anything about refinancing that isn't a good idea, or any information he is keeping from me that would be useful to know? Right now my mortgage is $1,124/mo and after refinancing it will be $1,042 (or something close, I can't remember the number he quoted). Lowering my monthly payment by nearly $100 would be such a huge help. I just don't want to do something that ultimately will hurt us in the longer term",finance

I need help. My Father in Law had a stroke last summer. He’s not all there anymore, has difficulty walking, has fallen repeatedly, but is still employed. He has a job as a government contractor at a government site, but the government doesn’t see him very often. His co-workers have been covering for his lack of work abilities for the past year, but he can’t even log onto the computer in his own house, and he has a job as a software tester. He has missed work twice so far this year because he tripped in the parking lot and knocked himself out.
He has finally listened to his co-workers and decided that it is time to retire and/or go on disability. How would one go about doing this? He wanted to call HR and ask them, but we have encouraged him to go see his doctor first (wife taking him to an appointment tomorrow). I just wanted to know what could be done in this situation. He is turning 63 this year, but badly needs to keep insurance and doesn’t qualify for medicare until he is 65. He borderline has enough money to retire, but if he loses his insurance he’d be screwed..

personalfinance,Refinance Logic / Justification,"Trying to find the true / total costs of refinancing my primary residence loan, as some of these online calculators aren't making sense to me. Many sites suggest not refinancing unless you drop a considerable amount in your interest rate.  My home value has gone up roughly $100-150k more than I paid in 2015. 

Current Mortgage:
- 3.75%
- $273,000 original principal ($288k was original purchase price, with $15k down = $273k)
- $247k remaining principal
- 30 years
- $104/mo in PMI
- Originated May 2015

Refi Option 1: 
- 3.375%
- 30 years
- $247k loan
- $3k in closing costs

Refi Option 2: 
- 3.5%
- 30 years
- $300k loan ($50k cash out)
- $3-4k in closing costs

When I type in either of the Refi options into many refi calculators, they're telling me that its not worth the refinance.  Is this because of adding the additional 5 years of interest?  None of them are considering that I would be able to drop PMI of $104/month. 

When I type the numbers into an Amortization Schedule (like this one: https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/amortization-schedule-calculator/), it shows: 

Current mortgage: 
- $182,149 in interest over life of loan

Refi Option 1: 
- $146,111 in interest over life of loan

Refi Option 2: 
- $184,970 in interest over life of loan


If closing costs are roughly $4k, and I could reduce my interest rate (each 0.125% drop saves around $20 per month on a ~$250k loan, so 3.75% to 3.5% should save about $40/month), and drop PMI ($104/month) - wouldn't my break even be roughly $4k / ($104 + $40) = 28.8 months?

And if I go with Refi Option 1 - wouldn't I not only ""break even"" in 28.8 months, but also save about $36k in total interest ($182k - $146k = $36k) over the life of the loan?

Even with Refi Option 2 where I'm taking $50k cash out - wouldn't I still come out ahead comparing the total costs of the loan over 30 years?

- Current mortgage total cost (principal + interest) would be $455,149 ($273k principal + $182,149 interest).  

- Refi Option 2 mortgage total cost would be $484,970 ($300k principal + $184,970 interest). 

- Total: $484,970 (refi 2) - $455,149 (current mortgage) = $29,821 more for Refi 2, but I also received $50k cash back at the beginning, so wouldn't I actually be ""ahead"" by $21,179 ($50k - $29,821)?   If you subtract the closing costs of $4k, still ""ahead"" by $15k-ish?

investing,"The market may very well ""fake it until make it"" through a 3-6 months bump in economy, and the bull market can continue throughout 2020.","Over the past few weeks I, along with some others around here or in the investment community in general, are a bit puzzled by the market's extremely bullish outlook despite the economic impact of nCoV virus turning out to be a lot more severe than initially expected by many.

In my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/eusz3g/people_arent_fully_realizing_the_economic_impact/) about the virus I made some predictions, and they mostly turned out to be very accurate, from AAPL missing their quarterly result (I wrote the post 2 days before Tim Cook gave a wider than normal range for the quarter estimate and 21 days before they issued a guidance warning), to China's energy demand dropping in the short term to the disruption to the supply chain. 

On the other hand, I'm very glad that I didn't make any impulsive trading decisions and short the market, since as everyone know the market has been only getting bullish as this whole virus saga unfolds. Even the Chinese stock market has been doing relatively well since reopening despite the whole country's GDP going down the drain this quarter.

So is it pure market exuberance (i,e crypto market back in 2017) or is it the media who's making a mount out of an ant hill with regard to a bad flu? 

I believe it's neither (ok some market exuberance is definitely here, I can't complain about my TSLA holding). Because in the end, no fundamental behavior/pattern of the market is being threatened by the epidemic. If we look back at the dotcom bust of the late 90s, huge valuations for companies with unproven *revenue* models was the driving factor of the bubble and for 2008 it was the overly leveraged subprime mortgage market. The market didn't collapse because the stocks were trading high, they collapsed because those unsustainable driving factors for the bubbles *inevitably* came to their end. 

So where are we now? Yes there will be some short to medium term economic pains, especially to small/medium businesses or companies that operate in certain industries (I wouldn't go all in on cruise ship stocks right now lol), but none of that will be the actual cause for a real recession since the current *operating framework* of the economy still *appears to be solid*. The Chinese central bank and other government feds/central banks will have no problem injecting cash and capital to keep the appearance up and it may very, very well succeed in smooth out the market bumps through the next 3 months. They have all the economic and *political* incentives to keep this up for as long as possible, and if the virus threat does end (or at least stops worrying people) in the next 3 months, they probably will succeed.

I see two risks with this outlook, one is the virus turns out to be worse than expected and China's economy is still halted six months down the road. In this case the impact will cascade and surpass what the market will be willing to ignore. The second risk is the intense short term pain (supply chain disruption, terrible cashflow impact, SMB hurting, etc) will uncover some fundamental problems in our current economic model. This is slightly more likely than the first risk and it will catch everyone by surprise, so by its nature it's difficult to predict exactly what it would be.

In the end, I've not changed my investment strategy since the whole virus saga began and I recommend people to not make impulsive decisions trying to time the market in the short term. Considering the unprecedented containment measure and economic impact of this epidemics, this will be a very good data point and learning lesson for everyone, doesn't matter which side you are on.

EDIT: I wrote this post to start a discussion, but instead some people have been quite hostile for reasons I can think of, but don't want to name. With regard to people asking ""what dumb predictions I was spamming hoping one of them would get right"", I compiled a pretty [specific list](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f5xckj/the_market_may_very_well_fake_it_until_make_it/fi2jpok/).",finance
personalfinance,I need Help - Student Loan,"Ive never done this before, but I really dont know what to do.   
I am in way over my head and need some genuine advice here.   
My story is long - but I will paint the highlights as best I can.   
I graduated a 2 year art school (art institute) in 1995 and at that time, I had 32k in student fed loans.   
due to a live or die attitude in life - fuled by a lot of alcohol, I wasnt very good at repaying my loans.   
I was informed in 2001 that I was in default - but that I could ""earn"" my way out if it by paying 600 a month for 18 months, which I did.   
at that time, my loans were consolidated and a large fee was added for going in default - but I was put back in good standing at that time - however, my balance was around 69k at that time - and it was set to be 7-9% (I honestly cant remember which.  
Then there was a large shuffle up with Salli Mae and my loans ended up with Nelnet - but there were now 2 loans listed one for 69k and one listed for 62k. I have no idea where the other came from but they have assured me that ""its correct"".  
time has gone by, and when I was employed, I paid, and when not - I didnt.   
I got sober and started looking into my finances and how to clean everything up around 2010  
I joined National Student Servicing around 7 years ago to get on an income based repayment to work towards repayment and to get out of this debt.   
I currently owe 182k in student loans (from the original 32k) and it goes up around 1.5k a month. My interest rate is pinned at 8%\~ and each year, I show my proof of income.   
the years I was unemployed, I was differed a year.   
the income based repayment thing takes decades of paying monthly and I only have around 3 years of the last 7 with monthly payments.  
it's looking like I will owe around 360k by the time I am supposed to be done with my IBR period - and if Anything goes amiss, I have to start over.   
Today I am 49 and pretty responsible with my money and debt. I keep a credit score of around 710. I own my house (mortgage) and I am ok - but no where near the extra income to pay all this back.   
What can I do. Seriously. is there Anything I can do. this debt is Crushing, and its only going to get worse.  Any reasonable suggestions will be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Tax refund help,"Hello all!

I have a question regarding the allocation of my tax refund. I’ll be getting $1153 back this year. Now I have 2 routes I can go...

1) I have a Wells Fargo credit card with a balance of $1100 at 18.6% APR. I can completely pay this off and use the snowball method to put it towards my other credit card

Or

2) My other credit, as mentioned above, is a Capital One credit card with a $3400 balance at 26% APR. I put the $1100 towards that to cut the balance by a third.

I’m conflicted between the thought of completely paying off one credit card or cutting a third off a card that has a way higher interest rate. 

What to do?

personalfinance,Should I buy the condo I am currently renting?,"I'm 23 and living in a nice 2 bedroom, 1 3/4 bath,1 car garage, condo with my girlfriend. My landlords emailed me last Friday that they will be selling the condo and have offered to sell to me. They offered it at $255k, where other condos in the neighborhood have sold at $285k. The HOA fee is $280/mo. I am left very divided on whether I should buy or not.

With my current job, I am doing an apprenticeship where I get $1.30/hr raise every six months for the next 2 years. I am currently making $24.80/hr (after swingshift differential) and will be making $30.75/hr upon completion of the program in 2 years. I have zero debts, am contributing 8% to retirement with company matching up to 5%, and have $55k saved for a house, with only $1700 saved in a separate account for an emergency fund that I allot $50 a paycheck to.

I love the location of the condo as it is walking distance to downtown, right next to an interurban trail for cycling/walking, and is close to places I can do my hobbies. I've lived here for about a year and the HOA is not annoying, and it is in a very safe neighborhood with nice neighbors.

The condo has double pane aluminum windows that have some panes that need to be replaced. The kitchen floors are pretty scuffed and need replacing, and the interior walls need to be repainted. The lighting inside is also not the greatest and I would like to add more lighting fixtures.

I am divided because I feel a bit rushed into this decision and am not sure I want to buy a condo for my first place as it seems that condos are fairly risky as an investment from what I have heard.",finance

I'm learning kubernetes and right now I'm trying to configure an ingress with haproxy in kubernetes. I can't get it to work. As it is configured as a NodePort, I was expecting to see the ports being active on the worker nodes where the controller is deployed, but that's not the case. At first, I was having some issues as my worker nodes had IPv6 disabled and the haproxy-ingress pod kepts crashing as it was trying to bind to ::::80 and ::::443. So I've tried to configure the configmap so it only bind to port :80 and :443 (ipv4)...but I just gave up on that and re-enabled IPv6. Now, the pod won't crash anymore, but I still don't see the ports listening in my worker nodes. The logs of haproxy-ingress say this (idk how relevant this is):

I am in my early 20s with terrible credit(due to passed due credit cards and medical debt that has defaulted).
I am currently a full time student in a STEM major, which occupies most of my time.

I am currently working a simple retail job on the weekends, but they cut hours consistently down to 4-12 hours a week. 

Before i was a student, I was working full time in an aerospace company that paid absolutely great. But after awhile of being there, I realized I need to start college and get an education, because this is not something I want to do for the rest of my life. I left that job, applied to college, and now here I am one year later.

Only problem is...I have carried on my car payment($350 w/ 12% int), my insurance for car payment($270), and other miscellaneous expensenes like phone service, gas, food, etc. 

When I bought my car, I was able to pay every month with no problem. But now I am only making around $500-$600/month from my part time job, and I am struggling.

My parents have no money or good credit. Non of my siblings can help. I dont have any friends with good income or credit nor would I ever ask them for help.

There isnt a day that goes by where I dont get stressed over my money situation, and it absolutely is stressful and completely discourages me from my studies. 
I know this was a huge learning lesson for me, but until then, i have no clue what to do . Its gotten so bad where i have even considered having my car repossessed (but after further research, decided to hold off on that as that will create more damage to me than how I am at now).

I am getting a small federal student loan every 2 months that helps me get by, but its still not enough to cover my expenses.

I would try and get another job, but I know myself and know that will come at the cost of my educstion because it is extremely difficult for me to juggle both a job and full time studies.

I have applied to dozens of loan vendors and have either been given extremely high interest rates (One of them being a 70% int rate!!), or not being qualified whatsoever.

Its hard for me to build my credit because, well, I dont have the money to build it up since I am struggling paying off my credit card debt(around $2,500), and car payments.

I have tried refinancing my car, no luck. Tried trading in my car, but it is underwater substantially and will only increase my loan amount.

Any advice in this situation or am I just screwed until further notice? I have come to accept my fate at this point after months of research and realizing i have no luck.

personalfinance,Paying off debt versus investing,"Hi all,
I currently have about $35k all in student loans. Most of this amount is at a low interest rate (~4.5%) but some is at 6-7%. I have been focusing all of my extra money on paying down loans (I started at $50k about a year ago and a half ago), however I am worried that I am missing out on a lot of potential gains by investing in a Roth IRA at this age (I also currently put 7% into my company’s 401k). I currently make $55k a year plus about $10k in bonuses (total around $65k). Am I being irrational thinking that it may work out better in the long run to be paying down debts and investing at the same time? Or should I focus on clearing out my debt aggressively now so that I’ll have a clean slate to work from in a few years?

Little bit of student loans but the interest rate is ridiculouly low.  Wife doesnt make much and her only retirement is a SEP IRA (profit sharing gets deposited into it. Average tends to be better than a 3% employer match from a 401k but it fluctuates). Theres about 375k total in my various investment accounts for retirement. I can Also probably start putting away more fir retirement than the accounts above.

Im getting to the point where i feel like there is enough money being invested in my different retirement accounts that I should have some help managing it. I watch it regularly (quarterly) but not as closely as i think i should for the amount in there. I started talking to fisher and it turns out that i can use them to help manage my accounts. It normally requires 500k under there mgt in order to qualify but i qualify to come in at a lower amount due to my age. I would need to do an in service rollover of appx 210k from my 401k to an IRA managed by them in order to start using them. I can do this because thats the amount that rolled over from my last employer. The current 401k has a lot of good options so i never really needed to use an ira instead of the 401k. My inestments are mostly split between a 2045 targeted date plan and a vangaurd s&amp;p 500 index fund. The fees for using fisher are 1.5% of the account they manage but i could obviously apply their recommendations towards my other accounts and they would at least have to consider those I accounts to come up with the best plan for me. 

Has anyone used Fisher and what are your thoughts?  Is it worth it? Is a targeted date plan 2045 (gross expense 0.40%) etc better. What about just doing indexes (my vangaurd s&amp;p 500 index is gross expense is 0.02%)? Or a mix if both like I'm doing now the right idea. Is now a good time to start using a financial advisor or when would be?

I realize the expense numbers arent necessarily enough info to say you should do your targeted date plan for sure but im looking for more general advice on whether the time is right for financial advisor.",finance

This same time next year we will have another bonus and do the same thing to both finish paying the SoFi loan off and catch up on any tax debt that hadn’t been paid on the first bonus. 

Both of our 401k’s are great and we would immediately resume all normal taxes and contributions and exemptions. The point of this would be to pay off the SoFi loan in two years verses 5.

investing,Fed Funds Rate and Bond Rates,"My teacher ended class today saying lower interest rates in the future means higher bond rates in the future.  This did not make sense to me and I was hoping someone could explain it.  

My thinking was lower interest rates means the fed bought treasuries to inject money into the banking system.  This decreases the supply of bonds for sale.  The shift in the supply curve to the left increases the price of the bond, while decreasing the interest rate (I do think I have a good understanding of the inverse relationship between bond prices and their interest rates).

I guess my biggest issue is understanding the relationship between the fed funds rate and the interest rates on bonds - I feel like these terms are all used interchangeably.  If banks are lending to eachother overnight at lower rates, why would they then charge a higher rate for bonds.

Would appreciate any help.  Thanks",finance

 Is there a way for me to get the debt reduced to the original 3k or lower? I do not own anything of value that I can sell to immediately pay off the debt, nor do I have any savings yet. Natural disasters, unemployment, and vehicle troubles have completely used them all up.

US federal budget is 4,7T for 2020.  
US daily transactional volume is about 14T, 0.1% on that times 365 would collect more than they collect in taxes at the moment. 0.1% of (14T \* 365) = 5T (in taxes collected)  


That would mean if you transact $10k you would pay $10 of that to settle the transaction where government would be beneficiary of such fee.  


In that case, no matter if money were transacted by drug lords or APPL corp ultimately government would receive their cut.

Obviously this ideal scenario would require every single transaction to happen on the chain and no more cash. But I would rather pay for transaction every single time I transact, than pay all kind of taxes.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Received inheritance, where to invest conservatively?","Hi guys,

About 6 months ago my father in law died and we inherited about $250k.

I have had this sitting in a money market account, but lately, with interest rates dropping, I want to move it to something that will earn more.

We don't need this money right now and live comfortably, but would like this money to grow to move to a bigger house in about 5 years for my family.

I know you can't time the market, but I thought that we would have had a drop by now and kept it in the money market account. I'm at a point now where I think the saying of time in the market beats timing the market makes sense and I'd like to pick some very conservative funds to put this money in.

What funds would you recommend that are extremely conservative? I want to open a new account with TD Ameritrade and go that route rather than pay an advisor. Any suggestions?",finance

This is actually the first time I've been in this situation. About a month ago, I got my W-2 from my job and was not only---

personalfinance,24yo with a BS in Finance but obviously still an idiot - Roth 401k v. Traditional,"I've been poring over this subreddit, trying to understand the traditional 401k v. Roth 401k discussion. And the most confident read I am getting is that there is no cut and dry right answer. It's a grey area depending on a whole slew of variables. Despite the super meticulous and helpful explanations, I'm still having a hard time applying it to myself - could someone perhaps help me understand the knowledge based on my circumstance?

I am 24, in the 24% federal income tax bracket and have a low appetite for risk (I'm young but have the soul of a grandmother who's been through the Great Depression). I have a 401k that my company matches (100% of the first 6% - which I take advantage of). I put 20% of my bonus towards my 401k but that's mainly because equities scare me though I have a feeling I'll need to suck it up and start dabbling in the stock market if I really want to see a meaningful difference. I also have a savings account that earns 1.7%. It's mainly just a place to put aside money that *isn't* my checking account because if I see the money, I'll feel like I have the right to spend it. No student loans, no debt. In case it's relevant, I live in Manhattan (and get f'ed up the wazoo with taxes &lt;3) .

If you made it this far - thank you. So much. I feel like I should know better but, simply, I don't :( Should I go ahead with the Roth 401k or the traditional or a mix of both?

Background:  my wife had some student loan debt on her credit report; it pre-dated our marriage.  She told me her dad was sure he paid it, and was still fighting with the bank about it.  She gets a lot of CA calls, and doesn’t answer her phone for unknown numbers anymore.  Last year, we filed taxes jointly, and we had a big federal tax return coming.  Unfortunately, the tax return was “kidnapped” to pay her student loan debt.

Just had some good news; her dad proved he paid it, and the bank agreed! They sent a 1099-C form (cancellation of debt), and discharged the entire amount.  She also just received a 1098-C form (student loan interest paid) for the portion of the tax return that went towards interest.  

I have some goals:

1. Get my tax return back
2. Clear her credit report and stop the calls

I think the parties involved are: the bank that held the loan, the IRS, the credit agencies that kept calling.

So I spoke with the CA and told them the truth - that I had been working on my budget for a week and I can no longer afford to pay the $120 a month I was paying. I told them that I could pay $50 a month until some of my other debt gets paid off. They told me that I was welcome to make said payments, but they would not accept a new arrangement until my balance from the previous agreement was paid (I'm only about two months behind) AND they would not be able to stop legal action against me.

The reduction can be explained by the relatively high cost of the contracts. Gold is denominated in US currency, and since the USD Index, which reflects the value of the dollar against other currencies, is at extremely high levels around 99 points, the price of gold in foreign currency has become much higher than it was a week earlier.

The output of the embedding is typically fed to some recurrent architecture whose error hypersurface will be very complicated, and non-convex.

In contrast, the error hypersurface of a linear regression is convex and regular, which is why linear regressions can be solved exactly and quickly through matrix inversion.

Now, suppose we have a model which consists of a dimension-reducing embedding layer which outputs its results to a linear regression.  And that's all.  Will the error hypersurface be convex or non-convex?",technology

btc,Please don't fork - US taxpayers will have to pay a fortune in taxes on the split coins and it will likely destroy the BCH price,"**Summary: There is a new tax rule that I think would have an enormous negative impact if BCH happened to split.  I haven't seen any discussion of this yet, so decided to walk through it from my understanding.**

The IRS came out with [new rules in Oct 2019](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions) stating that the new coins resulting from a hard fork would be considered ordinary income (like income from a job) immediately after the fork at the first fair market price.

&gt;A23.  When you receive cryptocurrency from an airdrop following a hard fork, you will have ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the new cryptocurrency when it is received, which is when the transaction is recorded on the distributed ledger, provided you have dominion and control over the cryptocurrency so that you can transfer, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of the cryptocurrency.

Let's collectively think about what this means.

John Coinholder has 100 BCH today.  Let's say we as a community fail at coming to an agreement (which is by far the worst worst possible outcome) and BCH now worth $400 splits into BCH1 and BCH2 each worth $200.

The IRS will likely consider BCH2 as the new coin.  Now John has two coins each worth $20k.  He's in the same spot where he started right?  NOPE. Under current tax rules the second $20k is now considered just like getting paid from a job.  Get ready to pay federal tax, state tax, city tax, and maybe social security and medicare (I'm not sure on those last two, maybe someone else knows better).

At an approx 35% tax rate, now poor John Coinholder has $20k \* 35% (an approx guess) = $7,000 of tax to pay.  But wait, he didn't actually sell or gain anything?  Yep, that's the new rules from the IRS.

How will John pay this $7,000 tax bill?  Either he has money in the bank or he sells $7,000 of BCH1 or BCH2 to pay the bill.

Now are there 10,000 John Coinholders out there that now need to get $7,000 for taxes?  Actually at approx 18.2mm BCH outstanding and half being US citizens (just a guess), there are 91,000 John Coinholders out there with 100 each.

Now suddenly the community needs 91,000 \* $7,000 each = $637 million to pay the government.  At $200/coin, the community would have to sell 3.18 million coins of one of the forks to pay the tax bill.  Imagine now suddenly torrents of coins needing to be sold by holders that love them and want to keep, but they suddenly have this giant tax bill out of nowhere.

What would happen to BCH1 or BCH2 coin prices?  I'm guessing they would get destroyed.  And once the first people start selling, the price won't last at $200 for long.  The price will go down, and more and more coins will need to be sold to get that $7,000.

And effectively by splitting our own coin through disagreement, we caused a giant selloff which in the end effectively destroyed our beloved peer to peer cash.

I know made a number of assumptions of % of holders that are US taxpayers, tax rates, will holders comply with the new tax and whether holders would sell their coins to pay the taxes. However you figure it, there could be a lot of coins hitting the market if BCH splits.

**TLDR: If BCH split under new tax rules, US tax payers would be forced to pay a huge amount of taxes to the government as new coins are considered income.  To get money to pay the taxes, they would likely sell some and it would help push the new coin prices down significantly therefore making BCH much less likely to become worldwide peer to peer cash.**

business,Effective Interest Rate Calculator and Formula on Top Online Tool,,finance
investing,Financial sector is almost always first to fall preceding a recession,"Looking back at the past recessions, it would appear that the financial sector is almost always first to fall before a recession, in its technical terms, actually happens.

Of course, the rationale is intuitive to most that are familiar with the concept of the credit cycle i.e., banks lend aggressively during times of prosperity, firms eventually run into cash flow issues, banks lend less, credit crunch, etc.

My proposition, expanding on the credit cycle above, is that central banks, by way of monetary policy, have been essentially transferring the damage to the financial sector, using retail banks as a barricade to temporarily impede damage to the wider economy. Imagine a hole in a boat, slowing filling the boat with water, and the central banks as the captain have shoved the financial sector on top of that hole, reassuring everyone on board that everything is fine.

I believe what we are seeing with Deutsche Bank, HSBC, etc. and all the bank layoffs is likely the result of cash flow issues on the bank's part which is then due to cash flow issues on debtors. Instead of allowing debtors (i.e., the wider economy) to default, central banks have resorted to lowering interest rates to reduce repayment strains for debtors and other wide array of policies to aid debtors, causing lowering of profit margins for retail banks.

As the retail banks and the financial sector start to perform poorly as a result of the above, running into cash flow issues *themselves*, the central banks then engage in repos to try to keep the retail banks afloat, providing them liquidity to meet their cash flow obligations.

But as we can see from the increasing number of banking layoffs, as well as the growing poor performance of the financial sector, I believe we are starting to see the cracks in the hole and the water that is gradually filling the boat.

My partner and I are in the midst of many life changes.  A move across the country, changing jobs, purchasing a home, and adding to our family.  I've been anxiously treading the waters of a first time home buyer and I just wanted to bounce some of the financials off this community to make sure  there's nothing I'm missing or overlooking.  


Initially, our realtor had suggested a mortgage lender to us, and while he was a real nice guy, the rate and closing costs that he quoted us were 3.5% and about $6,000 closing costs on a $300,000 30 year fixed VA Home Loan.  Now in my opinion, this rate and deal in itself isn't a bad one, but I decided to shop around a little over a month prior to our close date.  I went to a local credit union and they were able to match the closing costs while providing a 2.75% interest rate over the same loan term and cost.  I've since shown those numbers to the original lender and am awaiting his final response on if he's able to match that or not today.    


This brings me to my next point.  My partner and I chipped away at her student loans and paid them off aggressively within a two year span.  It had always been my vision to have a 20% down payment for a home as that seems to be the holy grail of money to put down to avoid PMI, but paying that off aggressively hasn't allowed us to amass the kind of down payment that I was originally intending.  Luckily though through the VA loan, I am able to avoid those altogether as well as avoid the funding fee due to service connected disability.  My goal is to just use the 30 Year Va Loan and pay it down as quickly as possible.  The difference between the 30 and 15 year in percentage was 0.1375% but it would alter the monthly payments by nearly $800 per month.  

My intention now is to put $0 down and attack the mortgage in the same way that we attacked the student loan debt while still funding our retirements at 15%.  We were paying the minimums on all the fed loans for the student loan debt and two times per month we'd look at our checking balance and throw as much money as we could toward the debt.  I believe that we COULD do the 15 year loan, however, I do like the flexibility that the 30 year allows.  With about $20,000 of what we've got saved, we intend to use that for appliances, furniture, tools, etc.  

Finally, with an addition to our family on the way, I'm wondering about any sort of financial/legal changes that I should be making.  We're looking into having a will done, changing our health insurance plans, saving for childcare expenses, my partners FSA plan (for childcare costs), and am wondering if there's any resource in that realm that would be helpful in assistance.  I know that a lot of people use the 529 Plan, but I personally don't think we'll go that route.  I understand that its tax advantaged, but for us personally, I just don't think its what we want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for reading.  Just in the midst of making the largest purchase in my life and wanted to cross my t's and dot my i's.  Let me know what you think.

Also negative interest rates never happened.

So the argument goes like this (arbitrary example) :
In the last 100 years every 15 years we have had a new communist government in the world, therefore communist governments are inevitable in th political system therefore there will be another one.

There I a great possibility that there will never be a new one.

personalfinance,Filed my 2019 Taxes with TurboTax and got a form 1040ES,"I just filed my taxes with TurboTax for the 2019 tax year. I got a small refund, but when I looked at the federal form TurboTax sent, it has some 1040 ES payments (estimated tax payments) for next year. 

Looking into this, I realized my wife's withholdings were incorrect (her W4 was not accounting for me earning a salary as well). If we continued to withhold what we're withholding, we'd owe about 3500 next year. 

To correct this, I fixed our W4s, so the proper amount of tax is being taken out. My question is: now that I updated our W4s, do I still have to pay the estimated tax payments? Did TurboTax actually send these to the IRS and they are expecting these payments? Or am I fine because I adjusted my withholding?",finance
personalfinance,I'm thinking of Air Gapping my VenMo and PayPal accounts,"I frequently use VenMo and PayPal because of how convenient it is, but I've been increasingly worried about the security because of the lack of any real protection by VenMo/PayPal or the federal government if my account was to get compromised.  I've read about Air Gapping the accounts by no longer having them connected to my primary checking account.  

I'm considering using this approach, but instead of bringing money to/from the 'VenMo/PayPal' checking account by cash deposit/withdrawal at the appropriate bank I would use the ACH functionality built into my primary checking account.  My primary account is with Citibank and they do not seem to charge any fees for the amounts that I would be working with.  I have checking accounts that are active with Jovia and Bethpage that I could use as the VenMo/PayPal account.

I'm curious about any advice anyone has or possibly problems/pitfalls that I could run into.  I would think that I would maintain a desired balance in my secondary checking account that would cover any amount I would typically need to send via PayPal/VenMo, and use ACH to send or receive money from that account whenever it strayed far from my desired balance.  I would consider then my liability limited to that balance as opposed to the entire checking account balance.",finance

personalfinance,Credit card payment strategy: Is snowball the best way or are there other strategies to accelerate payment? Hole in the bucket?,"I've been searching for calculators and a possible name for this.  I've seen a ""pay off your mortgage"" strategy that involves getting a home equity line of credit and using that as your ""checking account"" to pay off regular bills and reduce your mortgage principal.  (Not going to explain it here, just search 'Pay off your mortgage in 7 years!)  I'm wondering how this might work with my credit cards and possibly changing how I pay for daily living things in order to shorten the time it will take to pay off a credit card.  I think I've heard it described as hole in the bucket or something like that.

Say I have $1000 on a credit card with a 27% interest rate.  Add that I have no options for moving that debt to a lower interest account.  Now, I have $100 a month to pay on that credit card.  Also, in my monthly budget, I have $250 per week ($1000 a month) set aside for groceries, gas, diapers, lunches, whatever.  Also, assume I get paid once per month.

It seems that if I were to take the money I need for groceries and use that to pay off the credit card, and then use the credit card to pay for groceries, I may be able to lower my interest payments to 0% (assuming my credit card charges no interest if I pay the balance on the due date.)   If that's the case, using the $100 extra I have to pay toward the card, I would be paying the card off in 10 months rather than 12 months.

Is there a name for this strategy?  Clearly this is over simplified but I think I have the room in my budget to do this kind of thing for my credit cards.  I know you have to be careful not to use the credit card any more otherwise you could find yourself owing the $1000 and not having money for groceries.  But assume the discipline is there.",finance
personalfinance,Where to go from here? Bankruptcy? Credit Consolidation? Patience?,"I could really use some help/guidance. 

I've never been great with money, but I'd never been ""bad"" with it either. I was in school, I've always worked, etc. 

Long story short, I was hospitalized for a while during grad school, and all of my medical bills and living expenses were put on a credit card, or paid using student loans.  The loan for that particular semester had to be paid back ASAP in order for me to continue in the program this semester and was just put on credit cards. 

My current total debt (2 CCs, various medical bills) is $22,000

I make $40k a year now, working full time, while I'm getting my masters in nursing/RN. I graduate with that RN license/MSN in August of 2021. This will up my earning potential significantly, which will help my situation, but how do I survive until then?

Current budget:

Income: 2,218

Rent: 500  
Utilities: 160  
Phone: 30  
Spot/Netfl: 20  
Car Ins: 83  
Gas: 40  
Food: 400  
Pets: 40
Miscellaneous: 100  
Student loan: 40  
Min payment on CCs: 350

This leaves me just under 400 left over each month. Do I just slowly plug away at these bills and CCs until I graduate, when I can pay them off much faster? Or does this seem like a hole I'll never get out of? Right now it seems like the latter.   


Also, the interest rates on the CCs are killer, \~24% on both of them (one a Discover, one through 5/3)

personalfinance,How do I pay down my student loans in the most effective way with my tax return?,"So I am 3 months into paying off $43,000 in federal student loans. I have 11 loans ranging from $800 to $7,000. The lower loans have a lower interest rate (3%) while the $6,000 and 7,000 loans have higher rates (5-6%). 

I am getting a pretty good refund this year from my taxes, and have about $4,000 to throw at my loans (on top of my monthly payment). My question is, how should I do this? With my loan provider I can either pay off a specific loan or pay a sum and the provider divides the sum over all the loans. I think there are three options at this time, but which would be best?

1. Pick the highest loan of $7000 (with highest interest rate) to throw money at only. This would get the balance down to $3000 on the 6% interest rate loan. 

2. Pay off the three smallest loans entirely, eliminating them and their 3% interest rates. 

3. Throw the $4000 towards all of them and each loan will go down by a little bit.

gaming,Most OP guns / gun combos in video game history (multiplayer),"So a buddy of mine and I were talking and this came up in conversation. What are some of the most OP Gun and Gun Combos you can remember.

A couple I can think of off the top of my head:

Akimbo 1887s - MW2 

\- Range, damage, fire rate, speed... these had pretty much everything and pretty sure they ended up getting nerfed. 

AWP/Deagle combo - CS:S 

\- One of my favorite games of all time. The AK was pretty deadly if you were good with it but if you were good with the AWP you were unstoppable. 

Energy Sword - Halo 2

\- Maybe this wasn't so OP because I totally sucked at the game but damn the energy sword was ridiculously good

cybersecurity,Does Government Impose Security Restrictions on Private Contractors &amp; The Way They Store Data?,"Hey everyone,

Was wondering for anyone who deals with government (municipal, provincial or state &amp; federal) if government imposes a certain level of security for the documents it shares with people.

Is it simply an NDA they make you sign? Or do they require you to have at least AES 256 encryption for the confidential (or top secret) information perhaps.

We are working on a new product and was wondering if this is something people struggle with or may be a trigger point for switching solutions.

personalfinance,Having trouble figuring out W4 allowances - my employer doesn't have a worksheet for it.,"I'm in debt, trying to pay it down as aggressively as possible. I listen to Dave Ramsey and he always tells callers not to have any extra tax withheld from their pay checks because it's basically giving the government a free loan all year.

I went into my employer's HR web portal and clicked on my tax withholding, and it just has a box to enter ""number of exemptions."" Initially I believe I had 0 exemptions for both state and federal. Right now I have 2 for federal (changed it in December based on the advice of a coworker) and 0 for my state (which is PA).  However I don't know if 2 is too many, too little, etc. -- I don't want to owe money but I also don't extra withheld. I was afraid to touch the state exemptions because I wasn't sure if it worked differently than federal.

I've Googled how many to claim, and the pages always say to fill out the employer's tax withholding worksheet. The problem is my employer doesn't have one. It's literally just a page that lets me change the numbers without any explanation of what they do or point of reference.

That being said, can you guys advise on what you would do in my shoes?  If it matters at all, I'm 31, single, no dependents. I am salaried at $45k but have a sales job, with an additional \~$25-$30k due in commission, which I believe is paid out as 'bonus' income (and based on what I've read on this forum before, bonus money is taxed at the full 30% regardless of how many exemptions one chooses? So I am tempted to actually claim *more* than what I should just to 'balance it out' but I don't want to do something that could potentially backfire).",finance

My thought process first told me student loans as that is a much larger debt and is spread over a longer period of time. However, I then ran through the process with my truck.

If I am to pay $100 extra on my truck every month I would shorten the loan by 13 months. At that point, I would take the money (plus the $100) that I am currently paying on my truck and pay that all towards student loans.

Is that the best course of action? I can provide further details such as balances, rates and term lengths if needed.

Student loan totals: $89,000 with an average interest rate of 4.45% spread over 15 years (14 years to go, woo!)

personalfinance,Vantage score and balance transfer question,"I have one credit card where I carry a high balance and utilization.

I budgeted an amount I could pay monthly for 18 months, and transferred that to an 18 month no interest balance transfer offer, accounting for the balance transfer fee of course. 

My initial Credit Karma vantage score plummeted 17 points, because the new card reported it's existence and the amount transferred over to it, but the old card hadn't reported yet, making it look like I was taking on roughly an extra 6K of debt. But this week, my CK vantage only rose 5 points for the same amount of total debt coming off.

The concept of deflation is rarely discussed yet it remains one of the most dangerous economic situations known. It is my opinion that without the excessive quantitative easing of late that our inflation numbers would be near flat. My fear is that once a recessionary catalyst begins that this trend will only worsen. Hell interest rates are negative in Europe.

personalfinance,Do legitimate debt collectors often call from spoofed numbers?,"The collection agency in question is Hntr Wrfeld (just censored it incase names aren't allowed in this sub ... EDIT: my attempt at censoring only italicized shit but whatever lol).

FWIW I did recently realize I have some medical debt (&lt;$500) that's about 3 years old. I intend on calling my insurance company sometime within the next 2 weeks when I finally have the house to myself so I can sort everything out and find out if they truly sent the bill to collections.

BUT ...
I don't recall when exactly these calls started arriving? I want to say this past January (maybe even December), but they've been going extra hard these past couple weeks. The calls are to my landline home phone. The call log on the phone has only logged calls since Feb 10.

And since Feb 10, the collection agency has used 2 different phone numbers that had been identified by caller ID with the agency's name. However, the agency has been using another number as well, which caller ID identified as ""800 Service"" ... I know this is the agency because the robotic voicemail message explicitly says so.

There's been even more random numbers calling lately, that caller ID identified as being from states I have no business with whatsoever. A lot of random calls supposedly from my state too. There's also been calls from a town local to where I reside, which has called with 4 different numbers, where only the last 4 digits were different. Also ... at least 3 totally different phone numbers from ""Wireless Caller"" would repeatedly call as well. Even started getting calls from ""Walmart.com"" yesterday. None of the numbers mentioned in this paragraph ever left voicemail though. Except I got a call from Ridge MD yesterday that left some voicemail about social security being involved with fraudulent activity, and we must call them back before a lawsuit of some sort happens ... this I strongly feel is an obvious scam.

Speaking of scams, maybe a week or two ago my dad picked up the phone from ""Police"" and they were asking for donations. I've yet to ask him if he ever confirmed his name/address/SSN (I hope he didn't), but he casually mentioned that we should be getting some mail soon from the police - I know we most likely aren't getting anything - thankfully my dad refused to pay over phone and just told them to mail us a bill or something. I feel like it's possible that because my dad picked up the phone and proved our number is active, these scammers have been going hard since (but maybe that's also recency bias on my end lol).

So with all this considered, is it possible that the collection agency is not seeking out a legitimate debt, perhaps isn't even the actual collection agency and it's all a scam? Or are the obvious scams (SSN, Police) actually totally different from the actual legitimate agency that's been reaching out to us (even with the spoofed local appearing numbers, to try to get us to pick up), and we're just in an unlucky period with all these spammed calls?

I've been compiling my own tax return without professional help for over 30 years.  Most years I use some software to help automate the routine stuff.  I'm pretty good at it, for a layperson, but I am **100% confident** that I am missing many opportunities to reduce my tax burden.  Every year, I find there's a cost/benefit decision that I wind up making after a few days of noodling on my taxes.

For anyone interested, I thought I'd share some details about the complexity of an American tax return.  **What country you are from, and how complex is your tax return?**

My tax return is fairly average... maybe a touch more complex than most.  I take no salary, but I receive profits from a business.  (But I am describing my personal tax return here - not my business tax return which I also prepare myself.  It is of about the same complexity).  I have some investments.  I have a bank account.

personalfinance,"US, Indiana Settlement Annuity - Early Termination","First of all, Indiana has some seriously ridiculous laws pertaining to Medical Malpractice settlements. The law states that instead of paying the full amount, the defendant can pay a lesser sum provided that the annuity pays out the final sum eventually. Ultimately, this results in a situation where you can end up with a 35 year annuity with an absolutely disgusting interest rate of 3%. If invested in an index fund, this same settlement could yield 10x with historical figures or even 4x with conservative figures. 

I've been unable to find any documentation on whether or not you can terminate the annuity contract for early withdrawal if the contract was specifically purchased as part of a settlement agreement. I have found that that there can be an early termination fee of 10-20%, however over the span of 35 years this would still be worth exploring since the conservative rate would still yield ~3x or historically 8x of the final sum. The intent wouldn't be early access to the funds, merely the decision of investment vehicle, though I know there is no way that would have any impact on the law.

Has anyone dealt with something similar in Indiana or any other state in the US? My guess is that the answer will be this isn't possible since the defendant is the entity that purchased the annuity, but I figured it's worth researching at least! Ultimately if I can't find any documentation (or even if I can) I may consult an attorney to get the answer, however before doing so, I have a guilty pleasure in researching these things on my own beforehand.  Any anecdotes or leads to documentation would be much appreciated!

personalfinance,Student loan debt consolidation,"I have a whopping $115,000 in student loans as of this month with the current interest. I have 6 separate loans and I’m wondering if it’s smarter to consolidate so I have one interest rate or if it makes more sense to keep them as separate loans and take the Dave Ramsey approach and pay off the smallest one and once that’s paid, pay off the next highest and so forth. 

I am lucky in the sense that my fiancé has agreed to pay the household bills as well as our phone and insurance, etc. With my current salary I can pay about $3000 a month for reference.",finance
personalfinance,"Defaulted on Student Loans (Fedloan) - Servicer saying it doesn't ""really default"" for another 90 days?","So, my Fedloan is 274 days overdue. I got an email notice that my loan was in default. I went online and made a payment to pay off the amount in default (I was unemployed previously - no, I'm financially illiterate and didn't request smaller payments based on my unemployment).

Long story short, after I scheduled the online payment for the amount in the defaulted loans, I called and the rep told me that they don't actually release the loans or report the default for another 90 days, that Dept of Ed notifies at 270 days, but they give borrowers another 90 days to fix the default before it is reported/released to a collections agency. I asked if she was sure (I mean... I got a letter saying the loans defaulted) and she said yes because if it had been released to a collections agency, she wouldn't have access to it anymore.

Online, I can see they are listed as ""Delinquent"" not ""Default"" but with 274 days overdue.

Is this accurate? Everything online says rehabilitation is the only way to remove the default from your credit history? Should I cancel the payment to pay off the default loans and ask about a rehab program instead?

Update (for clarification):
Im not looking to declare bankruptcy. I am planning to pay my loans (I have made strategic moves to focus on my financial situation and should be able to aggressively pay off these loans in 6 months). 

My goal: minimize the damage to my credit history as much as possible by removing the default on the loans from my credit history as quickly as possible. 

When I looked online, it says loan rehabilitation is the only way to quickly remove the default from your history, and takes about 9-10 months. 

However, since I have a pending payment for the full amount to pay off the loans, I will now ""be in good standing"". 

Based on my online research, the default will stay on my history for 6-7 years. According to the servicer the default hasn't been reported to credit bureaus yet (they give you 90 days to resolve the default.... so she said) and won't be reported as default because I've resolved it so it will just look like a delinquency. 

My question is, is this true, or should I cancel the pending payment and ask about loan rehab to remove the default from my credit history in about 1 year. If I let the payment process and pay the full balance, will the default show for 6-7 years?",finance
personalfinance,Going to be 70-80k in debt as a teacher,"Hello, I'm in school for art education and health education minor. Even though I'm going to in instate public University, I'm going to be racked up in a lot of debt. Tuition is 10k and living is 10k so therefore 20k year equals 80k. I'm a junior and only have received about 3k in grants/scholarships. I'm applying for a bigger scholarship for next year. About half my debt is private loans which can't be forgiven and have high interest rates. I thought that this kind of debt was only for people who want to private school, but here I am and trying to do it better. I even took a few courses at community college to save money. I don't need an expensive life or kids, I just want to make it by. If I were to start out with 40k a year and had to pay 10k year in student loans, it would leave me with 30k.

personalfinance,"Considering taking on more student loans to pay for first house, good idea?","I know it’s a weird title and I’m not proud to be posting it but just looking for some information/advice. My wife and I are looking to purchase our first home by the end of this year hopefully. We are currently living apart as she is finishing her final year of pharmacy school (she’ll start working in July) and we are 99% sure she is going to be doing a 2 year residency and then work at the same hospital (basically she’ll earn about $42k a year for two years and then make her real salary of about $110k after that). Once we know for certain that she will be doing her residency at that hospital (we find out I believe March 10th) I will begin looking for employment in that area and expect to make between $40-$50k. When we were looking at her loans and talking to people who work at the hospital (she is doing all her 4th year rotations there) they let us know that the hospital qualifies as a “public service loan forgiveness” and that most of them are on an Income based repayment plan.

From what I can tell we would be able to take out the money we would need to put down 20% on a house and it doesn’t appear that it would effect us since the loans would be forgiven after 120 payments and the payment itself is based on income not the loan balance? 

I feel like I’m missing something here though so I wanted to come here for some advice, little financial background, we currently only have her student loan debt (around $110k) and our car loan with a $4700 balance (car is worth around $22k and the interest rate is 1.8%), no other debt than that. Also have a emergency fund of about $10k and another $9k in a checking and I have around $21k in a 401k and $6k in an IRA (we are both 25). Thank for any and all help!",finance
personalfinance,Did H&amp;R Block mislead my aunt?,"So my aunt went to get her taxes done and it turns out that her refund would be very small this year, I'm not really sure what she did because I haven't talked to her in a long time, but when she found this out, my mother kinda volunteered me to enter her stuff into HR block's website to file it.  The person at HR block said that she would be getting only like $300 from federal and like $50 from state since one of her jobs is in Oregon, but she lives in Washington, so no state income tax. They told her that this was because she was in a new tax bracket by over $600 or so.

So I start off on [freetaxusa.com](https://freetaxusa.com) and when I finish entering everything (4 w-2's \[1 from CA, 2 from Oregon, 1 from Washington, and 1 1099R from California public employees retirement fund), I got that she owes $1031 to federal.  I didn't even do the state portion at this point, because it was a WTF moment.  So I switched to HR block...this showed that she owed the same to federal too.  It made me wonder, how in the heck did this person say that she's getting a return if two (so far) tax prep softwares said that she owes.   So I, again, enter the information into HR block, but this time, I didn't enter the 1099R information and THEN it said that she was getting the $300 from federal.  I'm wondering, why they would give her the information and if they neglected to enter the 1099 stuff into the return.

I known very little about taxes.  When I do mine, they're simple. I enter the info as it says to and I'm done.  I've never had to do more than one W2 nor have I had a problem.  But this just comes off as weird that this has happened.  It made me wonder if after my aunt agreed, they would have corrected it to say oh, my bad, you get no refund, you now owe $xxx.",finance
personalfinance,Sprint phone collections,"Long story short, I was with sprint for over 10 years. Out of the blue I was getting horrible data connections, mad throttling, no data connections, dropped calls an texts all that good stuff. Essentially leaving my phone better as a paperweight then anything else. 

I could understand having issues if I was sucking 50+ gigs of data but I pulled on average like 10 an was under my data cap an all that. Did a round about trying to fix the issues for near 6 months and escalated it all the way to the top regional engineering dude who runs all the towers for my city. They find one tower was kinda messed up but all other towers in my driving zones were good. They said well it's your phone. So I got a new phone from them and still same issue. Finally fed up I said look give me DECENT coverage or something! But I couldnt get anything going at all with them. So finally I said look I'm done with this shit if I dont get at least half ass quality service I'm done an I'll walk. They said no your under contract you cant an I said oh hell yea I can watch me. So I left because they couldnt give me service or nothin. 

Now I've a collection for 1005 dollars when I only owed them 600 some odd bucks left. An i contacted sprint to tell them why I left and why i gave em the finger essentially and they didnt give a hoot. 

Do i have action to dispute this? Or am I going to be stuck with a collection. But that's the long story short of the matter.",finance

personalfinance,How is there $5436 unaccounted for in my car finance deal?,"My family and I have recently been looking into upsizing our current vehicle (2017 Civic). We found a car we loved (2016 Acura MDX), but the price was a bit on the high end. The dealership has been great so far, and managed to lower the costs to a conceivable budget. 

However, I was doing the math on the proposed payments and interest rate today. The car is $34,057 after taxes and documentation fees.  My interest rate (through a credit application that has been approved) is 5.74%. I took out a 7 year term with plans to make lump sum payments on the principal cost.

They have given me a price of $227.74 biweekly.

After 7 years it works out to $41,448; which is a 21.70% interest rate. So, instead of having a $1954 cost of borrowing (cost of the vehicle + 5.74%) it's $7391 in interest. 

I have not signed anything yet, but we have verbally agreed on the vehicle after the dealership completes some required repairs. I do plan on going to speak with the dealer/manager tomorrow, as I have been dealing with them since we started shopping.

Can anyone help me to figure out where the extra $5436 came from? There's nothing on the payment plan that suggests other fees. If it helps, with regards to relative laws in car sales, this is in Canada.


EDIT for more background:   Overall we were thrilled with the car at its price point (I didn't mention it was $27,777 before taxes). My 2017 civic is a lease and it was in an accident that caused over $4,000 worth of damage, so the car value depreciated by about $3,000. 

I will be also be cancelling my lease on the civic a year early. That adds $700 on top of the depreciation. The dealership took off $1200 owing to make it fit our budget. But there is still an extra $2500 on the price tag because of the vehicle I'll be getting rid of (I was not at fault, a deer ran into my car on the highway, but that doesn't change the amount of damage). 

 We saw the car fax for the Acura and there were no outstanding recalls and any issues we encountered were brought up with the dealer and they said they would fix it before we took possession (we started the purchase process a week ago).",finance
personalfinance,Should I continue to aggressively pay off debt or start investing?,"I'm 1.5 years out of college making $75k in a rather low cost of living area. I live with my parents rent-free so my expenses aren't much for now, but my gf and I are planning to move to a new city and get an apartment this Fall. Since I started working I've been able to put nearly 3/4ths of my income towards paying off my higher interest (8-10%) private student loans. The only money I've been saving so far is $2500 in a savings account and the maximum 401k contribution that my employer will match. This is the debt I'm left with:

* $10,000 private student loan, 6.24% interest
* $35,000 government student loans, 3.8-5% interest
* $14,000 auto loan, 5.54% interest

I think these interest rates are low enough that I could beat them by investing while I only pay the minimum payments. It'll take 5 years to pay off the car loan with minimum payments and 10 years for the student loans. My tentative plan is to increase my 401k contributions and max out a Roth IRA. I'll maybe even open a regular vanguard brokerage account after that (this seems more plausible now, but after I move and my expenses go up I might not have enough for this).

Is this a sound plan or should I aim for more of a middle ground between investing and paying off the remaining loans early? I knew I had to get those higher interest loans out of the way first so I entirely focused on that for the past year and a half. I've only started to read more about personal finance and explore my options moving forward a few days ago. Any feedback/advice is appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Working in another state - asked to complete state specific W4?,"Since mid- 2018, I have lived in New Hampshire, a state without income tax.  Prior to that I lived in Massachusetts. I have two jobs, a full time job (which I've had since before I moved) and a small part-time (&lt;$6000 annually) job (which I started in late 2018, post move).  Both jobs are fully located in Massachusetts.  I file state taxes in Massachusetts (in 2018 as a resident for half the year and non-resident for the other half and in 2019 as a non-resident).   Other than updating my address in 2018, I did not inform either job that I lived out of state. In 2018, I received a small refund in Mass taxes and though I haven't sent my return yet, it looks like I'm on track for the same in 2019

My PT job just got acquired by a new company and I completed new payroll paperwork, including a W4.   Payroll reached out to me a few weeks after I did this, stating that they noticed that I lived out of state and asking if that was accurate.  I said that it was and they sent me a ""Massachusetts W4"" to complete.  The form is called the ""Massachusetts employee withholding exemption certificate"" and looks similar to the top half of a federal W4, asking me for my withholdings and dependents.  I have never been asked to complete this form before, leading me to think that either my new employer is mistaken or my current employer is mistaken and I may have been withholding incorrectly since the move.  Do I need both a ""federal"" W4  and this form for each job?   (I don't want to claim different withholding for my state taxes).  If I don't complete it, wouldn't they just use my federal form information?  

Did I mess up my previous taxes by not using this form?  Should I inform my full time job that I need to complete it?

I'm in Canada. I have an unsecured line of credit from a renovation I did 2 years ago. I made minimum payments while paying off other parts of the renos for the first year, This year I've been focused on  paying down the LOC, having payed off about 20% of it. My mortgage doesn't come up for renewal for another 4 years and is with a different bank so I can't really use that to decrease the interest I'm paying. Although the house should have enough equity to cover the loan at this point.

I paid the first 500 in cash and the rest was put on a loan (for 3 years, payment being $50 a month) as I didn't want to spend 2k all in one go, and I figured I could build some credit as well.  I haven't missed a payment, and have actually paid more on every payment than i'm supposed to.  Well, my tax return has hit my account, and with 700 left on the loan, I'm figuring I should go ahead and pay it all off.  Here's the deal though.  I've had people tell me I should just let it keep going.  The interest on the account is kinda brutal though.  It's not killing me financially, but I can't stand interest.  Family have been telling me it'll keep building my credit, and it's better to let the loan go for a bit more before paying it off immediately.  I do have a car loan through my same lender that has 3k left on it, which i recently refinanced for another 3 years (no money issues, but it did lower my payment from $150 a month to $80 on the car).

personalfinance,Continue with Public Service Loan Forgiveness or Pay Off Loans Now,"Crossposting from /r/StudentLoans.

I know this is some first world problems shit, but here it goes: I finished fellowship last year and have ~$450K in med school loans at 6.5%. I have been on income based repayment since I started residency 5 years ago, and have 5.5 more years of payments to be eligible to have the remainder of my loans forgiven.

Here's the twist: we inherited $800K from my husband's family a couple of years ago. About $450K is in cash that we had talked about investing into Mutual Funds/ETFs, but I've recently had some issues with my loans going into Forbearance because of Fed Loans screw ups -- I swear. I've been on autopayments for 5 years and this was definitely their fault. This caused, albeit temporarily, $150K of interest to capitalize immediately.

I've done the math out and it looks like the amount of money paid off over time will be pretty close to my current payoff amount (e.g. I should have $100K of debt forgiven, but in five years interest will have added about $100K to my loan).

I know this money isn't mine to do with what I please, and my husband (understandably) has an emotional connection to it and is loathe to spend so much of it like this, but the thought of this much debt hanging over our heads for the next 5+ years and the potential to turn into a much higher amount honestly makes me sick to my stomach to think about.

personalfinance,Better to Save to Avoid Future Debt or Pay Down Existing Debt?,"Hi all! Curious to see what you guys think. I currently have a vehicle I’m driving that I love, i don’t have any payments owed and the vehicle has over 160k miles on it. 
I’m currently in baby step 2 of paying my debts off. I have an extraordinary amount of student loan debt because I was extraordinarily stupid and took out more loans than I needed while in college. 
My goals are to pay that student loan debt off as aggressively as possible, but I’m worried that I’ll need to purchase a vehicle in the next three to five years. Currently I commute to and from work and put maybe 15000 or so miles on a year. 

Would it be better for me to save money for the purchase of a new car now, maybe 200 or so a month, so I can avoid taking out a car loan in the future? Or should I still focus on paying my loans down as quickly as possible? I know it’ll take me about 5-7 years to pay my loans off if I’m aggressive about it and my career trajectory goes the way I’m aiming for it to.

Thanks for your advice guys!

personalfinance,403b roll-over help!,"I'm new to this and just trying to understand my options. 

This was my first job with a retirement plan. I left, my account was less than $1k and the old 403b cut me a check 12/2019. They took out 20% federal tax.

I called my new 403b to roll this over. But they weren't very specific in what I needed to do to make sure I get my 20% taxes back once I reinvest. He said since tax season is coming up, I'd need a special form or something (to submit with taxes) to show I reinvested the money and I could be refunded the 20%.

Does this sound right? What form might this be?

Or, he pushed me, that I could keep the check... And they would have me make up the tax bracket difference (I am only part time and make &lt;$30k now, is my tax bracket likely &gt;20%?) but then there would also be a penalty.

What would the penalty look like for keeping the check? Isn't it better in the long run to reinvest?",finance
personalfinance,[ADVICE NEEDED] - I'll be 30 next month: How do I achieve financial freedom?,"**1st UPDATE:** 

After all the replies, I've realized that I've never really took account of how much $$$ I've had coming in on a monthly basis. Rather, I've grown so accustom to living paycheck to paycheck that I think I've just been trying to find new ways/things to go for broke each and every pay period until the next check rolls around... Obviously this is my main issue.

What I think I'm going to begin doing as soon as my tax return hits... is to use ***ALL OF IT*** in order to pay off the CC debt. 

Once that is taken care of; I'm going to make an excel sheet with all my non-negotiable expenses/necessities and see how much I really have left over after paying all the things I 100% have to be responsible for... Anything leftover will go towards an emergency fund for the next 3-4 months. To cover... Emergencies (unemployment supplemental income, home appliance failures, vehicle maintenance, etc.)

Then, **hopefully around July-August,** I'll begin to save all my extra pennies in a high yield savings acct with some local credit union or online bank, and see what I end up with come November.... Whatever is in there I will blow all or most of it on a down payment for a **CHEAP new**/ **NICE CPO** car, or I'll just buy out my lease on the Camry and put the $$$ towards getting it refreshed/paying it down and drive whatever vehicle that ends up being into the ground for over the next 4-7 years till it is fully paid off and subsequently dies. 

Once that's all situated I think I'll hopefully be able to start banking my raises and tax returns year over year until I'm truly ready to buy a home  and or, pay off my student loan debt \*If I'm required to do so.\* Hopefully within the next 2 years. 

So I guess my come up year will not be 2020, but instead 2022, 2023, or 2024... &gt;.&lt;

**OP:**

I apologize in advance for the long post.

Hello r/PersonalFinance, r/PovertyFinance, r/FinancialPlanning, &amp; r/FinancialIndependence!

I'm writing in because I need a ton of honest advice. I will be 30 in a few weeks and feel like I never really learned to adult. My family was never good with money and we came up poor, my siblings are successful, all making over 6 figures. And I am but a lowly IT Jr. SysAdmin with less than 1 year of experience in-role, living in the Midwest making well below the national average.

Regardless! I would like to know how best to invest my money and to see if I'm doing things right. Current goal would be to retire by 60. That means I have another half my life to fix my mistakes and get it right.

So please be kind and help me to become a F.I.R.E. Starter as I have many things I would like to accomplish this year!

*Onto the Facts...*

*Living in the NW Suburbs of Chicagoland*

**FICO Credit score:** 663 \*Recovering from a Chapter 7 that I did 3 years ago\*

***INCOME:***

**Gross:** $56k \*funny Right? Any other I.T. people here?\***Net:** $3346**Taxes**: Based on my last 2-3 years with my accountant, he's estimating I should see a return of $3.5-5k this year with all I've been through in 2019. So that's good. Right?

***EXPENSES:Rent: $400 - For a tiny bedroomCar*** ***(Gas, monthly, &amp; insurance)***:\*\* $500\*My lease ends in November of this year...\***Entertainment** ***(Dating, Dinner Dates, New Release Movies)***: $250(GF &amp; I are foodies and like to go out once a week)**Groceries:** \~$400 - I enjoy cooking, and also provide groceries for 2 additional senior adults and a 18lb dog. \*Can't seem to save any more on here than I already am.\***Work Lunches:** $15 a day(Not every work day,  and not hitting $15 every time, maybe 3x a week) \*I know this is the obvious place to cut out and I should brown bag my lunches, please don't chastise me.\***Internet:** $80 Metronet - 1Gig connection\*It's like $70 to cut the speed down to 250mbps. Doesn't seem to make much sense to save $10)**Subscription Services &amp; Cell phone:** $150

***INVESTMENTS:***

Luckily, despite being unemployed for 2.5 months in 2019, I still managed to max out my IRA contribution of $6K for the year, and I rolled over my 401k into that same IRA from my previous employer, so I currently have just under $20K with VTSAX \*I know it is pathetic at my age to only have so little saved, but I started late and have only had a 401k going the last \~5 years and up untill 2019 I was contributing the bare minimum to it\*

And I think that's it...

***DEBT:***

\*\*I owe \~$4,200.00 USD. in Credit Cards (6 accts total, all with varying high interest rates)\*\*I discharged well over 10x this amount due to living off credit cards while in college and being dumb with money trying to impress the wrong people by living and providing for others well beyond my means.

Student Loans: I currently owe $47k (43k for my BFA I know, what a load of $H!t, and another 3k and change for my WGU B.S.) Neither loan is having payments made to it, the BFA has it's payments differed but is still collecting some (un?)healthy interest while I await the verdict on my Borrower's defense, and I'm still working on finishing my WGU degree...

Unfortunately, 2019 was unkind to me, and I had many unforeseen expenses crop up with my health and I also was unemployed for 3 months as I was laid off from 1 job, and then took on a short term contract position that ended early. I was also without health insurance for 3/4 of the year.

Not looking for any sympathy or pity, just want to make the best financial decisions I can going forward.

That put's my somewhere around $51-52k in debt... And makes me want to vomit. Granted, it's better than where I was 3 years ago before my chapter 7.

On to...

***FINANCIAL GOALS:***

***\*\*I realize these may be completely unrealistic but they're things I want to happen for myself going into my 30th year of life and in 2020. I am willing to put the time and effort into it to achieve them however I possibly can.\*\****

In order of importance...

1. *Buy my 1st house. (This is non-negotiable. I want my own place. I'm looking for 2-3 rooms, over 1k sq ft, and 2-2.5 bathrooms. Ideally a new or newer construction in a good neighborhood, and I would like it to be under $275k. First time Buyer's loan(s) should help Right?)*
2. I would like to lease a Tesla Model 3 (or buy one used?) as my next vehicle, it doesn't need to be anything fancy, the cheapest one will be more than enough to scratch my itch of having a fast luxury car.
3. I need about 3k done in dental work I've been putting off for almost 3 years now, I can only imagine how much worse it might've gotten/will cost me.
4. I would like to loose weight and get into shape, this means shedding at least 50 lbs, and at most 100lbs. To do this will require a gym membership and some changes to my diet and spending of food.
5. I would like to travel out of the country to somewhere (anywhere?) As I have been to 30 states, but never been outside the country. Doesn't need to be a lavish vacation, just 3-5 days somewhere outside of the U.S.

*I realize a lot of this is probably ""unrealistic, and that I may not be able to accomplish some or all of it in the next 9 months, but I am going to try my damnedest to do so. I hope this community can and will provide me with wisdom to make it happen, for which I will be eternally grateful and do my best to pay it forward in the future.*

Thanks for reading this long post of my musings and rambles, and I hope you have a great rest of your week!",finance
personalfinance,Looking for personal advice on investing my monthly income to get the most return value.,"I've decided to take a close look at my financial situation, and get some insight on how I can be better using my money. Right now, my circumstance is very comfortable, but I feel like there's more I should be doing to help prepare for the future.

I earn about $2300 per month. Of that, about $1200 goes to current necessities, leaving $1100 for everything else.   
From that $1100 I have several parameters for use: $180 is for minimum student loan payments. I've generally been paying much more into this ($250-$400 per month), but I feel like that difference could be invested somewhere else for greater return of value, but I don't know where. My student loan interest rate is 5%, and I have about 140 months remaining on the term.

Currently, I also put a percentage of my paycheck- roughly $280 per month- into my employer's 401k plan, but this currently won't be matched by my employer for a couple of years, and honestly I'm not too familiar with how that system works.

All the rest has been going into savings or used for other expenses. Which is about $500-$600.

I'm really looking at what I can do to effectively manage my money for the long haul (40 years to retirement), but I'm also looking at making a significant change in career and location in the next year or two so I need to be prepared for when that life-change hits. I'm specifically interested in knowing whether it's better for me to keep paying more on my student loan payments, or if there's somewhere else I could be investing the $220 difference (plus additional savings) for a greater rate of return over the next 10 years.

Thank you in advance for the guidance and help on this!",finance

personalfinance,Do I have to ammend my taxes?,"I am paid as a contractor but only made $7,500. My income wasn't deductible but I had to file because I am a contractor and for college.

I thought ""hey, cool! They magically knew I paid already!"" Definitely not the case. It's small but I owe federal $19. After a whole day of crying not knowing why I owe and feeling like a burden (my fiance had to pay for tax services ~$300), I looked back at the documents they had sent of my taxes. Both payments of $600 weren't there. 

I called to ask state about the money I sent them and was confirmed that I will get a total refund of $740. Awesome! I called a line to get ahold of federal and they told me to talk to my tax advisor. So, I did. My tax advisor said to look for something in the mail from the IRS that will hopefully clear everything up. Two weeks have gone by and nothing. I'm going to contact her again but I'm young and very afraid of spending more money to ammend and redo my taxes.

Should I just pay the $19 and get the money back next year?

I keep going back and forth on this and thought some input from this community would help me.

Is it worth it to pay off my student loans right now? I have $4k left planning to use $1k from my tax refund in a few weeks to get them down to $3k. Interest rate is 3.86% and I calculated a while back that paying a little above the minimum wouldn't result in a terrible amount of interest by paying them off over the next 5 or so years. My minimum payment is $75 and I pay $100 a month at this point.

I have \~$13k in a personal investment account that I could take from but am psyched out mentally taking from this because I've had these investments for a while and do have unrealized long term capital gains (so would the tax implication make this a bit sour?

politics,Megathread: U.S. Intelligence Told Lawmakers of Russian Strategy to Boost Trump Re-Election,"Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected, five people familiar with the matter said, a disclosure to Congress that angered Mr. Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.

The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump cited the presence in the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the impeachment proceedings against him, as a particular irritant.

During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he has been tough on Russia and strengthened European security. Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying that had the official who delivered the conclusion spoken less pointedly or left it out, they would have avoided angering the Republicans.

That intelligence official, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire who has a reputation of delivering intelligence in somewhat blunt terms. The president announced on Wednesday that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and long an aggressively vocal Trump supporter.

personalfinance,"Ongoing issue with IRS, any help is appreciated","Please let me know if there's a better sub to post this. Any help is greatly appreciated. Guidance, support citations, precedence, anything that can help this situation.

Let me start off with the issue, then I'll provide the back story.

The IRS says I owe $20,000 including late fees for federal, and $2500 for state, for 2011.

In 2008, my ex wife started a computer repair business for her nephew to run. It was a sole prop. 

I was working for a software development firm at the time. In 2009, the store was so busy, that I started helping out and acting as an operations manager of sorts. My ex wife ran the books and the nephew ran the store.

I was not an employee, and I did not take a paycheck. No bonus', no cash, nothing. I just did it because I knew the profits were going back into the company to grow, and what other profits remaining would go into our household anyway. So getting on payroll was not a real concern for me at the time.

In March of 2010, I had a very bad snowboarding accident which left me debilitated for almost a year. I could barely get myself to the bathroom, let alone up the stairs to the main floor. 

Then, as lightning strikes twice, I was diagnosed with colon cancer, just as I was regaining mobility from the accident. That was April 2011. 

I was essentially disabled after the colon surgery to remove cancerous polyps, which resulted in a bisection and 3"" of my colon being removed after a diverticulum ruptured. I had emergency surgery that split my gut from 2"" above my genitalia, to 2"" above my belly button. 50+ metal staples to hold it all together. Side note: going through this gave me the deepest respect and understanding for women who have had C-sections. A light sneeze is excruciatingly painful.

So, in 2011, my ex wife filed married, jointly - with me as a dependent since I was not able to work. Also note I received no disability or any assistance at that time. Between my ex wifes full time job and the computer store, we were making about $150K a year, so there was no need to seek aid. 

In January 2012, ex wife up and leaves in the middle of the night and runs away. She left me in her house (that she owned before we married), and her four teenage daughters (my step kids - I pretty much raised the two youngest as my own).

Fast forward, I recover and remarry. We start a business together, build it up and sell it. In 2014, we sell everything and move to the Philippines (wifes birth country). Long story short, she'd lived int he states 10yrs before I met her and she had inherited a large chunk of land from her mother. 

Fast forward a little further and we move back and start another business. Then I get contacted by the IRS in 2016 that I owe all this money based on 2011.

From what I understand, my ex wife filed a petition for abatement and basically put the whole tax burden on me. Even though I was disabled and had zero ownership in her company, nor provided any income. 

I hired a lawyer for a flat fee of $3000. What he's done so far is just refile my last 3 years returns.

What do I do? What lawyer do I need to contact? 

I am very adamant that I do not owe this. How can it be this easy for someone to do this? 

&amp;#x200B;

FYI: my ex wife left during a mid life crisis. Part of it was that she was a grandmother at 45. The oldest daughter was pregnant. The other part of her leaving was, she did not want to take care of an invalid. I was broken, damaged, no longer had value, so I was discarded. She felt the only way to get out was to leave till I left, then she'd come back. I stayed for almost a year, hoping she'd return. All the while, caring for her kids. I did not work. I had about $40K in cash rat holed in my closet, so I was just living on cash savings. Their grandma finally moved in around October and I moved out.

Also note that I am fine now. No sign of cancer after I did two years of a modified version of the Gerson method. Working as a project manager / operations manager for a mid size company. I also own 30% of a wholesale company that's barely breaking even due to a string of unreliable employees, but we're on the right track. I technically could pay the tax bill off in less than a year if I felt I owed it. But I don't believe I do.",finance

personalfinance,19 Years Old - How to invest without a Roth IRA,"Hey all!

I'm currently a third-year student at a state school in California and am a bit lost on how to proceed in terms of properly managing my personal finances. If anyone could help out a bit, it would be greatly appreciated!

Finances:

\- Will be making around 34k this coming summer (Jun - Aug) and will have a job lined up after I graduate in the spring of 2021 making around 155k pre-tax

\- I currently have a ROTH IRA account under Vanguard with about 1500 contributed for the 2019 year, and around 1500 in a Robinhood account for personal investing

\- Will have about 25k in student loans at a 4.63% interest rate that starts in January of 2021

I see a bunch of posts on this subreddit about contributing and maxing out contributions for your Roth and getting consistent 6-7% on your money, and I want to be able to do that. But I recently did some research and I won't be able to contribute any additional capital into my IRA because my income is over 139k.

That being said, what securities are next for me to focus on for building my wealth and preparing for retirement? Should I just invest in an S&amp;P tracker on a traditional brokerage like Charles Schwab or my Robinhood and take the tax hits on that? What's the next best and safe way to capture those 6-7% market gains without having a Roth IRA? Also, after I start my job and break the income threshold to have the IRA, will it close down on me or will it just keep growing with the original principal already in the account? 

Thanks, and hope you all have a great day!",finance
stocks,"Gold and gold stocks continue to rise, $2000 an oz on the way. Gold is currently $1624.80 and climbing.","Re-Edit: gold up to $1645

The fed has injected nearly half a trillion dollars into the repo market to keep interest rates artificially low. The federal reserves balance sheet is back over 4 trillion dollars; they reversed course months ago.

The fed shouldn’t care what happens to the stock market, they should be focused on monetary policy. We saw the fed hike to 2.5% and tank the market in December 2018. The “strong economy” should be able to handle rates at at least 5%. We typically need around 4-5% in interest rate cuts to get us out of a recession. The federal reserves problem is that it’s going to cut all the way down to 0% before the recession, leaving them with no “monetary ammo” to help get the economy out of recession. 

Of course they’ll just let quantitative easing run rampant. At all time market highs were already in QE4. Gold price will rise faster than people think.

Even if the stock market goes up in nominal terms due to all of the money printing, it’s real value won’t be worth anything. The fed is going to risk a currency crisis, it’s purchasing power will tank. The market will finally realize the years of debt monetization. In recession, the deficits will likely hit 2-3 trillion dollars annually. 

The fed took their balance sheet from 800 billion to 4+ trillion. It could reach 10 trillion very quickly, but the number doesn’t matter so much. It’s more of a psychological matter. Eventually the inflation will leave the stock market and hit consumer prices. 

A mix of bullion and mining stocks (for leverage) seems to be the best way to go. Gold up ~35% since the summer of 2018. Depending on the mining stock you’re up probably up around 25%-40%, some winners are up 60-80%. 
As gold gains in confidence, more money will start flowing into the mining stocks. So far the miners have lagged behind gold. But that will change when their earnings start to come out. Especially when the sentiment changes in the sector (which we’ve already seen), due to the mining stocks being forward looking.",finance

personalfinance,Are taxes on company stock options/grants different than standard income tax?,"Trying to understand tax models for my father who suffered a stroke. He has had a lot of stock grants and stock options as bonuses to his cash salary.

I was briefly speaking with a fiduciary who mentioned they may be considered long term capital gains. Yes I will eventually speak to a tax attorney/accountant (soon, waiting on conservator paperwork), but curious to know. 

If someone has around 5 mm value in stock options and grants, and had to exercise/liquidate in a short period of time, would they still be subject to the entire income tax (which I think between federal, ss, and ca, would be nearly 50%), or the capital gain which, online, is saying around 15-20%?

personalfinance,"Refinance after a year, pull money out?","I bought last year and interest rates are down like 1%. The mortgage broker called me and is interested in a refinance which seems like it will save quite a bit of money to get in at a lower rate. 

For simplicity in math let's say the house was $100k. It was a standard 20% down 30 year fixed, and based on an amortization table I've paid about $1k of the total value of the house in principle, so I now own $21k and would be refinancing $79k. However, I also spent about $10k of the value of the house on upgrades (solar, furnace, and a major garage renovation). 

So if the house could be appraised at $110k of it's purchase price, and since I still owe the bank $79k, then I'd have $31k in equity. 

Does that help me with anything? My friend was like 'dude that means you can cash out a bunch of your equity by taking out a mortgage for $88k (80% of 110k)

stocks,Best summary of what actually sets and changes stock prices in the market,"https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/43343

&gt;Can someone please explain to me how stock prices go up and down? What are the underlying physical and information technology phenomena and algorithms that drive a stock up or down?

This question may be better on the personal finance or the economics site, but I will answer it here. The question is very difficult because no one thing causes it. There is also a very different solution to the question if you are asking about the immediate future versus a long period of time as the factors are different.

In the short-run, if you look at the mechanics of a trade, there are two main broad categories of orders and in the United States, two types of markets. The two order types are market orders and limit orders. The two market types are auction markets and dealer markets. Both of these sentences are overgeneralizations. The NYSE does not work the way the now defunct Arizona exchange worked. Fill-or-kill orders do not work the way a market order for a single round lot works.

The key element of equity market orders is that until an offer is made, the short-run supply curve and the demand curve do not intersect. The existence of a bid-ask spread implies the curves are non-intersecting in the immediate period. For an order to be filled, the immediate curve has to be shifted. Of course, the true short-run curves includes as yet unseen supply and demand. I may be willing to pay $50 per share for IBM but may not have placed my order yet. I might be eating lunch. The immediate demand curve cannot include my order, but the short-run curve, at least in theory, does.

Market makers and specialists keep a supply of cash and shares on hand to cover market orders in the event no other party has an outstanding market order that would cover the transaction. The bid-ask spread is their compensation for carrying the inventory risk. As an example, imagine a bid price of 49.50 and an ask of 49.75. You buy shares at market for 49.75. The bid and ask change to 49.600 and 50.00. Someone else wants to sell, so they ask 49.60 for the shares. The market maker pays 49.60 and recovers their inventory that they had sold to you, pocketing the fifteen cents.

When someone places a market order, it drains the liquidity of the market maker or specialist by taking away their inventory of cash or shares. A market order allows a filling of shares, pretty much on demand, but the price is set by the dealer if there is no outstanding limit order to cover it. For larger orders, a market order is an order to continue bidding any amount of money to guarantee you are the high bidder as a buyer or the low bidder as a seller in order to be certain that your order will be filled, no matter what.

Limit orders state the prices that can be paid by a broker in order for you to buy or sell shares. If I am willing to sell at $50, then I cannot receive less than $50 (gross of commissions). I can receive more. If I am willing to pay $12.50 per share, then I will not have to pay more than $12.50 per share before commissions. If there is no offer inside my limits, then my order will never be filled.

For market orders, the price is driven by the bidding process. Market orders will keep bidding higher and higher or lower and lower until the order is filled. For limit orders, which provide liquidity to the market makers, those limits set the pricing for the market makers as they can use those orders to fill their obligations. People who state the prices publicly are the ones who decide what the price will be. In exchange for setting a limit order, the brokers are obligated to get the best price available for the maker of those limit orders. So if I say I will pay $12.50, but a broker can get it for me at $11.40, then I will get it at $11.40.

Now there is one more wrinkle in the short-run. When you look at a chart or trades on a ticker, that is not the actual order in which they happened. That is the order in which they were reported. Large orders would disrupt the market, so they are only reported as a weighted average of the trade prices and only after that order would no longer have a disruptive effect on the price. So if there is an order to buy 10,000 shares and everyone knew that people might make really high limit orders to make it hard to fill the big order and others might glom on to buy knowing the price will be driven up by the large order. So if you see a price change, it might not reflect the true current price structure. The bid-ask spread does, but the immediate spread does not appear on the charts and isn't recorded for most of US history.

In the long run, prices are driven by large macroeconomic forces. If you have a choice of eating or buying shares, you will choose to eat. This means that stock market money is always leftover money. It is money above your consumption needs. In addition, other assets compete for your money, such as bonds and bank accounts. As such, if someone will pay enough to borrow money, stocks cannot give a lower return as they make no promises about future cash flows.

Furthermore, stocks are countercyclical. There is more free money during an economic expansion than a recession. So stock prices are the worst when people need money the most, and the best when they least need it. Bonds are procyclical. When the economy is doing poorly, people seek the safety of bonds. Also, of importance, inflation falls as there is no demand for money, comparatively and so bonds become of greater value. Likewise, to stimulate the economy interest rates fall, so the present value of bonds rises.

In the very long term, dividends follow inflation on a lagged basis, and prices move with corporate productivity. Improvements in productivity that persist have a long impact on prices. In the very long term, inflation and persisting interest rates impact prices. In the very long term, demographic factors matter. In the US, baby boomers are retiring and selling their shares to live off the money. There are fewer young people, fewer even now that immigrants are being deported. If foreigners are willing to pick up the slack, the price will rise. If native borns need even more shares to be sold, then prices will fall. Finally, taxes have a complicated relationship with stocks. Low tax levels are bad in the long run. High tax levels are bad in the long run. That is because levels of taxation reflect the public expenditure on infrastructures like roads or law enforcement. The disaster that was Kansas' tax structure is a great example. Kansas destroyed its economy with tax rates that were unsustainably low. So did Greece. On the other hand, during the Cold War tax rates were very high, at the margin, but didn't always buy useful public goods.

There is also a difference between auction markets and dealer markets. In auction markets, buyers bid against other buyers for the right to buy while sellers bid against other sellers for the right to sell. These are high volume markets and so price swings tend to be smaller because there is a greater level of competition and more observable orders that permits easier price discovery. Dealer markets are more like retail stores. All trades are with dealers and no trades are with other individuals. Dealers set the prices, though competitively against other dealers.

As the dealers are covering the markets out of their own pockets, the liquidity costs are higher, so the spreads are wider. This makes markets look more volatile even when they are basically flat and moving sideways. In dealer markets, ever trade is wider.

There are tons of algorithms in place, but there isn't just one. If you would look at my trades as an ""algorithm"", it wouldn't look like another investor's algorithm. I use long run valuation rules. A day trader uses a minute-by-minute or second-by-second time horizon. We are not using the same thinking and we do not have the same goals. There are thousands of separate algorithms in place.",finance

stocks,Buy VSLR/RUN/SEDG/ENPH and how they are different from FSLR - Complete DD,"First and foremost, I have followed the energy sector for quite some time so I'll give my thoughts on what I see with the aforementioned stocks and the trajectory as a whole.

This was my post some several months ago when ENPH had it's big ITC drop; needless to say, I bought the dip but without much capital at the time. 

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpce9k/enph\_could\_be\_your\_next\_success\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpce9k/enph_could_be_your_next_success_story/)

That being said, let's jump in on the DD.

This year should be a great year for energy/green stocks with the rapid shifting of tech companies towards fully electric and renewable energy sources (namely TSLA, Intel, MSFT, Google, Apple, etc - all of which use solar energy as part of their operations). Considering the growth of the solar industry in the last year as well as software-driven solar tech, the energy market is consistently finding new opportunities to increase exposure in the greater market and making meaningful partnerships. Take for example Sun Power, which is one of the largest distributors of solar panels in the U.S, Phillips which is working on a sustainable energy source for TSLA vehicles, PLUG which is making deals with Amazon, Walmart, and potentially Home Depot. In fact, the U.S in 2019 has increased this sector's employment by 250,000 jobs in just Florida alone, and an increase in 31 states. Employment rate is oftentimes  a great predictor for an industry's health and outlook. Moreover, legislation such as CA Title 24 mandate requires all homes built after 2020 to have solar PV installed, and prior to this, following Lennar, Toll Brothers, and KBH, every new property developed in the last 2 years have solar installed and software-solar tech (automated thermostats). Another thing to consider is the cutting of door-to-door sales in many solar tech companies, and focusing on consultants that build partnerships for these companies. Vehicles are also starting to move into solar tech, with TSLA being the obvious front runner, but also fully electric Jaguars, MUSTANGS, and Audi's, all of which have never produced any fully electric, or even hybrid vehicles up until the recent years. The demand for solar is high and traditional energy providers (fossil fuels and standard energy providers) are starting to lose marketshare in the energy sector. This is mainly as a result of the growing issues and litigations over high winds, faulty equipment, and fires. If you take a look at solar installations, you will see a clear trend:

&amp;#x200B;

Starts with ITC incentives have been very favorable towards these solar companies, and with the tiered tax credit incentive system that depreciates each year, people are incentivized to get this tech sooner than later. What the ITC means (for those that don't know), it's the investment tax credit which is a 26% federal tax deduction for installing solar tech in your home. And as the full electric auto market grows, there is a substantially larger percentage of residents that will have these installed. For those buying new homes this year and forward, they will come fully furnished. 

There are lots of catalyst in this space, everything from the automotive industry, real estate industry, software tech industry, ITC, and general move towards renewable energy. Cloud based platforms will require an immense amount of energy to run these cloud servers, and MSFT/Amazon are already all over solar tech. This area is also just starting to develop rapidly. 

My picks are, from most optimistic to least:

VSLR, RUN, SPWR, ENPH, SEDG 

Also, for those that are discussing FSLR, it was a huge miss but imo analyst had no reason to lift EPS this high and guidance last quarter was far too optimistic. One big reason why I believe FSLR failed is that they are the only utility-scale distributor in the mix. That means they only work with utility companies to provide energy on large grids, however, they do not fit into the category or have partnerships with commercial or residential units. Moreover, as utility companies are beginning to lose marketshare and are losing the trust of customers (especially in CA), I can only imagine that FLSR partnerships are suffering. Anyway, I lost money on my calls which will probably be at -90% at open. I thought it would ride the energy wave, but I was wrong. 

Also, WSB auto hid this post. lol",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my car loan ASAP?,"I currently have a car loan in which I currently owe around $14k. The loan was thru a credit union and has an interest rate of around 2% payable in 3 years.I currently money sitting in a HYSA projected to earn around 500$ a year in a 1.6% rate and I have enough money to pay off this car loan and be worry free of payments and not struggle after I pay it. Aside from that, I do not have any debt on my credit cards as I pay the full amount each month.  The interest I earn in 3 years in a HYSA is greater compared to the interest that I will be paying for the car loan. So it is worth dropping 14k and pay off the car and be worry free of car payments? Or should I just keep paying it for 3 years until it gets payed off?",finance
personalfinance,401k and HCE question,"I have saved the 401k federal maximum for the past several years and also save the fed max for my Roth IRA. However I just found out from our 401k company that because I made $125,845 last year in wages, I am now considered a Highly Compensated Employee (HCE) for the purposes of our traditional 401k plan. And in my research it appears that as a member of the HCE group we can only be 2% higher in our average deferrals than the non-HCE employee group. And the savings rate for the non-HCE group sucks and currently around 1.7%. 

If current savings trends continue for 2020 it appears I am only going to be able to defer around $4k into my 401k this year. So I’ll miss out on the ability to defer about $15k. 

Other than taking that after tax money and investing it into a similar Vanguard fund, any other ideas? 

Thanks for any insight, thoughts, and help!",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

personalfinance,Future effect of paying back unemployment over-payment on taxes and 8962,"Graduated grad school, was unemployed, filed for unemployment and they accepted me when they shouldnt have. So now I have to pay back ~7k. 

Also during this time I got health insurance through covered california which I now understand was through use of the premium tax credit. 

Ended up getting a job, stopped that stuff, but then made enough money that I should not have gotten that assistance in the first place.

I know once I pay it back the following year when I do my taxes I will need to go back and adjust to get more money back. My question is do I adjust for the federal taxes (ie right now it says I made ~40k when really it will be ~33k, so I will get the money back from the taxes the 7k), as well as form 8962 (so now I am eligible for like 25$ of assistance, but once I pay back the 7k I should have been eligible for more)?

investing,What are the possible scenarios for the next 3-5 years,"I have seen a lot of talks in this sub about an upcoming recession and the burst of the everything bubble, but I'd like to try and list some of the possible scenarios for the coming years, along with the corresponding strategy. These are just my thoughts so feel free to correct me if you think I'm wrong somewhere and to add any other outcome you think is possible (not necessarily likely). Here are a few examples of what I have in mind:

1) Status quo: The current deflationary pressures continue, allowing central banks to keep on issuing more debt. Fundamental indicators remain strong and valuations keep on rising. Negative interest rates become more and more widespread. Strategy: Invest in the general market (indicial ETFs, growth strategies).

2) Plateau: Valuations hit a plateau and the markets start exhibiting punctual moderate drawdowns, followed by long periods of moderate growth.  Strategy: Value investment and flight to quality, carry more cash to take advantage of the punctual drawdowns.

3) Inflation: Inflation finally catches up, forcing central banks to stop quantitative easing and increase interest rates. The market drops over the course of several months. Strategy: Carry cash (unless you think inflation is going to hit really hard), gold, bitcoins

4) Reset: Global debt is reset as is has almost become purely theoretical (more than 300% of global GDP). Strategy: Own hard assets (gold and other commodities, real estate).

5) Monetary decentralization: The monetary system becomes decentralized thanks to blockchain. Definitely a stretch on a 3-5 horizon, but a possibility on the longer term. Strategy: Similar to 4) I guess as 5 could be a consequence of 4.

personalfinance,Pay off Student Loan Debt or Contribute More to Retirement?,"I am now in a spot financially (thankfully just got out of 25k worth of CC debt from being a reckless 20year old) where I can contribute to my retirement and work to pay off my student loans. I am torn as to whether or now I should contribute a higher % to retirement, or pay more aggressively towards my student loans. 

My job offers a 403(b). My contributions are matched, dollar for dollar, up to 6 percent. Plus, they contribute an additional 3 percent. I am currently contributing 1% just to get their additional contribution. I was considering upping it to 7%, which would make the total contribution 16% monthly. If I contributed 7% it would cost me about $375/monthly.

I have no other debt except revolving CC debt, since I put all of my expenses on my CC and then pay off the balance monthly. My student loan debt is 57,500 at a 4.59% interest rate. I have a monthly payment of $530.

Currently, I have about $500 in savings, but looking to put $500 in savings monthly just to have a small savings for an emergency. 

Would you recommend contributing $375 to retirement + pay the minimum $530 on my student loans, or funneling that $375 to the student loans to pay it off quicker?",finance

personalfinance,Questions about retiring and investing at an older age,"Howdy, PF. I’m a longtime lurker, and I had a few questions about investing and retirement. I’m a bit older, 40, and due to a divorce and some career changes, I basically had to start over at 35. I’m doing pretty well in my new career and my husband is also moving up in his (he just got a job where they offer a 401k option). I wanted to show you my finances and see if you had any suggestions where I could contribute, rearrange, or invest my savings and assets to maximize my changes of retiring on time.

We’ve managed to sock away around 50k, 40 of which is in a high yield savings account, 5 in a CD, and the other 4500-5000 in a savings account that’s connected to our checking for emergencies. I have around 20k in my 401k. I think he has about the same.

I own a home that we bought last year and I have 90k in equity. I plan to stay here until I’m around 55-60ish, and then hopefully sell and buy a small place in a low cost of living area w cash, that way I’m rent/mortgage free for my “twilight” years. 👵🏼 

And yes, I know I need to put more in my 401k. I’m definitely trying. We live in an insane cost of living area. My goal is to be at 15% in the next year.

My question is: what do I do w this 40k that sitting in a high yield savings account? Should I put some in a Vanguard account? Put it in my 401k? Leave it to make interest? Right now the interest rate w Synchrony is like 2.5% I think? The CD is a 24 month CD w a rate of return of maybe 3%? Are stocks going to make me any more? And if so, who can help me w that sort of thing? Also, I’m scared of LOSING money, too. Help an old broad out, guys!

gaming,Question: Do y’all prefer live services or contained campaigns and single player games?,"So myself and several others that I’ve seen post here in the past, talk about our lost or slightly diminished passion for gaming in general. The other day I had a thought that I might know the reason why. 

Almost all of the games I have now, have some sort of live service element that keeps going. So when the new “season” rolls around for each game, I’ve got 10+ new season passes and member rewards to go collect if I want to keep current on all my loot and such. It’s like trying to juggle so many balls at once and more just keep getting added.

Now a lot of that isn’t mandatory and it’s all for fun and usually cosmetic, but I still feel like I’m missing out which is part of the way those things were designed. I feel like with so many games competing for my time, I’d rather give it to one that isn’t trying so hard like Skyrim,  Assassins Creed, Spider-Man, God of War, games like that.

Then there’s the entirely separate argument about wether the content in those games is comparable as far as density is concerned and the amount of effort that needs to be put in.  A’la, the drip fed method of content in a live service game vs getting the whole cake at once with a single player/campaign style game.

So I was curious, how do you feel about games that constantly vie for your attention? And does that make you turn into them, or away from gaming in general? 

TL;DR I think live service games are burning us out on gaming because of the constant need for attention.",technology
personalfinance,Should I refinance my home?,"Bought a home in April 2017 for $485,000. Put 20% down and initial mortgage was $388,000. Got a 30 year fixed @ 3.99%. PITI currently is about $2550. Have been putting down a little extra each month (about an extra PI payment a year). Currently owe $364,000. 

Just got a quote to refinance another 30 year fixed @ 3.25%. No points. Title fees is about $1200. No appraisal needed, so likely no jump in property tax. New estimated PITI payment will be about $2275 if I slightly overestimate. So about $275/month saving on PITI, however I will down 3 years again. 

I was looking at 15-year fixed at 2.865%, however after calculating monthly payments it would 15 years, 6 months to pay off the home if we put down additional principal every month to match the 15 year PITI payment. I think it’s nice to have the flexibility to pay a lower payment if needed, especially since rates are edging at historical lows. 

Not sure if this is a forever home, however high chance we will stay in this area for a long time. Even if we did buy a new place around town we would rent this house out. Comparable rentals like ours go for $2900-3200/month. We have more than enough to drop 20% down on another house if we had to. 

I’m thinking it’s a smart idea to refi, however I just wanted to get other thoughts that I might be missing something that I should take into consideration. Also if we do refi, we are open to pay it off aggressively. Willing to pay an additional $700-800/month, but at the same time we could put that extra $700-800/month in our taxable brokerage accounts. We both having working careers, 2 young kids, max out retirement (Max TSP x2, Max Roth-IRA x2, also contribute to 529 plan, have pension through federal). 

So any good reason not to refinance based on our scenario.",finance
personalfinance,Relocation Assistance is Taxable Income?,"I relocated from Florida to Utah for a new job and was offered $5,000 in relocation assistance.

When I received the disbursement today, the net amount was $3,540.69. $1,459.31 went to taxes.

This message was passed to me by HR from their Senior Payroll Specialist:

&gt;\------ told me that the moving allowance was taxable and the **gross** was $5,000. It was taxed at his regular rate. If we ran it with the special withholding rules, it would have withheld even more (25% federal and 5% UT) instead of the 17% federal and 5% UT that was withheld. I'm sure he’s probably figuring the social security and medicare in as part of the 29.18% in tax that he is saying was withheld. The only other thing he could do would be to claim EXEMPT for that check and no federal or state taxes would be withheld. Let me know if there are any other questions about this.

It actually cost me more than $5,000 to get out here, so $1,400 is a pretty big cut out of that money I thought I had.

*Should* I ask them to claim this as EXEMPT, or should I wait a year and see if my tax return will give the bulk of that missing cash back? I feel like I've been double taxed: once for the sales tax on the moving expenses, again to get the money to reimburse me for the move.

business,How to find new markets through value chain analysis,"I have been familiar with the concept of value chains for quite a long time. However, it wasn’t until I read Ben Thompson’s Stratechery blog that I came across its practical applications in market analysis. Looking at products and companies from the point of view of their position in the value chain opens up a new perspective that helps to understand them, find not-so-obvious opportunities, and make more effective decisions.

Today I’ll talk about value chains within the context of expanding an established business or product to new markets. There will be more essays devoted to companies entering the new markets. In each, I will focus on different aspects of this process.

In this series of essays, I want to analyze the possible ways for businesses and products to enter adjacent and new markets. I will also discuss the advantages, nuances and pitfalls of these methods.

In this post, I focus on one of the most risk-free ways to enter a new market, which basically involves moving along the value chain towards the related dependent segments.

# What is a value chain?

I will use the concept of a value chain in a much broader sense than the one [introduced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain) by Michael Porter in 1985.

We will consider the value chain as the structure of interactions between different market players who create the necessary value to meet the market’s demand.

A similar use of this concept can be found on the Stratechery blog. In the early years of the blog, the author looked at the value chain as a way of tracking the flow of money in an industry. But eventually, he came to a broader definition that describes the value chain as how different companies interact to create the value needed to meet the demand of a particular market.

Companies build different integrations within the value chain. This integration defines the defensibility of their market positions, the level of profitability, and the ability to expand to related niches. If it sounds abstract and vague, don’t worry. We have some examples coming up.

# Value Chain Examples

Depending on the problem you are trying to solve, value chains can be visualized with varying degrees of detail. For example, here is how Ben Thompson describes in one of his essays the differences between the way Amazon and Walmart integrated into value chain aimed at satisfying the retail demand.

Walmart’s core business integrates the wholesale purchasing, distribution, and stores:

* First, Walmart is able to get the best price for their wholesale purchasing.
* Then, with the help of distribution centers and logistics infrastructure and special processes that ensure the freshness of perishable foods, it ensures the distribution of goods to the networks of their stores.
* Final demand is met through physical Walmart stores.

Amazon has created an alternative way to meet its retail demand:

* Amazon purchases goods from suppliers at wholesale prices.
* Amazon is also a marketplace and significant part of its inventory comes from third-party merchants (this is not included in Ben Thompson’s scheme, but I believe such a connection between supply and Amazon.com should be mentioned here, since the share of third-party sellers in Amazon’s GMV (Gross merchandise value) amounted to 58% in 2018).
* The final demand is met through Amazon’s online store, where customers order the necessary goods to be delivered.
* Quick and reliable delivery in this case requires the coordinated work of distribution centers, duplication of stock, quick fulfillment, as well as the participation of third-party logistics companies.

The fundamental differences between how Amazon and Walmart are integrated into the value chain are as follows: Both companies were originally created to solve completely different tasks in retail and then organically developed on the basis of this foundation (such as purchasing food vs buying books, and then audio CDs and others categories of non-perishable goods) later on.

Now, the respective positions of Amazon and Walmart in the value chain largely determines which new markets each company can and cannot enter in a quick and efficient way.

# Moving along the value chain into dependent segments is a predictable way to expand your business to new markets

What does the value chain have to do with expanding your business to new markets?

In fact, it has a lot to do with it. Analyzing a company’s position in the value chain may help find opportunities to enter a new market segment in many ways. I will discuss some of them in future essays. This essay, however, focuses on moving to adjacent value chain–dependent market segments.

Moving into adjacent market segments in the value chain is one of the predictable ways to expand the business to the new markets. Moreover, the company’s management tends to intuitively select such a development vector, gradually increasing the control of the system (building a vertically integrated system).

Amazon is a classic example of a company that is expanding to adjacent dependent segments of the value chain very aggressively.

A few years ago, Amazon began to build its own delivery wing. Amazon now has over 20,000 trucks and 60 cargo planes under its wing. Over the past year, Amazon’s delivery has become its largest shipping channel, accounting for almost 50% of all of the deliveries Amazon has made.

While it is primarily serving its own delivery needs, Amazon already holds an 18% share of the US online delivery market. The next logical step would be to provide delivery services to other companies, probably at a lower price than the market, since Amazon doesn’t need to make this new business unit profitable in the short term. This is bad news for UPS and FedEx, which have been enjoying large profit and growth from Amazon’s booming ecommerce business (both companies’ revenues have almost tripled since 2000, and both of these companies are profitable).

Another example of a similar strategy is the manufacturing and selling of goods made under the Amazon brand. Amazon has done this in a number of categories that were previously dominated by third-party merchants. Amazon sees an interesting and profitable business segment that it can easily seize by taking advantage of its current position in the market.

# Search engines are part of many value chains

The study of search engines provides many examples of how products and businesses launched through entering adjacent segments within the value chain. Due to the centrality of product search on the Internet, search engines have become a key component of many value chains. This has placed search engine companies at an advantageous gatekeeper position in many markets and helped them to maintain growth rates even after internet penetration slowed down on all the major markets.

For example, a large proportion of search queries are geo-related or related to organizations. Given this information, the logical step for Google, Baidu and Yandex was to create a predictable high quality experience for their end users by building their own mapping and location services. These services became a logical continuation of the search product at an early stage, but eventually got stronger and set off a race to conquer new adjacent segments of the value chain (such as traffic jams, routing, navigation, taxis).

Other similar examples might be Google Chrome, Google Translate and other services launched by the biggest search engine companies.

Moreover, these companies do not always have to build a product that will become a direct competitor to profit from an adjacent segment in the value chain. The most demonstrative example is the launch of advertising products on search engines, which caused a large-scale redistribution of profit within several value chains by creating competition between the players in their markets. This is how Google and Yandex created a mechanism that attracted a significant part of the companies that depend on search traffic and context advertising to their platforms.

It is illustrative how Google now keeps squeezing large markets that are dependent on the company but have somehow managed to protect their profitability. Below you can find the stock price dynamics of Expedia and Tripadvisor for the past year. Both companies did not achieve their financial goals in the third quarter of 2019. As a result, the valuation of both companies fell by about 25% in one day. What did the companies have to say about this? [Both said](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/07/expedia-and-tripadvisor-stocks-tank-after-poor-third-quarter-earnings.html) the reason for missing the targets was due to reduced visibility on organic search results.

For both companies, SEO is one of the key distribution channels. But with the user transition towards mobile devices, the increase in the number of ads in search results, and the presence of Featured Snippets, and the addition of special modules (for example, when you need to look through hotels using filters and say a map), the share of organic search traffic in the tourism segment began to plummet. This was a direct signal from Google that in order to get traffic from this search segment one will need to pay for ad placement (many of the features mentioned above provide paid prioritization).

# A direct attack against a dominant player in the value chain will most likely fail

Not every company’s move into an adjacent segment in the value chain will lead to positive results. If the company plans to attack a player that occupies a stronger or even equal position, then chances of success are low.

Take VSCO, one of the pioneers of photo editing for smartphones and one of the most successful companies of its kind with a multi-million audience (the app has over 200M downloads). Its revenue exceeds a few million dollars per month.

Users primarily use VSCO to edit and process their photos before posting them on Instagram. If we were the VSCO product management team that saw this kind of use case, we would probably wonder, “If we already own the starting point of this user journey, then why not integrate it entirely into our service? Let the users edit and publish their images on VSCO, follow and talk to friends, and eventually view some ads.”

This kind of thinking probably pushed VSCO and a number of other photo editors towards making their own social networks, which, for the obvious reasons, had no chance of posing a threat to Instagram’s position, protected by the company’s strong network effects. At the same time, the reverse sounds quite possible: If Instagram decides to clone the popular editor and add its features to its own product, it will turn out just fine. However in most cases, social giants are not interested, with rare exceptions (we can think of adding MSQRD to Instagram, or Looksery to Snapchat).

How can we understand who has a stronger position in the value chain? This will require examining and understanding a particular market. In this study, it makes sense to look at who stands closer to the end customer, what are the defense mechanisms that different companies have, and what part of this value chain has a level of competition.

While the market is growing rapidly, the interests of all its participants in the value chain are usually aligned. As soon as growth slows down, the attention switches from outside to inside. At this moment, the players holding stronger positions begin to support their growth by expanding to new markets and capturing market share of other companies that depend on them. We have already discussed examples of similar behavior from search engines and Amazon. Here you can find a good analysis of the relationship dynamics within value chains for the PC and smartphone markets.

# Examples of dependent players who have gained independence within their value chain

Value chains change slowly, but they change nonetheless. Sometimes the reason for this change is the shift happening in the world around us (i.e. the transition from the era of personal computers to the smartphone era), and sometimes it happens due to the competent actions of companies that allow them to change the balance of power.

For example, Booking.com was able to reduce its dependence on search traffic by creating a strong brand. Here is what Booking Holding’s CEO had to say about the SEO channel issue at the end of Q3, 2019, following the poor results of Expedia and Tripadvisor: “Regarding SEO, we saw some headwinds in the SEO channel that did create some modest pressure, but it’s a small channel for us.”

Another example is Amazon. Amazon is currently the main entry point for searching for goods in the US. The company accounts for 45% of all product queries, while Google’s share stands at 33%. Ten years ago, the situation looked totally different: Google was way ahead of Amazon.

Another source of change in the dynamics of relationships within the value chain is the way the world changes around us. For example, the rise of social networks has allowed artists and athletes to escape the control of producers, record labels, clubs, etc., and change the structure of their value chains. Previously, it was mainly the clubs/producers/labels who signed deals with sponsors, making them an essential part in any artist’s/athlete career. But now the system has altered, making the old players weaker. Artists and athletes have gained much more freedom and new opportunities to build direct relationships with their fans as well as brands and advertisers. But now, their dependency has shifted to social media giants.

# Summing it up

Some companies, due to the nature of their first product, find themselves involved in a large number of value chains. This provides them with great opportunities to enter new business segments based on the foundation they’ve established. But there are some products that are self-contained, and for them, such a business expansion model turns out to be extremely limited. It might even be dangerous if the team mistakenly thinks there is an adjacent market where there isn’t.

Another important point is that one shouldn’t think of a vacant adjustment business segment as a call to action. The prospect of each opportunity should be evaluated in the broader context of other projects and their potential ROI.

Value chains are a great tool that allows you to look at your product or business from a new angle. It can help with the search for new growth points, as well as the identification of potential risks due to a dependent position from other companies in the value chain. Try to picture the value chain for your market and meditate on how your company, your partners and competitors are integrated into it. There is a high chance you might find something new.",finance

personalfinance,Seeking Advice: Beware Shady Personal Investors,"Okay, so here's what I know of the story. Basically, my mom had her entire retirement savings held with one or both of these firms that went bankrupt sometime in either 2018 or 2019. She lost all of her money, but since then the advisors have been arrested, with one conviction and one starting trial, for fraudulent investments. Basically, these assholes were swindling elderly people out of their retirement savings by making fraudulent investments between the two firms and pocketing millions in commissions.

My mom literally lost her entire retirement savings to these assholes after their companies went bankrupt, even though they walked away super rich. She's now fighting to keep a roof over her head and food on her plate, but I'm sure she's not the worst case.

So first, a warning that if you or anyone you know worked with the firms Woodbridge or Ironbridge, you have legal rights and need to work with an attorney.

Second, I have the following three questions:

1) My mom is already speaking with an attorney, but her money is with a ""liquidation trust"" (not sure what that is?), and she's only getting small amounts distributed at a time. Is there anything she can do to get her money back if her investment firm filed bankruptcy? It would be nice to keep her money growing instead of being stagnant as she spends it slowly.

2) If my mom loses her (rented) house or needs financial support, what are my options as her son to make sure she's taken care of, and what should I do now to plan for the possibility?

personalfinance,Should I use some of my savings to pay off my variable interest rate student loan first even though the interest rate is currently low? What loan should I pay off after?,"I have about **$60K** worth of student loan debt and about **$9K** of car debt that I want to pay off as fast as possible. After tax + HSA + minimum 401k match deductions, I bring home about **$2,700** a month. I also just picked up a side job that I'll be starting next week where I should bring in about **$800** a month after taxes. I currently live at home, so my expenses are relatively minimal. However, I'm playing around with the idea of moving out towards the end of summer this year because of personal issues and my own mental health (I know, I know. Smartest move would be to stay but I've hit a breaking point and I'm beginning to worry about my own safety). I've read the wiki on PF but still have some more questions pertaining to my particular situation.

Here's part 1 of where I need advice --- towards the end of last year I saved up for a 6 month emergency fund. Then, I kept saving with the idea that I'd have money for a down payment for a cheap house and GTFO of my current situation. The last few weeks I've been realizing that purchasing a home right now wouldn't be the best idea. I don't think I'd be up for living in the same area for at least 5 years, plan on finding a new job at a different company soon, and I have yet to move in with my girlfriend so renting seems to be the better option for the foreseeable future. After receiving my tax return for last year, I'm currently sitting at a total of savings of around **$19,000**. I have most of it sitting in a high yield savings account. I believe it would be best to keep half of this for an emergency fund and then apply the other half towards loans.

After using some calculators, I'm getting results telling me to pay off one of my federal loans first because of the higher interest rate. I have 1 private loan that I really want to get rid of because of the variable interest rate and because I have a family member that cosigned it for me. As far as what to pay off next, I had some friends recommend I pay my car loan off and then continue with the federal loans. My federal loans are still in IBR until August and have extremely low minimal payments ($30/mth each) due to my prior job. After IBR my monthly payments could jump up to about $430 and $155. Right now I'm dedicating about 75% of my pay towards loan payments and plan on paying about **$2,700 per month** after I start my side gig. When I move out, I'm currently budgeting and projecting to allow for about **$1,500-$1,700 per month** for loans.

I have supplied a breakdown of my current loan summaries below:

Federal Loan 1 (\~$950 interest; $14,500 total)

|Balance|Interest Rate|Type|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$3,100|6.80%|Fixed|

|$3,700|6.00%|Fixed|
|$2,400|5.35%|Fixed|

|$2,400|4.25%|Fixed|
|$4,000|3.61%|Fixed|
|$1,600|3.15%|Fixed|
|$2,300|3.15%|Fixed|

Car Loan

|Balance|Interest Rate|Type|

\*\*\* So my first question is... should I use some of my savings ($9,000) toward my private loan?

\*\*\* My second question is... would it be wise to continue to paying off my private loan first because of the variable interest rate then pay off my car loan? if not, what loans would you recommend I pay off in what order?

personalfinance,Should I sell my car?,"Situation:

(1) My Ford Focus ST value is roughly $1,000-$2,000 more than what I have to pay off (included: 2 years, 35,000 miles left in Powertrain warranty)

(2) I am uneasy because all Ford cars have been discontinued (future difficulty obtaining parts, etc.)

(3) I take the subway to work, M-F, need a car Saturday to my second job, and sometimes visit my gf's family Sunday

(4) GF got her car back (her family had been using it) so she is fine with us sharing the car for all reasons of point (2)

(5) My current APR is 8% through a credit union, the credit union stated that if I were to purchase another car, my loyalty status will make a lower APR available.

(6) My credit union is partnered with Enterprise Car Sales, where they will give me $1,000 on top of my KBB valuation.

(7) I could also sell the car privately.

(8) I would eventually need a car, for a future career path

Decision to be made:

A. Keep the car

OR

B. Trade it in and start a new 5 year loan /w lower interest rate in on a 4runner/Tacoma (vehicles that hold their value)

OR

C. Sell it privately

D. Whatever super smart suggestion r/ personalfinance peeps come up with.

personalfinance,At what point does it make financial sense to ditch a public sector job (for obtained PSLF loan forgiveness) and move into a private sector job?,"I’ve been working a government job for 4 years with the intention of obtaining PSLF student loan forgiveness after 10 years. Every year I re-certify for PSLF and obtain an updated tally of qualifying months of payment.

**I’m trying to determine the “tipping point” where switching to a higher paying private sector job would actually get me ahead financially.** I’d love to hear your thoughts about my math and any errors you see in my reasoning!

My government job doesn’t pay a ton ($50k gross salary for niche scientific field with a Master’s degree in MCOL area), but the benefits are great:

* PPO health insurance with $3.8k family deductible that covers myself and my partner. Employer pays 90% of monthly premiums. Plus cheap vision &amp; dental benefits.
* Employer pays for $5k of life insurance (I have declined to purchase additional coverage).
* 23 days of paid vacation per year, plus 10 paid holidays. 12 days of paid sick time per year.
* Employer contributes a whopping 12% into my 401(a) account ($500/mo). I also contribute 4% ($165) into my Roth 403(b) and 3% ($135) into my traditional IRA. I used to contribute much more, but have recently dropped back in order to accelerate savings for a home down payment.
* Lots of free/discounted services (counseling services, legal services, access to city public transportation, access to massive gym, etc.)
* Flexible &amp; accommodating work culture. My boss is chill, I like my coworkers, I enjoy what I do enough that I could envision staying here for the whole 10 years for my PSLF.

But … I might be able to make a higher salary elsewhere (although I doubt I’d get benefits nearly as good). The private sector industry in my area is decent and I am pretty confident I could land a job at one of those companies without needing to relocate. But I haven’t yet applied for any of these jobs, so I don’t really know what salary range to expect. No one publishes the salary range in their job descriptions!

My question for all the r/personalfinance gurus is: **At what salary level would it make more sense to pursue a private sector job, rather than waiting out here for another 6 years to achieve PSLF?**

**&gt; Student Loan Details (all federal, no private loans)**

* Current balance: **$57k** (consolidated sub/unsub from undergrad &amp; grad – have been paying off for years)
* Interest rate **5.625%** (fixed)
* Monthly payment: **$405** (slightly above my current IBR-mandated minimum)

**&gt; Payoff trajectory in a non-PSLF (private sector) job:**

* Loan payoff time: **19.25 more years** (assuming no change in monthly payment)
* Interest paid between now and time of loan payoff: **$37k**
* Total amount paid at time of payoff: $57k (balance) + $37K (interest) = **$94k**

**&gt; Payoff trajectory for my current PSLF (governmental) job:**

* Loan payoff time: **6 more years** (assuming no change in monthly payment)
* Interest paid between now and time of loan payoff: **$17.5k**
* Total amount paid at time of PSLF: $405/mo for 72 mo = **$29k**
* Remaining balance forgiven at time of PSLF: **$45k**
* LIFETIME AMOUNT SAVED WITH PSLF: $94k (non-PSLF total paid) - $29K (PSLF total paid) = **$65K**

If this math is right, it looks like achieving PSLF in 6 years from now would **save me $65k over the lifetime of the loan.** That’s a big savings!!

**So, what would it take for it to be worth it for me to switch to a private sector job? I’m having trouble with this calculation.**

Should I divide the savings of $65k by the **6 more years** I’d stay here, such that any private job would need to pay me $65k / 6 yr = **$10.8k OR MORE per year (gross salary) to make this a good switch?**

OR, should I stretch that $65k savings across the 19.25 years it would have taken me to pay off the whole loan, in which case the private job would need to pay me $65k / 19.25 yr = **$3.4k OR MORE per year (gross salary)?**

Or should the calculation be done some other way entirely?

And, how do I determine the total value of my current benefits package and convert that into something a private employer would need to pay (either with equivalent benefits, more salary, or a mix of both)?

Basically I’m just trying to figure out what combo of minimum salary &amp; benefits at a private company would allow me to come out ahead financially even without PSLF. Thanks for your thoughts!",finance

personalfinance,Planning next home into budget,"My wife and I are 30 years young. We have two kids under 3 years. I got the snip snip so no more for us. In the past 4 years, we have been on a strict budget and limited our spending to pay off all student loans and as of this week have paid off the remaining vehicle. Our vehicles are both 2014 and I’m hoping they’ll last us a good while. The only remaining debt is our mortgage ($120k – 17 years left on a 20). This has left us little $ to do things, such as enjoy life. While I’m glad we bit the bullet and did it, we are tired of (feeling) like we’re living paycheck to paycheck because all additional income has been thrown at our debt. We have no life but work and kids.

My income in this time has gone up significantly so we were able to pull our oldest from daycare and my wife now stays at home with both kids (no daycare expense, fewer hospital bills). With my wife’s income it made sense financially. We have about $70k in retirement accounts, and this year I was planning maxing my 401k and Roth IRA for the first time. We also have a healthy emergency fund (6 months) and have college accounts set up for the kids which we are depositing monthly.

Our home is a starter home and is relatively small. We have been passively creeping the housing market the past 4-6 months until we saw our “dream” home. We went through the motions, looked at it twice and fell in love. We even made an offer, but ultimately pulled our offer because we have developed a fear of taking on more debt and living above our means, and it was keeping us up at night. With the new mortgage, our DTI ratio would have been about 33% (using take home pay). We were devastated feeling like we gave up on the perfect home that we both loved, one that we would be in forever. We could have done it financially, but since we’ve only recently gotten to the point where we have paid off our debt we didn’t want to stretch ourselves too thin (our mortgage would have doubled), and wanted to have some disposable income for vacations or other things we want/need while still saving for the future. 

Since giving up our dream home, we are determined to either buy or build on the next 2-5 years. That will give us some time to save more. Unfortunately, there are also some things we will need to work on in our current home as well. My question is, what is the best method to save for our forever home given our situation? I have a couple of methods in mind: 

· **Double our mortgage payment.** Our current interest rate is 4%, so by paying additional we will be more rapidly decreasing the principal, therefore interest applied to principle, while building more equity. Any additional could be put into our savings account. This would also be a good indicator on how it would feel to have a larger mortgage and how it affects our lifestyle.

· **Deposit all additional into savings account.** Interest is at 1.4%. 

· **Decrease 401k contribution to be able to throw more after-tax dollars at either option 1 or 2 and speed up the process.** Before you shoot me r/personalfinance, hear me out. I’m conflicted that housing prices are only going to go up as they have in our current market, so I feel like I want to get there quicker or the home that was once $250k this year will be $325k in 5 years. In which case, why didn’t we just buy the house now as we’ll be financing anyway?!?! Interest is low now.

Thanks for reading, and we appreciate any input you may have. Also, the home is still on the market if you think we should change our minds...again ;)",finance

personalfinance,Muni Bonds for Emergency Fund,"Hi Folks,

I've seen variations of this question posted before, but was curious to get an updated answer. I have approximately 20k I keep as an emergency fund (savings account for now). I also have a larger-than-normal account in checking, usually hovering around 10k and am able to tolerate a little more volatility as our combined household income is generally able to cover emergency costs (wife makes more as an attorney than I do as a federal employee :-).

I'd still like to reallocate the various funds I have in BoA. The safe answer for me is Ally. That said, would it be insane to open a cash management account with Fidelity (where my Roth is) and invest in municipal bonds such as FTABX? I'm slightly unclear on the tax consequences on their interest (if any) or dividends. Obviously I'd never invest the EF but can stomach a little more variance than most.

Am I crazy and missing something obvious? Could I not withdraw them at a moment's notice should I need to? Is this just yield chasing? I'm fairly new to the alternative methods to HYSAs and was curious what's out there. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Currently 27 going back to university should I commute or try to move nearby?,"A little bit about my situation. So I am currently living at home working two jobs because my family needed me to be at home so I put university on hold. I only currently gross about 22-25k a year. Which is well below what I ever planned to be at this stage in my life. I feel like I’m being suffocated living with my family and helping out maybe a little resentful that I put my life on hold. 

My question is would it be smarter for me to stay at home and commute to my university. The commute takes about 45-1 hour to get to most likely 3 days a week if not 5 some quarters. I know it is the cheaper option but is it the smarter option? I feel as though if I end up commuting I will not be able to work. Even part time as having 6-10 hours of travel time per week on top of studying would leave no time for work if I even could find something to accommodate my available hours. 

I estimate moving to the city in which the university is would cost me about 800 rent and utilities included. But with that said I think I’d be able to work around an average of 15-20 hours a week. I am able to take out about 1800 a quarter in federal subsidized loans and on top of that I’d get about 800-1k in grant aid for free. I’d most likely be able to qualify for food stamps as well which would be roughly 150-200 a month. Which may also be able to include medi cal and give me an extra 700 per quarter by dropping university insurance. This would take me about 2-2.5 years to complete a economics degree based off of my education planning I’ve received from advisors. 

I am deathly terrified of not finishing university if I don’t dedicate myself 100% by moving there.

I was approved and actually signed with Earnest to refinance at 2.95% interest over a 5 year term (I can get out of this within a few days)

I just learned of First Republic, which apparently isn't really a student loan refinance, but is actually a personal loan, couched in student loan refi terms. The rate is 1.95% over a 5 year term. However, you need to open a checking account and keep $10,000 or 20% of the loan balance in there (zero interest on the checking account). My current checking account gets 0.449% interest.

I've been using the calculator, but my problem is that my paycheck varies not only whether it's the first or second paycheck of the month, but also depending how much overtime I work.

It seems that the function of the calculator is to divide what you expect to make for the year into equal sized paychecks, and assess that against how much federal tax you've already payed and how much you payed on your last check. Based on this it gives a number (let's say $100) in additional withholdings recommended to avoid owing taxes. 

This seems like a flawed method because if I just extrapolate my last check for full year earnings, but then decide to work overtime, my additional withholdings will still be fixed too low at $100.

personalfinance,Mom lost her health insurance. I'm a college student with a lot of health problems. Should I take out a loan to get insurance with my school?,"So I am a full time college student with a laundry list of health problems. My autoimmune disease made a nasty return so under my doctors orders I quit my job and limited my exercise time. I can't switch schools because my major is only offered here. 

My mom claimed me as a dependent on her taxes, but she recently lost her job. This employer has been very nasty to her in that they won't give her the paid vacation time she is owed. She was basically fired over text message and sent termination papers. We were given 10 days on our health insurance before it expires. 

I live in Michigan and I have basically no income. I noticed that I wouldn't be able to do Medicaid without much mom since I'm a dependent. I'm losing my insurance on Feb. 29th, but I need to have insurance by March 2nd. I've been very sick and I need to have a checkup from my specialist. 

The employer won't give my mom any COBRA papers and we are in the process of reporting them. She was considering not getting the COBRA since she doesn't know how long she will be out of work and we are living paycheck to paycheck. But she told me shes also scared of the penalty. 

Would it be a smart move to take out a loan with my school and buy a few months of insurance? This would get me to May and it would be around $430 for the quarter. I know the plan because it was the same type of insurance I had a few years ago. It would be through my school. The loan would be a federal unsubsidized loan.",finance

personalfinance,How should I handle my salary and taxes?,"Hey guys, I’m starting my first long-term job and trying to figure out taxes, money management, all that good stuff. I’ve done temp work and odd jobs in the past, but this job pays a bit more so I’m actually making enough to think about savings and taxes.

First off, my dad wants to list me as a dependent but I’ll be making a bit more than the child credit. I’m not entirely sure how it works, but I’d be paying at his (higher) rate just so he could take off less money at that rate. How should I handle that?

On a related note, I’m not really sure how to handle withholding. I read somewhere that 20% of salary for federal and 5% for state are general ballpark estimates? But my salary is tied to hours and while I have a regular schedule, I know I’ll be taking time off and working overtime so the salary won’t be consistent but the W-4 asks for a flat withholding amount. Should I err on the side of paying more because I can always just get a tax refund at the end of the year? In the past I’ve just withheld $0 and paid at the end of the year (especially since the work was more fluid).

Then, how do I handle my savings? I obviously want to keep some spending money, but I also plan to save most of my earnings. It seems Roth IRAs/401k’s are good ways to do that, but I have no idea how to open one, use it, etc. Are there other recommendations for saving money and planning ahead financially?",finance
investing,Japanese yen due for an explosive move,"If you check out a weekly chart of usd/jpy FX, it's breaking out of a 5 year triangle to the upside. Not only is it breaking out but the yen's relationship to the rest of the market is materially shifting. Normally the  Japanese Yen trades like a safe haven and trades inversely with US  yields. The relationship has been slowly breaking down, and last week it went in the opposite direction. The currency is experiencing a regime change, and there's a lot of money to be made if you can recognize this early and get on it.  Why is usd/jpy going up? 

**Reason #1**:  Japanese institutions are selling the hell out of their own currency  and seeking safety in foreign bonds, with Treasuries being the #1 destination

**Reason #2**:  Japan is crashing into a recession. The weakness started in Q4 and is  likely to continue this quarter due to the impact of Covid19 in Asia.

**Reason #3**:  The Bank of Japan has been the global leader of stimulative monetary  policy because of Japan's long history of anemic growth and deflation.  They were the first major central bank to reach 0% interest rates, and  also the first to do quantitative easing. However, it's clearly not  helping the economy right now, so what is Japan to do? The only answer  is to increase fiscal spending by issuing more debt, and let the central  bank buy the additional debt! There are several names for this - modern  monetary theory, monetizing government debt, quantitative easing  etc...but they all mean one thing - debasing the Japanese yen. No wonder  institutional money is getting out the fuck out of their local currency like rats trying to escape a sinking ship!

Implied  volatility is near historical rock bottom lows. When I put this trade  on a few days ago, 1 mth vol was even lower at 5. It's perking up but  nowhere close to where it could be heading.

Not only that, but options skew still  favors puts over calls, which means the market is still more worried  about usd/jpy going down than up! Silly options traders...

Because the market is so off sides on  this trade and hasn't completely gotten its head around the idea of JPY  losing its safe haven status, there is potential for an explosive move  both in usdjpy upside AND usdjpy implied vol. How explosive? Think  114.00 in 2-4 weeks, 118 within 3 months (were are at 111.55 today).  This trade is best expressed by buying usdjpy calls with strikes 114-118  and expiries 1-3 months out.",finance

personalfinance,Buying a New Home,"Hey guys,

So, my wife and I have been talking about buying a home for  some time now. When we started getting serious (both in our relationship, and in our budgeting) we planned to start looking for a house around this time next year. However, since interest rates are quite low right now, and we're a bit ahead of schedule in regard to our savings, we thought we'd start looking this weekend.

Long story short, we found a subdivision that's building new homes right in our budget. The floor plans have everything we want, and the location would shorten our drives to work considerably. Here's a break down of the financial components:

Combined income: \~110,000 (we both work in public school, so there are scheduled raises. I'm planning to get my Ed.S soon, which will result in another 5k raise.)

Combined Student Loan debt: \~100,000 (all of this is through federal loans, and we both qualify for PSLF. I have about 3 years left of qualifying payments, she has about 5)

Liquid savings: 23,000 (we also put away at least 1,000 a month, and would continue to do so until we've moved in)

Price of home: 304,000 (this is listed on the website. We're meeting with the agent tomorrow to look at building timelines, floorplans, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

We plan on putting 5% as a down payment. I know that having 20% is ideal, but it's just not going to happen. Our current lease ends in November, which seems to be-based on the website- the timeline for new builds to finish.

Before we tour these new homes, does buying a home even seem like a feasible thing to do right now? Or, should we stay on course, and wait to look around this time next year? We're in no real rush to move, but we want to look at ALL of our options before we sign a lease for another year.",finance
personalfinance,Thoughts on 5% down for first time homebuyer,"I know it is always best to put down 10-20% on a home you are purchasing but I'm in sort of a unique situation. 

My fiance and I are saving to buy a home right now and the only thing we can swing at this point in time is 5% plus closing. It would probably take us another year or so of hardcore saving to get to the 20% threshold. Because of where my lady works, we have the opportunity to qualify for a 30 year conventional fixed rate with only 5% down and no PMI. On top of that the APR we would be paying is right around 2.7%. With interest rates as low as they are my feeling is that we would make up the down payment difference pretty quick with some extra principle paid over the time we would be saving for a bigger down payment.

stocks,My take on Mr. Buffet's anual letter,"Warren Buffet, the legendary investor released his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders today and there is a lot we can learn from it.

2019 has been a great year for Berkshire with reported revenue of 81.4 billion $

Buffet himself says focus on the operating income, not the reported revenue

A big part in the profits is due to Apple’s great stock performance last year

In the letter Buffet warns again that companies are overvalued but sights that in this environment where interest rates are so low, stocks are outperforming bonds

He stresses the long term investment goal and warns shorter term investment could be very risky, saying stocks can go down 50% or more, but long term they will be the smarter investment

Still holding on to a massive cash pile of over 120 billion dollars

He assures shareholders that Berkshire is 100% ready for his departure from the company.

These are the main takeaways, but there is a lot more he points out and is worth reading. What my take on his remarks is this:
Mr. Buffet is right and wrong at the same time. He is right about his views on long term investment, but he himself talks how stocks are overpriced for a long period of time now and he is not willing to deploy any of that 120 billion dollar cash pile. He got in the market way back when stocks were very cheap and for him long term investing has absolutely paid off, but our questions is whether to buy now. The stock market is at record highs with PE multiples way above historic norms. Mr. Buffet talks about smart investment and buying good companies for a fear price, but he also says companies are overvalued which means they are not fear valued. I respect Mr. Buffet and his way of investing, but I believe that his strategy of buying and holding investments is outdated in an era of computer and algorithmic trading. I believe we as investors should be more proactive in our strategies in order to keep up with the times and the new way of investing. The technological boom made it possible for companies like Coca Cola, one of Mr. Buffet’s proudest purchases, to become global brands and take over the world. This has been reflected in their share price and made Mr. Buffet a lot of money. But Coca Cola and all the other companies are already global, they control the world markets and if we are realistic, these companies can grow in a much smaller percentage than before. When Mr. Buffet was buying these companies, not only did they have much more room to grow, they had multiples way smaller then today.

So if we put these two points together, coupled with a 11 year long expansion and fears of recession coming every year, we do not believes time to commit to such long term investing and deep down I believe Mr. Buffet knows that too and that is why he is not deploying all of that cash.",finance

I am also putting aside about 6600 each month that is being invested into various funds. The average return rate of my funds are 26% atm, but that is the total from when I started saving some years ago.

At this rate I have paid down the mortgage by 2030.

Im 36 years old, so I still have to work for 30+ years until retirement, but I have some health issues that makes me think about early retirement. It is too early to say when or if I will have to. 

That's why I am interested in spending/investing my money visely now that I am still earning. So my question is: should I keep on paying down on my mortgage, or is it better to invest more in funds?

I'm open for suggestions and would like to learn. Any tips on calculators that can help me see what is the most profitable are welcome.

Turns out from the tax preparer, I owe double than what was showing up on TurboTax.

They said TurboTax didn't have the means their service does to fully assess my situation. They also set me up with a financial advisor because if I deposited X amount of money into a Roth IRA, it could help lower the amount of taxes I owe this year.

Went to the meeting with the financial advisor and it was a scam. The guy was mainly selling the business (Transamerica) saying how much money I could make doing this as a side business. I was pissed off my time was wasted and I got NO help at all.

personalfinance,"Job Opportunity Requires Relocation, Looking for Help in Researching Cost of Living Differences","Good morning r/personalfinance!

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I received an offer for a new position that requires my family (me, wife and 3yo) to relocate. The job itself is fine (coding) and the boss (who would be in a different office) is a previous boss who recruited me in. My wife doesn't currently work.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

We would be moving to NYC from Northern VA just outside DC. Right now, I'm making 108,000 with 2,000 in rent and 1,100 in student loan payments - we're not starving, but we don't have any extra cash to contribute to savings, recreation, or relatively cheap/moderate wishlist items. Based on an upcoming annual bonus from my current company and signing bonus from the new company, I estimate we can fully pay off the loan by May or June. The new salary will be 165,000, and I would not actually have to move until the end of this calendar year.

&amp;#x200B;

The questions:

For those of you with experience in these two locations, is 165 enough for a family in our situation to live on in NYC? Obviously we aren't going to try to live in Manhattan, but I am not at all familiar with anything in the NY area.

&amp;#x200B;

When I moved to the DC area, I moved from Atlanta. I used several cost of living calculators and they said that 70,000 roughly equaled 102,000 in this area. Maybe, but I have yet to see how that would work. Is there a reliable place to conduct that type of research? I've seen some places say that 125,000 or so is fine, but other places say cost of living is significantly more.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not looking to make a lateral move, I want to actually start saving significant money for various things AND have at least some disposable income that doesn't stress me out.

&amp;#x200B;

As i hinted to earlier, upon starting the job in April, we will be able to stay in the DC area until the end of the year, so that gives us an opportunity to stay in this cost of living band without the loan payments for \~7 months. The new company is paying all relocation expenses, so that keeps things relatively easy and gives us plenty of time to figure out the specifics of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any insight into how different the tax rates are? Is there a good website for easily comparing fed/state/local tax rates?

personalfinance,Most tax efficient way to receive a bonus?,"Say you are getting a $25,000 bonus and would like to find the most tax efficient way you to receive this .  

Ex: A single male, with no dependents making $120,000/year. Your employer is required to withhold some percentage or portion of that bonus for tax reasons.  If I understand the percentage method correctly, the bonus will be taxed at a flat tax (22%) + social security (6.2%) + FICA (1.45%) + CA state tax 10.2% which comes out to a total withholding of 39.8%.  

However, lets say to have a professional corporation (engineering company) on the side.  In CA, the corporate tax rate is 8.84% + alternative minimum tax of 6.65% + federal 21% which comes out to 36.5%.

Bitcoin,Gold/bitcoin ratio might become the single most important financial metric on earth.,"Comparing the price of bitcoin to dollars when determining its value today is as pointless as comparing the price of bitcoin to a kilo of gold now, it tells you absolutely nothing.. yet..

In these early days those comparisons are irrelevant.  Volatility and violent free market price discovery make them irrelevant. Bitcoin is like the earth back when it was still forming with meteorites raining down and volcanos everywhere constantly erupting creating an insanely volatile environment that couldn't harbour life, just like bitcoin can't yet harbour stable commerce.

Once speculation and store of value use cases have driven prices up to highs that represent the amount of wealth needed to facilitate global commerce life will emerge. Stability will form, skies will clear, the meteorites will stop, volcanoes will turn dormant, and the first signs of life will form. Commerce will emerge and evolve faster than you can imagine.

Then and only then will a ratio like the gold/bitcoin ratio tell us anything comprehensible. 

However, over time it is possible that in a few decades from now the gold/bitcoin ratio becomes the single most important financial metric on earth, maybe even as important as fed monetary policy is today, because we sure as hell won't be measuring bitcoin against fiat anymore.

There will be no fiat, no fed speak, no target CPI rate, no interest rate manipulation, no repo injections, no fed minutes. There will be just bitcoin with its known supply and gold.

personalfinance,Starting down the path to buying a house and I'm interested in feedback on my situation,"Hey folks,

Using a throwaway to not put my financial stats on my primary account.

I'm just starting to look into buying a house in Colorado and I'd like to get folks thoughts on my financial situation and recommended next steps. I was inspired to see what folks thoughts are after reading \[this post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/f7t0m0/buying\_a\_new\_home/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/f7t0m0/buying_a_new_home/)).

I \[late 20s, M\] recently moved to the Boulder, CO region with my girlfriend. We will be here for 3-4 years and I would like to buy something in either Boulder or the surrounding towns (Louisville, Lafayette, Broomfield, Longmont, etc.) as a place to live for the time we're here and an investment since I would like to rent it out if/when we leave or purchase another property.

First, my reasons for buying:

1. I would like to invest my savings into a home instead of continuing to pay rent.
2. I want to own a home that I can put sweat equity into. Would love a place that has an unfinished basement or unfinished room or that I could build a mother-in-law suite.
3. We will likely move elsewhere in 3-4 years and I would like to rent the property at that point. Maybe sell within a 6-10 year time frame if I need to.

Next, my financial situation:

1. I'm an independent consultant making \~$150-170K a year through my solely owned S-Corp LLC. This may increase as it looks like 2020 will be a good year for me. Figure my month income is in the $13K range, but this does differ month to month.
2. My credit score is 753.
3. Assets:
   1. I have $30K in a Money Market account.
   2. I have $18K in my business account which will like increase by $10 to $15K in the next 2 months, and I plan to put some of this money towards my downpayment.
   3. I have $24K in an IRA for retirement.
   4. I have $1K in personal investments in Robinhood.
4. Debt:
   1. I have college private and federal loans totaling $24,973. They all vary, but are in 3% to 6.5% interest rate range. Private loans were refinanced to \~5%. 3 of the Federal are the 6.5% loans.
   2. I have an auto loan of $13,899. Interest rate is 2.24%.
   3. Total debt: $38,872.
5. Steps I've taken so far:
   1. I'm meeting with a financial planner to get detailed insights into my personal situation. There are likely a lot of business related ""poor on paper"" items I'm not doing that I believe can be addressed. I'm also going to be discussing this home purchase and getting their thoughts on what makes sense for my financial situation.
   2. I've just put in applications for two mortgages brokers: A friend of a friend and my previous state's credit union.
   3. Attempting to save more money by cutting down expenses. I'm definitely a high spender (hobbies, food/entertainment, travel) and I'm just looking to cut that down a good bit this year to help turn my high wage into more savings then in the past.

Finally, what I'm looking to purchase:

1. I would like to get a house in the $400 - 550K range.
2. At least 2 bedrooms with a back yard and possibly a garage.
3. I'd like to put 8 - 10% down.
4. As I mentioned before, I'd like to get something that I can put work into as I enjoy around the manual handy work and would like this process.
5. I'd like to purchase the home before May or June if possible, but before August at the latest.

Questions:

1. In this market, would you go with a Fixed rate or Adjustable? Why?
2. Considering my monthly income, is my target house price too high? What should I target?
3. Considering I will likely sell this home in a decade, is putting down a max of 10% a good or bad choice?
4. What did I not address in the above that I should be thinking of?

1. What recommendations are there to ensure someone is registered/legit on a state/federal level?

2. What protections are there to ensure a FA/Planner/fiduciary can’t just walk off with your money?

3. Where would you start your search for a fiduciary? Lots seem to have small practices, consultancies feeding my fear of them pulling a runner with my money—not fair as there are lots of thieves working for big companies but fear is not rational. 

4. Seems like options for fees range from a % of funds managed or advised for ongoing work to a flat fee for more one-time plan/jobs. I mostly want a fiduciary so I can not touch my money as I see myself responding emotionally to calls of stock market peaks, etc. And I know that’s not good. Paying someone to tell me “no” is a lot of what I need.  What is a reasonable fee company/structure that would protect what I have with more active management if the market were to turn and being long on everything wasn’t great? I’ve got a good chunk in bonds and cash at the moment because I’m scared. 

5. How much access should I give fiduciary? Do people give them logins to their accounts? How is the safest way to set this up?

personalfinance,Maryland trying to offset my federal return... again. Any input here?,"Update: I received my full federal refund. Suck it Maryland.

As the title indicates, this isn't the first time. I haven't lived or worked in Maryland since mid 2011. Last year they tried to seize my fed return for supposed state taxes owed in 2010. That's right, 9 years later I all of the sudden supposedly owed them money and lots of it with all the fees and interest. Thankfully they were unsuccessful in seizing that return and I received my full refund last year. There wasn't any notification from Maryland that I owed them money before last year or since.

Well, they are back at it again. My return status was just approved and marked refund sent, but with the disclaimer that there could be an offset. Verified through the TOP line under ""personal offsets"" that Maryland has requested all or a portion of my refund.

Anyone knowledgeable about statutes of limitatio , offsets, any recourse I might have here? Google is usually my friend, but I'm finding conflicting and unclear information. 

Side note: Maryland was successful in seizing a fed refund when I worked in the state, but didn't live there. They ended up having to return the money, but it was a giant pain in the ass to get it back.

Edit: I did contact them. Since I no longer had documents from 2010 in 2019, the only resolution would have been to pay their estimate, plus all fees and interest over the previous 8ish years. Yeah, I don't think so. Especially since the offset wasn't approved. I am uncertain as to why, although it could be how length of time or the lack of required communication from MD to me regarding the ""debt"".

personalfinance,my work will give me 90k toward a down payment +5k for closing costs - what are some reasons *NOT* to take this,"hi everyone!  i'm in southern california, currently renting happily (and splitting the rent with a roommate).   We pay about 2300 per month which I'm happy with, but I'm considering buying a house because i'm concerned that rent is only gonna go up over time, and that my salary (i'm in academia) probably won't go up that much (barely matching inflation is most likely).

I've been skeptical about buying, because a 2br similar to my current place is going to be at least 400k, and that just seems crazy to me on my 75k salary.  however, the more i look at places and the monthly payments, (with the current low interest rates) i find myself thinking that it might make sense to buy something (especially with this free money from work).   i'm thinking of getting a condo, likely still splitting with a roommate, and aiming for a total payment (PITI ) of somewhere around 2600 a month.  i'd put 5% down myself and work would put in 89k.  i'd be grateful for your thoughts - pros / cons that i might not have considered.  thanks a ton!  the only main downside i can think of is that if i don't like the place / location after i move, then i'd feel stuck - if i don't life in the house for 5 years, i have to pay back a pro-rated portion of the money to my work.  but with that in mind i think i'd be particularly choosey about where i consider.",finance

I recently just bought an engagement ring with my soon-to-be fiancé, and now I have about \~$4300 to pay off over 5 year at a 10% interest rate.

personalfinance,"Father passed away, inheriting some money, in mid-twenties - help?","On February 10, 2020 my father passed away rather unexpectedly. He had an accident while driving, lost control of his car, crashed, and died. I had not seen or spoke with him since I was sixteen (now 26), and now he is gone - and I will never get the opportunity too - and It is a hard realization.

Beyond processing a lot of emotional baggage; a lot of financial stuff is happening as well. My mom and dad are/were legally married - although separated. He had no will when he passed away; the majority of there possessions (house, his 401k, Life Insurance Policy, bills - etc. were in both of there names).

My entire life my father had issues retaining jobs. Throughout all of his ups and downs, my mother also worked nights to help provide - however, they were never able to really start saving for retirement. My mom is 62 - currently working; but has virtually no savings. When my older sister and I were both enrolled at college at the same time - my father did nothing to help out with the finances, and essentially kept out of everything that was happening with my mother or us kids. My mom sacrificed a lot of her income to help my sister and I make it through school - and was not able to also save up money at the same time.

For a majority of all of the assets, she has been discussing/planning with a CPA on the best use of the money; but is generously giving myself - and sisters - $15,000.00 ea.

As I said, I am 26 - and have never had this much money in my possession at one time. I am not sure what the best use of this money could be; and I am really looking to Reddit for some advice!

Little bit about my personal finances/situation:

\-Have a BS in MS Engineering / Been stably employed since I graduated college in May of 2016. I acquired $39,316.64 in loans and began paying back in a non-tapered plan on 12/5/2016, at a rate of $404.53/mo (I have never missed or differed a payment). My current balance on my student loans is: $28,465.66 ($15,776.67 paid to date: $4,570.45 to interest/$11,206.22) - loans are consolidated, average interest rate is 3.95%.

\-Have $30,645.51 in my 401K (vested: $28,037.37)

\-Current salary is $75,000/yr (plus bonus - maybe an additional $1,500-2,00?). Live in Michigan. Rent is $600/mo.; Insurance \~$1,000-1,100/yr.

\-I own a Lexus/have a 6 year payment on it: (Purchased Sept 2019) Currently owe: $26,867.74 - pay $438.28/mo.

\*Quick edit: The car seems to be a major point in this thread, and I should probably expand a little bit further. The car is completely insured for the entire duration of the loan - for unlimited milage. The car was Lexus Certified, and I paid a little extra money to extend the manufacturers unlimited milage warranty from the 2 years that come with the manufacturer's certification; to the entire 6 years on the loan. I used to lease a car, but with how much I was driving - I ended up eating $1,400 in milage when I turned the car in 5 months early (ended up settling the balance for $1,000). The peace of mind of not having to worry about miles, coupled with the fact that its a Lexus and they retain their value/resell market is great, as well as the excellent ride/quality - I think it was a smart purchase. I understand its expensive; but I'm planning on driving the car 5-10 years - and really do not have anything to be concerned about performance wise.

\-Have $3,281.82 in my savings - just tangible cash for anything.

I could be interested in possibly purchasing a house soon, and was thinking the money/a portion of the money could be utilized for that? I have heard about the possibility of getting some Certificate of Deposits?

personalfinance,Where should I put my upcoming Downpayment with Interest rates dropping?,"I will try to keep this short and sweet. I have been looking for other similar questions but did not find any so I thought it wouldn’t hurt to throw the question out there. 

A little about me: I am 25 years old and live in a pretty HCOL area, (DC metro area). I have no debt, just bought a new car last August, and moving to a neighboring city further away from DC to be closer to a new project I have been assigned for a 2 year duration. (This means lower housing costs for 2 years) I am hoping to continue saving for a down payment and potentially purchase a house/condo at the end of this project back towards DC. Looking at the numbers, I should have about $75k saved towards a down payment by that time but with my current interest rate at 1.7% and dropping fast, I feel this is a poor location for that amount of money for 2 years. I just put $3k into a 12 month CD at 3.5% with my bank but that maxes the CD so that doesn’t really help the rest of the cash. 

What other locations would you say is worth looking into for a 2-3ish year duration to let a significant amount of cash sit? Would CDs around 2.5% be worth a few years? Of course better than 1.7% or lower.

personalfinance,Amendment based off of early withdrawal 1099-R.,"So my employer that I left beginning of last year cashed out my 401k that I have invested.

gaming,Low latency monitors - why is the industry using the wrong approach?,"So a quick ELI5 on how a video signal is displayed. 

Let’s use the SNES and a CRT monitor as an example. 

- the snes renders games at 60fps 
- each rendered frame takes 14.23ms to draw by the display  
- after it is drawn, the remaining 2.41ms are used to load the next frame into gpu memory.

Each frame is received line by line by the display and with a CRT each line is displayed instantly as it is received.

At the SNES resolution this equates to about 0.063ms per line

This means the top of the frame is drawn 0ms after it’s creation. 

The middle of the frame is drawn 7.11ms after its creation. 

The bottom of the frame is drawn 14.17ms after its creation. 

If Mario is running at the bottom 1/3 of the screen the crt would actually have 10-14ms of “signal lag” before Mario appears BUT since his position has not yet been updated by the SNES yet he will be drawn at his true position. 

***
At modern resolutions @ 60hz it still takes ~16ms to transfer a frame and then 0.66ms idle. 

With current technology we CAN achieve better but we don’t. 

HDMI2.1 can transfer a 1080p signal at upto 480fps.  This means that the entire frame can be delivered to the monitor within 2ms. LCDs can also accept and start transitioning pixels at the higher transfer rate.  With LCDs it takes time for pixels to transition their state. For this example a high end LCD screen may take 6ms for pixels to fully transition after they receiving the input signal. (The transition time is 0ms for a CRT)

Now for the fun part:

**If an lcd is driven with a 60fps signal, the top of the monitor will be drawn 6ms after frame creation and the bottom of the monitor will be drawn 22ms after frame creation. This is due to the signal transfer time and pixel transition time**

**If a crt is driven by a 60fps signal, the top of the crt will be drawn  0ms after frame creation and the bottom of the crt will be drawn 16ms after frame creation.**

**If an lcd were driven with a 480fps signal, the top of the monitor will be drawn 6ms after frame creation and the bottom of the monitor will be drawn 8ms after frame creation.**

**A simple protocol change, NOT requiring extra GPU power, could cut down latency by 14ms. This could allow the middle and bottom portions of an LCD to display FASTER than a crt**.


This has potential to make LCDs BETTER than CRTs.  The games themselves don’t have to run at 480fps. The gpu would just keep sending the same picture 8 consecutive times. 7 duplicates would be ignored but the faster transferred first frame will have the LCD to start transitioning its pixels faster. 

Side note: An capped max frame rate exists per monitor given its pixel transition time.  Refreshing the screen faster than its pixel transition time (response time) introduces  nasty ghosting. 

- A 6ms pixel response = 166fps game cap 

- A 6.9ms pixel response = 144fps game cap

- A 8.33ms pixel response = 120fps game cap

- A 12.5ms pixel response time = 80fps game cap

- A 16.66ms pixel response = 60fps game fap

But all these monitors should still be fed 480fps with duplicate frames.  


The reason why gaming monitors have so much damn ghosting is because they are fed frames faster than their black to white response. 

TLDR: monitors should be receiving frames at 480fps to reduce 6-12ms of latency, even allowing them to get BETTER frame latency than CRTs.  

The games framerate should still be capped to the pixel response of the monitor to eliminate ghosting event if the signal is operating 480fps. 

Current gaming monitors seem to be taking the wrong approach. 

Using this method freesync wouldn’t have to have limited FPS ranges.  What am I missing??!?

Fun fact: the SNES actually ran at 13,440fps as it could change the frame in between lines.  This was used for effects. The games themselves still updated at 60fps.",technology

#  Overledger SDK Update

Quant  have just released their Overledger SDK update which has enabled  standardisation of objects to abstract and simplify how to interact with  different types of blockchains (UXTO and Account-based) in a common  model. As well as the ability to directly deploy, invoke and query smart  contracts directly through Overledger. I strongly recommend reading the  teams [Overledger SDK Update](https://t.co/L9NKQpWSii?amp=1)  which explains it in more detail and includes example use cases of how  Overledger is being used and the benefits it brings. Dr Luke Riley also  did a fantastic job providing an in-depth demo of the Overledger SDK  Update via Video as well.

[https://youtu.be/PbpaZpe4mTQ](https://youtu.be/PbpaZpe4mTQ)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“This  update sets the foundations to build the ecosystem for Overleger  Network, allowing stakeholders other than Quant to write any type (DLT  and non-DLT) Overledger connectors and sets up the ecosystem with  multiple entry points for Overledger Gateways.  
These  updates open up the integration capabilities of Overledger to 3rd  parties and create the foundations for the Overledger Network”

# Standards

&gt; “Trusted standards mean that industry doesn’t need to reinvent the  wheel, that innovations will be compatible and work with existing  technology, and that products and services will be trusted too.  Governments use standards as trusted solutions to complement regulation,  and they give peace of mind to consumers who know they are not putting  themselves or their families at risk.” — Acting ISO Secretary-General  Kevin McKinley 

 The foundations need to align with internationally recognised standards  as they play a crucial role in ensuring interoperability with new and  existing technology and validates a product meets the best practices /  regulation required to ensure Enterprises remains in compliance. CEO of  Quant, Gilbert Verdian, founded the ISO TC 307 standard covering  blockchain as a whole, which 56 countries are working towards today. 

[ Countries involved with ISO TC 307 — https:\/\/www.iso.org\/committee\/6266604.html?view=participation](https://preview.redd.it/qc4a23eiwoi41.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf8de184579d481f449c7ff156187e3757199e45)

 Gilbert  Verdian is the chairman for the ISO TC 307 working group for  interoperability of blockchain and distributed ledger technology systems  as well as being chairman for Blockchain and Distributed Ledger  Technology for BSI (British Standards Institution) which represent the  UK and includes companies such as Quant, IBM, Microsoft, HSBC, BAE  Systems, Huawei as well as a number of UK Government bodies such as BEIS  — Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, Defence  Science and Technology and the National Cyber Security Centre.

The  standardisation updates to the Overledger SDK aligns with the work in  ISO TC 307 and academic work from Dr Paolo Tasca and Dr Claudio Tessone  to provide users with a clear distributed ledger data standard. This  will enable everyone to easily create connectors in a standard way,  facilitating interoperability with all of the connected blockchains /  non-DLT networks that are already connected to Overledger through  Overledger Gateways.

# Security

Cybersecurity  is in Quant’s DNA. The team have a rich heritage of working for  Governments, banks and industry for over 20 years protecting  organisations and people from security threats. Before Quant, Gilbert  Verdian was the Chief Information Security Officer for Vocalink  (Mastercard) where he was in charge of security for the entire payments  infrastructure in the UK (£6 Trillion per year).

&gt; Gilbert has led a team determined to take security to another level,  protecting a critical part of the UK’s infrastructure, protecting UK  citizens and businesses from fraud and risk and, by extension, allowing  them to live as they want to. Under Gilbert’s guidance, Vocalink  security is not merely best-in-class, but setting a new standard. — [https://connect.vocalink.com/2017/july/a-winning-streak/](https://connect.vocalink.com/2017/july/a-winning-streak/) 

In addition to Quant being selected as a [Guarantor for Pay.UK](https://www.quant.network/blog/quant-network-is-appointed-guarantor-of-pay-uk/),  Gilbert has also been appointed to the Cybersecurity Advisory Board  (Pay.UK is the UK’s leading retail payments authority and runs the UK’s  retail payments operations, which includes Bacs, Faster Payments and  Cheques.)

The  pillars of security are Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. As  such, they have used their experience in running payment and financial  infrastructure and critical national infrastructure for nations and  embedded these principles into every aspect of Overledger.

# Regulation

Regulation  is playing an ever increasing role for blockchain. Standards and  Security naturally complement and help define regulation. The verticals  Quant are involved in with regards to regulation span the globe. Gilbert  helped shape the conversation about consumer data protection rights  during his time as CISO of [NSW Health](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx),  and is continuing to serve as a cornerstone for policy within the  adoption of blockchain in public infrastructure. Quant serves as a [founding member of INATBA](https://www.quant.network/blog/quant-network-is-a-founding-member-of-inatba/)  (The International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications),  which is the formal governing body of the European Blockchain  Partnership, all of which is overseen in Brussels by the EU. More  locally, Gilbert and team are in consistent contact with the House of  Lords within the UK, and advises the FCA in matters regarding  cryptoassets.

 As recently seen in the SDK update, Overledger can serve as a key  component of automatic compliance of governance bodies’ financial  regulation, shown [here](https://medium.com/@quant_network/overledger-sdk-update-649e89386c10) by an Overledger instance reporting to the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority. [Project BARAC](http://blockchain.cs.ucl.ac.uk/barac-project/),  stewarded by University College London, is a project examining the  impact Automatic Regulation as administered by Blockchain can have on  the Federal Government. Most notably, the FCA and R3, the developers of  Corda, are involved here. [Gilbert’s recent engagements with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston](https://twitter.com/gverdian/status/1221819998152331264) also seem to revolve around this very topic, with the [Boston Fed pilot-testing a Supervisor Node for automatic regulatory compliance](https://t.co/Q8NNPpUk7E?amp=1).  While at P2PFISY 2019, it was noted by Gilbert that Raphael Auer’s  “Regulation Automata” aligns very well with the vision of Overledger,  with Paolo Tasca, former CSO of Quant, more recently co-hosting a recent  blockchain panel with him. Raphael’s ideas will most likely be taken  into consideration by the BIS, as they r[ecently announced a trial of a 6 central banks collaboration centered around exploring CBDC](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cenbank-digital/six-central-banks-to-hold-digital-currency-meeting-in-april-nikkei-idUSKBN1ZZ348), and are in the early stages of installing Innovation Hubs in Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Singapore.

# Overledger Network

https://preview.redd.it/ixxeqbfywoi41.png?width=1684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc91a25af64cfb09b550344893adcc7dad3837af

The  Overledger Network is a network of networks, which allows enterprise  and communities stakeholders to access and participate in a growing  hyper-connected decentralised ecosystem. Enterprises, banks, central  banks, trading venues, etc will be able to host their own secure  dedicated gateways, enabling secure connectivity to permissioned  networks, permissionless networks, ecosystems, consortia and other  distributed technologies. Community members will also be able to run an  Overledger gateway to further enhance the scalability, decentralisation  and optimise network latency, providing enterprises, developers and  users choice to use the closest gateway when accessing permissionless  blockchains. The Overledger gateways will create a scalable p2p network  that shares the transaction and volume between participants and chooses  the closest or largest node to transact with.

As  per the example use case in the recent update a Bank can run an  Overledger Gateway to provide access to the various consortiums hosted  on a variety of blockchains including Corda, Hyperledger Fabric and JP  Morgan’s Quorum as well as access to the legacy / non-DLT platforms.  Should they want to utilise a public blockchain as well in a hybrid  scenario then they also have the option of using a Overledger Gateway  hosted by a community member.

https://preview.redd.it/b1bx8wm0xoi41.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e70a9ce6c8c42aa880e0b9d1fe8ab4f3b453867e

https://preview.redd.it/8a8c13k1xoi41.png?width=1252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02cd33a79487a2a74af8a2d0f0831c06d5f62005

The Overledger Gateways contain several layers which we will explore some of their features below:

## Overledger Operating System

https://preview.redd.it/7hvr91d4xoi41.png?width=1197&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e6c9b38c6e0ce133f8916bab08aad3d6b218051

 Overledger  allows connection to any blockchain / DAG as well as easily integrating  with existing non-DLT environments. It does this without adding the  overhead of yet another blockchain / consensus in the middle, ensuring  that it’s scalable and doesn’t contain a single point of failure. Nor  does it require the connected blockchains to fork their code to  integrate and place restrictions on what can be implemented going  forward. All of this is done in a secure, trustless manner where  transactions are signed and encrypted client side so the contents can’t  be viewed / modified as they pass through Overledger. It currently  connects all of the leading permissioned and permissionless blockchains  used by enterprises today. [This article](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/what-is-a-blockchain-operating-system-and-what-are-the-benefits-c561d8275de6) explains the differences between other interoperability solutions and the benefits of Quant’s approach

## The Five Ingredients of Interoperability:

Recently there was an [interoperability webinar](https://twitter.com/CryptoSeq/status/1227703500794220544)  with Fintech connect with speakers such as R3’s CTO Richard Gendal  Brown, along with representatives from the Bank of England, Deutsche  Boerse, Nasdaq, ArchaxEx and SwissRe. Richard Gendal Brown from R3 [wrote about](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardgendalbrown/2020/02/13/the-five-ingredients-of-blockchain-interoperability/#60df51d58a19) the Five key Ingredients of Interoperability:

https://preview.redd.it/l6edi3a9xoi41.png?width=2356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f9129d9b61ba0a083e264222fc7df2dd0a2256c

1. **INTEGRATE**  with existing business systems — Businesses aren’t going to replace  their existing applications for new blockchain ones, they need to  integrate with their existing systems.

2. **INITIATE**  Payments on existing rails or blockchain rails — Needs to be able to  make a payment / settlement using a wide variety of existing payment  rails (off chain) as well as blockchain rails, ensuring delivery vs  payment can be achieved with certainty that they have happened.

3. **INTERCHAIN**  applications and smart contracts that can be deployed / executed across  protocols — Enabling a solution built on Corda such as Marco Polo to  easily connect to a solution on another platform such as Vakt on  Ethereum or CargoSmart on Hyperledger Fabric etc

4. **INTRACHAIN**  applications that benefit from value add of same underlying protocol —  What happens when networks such as Marco Polo and Contour both running  on Corda want to interoperate and the additional value and benefit that  can be achieved.

5. **INTERCHANGE**  applications to switch platforms — What happens if you want to  interchange one platform for another. Can you achieve that holy grail of  interoperability by being able to be completely agnostic to the  underlying platform?

Overledger  meets all of these key ingredients in performing interoperability.  Overledger enables existing business systems to benefit from blockchain  connectivity by adding as little as 3 lines of code to their existing  applications. No need to completely rewrite / replace their existing  systems and all done in the most common programming languages such as  Java and JavaScript.

https://preview.redd.it/9whqtamdxoi41.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bdf408f7fe76a9fdd313ef2bc3032982d42c371

At  QuantX in December they announced Overledger Interchange which enables  settlement on a variety of existing non-dlt payment rails such as Faster  Payments, BACS, CHAPS, SEPA, SWIFT as well as on DLT payment rails such  as with Central Bank Digital Currencies, Stablecoins and XRP. It also  facilitates Cross Chain Atomic Swaps using Hash Time Locked Contracts  ensuring Delivery vs Payment is achieved. Interchange is at the centre  of the discussions Quant has had with traditional exchanges in capital  markets and central banks and is a technology financial services have  been missing and was built it address client needs.

Overledger  enables interoperability within the same ecosystem such as Corda DAPP  to another Corda DAPP etc as well as interoperability between any of the  connected permissionless and permissioned blockchains.

Quants  blockchain agnostic Operating System enables users to benefit from  using the best features from different chains in combination and migrate  between them, preventing Vendor or Tech Lock in without having to  completely rewrite existing applications, achieving the holy grail of  interoperability. It enables developers to quickly test a variety of  connected blockchains in a sandbox environment to see which is best  suited for their requirements, starting with just 3 lines of code.

## Transactions Services Layer

https://preview.redd.it/swjgywqhxoi41.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce59d63936b6c67b27173ba8655996c28421641c

The Transaction Services layer handles more complex features of  Overledger. Allowing for applications to request services such as  cross-chain atomic swaps, treaty contracts (Multi Chain Smart Contracts  as well as enabling smart contract functionality even on blockchains  that don’t support smart contracts natively such as Bitcoin) and  transaction brokering (using heuristic analysis to determine which  method is the fastest / cheapest out of the various payment rails) 

## Financial Services Layer

https://preview.redd.it/r1v1u3tkxoi41.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8836c2cba3370d784601cbc97c98a29172581da6

Financial services features can be called upon by participants and  applications to use crosschain and cross-platform. Financial Services  specific use cases can use the features in Overledger to operate across  networks. This layer provides enhanced privacy and security to regulated  entities and institutions who require additional controls to maintain  compliance to regulation and security policy. The features of  Zero-knowledge Proof and privacy can be mandated for all transactions. 

## Channels Layer

https://preview.redd.it/5m5pwjaoxoi41.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5e2fbfb47042067d2c35ab8796474a3209152a4

Channels provide interoperability of services related to digital assets,  payments and tokenisation. The Overledger Network allows for  participants to transfer interoperate enterprise and institutional  issued tokens and assets. Connect to many existing payment rails such as  SWIFT, SEPA, Faster Payments etc. 

[ Overledger Network — Network of Networks](https://preview.redd.it/jyxh2v8qxoi41.png?width=1441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea49dba348335b5ae50a8aec32644dca77a40ecc)

 

## Connecting Blockchain and Non-DLT Applications / Networks to Overledger

The  connectors to Overledger which grant access to Overledger Network will  be open source and soon be made available, allowing for anyone to create  a connector and benefit from being part of the ecosystem. Currently the  permissionless blockchain space is mostly speculation with little  adoption, mainly due to issues that need to be resolved such as  scalability, privacy and regulation with permissionless blockchains,  however there are some extremely large Enterprises, Banks, Governments,  even Central Banks getting heavily involved and going into production  albeit mostly in the permissioned blockchain space where such issues are  not a problem. Just as each Blockchain has its advantages and  disadvantages, parts of Enterprise applications are better suited to  Permissioned blockchains (such as more sensitive parts) and  permissionless blockchains suited for a higher degree of immutability,  thus a Hybrid model requiring interoperability between permissioned,  permissionless as well as existing non-DLT applications is required  arguably for many years ahead. Just as with cloud computing where  everything didn’t suddenly just move up into the cloud, well over a  decade later since the birth of the likes of Amazon AWS, hybrid is still  very prevalent today with only recently the likes of central banks,  banks, governments discussing moving more sensitive workloads to public  clouds such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud etc.

## SIA, Central Banks, Banks, Trading Venues

[Quant Network partnered with SIA](https://medium.com/@CryptoSeq/quant-network-partner-with-sia-a-game-changer-for-mass-blockchain-adoption-by-financial-9059ab411069),  a game changer for mass blockchain adoption by Financial Institutions.  SIA is the leading financial network provider in Europe that connects  over 570 Banks, Central Banks, Trading Venues (stock exchanges etc) to  their infrastructure. They provide a dedicated private network /  infrastructure for financial institutions. Every European financial  institution will either connect via SIA, in partnership with Colt or via  SWIFT (and in many cases they will have connectivity with both) in  order to access the Eurosystem Single Market Infrastructure Gateway,  granting access to all RTGS, Securities and Instant Payment transactions  for Europe.

SIA  have integrated Overledger into their private infrastructure covering  Europe consisting of 570 supernodes called SIAChain which enables each  bank, central Bank, trading venue etc to utilise Overledger for  interoperability. Some of the largest deployments of blockchain are  happening on SIAChain such as the[ Spunta project](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/italian-bankers-test-reconciliation-blockchain-with-a-years-transactions/) where the entire Italian Banking Sector will be using blockchain and due to go live next month. As well as the [“Fideiussioni Digitali” initiative](https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/81028/sia-launches-national-securities-blockchcain-project) (Digital Sureties) to digitize the management of sureties using blockchain technology with the Central Bank of Italy involved.

[Central Bank Digital Currencies are going to play a hugely significant role in the future](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cenbank-digital/six-central-banks-to-hold-digital-currency-meeting-in-april-nikkei-idUSKBN1ZZ348) and there is one central Bank currently testing Overledger and Quant are in discussions with 4 others.

Connecting  your blockchain / legacy network to Overledger enables the possibility  that it could be used by any of these connected Banks, Central Banks,  Trading venues etc in their private network (obviously due to the amount  of regulation and critical financial infrastructure the options are  going to be limited on what they want to connect).

https://preview.redd.it/pmbmsyauxoi41.png?width=1336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9f3dc1d5df4300207605c01838bf86bb6c1fd80

# Oracle

Quant  are a Fintech Partner with Oracle, the 2nd largest software company in  the world and Oracle are taking Quant’s tech to their clients directly.  They have 480,000 clients globally and towards the end of last year  Oracle invited Quant to attend Sibos (SWIFT) where they met existing  financial services and banking clients and introduced to new ones. By  connecting to Overledger this also enables your solution to potentially  be used by those 480,000 of Oracle’s global clients.

## SIMBA Chain

SIMBA  Chain is a cloud-based, smart-contract-as-a-service (SCaaS) platform,  enabling users across a variety of skill sets to implement dapps  (decentralized applications). The easy-to-use platform is tailored for  users, developers, government, and enterprises to quickly deploy  blockchain dapps for their enterprise. SIMBA Chain are developing on  Quant’s Overledger Blockchain OS to allow them to deploy DAPPs across  multiple connected blockchains.

[SIMBA Chain have recently been awared a $9.5 million contract with the US Navy](https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-navy-bets-95m-on-blockchain-to-keep-messaging-secret), they are also working with the [US Air Force](https://www.ledgerinsights.com/us-air-force-blockchain-simba-constellation/).  They have a thriving ecosystem with over 1100 Organizations and 650+  Applications developed. Partners include Microsoft, Government  Blockchain Association, Air Force Research Laboratory, Caterpillar, SAP  and EY. [Recently they also integrated Unity 3D plugin for Gaming](https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2020/02/18/simba-chain-integrates-unity-3d-plugin-to-enable-blockchain-gaming-development/) to enable owning, storing, and managing all personal gaming assets across a variety of blockchains.

These  are just a few of the companies that Quant have partnered with  directly, but the ecosystem for Overledger Network is the Network of  Networks. Every connected blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple (XRPL),  EOS, Stellar, IOTA, DAG, R3’s Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, JP Morgan’s  Quorum and other Permissioned Variants of Ethereum) and their associated  partners / applications built on them have the ability to connect and  interoperate with the other blockchains connected as well as non-DLT  networks such as existing payment rails like SWIFT, Faster Payments,  SEPA etc. This Network of Network’s effects will grow exponentially as  more and more join the ecosystem.

&amp;#x200B;

#  Connecting the Internet directly to blockchain

Quant  Network are also developing the ability to allow developers to build  MAPPs that integrate directly with the internet as well as blockchain  data. They will enable this via creating a new IP address for  blockchains which they are calling Quant IP which will enable traffic to  be routed from an IP connection from the Internet through Overledger to  the connected blockchains.

Another  Quant product called Seeq is a distributed search engine that is able  to search and retrieve data from multiple blockchains and display them  via html directly from the blockchain. More details will be released  about Seeq later this year.

Connecting  the Internet directly to blockchain will allow websites to be natively  created and served directly from blockchains, without the need to have,  run and maintain web servers, web services, SSL certificates etc and all  running in a completely trusted, extremely resilient / tamperproof  environment. The implications of this are enormous and more details will  be released by the team later on this exciting prospect. By connecting  your blockchain to Overledger you will also be able to benefit from  this.

## Join your favourite Blockchain project to the Overledger Network Ecosystem

Instead  of the current mentality of having the main focus for many projects of  listing on exchanges for vast sums of money, why not spend a little time  (connectors can be created in as little as a week of development and  don’t necessarily even need to be created by the team themselves) and  make your blockchain / non-DLT application available to be used by all  existing enterprises / members. Not only that but if you also run an  Overledger Gateway connecting your blockchain node you also benefit from  the transaction fees of the traffic going to it. The connectors are  open source and completely free to connect and now with the  standardisation of Objects in the recent SDK update the foundations are  in place for the launch of Overledger Network with an ETA of Q2 2020. If  you would like your favourite blockchain project to interoperate and be  part of the ecosystem to further adoption then make the relevant people  aware and keep an eye out for further details released in the future.

personalfinance,Advice on New Home Affordability,"Hi everyone!

Looking for a gut check on a home buying situation - are we crazy or is this reasonable? We can make the math work but are curious about inputs based on others situations/reality/points of view.

We are considering a move to a home that better accommodates our family’s medical needs. We could achieve our goal with a home at our current price point, but we are very excited about one option we’ve found (including the home *and* specific location - from proximity to family and school districts down to the direction it faces and specific terrain features of the property) and want to understand if this financially is OK or not. Just looking to hear if we are way off the mark or ballpark appropriate.

We’ve run through the online tools for home affordability, and generally they say we can do this - in fact, they say we can go way higher, but I don’t trust those things.


**Background** 

* Married
* Low 30s
* 2 kiddos (both under 5)
* Both adults working in management, one in a lucrative line of work and the other in a less lucrative and more socially impactful line of work
* Considering a move in 9-12 months to better suit our family’s needs


**Income**

* Combined salary $270,000/yr
* $30,000 annual equity grants (not factored in to any numbers below)
* $42,000 in bonus that we do not count on (not factored in to any numbers below, also not banking on this ever)


**Retirement &amp; Future**

* Roughly $300,000 in retirement accounts (mostly 401Ks, a little in Roth/traditional IRAs)
* Each contributing $19,500 to our 401Ks
* $200/month into 529 account for one kiddo
* $200/month into special needs account for the other kiddo
* Maxing annual HSA at the individual level - I forget this number, maybe $3,550/year
* Maxing annual childcare FSA - I believe this is $5,000/year which we make use of each year to help cover the monthly expenses (does not completely cover but reduces realized monthly by $415)


**Debt**

* No student loans
* No credit card debt
* $2,600 monthly mortgage including taxes/escrows
* Vehicle lease #1 @ $550/month with 18 months remaining
* Vehicle lease #2 @ $450/month with 18 months remaining
* $430/month in an old vehicle loan (unsecured) that is hanging around because the interest rate is so low (1.9%) that the cash in an investment account or as a down payment is more valuable - something like 10 months until the ~$4,000 paid off


**Other Regular Expenses**

* $1,200/month for one kiddo’s daycare; public education starts in 12 months, so costs may reduce them
* $1,000/month for the other kiddo’s daycare; public education starts in 18 months so this cost may reduce then
* $300/month toward kids’ activities (sports, clubs, etc.)
* See above note regarding $415/monthly offset to daycare from FSA contributions from salary


**Cash**

* $35,000 liquid with about $30,000 that we consider emergency; the remaining $5,000 is reserved for “current” expenses at a given time
* We had been increasing this by $1,000/month but lately it’s be $500/month - frankly due to frivolous spending habits
* Could pull $10,000 from a Roth if needed (included in the above ~$300,000 retirement number)


**Proposed Situation**

* Purchase in the $650,000-$700,000 range
* 20% down including rolling equity over and using ~$20k of cash reserves
* Monthly mortgage increases by ~$1,500 to  ~$3,900-$4,200
* This would be about 9-12 months out


Running the numbers, we can make this happen between reducing our frivolous spending ($500/month), seeing shifts in childcare costs (not expecting an elimination, but a conservative reduction of $500/month), elimination of the $450/month old vehicle loan and considering reducing our $39,000/year 401K contributions by a few grand to $35,000 or so if absolutely required. Also willing to reduce our vehicle allowance when leases expire in 18 months.

Square footage is the same or less than where we are today, and the numbers above include conservative estimates for HOA fees, taxes, etc. We do not expect maintenance/utility fees to increase since the home would be equal or smaller and a newer home so equal or more efficient than current state.

Any input? Is this move/change in housing cost reasonable or are we nuts?",finance

personalfinance,Home equity and student loans?,"My parents currently have ~$67,000 in home equity. My mother was thinking of taking out a partial amount to help with my student loans (Parent PLUS and my federal loans). 

Parent PLUS Loan(s): $18,167.33 w/ avg interest of 6.84%

My Federal Loans: $31,353.03 w/ avg interest of 4.0%

From my understanding (or lack thereof), taking out part of the home equity can increase the mortgage payments, but possibly lower the interest rate. It sounds incredibly risky, but the idea of shaving off a couple thousand on either loan (or both) would help tremendously. 

Is there anything she should consider before doing so? My parents plan to talk to their mortgage lender/servicer in the coming weeks too.

personalfinance,May not be able to go to college because of trouble getting loans?,"Hi so I'm in my last year at the community college I'm going to, and I'm going to graduate with associates in May.

I know that I get the federal loan no matter my credit score or lack of cosigner, but I'm most likely going to need to take out private loans as well. The thing is I have yet to start building credit. I'm trying to get a job asap to try and get approved for a secured credit card to start building credit so I improve my chances of getting a loan.

Do you have to fill out loans before starting the school year, or when you graduate? What do you think is the best thing for me to do right now? Are there any easier private loans to get with minimal credit history and no cosigner?

personalfinance,Turbotax says I owe more than 6k in taxes - taken totally by surprise,"Hi there - hope this is the right place to take this question.

I'm preparing my taxes via TurboTax this year, and much to my surprise I'm being told I owe more than six thousand dollars this year.

I had three sources of income:

\-W2 from Job 1

\-W2 from Job 2 (I switched jobs halfway through the year)

\-Income from selling company options (around 6k)

TurboTax calculates the money that you either owe or will receive as you go along, and it immediately shot up as soon as I entered in the info from my first W2. I expected to owe some taxes due to the sale of the options, but here at the end, it looks like not enough taxes were withheld from my first W2, and that's what is causing the discrepancy.

Is it worth it to go to an accountant to get this sorted out? Does anyone know why this might be? I didn't adjust anything with my tax withholding at my first job, so I am completely taken by surprise that I owe so much. I did get a pretty significant raise at the beginning of 2019, but I assumed that my tax withholding would increase commiserate with that.

Any help or guidance is appreciated, and please excuse my financial illiteracy.

personalfinance,[Debt] I really need help with my debt during dealing with a divorce,"Hello,

I REALLY need help. 

I am going through a divorce and I’ve been financially wrecked by the situations leading up to the divorce and my ex’s absolutely POOR handling of money and buying things without telling me, plus we had a joint account he basically cleaned out. I was doing great and the situation changed within 2 years from doing okay to doing poorly. I had savings and now I have debt and I am working full time and in school part-time working to get my PhD. I am lucky enough that I usually can get enough funding to cover most of my classes but some stuff happened last year that caused me to have to pay for half of my classes. I also got my student loans back late, but now I have roughly $5k to allocate to various accounts. 

My question is, what is the best way to allocate the $5k and what is the best way to get my debt back under control? It is really contributing to my depression and anxiety and I really need help because I just feel so LOST. A divorce is bad enough without the debt involved. Also, should I take out a personal loan to pay off some of the credit cards? Or is this just getting me back into debt? I CANNOT take another legit job, both because I’m federal and because I just don’t have time around school and work.

personalfinance,US - Figuring out Additional Tax Payments to file this year.,"EDIT: Thanks for the feedback! I had no idea what I was talking about and confused two different things. Please disregard.

This wasn't in the top-ten-FAQ for taxes. I'm unsure if this is the right sub but giving this a try first.

**TLDR: My wife's employer didn't do additional tax payments the way we thought they would, and there isn't a clear straightforward answer of how much she paid. We don't know what to put in when we file.**

Before my wife and I were together, I filed taxes with TurboTax. I felt comfortable with it. Her family has an accountant they've used for like 30 years. After we got married we used their accountant for a few years. I found dealing with him a frustrating experience so this year we're back to filing on our own. Everything has been quick and easy except for one thing.

When we filed with that accountant for tax year 2018, he said that however my wife's W4 was setup, she didn't pay enough federal taxes and she owed. Okay, fine, we'll pay. But he also said that she underpaid so much, that if she did it two years in a row she would get penalized by the govt. and that she should adjust her W4 or include additional tax payments. When we asked how to do that, or how much, he couldn't give us a straight answer. So four-months into 2019 when he told us, we just took a guess. Her employer had an online W4 that said you can include additional tax payment per pay period. She put in $700 for a month  and then dropped it to $600.

Her pay periods are per month. We assumed that she would have $700 for April and then $600 for May - December, totaling **$4900** for the year, and we'd know by-which-quarter each payment was made. Should be easy.

Not easy. Her company started this new thing where overtime was distributed as part of a separate paycheck, that was during the same pay period... but itself was a different pay period. She has some checks where she worked maybe 6 hours overtime, and 90% of what she earned went to taxes. Some exact numbers are 92.35%, 68.38%...

Her company is a big corporation - it's difficult to get a hold of a human. I came up with an idea - I would go to her previous year's paystubs and the current year prior to our tax payment adjustment to figure out during a normal pay period what percentage of federal tax she'd normally pay. Anything additional than that was probably the overpayment, just weirdly calculated by the employer. Running through her numbers, it looks like typically she pays 23.39% in taxes, and 12.85% of her salary is federal tax. I calculated the sum for 2019 of everything listed as federal tax payment that was more than 12.85% of the pay check, and it totaled as **$7,491.05**.

Okay, we enter that into TurboTax. But... I assumed that since TurboTax has her total gross income, how much she paid in federal taxes, this that and the other, that typing in the over-payment amount was just procedure. They should have all the information they need to calculate our refund/payment. Since we entered he W2, they should know what it takes to make us an the IRS square. So we made a point to leave this as the very last thing we'd enter, and I expected the refund number to not change. But then it did. It went up. Now I'm afraid we could accidentally scam the government if we're calculating something wrong.

My questions:

* Is my process sound?
* Was the accountant right about this fee/penalty thing?
* If he was right, was that only prior to the 2018 tax law changes? Is this still a concern?
* Should we pay TurboTax for their audit protection? Or pay for some time with one of their accountants/reps to review this with them?",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay my car off now or wait 6 months,"Title says it all. Just for some background, I graduated with an undergraduate degree in May of 2019. I've always driven a beater. I figured that I'm in a new part of my life with a great job and I need a more reliable car. In July, I financed a newer used car due to my beater car dying. Unfortunately, I just graduated and barely had any money saved, but I needed transportation. I have been pretty intense with working toward paying off my debts. I have student loan debt and this car debt. I'm pretty set on the debt avalanche and this car loan is the largest of my debts (highest interest rate and principal balance) compared to my broken up federal student loans. I have been focusing on paying the car off first. With the additional amount that I add to my car payment every month, I will have the car paid off in September this year, much quicker than the 5-year payment plan I chose. I now have enough cash saved to pay the car off today. However, doing so will take a significant bite out of my savings (like over half of all the money to my name). Should I pay the car off today or just wait the 6 months and continue using my cash flow to pay off the car? I understand that my 1.25 year plan is already saving me so much money on the interest compared to paying it off in 5 years, so going faster won't save me that much more money, but I want the peace of mind of having a paid off car so that I can move on to my student loans.

TLDR: Took out a car loan last year. Car will be paid off in September but I now have the cash to pay it off. Do I pay it off now or stick to my original plan?",finance

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this isn't a proper sub, I've posted this in r/CyberSecurityJobs as well but was hoping to reach a broader audience. 

I've had interest in cybersecurity and IT fields for years but career directed me into healthcare for the past 6 years. I am a US citizen. Prior to that my tech background goes like this: B.S. in electronics engineering from a foreign school-&gt;immigration to the US-&gt;military service(combat time, additional duties as intel. analyst with interim secret clearance). Since then I've gotten out of the military, and re-entered federal scene at the VA working in healthcare. Last year I have involved myself in telehealth and healthcare analytics, led a project on it to high acclaim of Director's quad. Now, I understand I am not well qualified for even a regular IT job,let alone INFOSEC, but I would like to ask the SMEs here what is my best course of action to begin accumulating these qualifications. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to remain with the fed, DoD, DA, DHS/CISA, VA, etc. If possible, coursework/certs/internships should be doable in the evenings/wknds due to ongoing need to provide for the family.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've read so far, CompTIA courses aren't extremely valuable aside from the very entry level, to that end I've signed up for FedVTE to begin my prep. My sense tells me I should be looking into entry level IT position then taking more courses/certs to get foot in the door on the INFOSEC side. My problem is I feel uncertain how to get there most efficiently.

personalfinance,Did our taxes using freetaxusa.com. Our experience:,"We'd paid our CPA $300 last year.  Even HE said, ""You paid your house, you're doing standard deduction, save the money and do your own taxes.  I'll review it free.""  Since we have to take my mom's stuff to him soon, sounds good.  But we hadn't done our taxes in a couple of decades, and tbh, there ARE a lot of forms.  

I did it by hand first.  Double checking a lot because we have 1099-INT, 1099-DIV, 1099-Rs--nothing outrageous, but a bit nerve-racking when one is a worrier.   

Tonight my husband and I went to freetaxusa.com, and went through every single step.  Most of them didn't apply, but evidently, you ARE supposed to go through them anyway.  A bit monotonous (do one, do the next, do the next), but I can see why it's better to go through them.  Lots of entries (payor, address, TIN, etc etc) but nothing difficult.  Take it slow and easy.  Check yourself as you go.  You can stop, there's not a time limit (except for Apr 15, of course), but it's not a race.  

But it wasn't difficult, partially because I had done it all by hand, so it was familiar.  My husband hadn't reviewed what I had done, so at least I could tell him a bit about it when things arose.  We had a few oddities, mostly due to a pension roll-over to his 403b, an error on my IRA by the IRA-people (resulting in their having to rollover my contribution to the correct year but giving me $0.61 in taxable income--which seems to have been easily entered in this software).  

Finished the federal.  Lo and behold!  I was off $10!  We're getting back $10 more than I had calculated--but to me, the important thing was that I was that close after various schedules and such.  So I was pretty happy.  

We did the state (CA) and it was dead on to what I had done by hand.  Yay!  Very simple.  

We were a bit nervous on the actual filing, but since we had checked so much--and the CPA will review--we weren't panicking.  Despite a version for free printing, I still wanted a bound copy, just to make sure I didn't lose it.  Total price was still only about $25.  Husband says that since I saved us $175, that's mine.

stocks,Gold continues to rally +$19. Gold up to $1663 an oz. Dow futures are -375,"Re-Update: $1688 now, DOW futures -800

We could potentially see a move to $1700 by the end of the week, if not tomorrow. The federal reserve will try and save the market, as its doing right now, with the only thing it can do; massive QE with low rates. It may make the market go up in nominal terms, but it’s purchasing power will tank. They would rather risk a currency crisis, than deal with the problems and the recession now. They won’t allow interest rates to go up because debt would be too expensive to service; whether it’s the government or corporations, they’re drowning in debt. Obviously not all corporations, but many of them are. 

The federal reserve should let interest rates rise and encourage savings. More savings = more capital for business. 

Ultimately the lender of the money is the one who gets fucked in this scenario. With massive QE, the lenders purchasing power gets stolen from him. The debtor pays the lender the same nominal amount; but it doesn’t have the same amount of purchasing power. 

If you’re in cash, stocks, and bonds. I would attempt to diversify into something not denominated in dollars. Just in case, no need to get caught with your pants down. Not only is gold insurance in this scenario, but you can profit off of a trade like this; it’s so undervalued to where you can actually make money. 

If you’re interested in this kind of stuff I suggest Jim Rickards books. He has 4 financial books on money, the latest one being called aftermath. His books are very good at forecasting events years in the future. He ultimately goes into the reasoning behind the math of $10,000-$14,000 gold based off of the current money supply. It’s a good read. 

Jim could be right, tons of facts and history. He’s great at explaining concepts in clear terms, no unnecessary jargon. And if he does, it’s easy to understand. 

I think we could see gold around $3000-$5000 an oz over the next 5 years. But Jim could be right for the better.

Bitcoin,What would happen if sovereign governments gave bitcoin a gold peg?,"This is a totally theoretical post, but I believe it is a really interesting idea and would love to get the Internet's feedback on it, and what you think the ripple effects would be in the scenario described.  Am very interested in writing this up and republishing it widely so it can be read by monetary policymakers in all major developed countries - if you know anyone like that, pass it on.  In a move that would act like a bridge to a pre-Bretton Woods type of gold peg, (here is a great paper on a history of this in the US:  https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41887.pdf) sovereign governments with gold holdings could (again, it is a theoretical idea - I am saying they COULD do this NOT that anyone or any country is doing this that I know of) establish open market operations to purchase bitcoins (partly as a diversification strategy) using their physical gold holdings at a fixed peg rate of 5 ounces per bitcoin.  The reason I say 5 is because the current chart here seems to suggest that somewhat of a convergence to 5 oz is already occurring:  https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=XBT&amp;to=XAU&amp;view=10Y  

If any government did this and offered to buy physically delivered bitcoins from private holders of bitcoin (no other coins just BTC) in exchange for private delivery of physical gold, then the standard governmental unit of physical gold (held in places like Fort Knox) - known as the Good Delivery Bar which is 400oz of gold - could be procured by any holder of 80 or more coins in a secure and sanctioned exchange with the government in question - the most impactful of course would be if the US did this.

My theory is that any time the exchange rate mechanisms in the forex or crypto markets violated the peg, there would be arbitrage opportunities that would bring the peg back in line.  It would not only stabilize BTC, but the stabilization might spread via the 24/7 exchange rate mechanism in the crypto market to stabilize many cryptos that are still somewhat worthy experimental stores of value.  Depending on the strength, credit, and depth of gold holdings of whatever governments engaged in this, it would seem that such a strategy could transform bitcoin into a new type of sound money, and also signal that owning bitcoin and gold is a priority of governments as well as their citizens.  The gold standard was powerful both because it was tethered to something of limited quantity in the earth's crust with unique properties, but also because pre-Bretton Woods gold standards acted very much like a peg - and the government honored the peg no matter what.  So in some sense it was still the ""faith and credit of the government"" that made that peg work so famously.  I was partly inspired by this recent award-winning documentary www.inmoneywetrust.org in formulating this idea, and partly by my own academic interest in cryptocurrency.  I believe bitcoin, above all others, because of its deflationary nature and algorithmically fixed quantity, is powerful all in itself - but with a peg from a real government to a real precious metal that many governments do in fact hoard (for whatever reason) - it could become both an international currency, and a form of truly sound money backed by governments' physical gold reserves and a legal or policy commitment to a peg of 5 ounces to 1 bitcoin.

What do you all think would happen if a major government or many major governments did this?  Remember the idea is to convince monetary policymakers in governments to willingly and openly bypass completely the fiat currencies of their governments and to make no informational commitment to those free-floating fiat markets for forex - so the bitcoins transacted for in the peg wouldn't be bought with dollars or yen or anything that could be printed by fiat.  This would simply be a convertibility guarantee by major governments that 1 bitcoin, transferred to the Treasury by a private citizen or business (again so the Treasury could diversify holdings of sound money), would be convertible and be guaranteed to be convertible to 5 oz of physical, deliverable gold bullion (or 80 bitcoins per bar). 
 Here is a list of the largest physical gold holders on earth who could theoretically engage in this type of operation:  https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040715/what-countries-have-largest-gold-reserves.asp

With the advent of the bull market, how does WaykiChain perfect their Defi ecosystem and occupy the market?","As a world’s leading blockchain company focused on blockchain’s underlying technology and related ecosystem technology, WaykiChain owns an industry-leading public chain. Relying on the inherent technical advantages of blockchain and its superior R&amp;D strength, WaykiChain is empowered with high-performance transaction processing capabilities (TPS3300), efficient mechanism of consensus (DPoS + pBFT), powerful smart contract, as well as the blockchain ecological decentralized control ability, WaykiChain can provide various major industries and key areas of vertical industry with infrastructure services and industry solutions.

At present, the bottom layer of the WaykiChain public chain has been continuously upgraded and optimized and has achieved significant success. WaykiChain stablecoin WUSD, which is developed on the bottom of the public chain, is one of the important infrastructures of blockchain finance promoted by WaykiChain. It is also continuously improving the potential of decentralized business development.

At 20:00 on February 14th, at the invitation of the “Bull Market Sharing Class”, Gordon Gao, the Co-Founder, and CEO of WaykiChain, made sharing of the theme “ Why does WaykiChain (WICC) soar after the start of 2020? With the advent of the bull market, how does WaykiChain perfect their Defi ecosystem and occupy the market?”

Gordon Gao Background: Gordon Gao, WaykiChain Co-Founder &amp; CEO, an Alumni of Columbia University in New York, former Chief Data Scientist of Fishbowl in Wall Street, ex-Senior Data Analyst of Alibaba Group, a senior member of Mensa International Club, currently serves as WaykiChain CEO. He is responsible for offering support to WaykiChain commercial model designing and strategy planning, building up a digitalized monitor system for products and operation and promoting WaykiChain overseas market with his international background.

The Following is the content of sharing from Gordon Gao:

**1.WaykiChain is a third-generation blockchain commercial public chain that aims to build a world-leading public chain brand. How does the performance of WaykiChain compare to other public chains on the market?**

Gordon Gao: In terms of performance, WaykiChain’s TPS ranks first with a measured average of 3300 in the world. Besides, our ecological construction in the DApp field and Defi is also gradually perfect. Last year, we introduced more than 20 DApps. Since WaykiChain has launched the Defi platform, it has collateralized over 24 million WICC and issued over USD 1.4 million in WUSD.

**2. Recently, WaykiChain(WICC) is well received by Korean investors, and its trading volume has exceeded 70 billion WON. How does WaykiChain achieve such outstanding results?**

Gordon Gao: When WaykiChain(WICC) was listed on Bithumb, WICC’s premium was three times the domestic price. Recent market conditions are very good. The maximum price in South Korea is up to 10 times the domestic price.

Our investment in the Korean market has always been very large. As early as 2018 May, WaykiChain Global Conference which was attracted thousands of persons to participate was successfully held in Seoul. After that, we did a lot of publicity around the Korean market, such as the content promotion and SEO promotion of their NAVER search engine. Last year, we also held WaykiChain(WICC) X Huobi Korea Hackathon and offline meetup in South Korea. I have also been invited three times to give speeches and conducting exhibitions at Korean blockchain conferences. And our CTO Richard Chen was invited to interview with the Korean media, which was broadcast by Korean KBS TV station. South Korean users are very impressed with WaykiChain. When WaykiChain held the Hackathon in South Korea last year, a Korean investor came over and told us that he also came to our conference in 2018 and also received gold bars. He told us he was very happy to see our development so that he came to support us this time. When we have this kind of market enthusiasm, it is not unusual for prices to be reflected in the exchange.

**3. According to media reports, WaykiChain has a strong technical team and has made a lot of progress in technology development. It has planned a four-public chain version iteration plan. What innovations and breakthroughs has WaykiChain achieved in technology?**

Gordon Gao: The current version is WaykiChain public chain v2.0 version (Teng version) that we updated in October last year. We added the decentralized exchange and developed a CDP system at the bottom of the public chain for pledging WICC to get stablecoin WUSD. We developed a 3-token economy model (WICC, WUSD, WGRT) and increased the speed of block generation from 10 seconds per block to 3 seconds per block, which greatly improving user experience. This version lays the foundation for us to achieve decentralized financial functions, and directly implements the three most important functions of Defi at the moment: stablecoin, lending, and DEX.

We are developing the public chain v3.0 version (Hu version) now. In the public chain v3.0 version, we will further improve the performance and scalability of the current decentralized exchange, allowing anyone to publish their own DEX on the chain. Meanwhile, we will introduce WASM to greatly improve the performance and developer-friendly of the virtual machine.

At the same time, in the next public chain version, we will soon launch the WASM virtual machine, which greatly improves the performance of the virtual machine and makes it developer-friendly. Porting virtual machine is a project with high technical difficulty. We learned that several projects ranked among the top 30 in market value are also developing WASM virtual machines. It took us several months to complete the porting of WASM, which fully demonstrates our technical strength. In addition, in the next version, we will provide a decentralized cross-chain solution so that more digital assets can operate in the WaykiChain Defi eco-system.

**4. We all know that WaykiChain has conducted in-depth reciprocal visits with the Montenegro government and exchanged views on blockchain technology reform in the field of Montenegro International Trade and Finance. What new knowledge and experiences have you gained through international cooperation? How do these experiences inspire you to give WaykiChain more business value and promote the implementation of decentralized financial applications?**

Gordon Gao: Firstly, the government thinks differently from ours. For example, we only consider whether a business model can improve efficiency and reduce costs, but the government will also consider how to coordinate all stakeholders and make a balance. We discussed the issuance of stablecoins with them. If stablecoins are controlled by the central bank and all are on the chain, then the commercial banks below the central bank will not be able to adopt the original method. If addition, currency is issued through leverage, this is a weakening of existing stakeholders and it is difficult to continue. So, both of us are still exploring better solutions, and strive to not only improve efficiency through the blockchain but also meet all existing stakeholders.

Moreover, there is also a shortage of technical talents and human resources in some European countries and regions. They welcome Chinese blockchain teams like us to export technology and solutions to them. This is a very good opportunity for WaykiChain and other Chinese blockchain teams.

Thirdly, the cheap money policy of the European Central Bank can cause huge interest rate differences between European and Asian currencies. This contains huge market space and business opportunities, and the Defi system aims at this.

**5. WaykiChain will complete the cross-chain process of BTC and ETH in the first half of 2020, and the mortgage lending system through stablecoin will be launched simultaneously. It is expected that there will be a new round of explosive growth around WUSD’s Pre-IPO business and loans. What is WUSD and what are its uses?**

Gordon Gao: WaykiChain WUSD, the first stablecoin developed on Core Layer of the public chain, is issued through over-collateralization with value anchored to USD.

WUSD is the cornerstone of the WaykiChain Defi system. WUSD can be cashed in USDT or fiat currency. In other words, users can pledge their WICC to borrow cash. This principle is the same as a loan from a bank. WUSD can buy WICC or WGRT (governance coin) in WaykiChain DEX. This means that giving leverage to those who hold WaykiChain coins. WUSD can also be used in WaykiChain ecological applications. For example, Huatong Securities provides brokerage services on HK and US stocks to global customers with its unique WUSD-based payment solution which means that opening up the digital currency and traditional financial channels. Also, recently, we plan to launch a new application just like bank demand loans. Users can buy WUSD as wealth management. Of course, there will be derivatives based on WUSD pricing in the future.

**6. “Building a decentralized big platform and ecology through community autonomy” is the original intention of WaykiChain, and this is also the big vision of WaykiChain. What difficulties has WaykiChain encountered in building a globally decentralized consensus? How did you overcome these difficulties?**

Gordon Gao: At the beginning, we only divided the domestic market and overseas markets. The main job of overseas markets is to publish articles and contents which achieved very little success. The language, culture, social platforms, per capita income, and the cognition level of cryptocurrency vary from country to country. And if we only use online communication, the information is too fragmented to help others understand your project in depth.

After continuous experimentation, we decided to adopt the mode of offline(entering)-online(maintenance). We organized offline meetups and recruited WaykiChain Global Ambassadors. And then, we transferred to online maintenance, which has achieved success.

Now we have organized 10 meetups with our global ambassadors, and have established telegram groups in nearly 20 countries and regions, including South Korea, Iran, Japan, Vietnam, Turkey, Indonesia, and the Philippines, with high daily engagements. The last time I did AMA in our Iranian group, the local media asked some very professional questions which show our Iranian fans have in-depth knowledge of our project. Now, WaykiChain team brings people from different countries to work together and becomes more international.

**7. WaykiChain ranks first with a measured average TPS of 3300 (Measured Peak TPS 7800). And WaykiChain launched WUSD which is developed on the bottom layer of the public chain. What convenience and value will this bring to payment and commerce?**

Gordon Gao: The Defi system that WaykiChain is going to achieve is a decentralized bank without borders

In daily life, most people go to the bank to do deposits, loans, exchange, buy financial products and so on. These functions are also available on WaykiChain and users can enjoy lower interest rates.

The average deposit rate in Europe is between 0 and 0.3%. However, if we launch the new application of WUSD, Europeans can use fiat currency to buy WUSD and then gain at least 3 points of interest. This part of the interest comes from the mortgage interest paid by the mortgage borrower to the system. This part may be can achieve 6 points or more. In this way, the system also earns a cut of the discount. So, this is a three-win business.

Defi is a business model that enables blockchain companies to truly implement possible commercial application scenarios. For example, Huatong Securities provides brokerage services on HK and US stocks to global customers with its unique WUSD-based payment solution Ordinary people are difficult to open an account to trade Hong Kong stocks in HK exchanges. However, now users can use WUSD to trade and invest HK/US Pre-IPO to make money. The HK Pre-IPO market now has an annualized income of 20–40% on average. Therefore, many people in the WaykiChain community now pledge WICC to generate WUSD and use WUSD to buy Hong Kong and US stocks to make new money. It can not only enjoy the potential appreciation space of WICC but also improve capital utilization.

**8. WaykiChain has established a 3-token economic model (WICC / WUSD / WGRT) with more financial stability and scalability. Please introduce this model to us. What are the advantages of the WaykiChain 3-token economic model compared to the common single-token economic model?**

Gordon Gao: As the base currency of Defi, WUSD is a stablecoin that is just needed in the investment market for deposits and loans. At the same time, WUSD can also be used as a payment tool, which is much more convenient than using other digital currencies with large volatility.

WaykiChain (WGRT) is our governance coins. All interest generated from borrowing WUSD and the liquidation penalty will be repurchased on the market to destroy WGRT. We don’t use WICC because if we use WICC, it means that the collateralized currency and the risk-proof currency are the same types. This model is the same as the model of BTS. The BTS black swan event has verified that this economic model does not work. Therefore, the emergence of governance coins is inevitable.

**9. 2019 can be called “the year of Defi loans”, and 2020 will be the “year of Defi derivatives”, so how will DeFi develop in 2020? What is WaykiChain’s strategy?**

Gordon Gao: Defi is definitely still a hot topic in the blockchain industry in 2020. From Huobi BTC(HBTC) which is released by Huobi, it can also be seen that exchanges that do centralized finance are also developing Defi. Loans and deposits are still rigid demands in the market.

Although derivatives have huge business opportunities, their outbreak in the Defi field may not be so fast. Because the market capability and liquidity of Defi are still limited. In addition, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have limited knowledge of derivatives. Now, Defi obviously still has some opportunities and the market is not occupied. For example, Bitcoin-based Defi has not yet been implemented. Of course, the emergence of HBTC promoted the development of Bitcoin-based Defi. However, its specific effects need time to verify. Moreover, Other public chain projects are still in the process of developing Defi. At present, only Ethereum’s Defi business has formed a certain scale, and WaykiChain might be the second-largest Defi platform which is developed on the public chain after Ethereum. Some users from WaykiChain do not own Ethereum, but if they own WaykiChain (WICC), they can also do collateralizing.

Since WaykiChain has launched the Defi platform, it has collateralized over 24 million WICC and issued over USD 1.4 million in WUSD. WaykiChain’s strategy in Defi is mainly to satisfy both supply and demand. Firstly, we will continue to increase the amount of WICC total collateral and expand the issuance of WUSD. Secondly, we will keep working hard to expand and develop commercial application scenarios of WUSD. Finally, we will keep innovating and explore more new products and technology. WaykiChain will continuously make contributions in the world blockchain industry with its leading specialization.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Student Loans Repayment Question,"Is it really possible to get on an income driven repayment plan that doesnt just put you into a deferment or forbearance if you make less than, I guess, what they're expecting?

I've been on deferment for a while, because now instead of asking if I've had a change in income, it asks if my income has decreased. Once my recertification comes back up I think I'm going to mark yes just to put in updated amounts to see if I still qualify (because I have no idea if I do or dont and none of my loan servicer's reps can really tell me if I do or not). 

***My biggest concern is my boyfriend's loans, though. He consolidated his loans and they ended up putting him in a forbearance, and he needs to recertify his stuff too now. But I'm worried that, if we try to recertify, they're just going to push him into a forbearance again. I know you only get so many of those, so I dont want him to use them all up now to push it off. So how do we get a lower payment without going into forbearance again?***

We live in Tennessee. Not sure if that will help, but I imagine it might. These are all federal loans I'm talking about--no private loans. For some reason he's gotten two emails with different estimates payment amounts. One was about $250 and the next was about $370. It'd be preferential to get those under $200 a month, though.

personalfinance,"Finally earning enough to save, please help me make the right decisions!","am a UK based single male and 26 years old. Up until this point my saving potential has not been great as my salary was fairly low, however, I am now in the fortunate position that I am earning a little more (I recently gained a professional qualification) and I wanted to ask the community for some general advice around my savings options and whether or not to buy a flat as opposed to renting.

I am earning 40K a year which will bump up to 45/48K next cycle. This gives me a post tax take home of approximately £2,150 per month. I have just moved into shared accommodation which will cost me approximately £580 per month meaning that my total fixed outgoings will come to around £800 total (Rent, car payment, gym, Netflix etc). On top of this I spend approximately £650 a month on variable costs including social spend, groceries, fuel and miscellaneous spend.

If my budget holds this should leave me with around £700 a month.

I already pay £550 into my pension each month from my salary and I have maxed out my employer contributions (8% match), my pension pot is £5000 - I'm in my fourth year of employment.

In addition I received some inheritance money a few years ago of which £7000 is left. It is sitting earning nothing in a savings account at present.

I think I have a few options.

1. Buy a property in the UK - with my inheritance and assistance from parents I will be able to afford a deposit at a 95% mortgage however this will be a 1 (maybe 2) bedroom apartment. My parents seem to think this is a sensible option and have effectively ring fenced the inheritance money for this. I'm not convinced this is the right option as I may still move to London with work or try and do a secondment overseas however there is something to be said for getting on the housing market early. My mortgage would likely be £600/£700 a month but if I got a 2 bed property I could probably charge a flatmate £400 and therefore bring my accommodation costs down to £300 a month. This option scares me a bit as it locks me in to a mortgage and I'm not sure I'm ready for that sort of commitment yet.
2. Alternatively, I could continue to rent for the time being and get a lifetime ISA that I could drip feed my inheritance money into. As I understand, this is a guaranteed 25% bonus on up to £4000 a year, plus, if I get a cash lifetime ISA this is essentially a risk free/tax free investment provided I buy my first property in the UK. I'm struggling to see any alternative use for this money that can guarantee those returns.
3. For the additional £700 disposable income a month I am earning I think I can move £200 a month into a rainy day/holiday fund so I can go on a decent holiday each year. £200 into an emergency fund that I can slowly build up for car maintenance costs etc, I've read having a few months worth of spend saved in an emergency fund is wise. The additional £300 remaining I figured I could open a low fee Vanguard and start investing in some FTSE/global index trackers.

All in all that would mean I would have invested my £7000 inheritance over two years which will have grown to £8750 with Government bonus, I could continue to grow this with my own savings once the inheritance has been fully fed in depending on whether I feel ready to buy. This would essentially be my deposit for a house which my parents have also kindly offered to assist with if needed. I imagine in a few years I'll be looking for a house as opposed to a flat but still an unknown.

I will be investing £6600 a year into my pension pot and £3600 in a Vanguard index tracker giving me £10,200 a year into long term savings.

In addition i'll be saving £4800 a year into a holiday/rainy day/emergency fund which may or may not be used depending on circumstances. Does this all sound like a reasonable start to my retirement journey?

Starting saving at 26 has meant I've lost years of compound growth so I really want to be smart with my money to try and generate a nest egg that will allow me to retire at a reasonable age. I have good earning potential with my job but I don't want to become a slave to work so hoping I can start making my money work for me.

Thanks to anyone who is able to assist/give me any tips or even anyone who can give me an indication as to whether I am making sensible decisions.",finance

CryptoMarkets,Five undervalued crypto coins,"*Bitcoin is looking both technically and fundamentally strong after its six-month correction, as the Halvening approaches. The last leg up in 2019 saw altcoins brutally sold off as traders positioned for BTC’s parabolic move. This time, the alts are showing some signs of rising with the tide. With prices still near the bottom after a brutal crypto winter, we look at five altcoin projects we view as interesting – and potentially significantly undervalued.*

[**1) Waves**](https://wavesplatform.com/)

Waves Platform launched with great fanfare back in 2016 after raising 30,000 BTC. Since then the team have diligently – but relatively quietly – worked away on a host of DeFi features. Waves is now an extensive and powerful ecosystem that includes user-friendly mobile and desktop wallets; easy token creation; a decentralised exchange that combines speed, security and privacy; safe and accessible smart contracts; an algorithmically-backed stablecoin, Neutrino; and many other products and services. It contains everything needed to launch scalable dApps, and the LPoS network and community-run monetary policy provide a great way to earn on your holdings. With its core tech in place, Waves is now looking to expand globally. Neutrino dollars (USDN) are very promising: there is huge demand for stablecoins (Total Value Locked for the Maker Protocol alone is $600 million), and TVL for Neutrino is almost $4 million after just a few weeks of operation. It’s growing fast, and the more WAVES are locked to generate USDN, the more net demand there will be on the market. Add to that the fact that Waves’ corporate arm, Waves Enterprise, has already established some impressive industry partnerships – if the same success follows for the open Waves platform, it’s going to start looking very underpriced.

[**2) Ergo**](https://ergoplatform.org/en/)

In terms of fundamentals, it’s hard to find a coin stronger than Ergo. Ergo has taken a different approach to smart contracts and DeFi, using Sigma protocols to enable use cases that are either impossible or risky on other platforms. Sigma protocols allow for very flexible and elegant coding of functionality, enabling developers to implement dApps that would be very expensive or horribly messy on Ethereum. Think of it like this: it’s possible to build a rudimentary jet engine with junk from your garage. But it wouldn’t be efficient or safe, because you don’t have the right tools or materials. With Ergo, you do. Ergo’s team have been involved with several other crypto platforms, and have drawn on this experience to create something unique. The issue – and the opportunity – is that they’ve focused on development and not marketing. It’s not easy to mine and beginners will be better off with the lite wallets rather than running a full node. This is now changing. The first mining pools are coming, and at a $5 million market cap, Ergo could easily outperform many other alts in the short-to-medium term.

[**3) MakerDAO**](https://makerdao.com/en/)

With a half-billion-dollar market cap, this is by far the largest project on the list. But it’s an excellent one, and given the interest in DeFi – in which Maker is a leader – it’s likely undervalued. Maker’s strength comes from several sources. A very solid economic model, a highly professional development and marketing team, and full decentralisation. MakerDAO, for those who don’t know, is the protocol that underpins the Dai stablecoin, which is backed by crypto collateral and smart contract-enforced algorithms. There are no middlemen at all. Best of all, every time users issue Dai against ETH and other collateral, they start accruing fees – some of which is used to buy and burn MKR. $600 billion is currently locked in Maker Vaults and DeFi is growing fast, so you can see where this is going.

[**4) Beam**](https://beam.mw/)

Along with Grin, Beam is one of two very exciting projects based on Mimblewimble – an impressive new privacy protocol that offers significant advantages over existing approaches. While coins like Dash and Monero seek to obscure the flow of money on the blockchain, Mimblewimble enables users to avoid putting critical information on the blockchain in the first place. That makes it both more private and scalable. Of the two, we’ve chosen Beam because it has a well-funded development team and limited coin supply – plus it’s just passed its first halving, so there’s a good chance the reduced block rewards will have an effect on price in the coming months. At $40 million market cap, it has a long way to go.

[**5) Sentinel**](https://sentinel.co/)

Sentinel is another micro-cap ($3 million) and another privacy project, but this one’s a dVPN – decentralised Virtual Private Network provider. Sentinel Network is a decentralised VPN that cryptographically guarantees the safety of your personal information, maintained by a collection of nodes around the world. It’s built on Tendermint, which is a solid technical choice. We’re interested because it’s tiny, but there are a lot of people who use VPNs. A lot. And after a spate of VPN hacks (including NordVPN), a large proportion of those users must be wondering how safe their ‘private’ data really is when surfing the web…

These are just five of the many, many interesting and attractive altcoin projects out there – we couldn’t include all the ones we’d want in our portfolio. Are you involved with any of these five? Are there others you think should be on the list? Retweet and let us know why!

So I trade both US and China, the last couple days were phenomenal for Chinese market. And my US portfolio is being raped in the fucking ass. 

As for today, the Chinese market was briefly dragged down by the US futures but was able to pick up momentum. It doesn't seem to be effect when everything start to pick up. 

If everything would follow same logic, feds gonna pump liquidity into market, bear virus cases rise, people stay at home, cloud conference goes up, chips goes up. Since the Chinese slaves go back to work gradually, supply chain won't be troubled as couple weeks ago. 

However I've been reducing allocation from 90% to 60% today for Chinese, and increased allocation to US from 50%-70%.

I think white house and fed were caught right off guard in this one.",finance
personalfinance,Looking for advice on investing.,"I am 100% new to all that is investing. I had a small introduction to the stock market and such when I was in high school so I would say I know the very basics.
 
My Boyfriend (25 M) was in a car accident early last year. So he has a claim that he will be getting. I (25 F) at the time of his accident was a stay at home mom to our 8 month old, So I have been working to support us ever since. We have been together for the last 7 years for context. And I do pretty much all the finances.

We do expect to get a fairly large sum of money as he was out of work for an entire year +, we had to move out of our home and into his parents at first as we didn't have an income and used our savings to pay the last month of rent and to cover moving costs without breaking our agreement with the landlord. Shortly after I started working we were able to find a place to move out to on our own which is great! And we saved up quite a bit as well.

So what we want to do with the money is put 10,000 away as a down payment on a house, We do not plan to actually buy a house for a while as we want my boyfriend to be retrained in something and start working first and then I might go back to school myself so I can be payed better too. Most average homes in my area are going for about 500k and up. So.... we forsure need more then what I am currently making now which is $16hr (Which is already better then most jobs. Min wage right now is $13 something but is expected to go up too 15 by the end of this year) So that will go into a savings account. Then another 5,000 away for taxes that we most likely will need to pay for next years taxes. I'm not sure how much our taxes will be so I just wanted to put away a flat sum. After all we do live in Canada and we get taxed... a lot... Ideally we are expecting about 30,000 maybe more, just because that's about how much he would have made if he was working. so that is not including any pain or suffering, or retraining that he is also entitled too. We do also have a lawyer which takes a portion of our settlement as well. About 15% I think?

But overall I was just wondering how much we should invest and should  we invest at all? Right now my savings account gives us about 1.60% interest rate over 180 days. Would it be better to just let the money sit in our savings or invest into something? What is your option on what we should do? 

We also haven't saved for retirement at all besides what we have put into the CPP that is mandatory to pay into, so Long term I am hoping that we can make money kind of stretch over a few things and plan for the future but I am wonders what is the best way to do this?",finance

My question is should I toss the 2k at the 5000 one with 20% then pay like 350 per month until it’s gone leaving my with about 9-10 months of 0 apr on the other card which I can pay a good chunk until it starts getting interest charged?

Or put the 2k towards the 5600 and pay 350 towards that while doing the minimum on the other card that has a 20% interest rate?

personalfinance,Can you help me understand how payments are applied to different interest levels?,"SOLVED - I spoke with Chase they said my **Cash Advance Subject to Interest** is actual $0, not $359.29. Something about me paying on Feb 6th but I didn't understand their reason that my statement said $359.  Anyways, If I make my minimum + $8.08 today, then everything is gone from the 26.49 APR tier.

I'm working on the avalanche method and I have a CC with the different purchase and cash advance rates. I thought that the CARD Act of 2009 required payments above the minimum to be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. I attempt to pay the minimum plus the total cash advance amount but it didn't work out as expected. No transactions occurred other than interest and payments so I don't know if I'm just not getting how this works.

personalfinance,I am a college sophomore with $6500 in student loan debt. I have about $8000 in my bank account. Is it smart to pay off all my loans now or should I wait?,"As the title mentions, I have about $6500 in student loan debt from my freshman year. This year, I was fortunate to receive a very generous scholarship, so I now have about $8000 in cash. I'm wondering what the smartest move for me is.

Here's a bit more information about the student loans:

Loan 1: $2500, will not accrue interest until six months after I graduate.

Loan 2: $4000, has an interest rate of 5-6% and is accruing interest now. However, payments are not required until six months after I graduate.

There are a few reasons I am hesitant to pay off the loans.

1. With the loan having a relatively low interest rate of 5-6%, would it be better for me to invest my $8000 in a low-risk index, like the S&amp;P? And then I can pay off the loan, with interest, but keep any gains.
2. I believe my credit score is impacted by both the age of my accounts and the number of accounts I have. If I pay off both of these loans, it would lower both of these, which could have a negative impact on my credit score. I may misunderstand the way a credit score is calculated, so any insight would be appreciated.
3. It's nice to have capital. This summer, I am planning to travel abroad. I want to be sure that I have enough money to travel with peace of mind. 

What would you suggest I do? I'm thinking the smartest action would be to pay off the loan that is accruing interest now but to wait until after I graduate to pay off the $2500 loan. Does this make sense?",finance
investing,Thesis: Euro and/or area Bonds (risk-off play with cap. appreciation possibility),"The S&amp;P 500 is down almost 100 points today while the Dow is almost down 1,000 points. Who knows where it will go from here but even before this equity rout, people already had sentiments that equities were overvalued. In addition to this, Covid-19 was discovered during Q1 2020 and this, and the corresponding slowdown in Supply and Demand, doesn't bode well for equities and earnings season come Mar/Apr. So equities seem risky now. I'm tempted to say Gold and U.S. Treasuries would be good defensive risk-off places to put cash right now, but those have rallied quite a bit since the new year. With the Fed messaging that they'll most likely be on hold, it doesn't seem like U.S. Treasuries will do much from here on out (however, they have reneged on their word before e.g. 2018). Regardless, I do like risk-off asset classes till maybe Q3 or Q4 2020 (at this point in time).

In come Euro-area/European bonds: They're risk-off with a higher likelihood that there will be more easing vs. the US which will provide for some capital appreciation.

personalfinance,"Got my tax return, could use advice to what debt to pay off.","Hi Everyone -

So I have a state tax refund of $3,000 and I'd like to receive some responses as to which account I should reduce debt on. Here are the top 3:

1. Wells Fargo Credit Card, Balance $6,595
2. Internal Revenue Service, Balance $5,069
3. Upstart Loan, Balance $5,547

A few details. WF has a 19% interest rate, Upstart has 23% interest, and IRS just has penalties and fees for every month there is a balance.

My federal tax return has already been applied to the IRS, lowering it to the current amount above.  I am currently in a low-tier monthly installment plan while I pay off other debts at a rate of $1,500 monthly. Additionally, I filed an amended return for the previous year so technically a similar federal and state refund is in the works. The former federal will automatically be applied, reducing the IRS balance to likely  $1,800, although I won't know until about May 2020. If state returns applies, I'm also looking at an additional refund of $3,000 also unconfirmed.

The existing payment schedule is as follows: 2 out of the 3 accounts receive a slightly above minimum payment while the remaining target account receives monthly payments of $1,500. So for example: IRS receives a monthly payment of $120, Upstart a monthly payment of $190, and WF a monthly payment of $1,500. Once an account is retired, then the focus switches to the next account and the amount is adjusted to $1,500.

Both WF and UpStart show up on my credit report. I'd like to retire all 3 accounts by Fall 2020 so I can aggressively save to buy a home by year's end.

So my questions are as follows:

1. To which account should I apply my state refund and why?
2. Should I receive an additional state refund from the previous year, which account should I apply to that and why?
3. Should I modify the current payment schedule?

This is a 4 BR 2.5 BA home, 2500 SF with around .25 acre yard, .45 acres in total. I love doing DIY projects and this was a dream ""family"" home for me, but now I have to take care of my daughter (3.5) alone half of the time. Value of the home is roughly $285,000, I've got about $20,000 worth of equity and interest rate is 4%, PMI is $95/mo. All in payment is $1683, $1708 with the HOA. Utilties and water are around $250/mo, even living alone.  I owned a 1600 SF townhouse before the marriage and it is currently $850/mo all in expenses apart from maintenance, I've got renters in there paying $1300/mo. It's worth about $180K, I've got about $80K in equity. I make $64K/yr but have my phone, insurance, vehicle and my daughter's insurance paid for by my company. I also have expenses of $1020/mo in daycare. I save about $500/mo or about $1000/mo if you include tax refund and annual bonus. $60/wk plus $40 match in 401K, but no other retirement funds.  I'd like to save more, but not sure if it's wise to take the hit of 6% commission plus other fees on the house to sell. 

My questions are, should I move and downsize now that I'm single? Should I move into the townhouse and sell the larger house? Move into a smaller house (I like having the garage and yard TBH)? I always cleaned the entire house before, but it's just exhausting to work 50 hrs/wk, take care of my daughter 4 nights and then maintain the entire house.

He's also been engaged to a woman half his age (just a few years older than me) since a few months after my mom died, and he has no problem hitting me and my siblings, screaming at us, and not allowing us to leave the house for any reason other than to go to school. He's been tracking our phones 24/7 all our lives, and none of us have ever been allowed to go to a friend's house, have a friend over, go to the grocery store, restaurants, etc. unless he's with us. Despite my sister and I being adults, we've never been allowed to work, as part of his plan to keep us financially dependent on him.

I'm currently a biochemistry student attending a university in the midwest, and I'm about 3 semesters off of graduating with my Bachelor's degree. Afterwards, I have plans to go to med school, and I hope to become a surgeon. I have good grades and test scores, and do very well in school. All of this is completely paid for by my dad, as he makes a lot of money, between $600,000 - $1,000,000 per year. 

I have absolutely no work experience whatsoever, as I previously mentioned. However, I am very familiar with computer programming, and have saved up about $10,000 from online freelance work over the last few months (I haven't paid my taxes yet for last year, but I made about $8,000 during the last few months of last year, which is when I started doing this), and plan on making about $30,000-40,000 during the reminder of this year depending on how much I'm able to work. My dad has forced me to work for his business doing a pretty basic data entry job as well as software development for his business for the last 10 months, however, he doesn't pay me at all and I'm not legally employed by him or anything, he just considers it to be a chore for me. I work about 20 hours a week.

This summer, I'm planning on moving to southern California and attending a state university there. My tuition is going to be about $19,000 per year. I haven't yet filled out my FAFSA, which I will do soon, but it really shouldn't matter because I definitely won't get a cent given my dad's income. I should have about $15,000 saved up by then ($1,500 of which is in a mutual fund). I plan on staying in an Airbnb for a month or so to get situated, and then moving in to a studio apartment near my campus. I also plan on buying a cheap, used car to commute to school. I am planning on buying a new phone and just leaving in the middle of the night without telling my dad, and cutting him off completely. 

In terms of my finances, like I said, I should have $15,000 saved up by the time I move (in June of this year). I haven't yet paid my taxes for 2019, during which my income was ~$8,000. My income should increase to roughly $2,500 a month starting in March or so. I'll need to spend about $2,000 to travel to Cali and for my airbnb for the first month, and I'll need to buy a car as well. I also am bringing minimal belongings - just valuables and more expensive clothing items like jackets, shoes, pants, etc. but then leaving the rest behind. My credit score is in the 750s, and I currently have about $15,000 in federal student loans under my name. I think the bulk of my high credit score is due to the fact that I'm an authorized user on one of my dad's cards, though, so my score might drop if he takes me off or closes the account, I think. I just got my own credit card (Chase Freedom card, and they said they calculated my FICO score to be 712, even though it was in the 780s at the time with VantageScore) in December, and I've spent (and paid off) several thousands of dollars on that card since.

My question is, are there any resources that may be available to me when I move? I should be able to get $7,500 per year in federal student loans, but without a cosigner or anything, I don't think I'll be able to get anything else. And for my car, I don't think I'll be able to get a loan for that either, and I'm already unsure of whether or not I'll be able to get just any apartment with my short credit history. I think I might possibly be eligible for MediCal (medicaid program in California) and possibly ~$200 in CalFresh (food stamps in California) at least for this year because of my low 2019 income, but I'll probably stop being eligible next year when I pay more for my taxes this year. Also, I might not be able to because of the $15,000 in cash that I'll have when I apply. I will definitely need to get good health insurance, because I have a severe digestive illness that requires frequent lab tests and constant medication for life, which can be quite expensive, I think. I also have no clue what my options are for med school afterwards - will I even be able to go? Can I get a loan for enough to cover the costs once I finish my bachelor's degree? I can probably get a lab tech job once I graduate that pays around $40-50k per year, but then again, I'm not sure, and I doubt I'll be able to work anywhere near full time while in med school.

In my head I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what I need to do once I get to California, but I'm really going to have to wing a lot of it, I feel like. I would greatly appreciate any advice that anyone has for me going forward. At the moment, my plan is roughly this:

1) Fly to California, stay in an Airbnb that I'll book for a month

2) Buy a cheap, reliable used car

3) Apply for any programs (?) that I might qualify for, including getting health insurance very quickly because I'll need to start seeing doctors soon and will definitely need my medicines ASAP

4) Find an apartment to lease for a year or so, close to my campus

5) Potentially get a job alongside my freelance work to increase my income, although I'm not sure what kind of jobs I'd be able to do with my nonexistent work experience and the fact that I'll be a full time student (as well as needing to study for the MCAT, the standardized admissions test for med school which studying for is basically a part time job)

investing,Millions of Chinese Firms Face Collapse If Banks Don’t Act,"(Bloomberg) -- Brigita, a director at one of China’s largest car dealers, is running out of options. Her firm’s 100 outlets have been closed for about a month because of the coronavirus, cash reserves are dwindling and banks are reluctant to extend deadlines on billions of yuan in debt coming due over the next few months. There are also other creditors to think about.

“If we can’t pay back the bonds, it will be very, very bad,” said Brigita, whose company has 10,000 employees and sells mid- to high-end car brands such as BMWs. She asked that only her first name be used and that her firm not be identified because she isn’t authorized to speak to the press.

With much of China’s economy still idled as authorities try to contain an epidemic that has infected more than 75,000 people, millions of companies across the country are in a race against the clock to stay afloat.

A survey of small- and medium-sized Chinese companies conducted this month showed that a third of respondents only had enough cash to cover fixed expenses for a month, with another third running out within two months. Only 30% of such firms have managed to resume operations due to a complicated local government approval procedure as well as a lack of employees and financing, a government official said at a press conference on Monday.

While China’s government has cut interest rates, ordered banks to boost lending and loosened criteria for companies to restart operations, many of the nation’s private businesses say they’ve been unable to access the funding they need to meet upcoming deadlines for debt and salary payments. Without more financial support or a sudden rebound in China’s economy, some may have to shut for good.

“If China fails to contain the virus in the first quarter, I expect a vast number of small businesses would go under,” said Lv Changshun, an analyst at Beijing Zhonghe Yingtai Management Consultant Co.

Despite accounting for 60% of the economy and 80% of jobs in China, private businesses have long struggled to tap funding to help them expand during booms and survive crises. About two-thirds of the country’s 80 million small businesses, including many mom-and-pop shops, lacked access to loans as of 2018, according to China’s National Institution for Finance &amp; Development.

President Xi Jinping over the weekend pledged a greater focus on reviving the economy, with a more proactive fiscal policy, accelerated construction projects and freer reserves for commercial lenders to unleash more funding.

Support from China’s banking giants in response to the outbreak has so far been piecemeal, mostly earmarked for directly combating the virus. Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s largest lender, has offered relief to about 5% of its small business clients.

In an emailed response to questions from Bloomberg News, ICBC said it has allocated 5.4 billion yuan ($770 million) to help companies fight the virus. “We approve qualified small businesses’ loan applications as soon as they arrive,” the bank said.

As a group, Chinese banks had offered about 794 billion yuan in loans related to the containment effort as of Feb. 20, according to the banking industry association, with foreign lenders such as Citigroup Inc. also lowering rates. To put that into perspective, China’s small businesses typically face interest payments on about 36.9 trillion yuan of loans every quarter.

Stringent requirements and shortlists restrict who can access special loans earmarked by the central bank for virus-related businesses, while local governments and banks have imposed caps on the amounts, according to people familiar with the matter. A debt banker at one of China’s largest brokerages said his firm opened a fast lane to ease debt sales by businesses involved in the containment effort, with borrowers required to prove they will use at least 10% of the proceeds to fight the disease.

That’s of little help to a car dealership. Brigita, whose firm owes money to dozens of banks, said she has so far only reached an agreement with a handful to extend payment deadlines by two months. For now, the company is still paying salaries.

Many of China’s businesses were already grasping for lifelines before the virus hit, pummeled by a trade war and lending crackdown that sent economic growth to a three-decade low last year.

At most risk are the labor-intensive catering and restaurant industries, travel agencies, airlines, hotels and shopping malls, according to Lianhe Rating.

Yang, a property manager of a seven-story mall in Shanghai, says a tenant who runs a 150-room hotel that’s usually busy has called asking for a month’s rent waiver after business dried up. She expects the massage parlor that rents space in the mall is also struggling and is open to extending some help.

A deputy financing director at a small developer in central Anhui province said his firm is even being denied loans under existing credit lines. A drop in sales has hurt the company’s credit profile and a dearth of new projects means there’s no collateral to put up. Without access to credit, the business can survive for about four months, or maybe longer if some payments can be delayed, he said.

Banks are hardly any better off themselves. Many are under-capitalized and on the ropes after two years of record debt defaults. Rating firm S&amp;P Global has estimated that a prolonged emergency could cause the banking system’s bad loan ratio to more than triple to about 6.3%, amounting to an increase of 5.6 trillion yuan.

Wu Hai, owner of Mei KTV, a chain of 100 Karaoke bars across China, took to the nation’s premier outlet of discontent, social media platform WeChat, to voice his despair.

KTV’s bars have been closed by the government because of the virus, choking off its cash flow. The special loans from the authorities will be of little help and no bank will provide a loan without enough collateral and cash flow, he said on his official WeChat account earlier this month.

Wu couldn’t be reached for a direct comment, but on WeChat he gave himself two months before he has to shutter his business.

personalfinance,Volunteer to Add Name to Title of Family Home - New Lender as well - What should I know?,"So, my mom doesn't make a lot of money, but she does manage to pay all of her bills on time.

She wants to refinance the family home (that is far from being paid off mind you), and wants to add me to the title as it will significantly reduce the monthly loan payments. My credit score is good, so the lender agreed to pay. I make more than she does, and want to help her pay for the house.

However, I feel like I'm moving too fast into this, and don't want to sign paperwork without some guidance. This is where I'm hoping you can come in.

1. What should I look out for if I'm adding myself to the title of the house along with my mother?
2. Is there any taxes I should be on the look out for so I don't get screwed?
3. Is owning Corporation a legit lender who won't screw us over?
4. I heard there was a form that would prevent the property tax from rising if a son was being added to the title? (Not sure if I heard this correctly.
5. The total interest percentage is 64.199% for the loan term of 30 years, while the Annual Percentage is 3.625% (not interest). Is the interest rate too high? \[EDIT: DISREGARD THIS. This was cleared up by the lender. 64% is not correct\]

personalfinance,What to do next--Bank of America won't give me my $560 back,"**TL;DR: Bank of America won’t give me my money back. I appealed with more evidence and they refused again. I've already filed a police report (several months late) and I'm trying to get something going on that part. I want to figure out if there's anything else I can do to get at least some of my money back.**

I'm 25M and live in Houston, if that's relevant. I'm single, and for the most part I can survive this blow since I have a support network. I'm very lucky, and the worst thing that will happen is that my efforts to build up my savings account will be delayed by several months, but it's still pretty loathsome, the treatment I've experienced from Bank of America.

It started on October 15, while I was in line at the DMV. I only moved to Texas this past fall, so I was getting new plates and stuff for my car. When it was my turn to pay, my debit card didn’t go through because I had a fraud alert. I checked the transactions, and they all looked normal, so I approved it. I was also panicking because I’d been waiting for like an hour and didn’t want to go through it all over again because of this random alert.

So here’s the thing. Someone had spoofed my card and gone to a Kroger twice on October 13 and spent several hundred dollars of my money. I didn’t notice it because I also shop at Kroger, but I later found out that this happened at a store in League City, which is thirty miles southeast of Houston.

I didn’t notice the fraud until several days later, when I was on a work-related trip with my boss to Taiwan. When I got off the plane and finally had Wi-Fi at the hotel, I got a notification that I was overdrawn and someone had spent $280 of my money at a Kroger in Katy, which is 30 miles *west* of Houston. It was then that I scrolled down and found out about the other Kroger transactions from earlier.

Basically, someone spent $560 of my money at three different Krogers in two suburbs of Houston, both about 55 miles apart from each other, and 30 miles from my house. Thankfully, I had withdrawn some cash for this trip, so I could get by without my boss paying for everything. 

In summary, I had five charges on my debit card, two on October 13 in League City and three on October 22 in Katy, for $560, all at three different Krogers (the thieves went to two different Krogers in Katy and visited one of them twice, and they also visited the one in League City twice). I called Bank of America and got a fraud investigation started.

...

Here’s where I messed up. They suggested I file a police report. But I couldn’t at the time because I was in Taiwan, and by the time I got home, they’d already credited the money back in my account. Since this is the first time I’ve ever had to deal with this, I thought that the bank would keep in contact with me and tell me if they needed any more information. So I never got around to filing the report because they didn’t say anything.

I forgot about the whole thing since nothing else happened for several months. Then, sometime in January, five days before the 90-day time limit for fraud investigations, they told me that they couldn’t confirm the fraud and took my money away. I didn’t notice it until February 4 because, again, I was naïve and didn’t get how these investigations worked and didn’t think this was likely, and I only noticed when I was logged into my bank account doing some budgeting and trying to figure out why I was running out of money so fast.

It’s now February 4 (so three weeks ago). I called Bank of America, and they told me that since the thieves had used my PIN and chip that Kroger refused to consider it a fraudulent charge and didn't or couldn't (I forget which) show them the security footage. I asked if I should file a police report now, and the lady said that that would help. She also told me that if I wanted to appeal the findings that I needed to fax a letter with as many details as possible to their number for that.

So I filed the report. I met with a cop and everything, and I explained all the stuff I’m telling you. The police officer thought the chip and PIN excuse was dumb, and he thought that the thieves probably spoofed my card. The officer wrote up a police report and gave me a slip.

...

Then I wrote the letter. I told BoA about the DMV situation and provided the receipt, along with two pieces of paper—one informing me of my failed transaction and another from a few minutes later informing me of my successful transaction. I gave them a picture of the slip from the Houston police department with the number of my incident report. I included a printout of my plane ticket to Taiwan, and I even took pictures of my passport with the entry stamp showing that I entered Taiwan on the morning of October 23 (so, the evening of October 22 back in Texas).

So anyway, last Friday night I checked the message center online and saw that they’d “resolved” my investigation and now refuse to give me my money back. When I tried calling the fraud number today, there wasn't an option to talk to a representative anymore, so they won’t listen to my case.

I was going to get a copy of the police report and fax that over to them too. According to the police department’s website, I had to write an email requesting it before they’d send it to me by mail within ten days. But I was a dumbass and didn’t realize that I could drive downtown and just get it in person. I guess it’s too late for that now (I still got the report anyway).

The representatives I talked to read my file and told me these were the reasons Bank of America had for not paying me back:

* Kroger says the thieves used my PIN and chip, so that obviously means it was me (except cards can be spoofed, and the police officer I talked to thought that explanation was stupid)

* The five charges at three different Krogers each 30 miles away from my house happened on two different dates, which isn't how most thieves use stolen debit cards (I explained to them that they couldn't drain my account the first two attempts because BoA put a hold on my card for suspicious activity, which I accidentally removed because I was in a hurry at the DMV and didn't check closely enough; I provided the receipts to that).

I explained these two things in my letter, but they still refused my appeal and won’t let me call about the claim again. The transactions on the 13th were suspicious enough that BoA put an alert on my account, and the transactions on the 22nd happened while I wasn’t even in the country! But because of some technicality bullshit with Kroger (if that’s even true), they’re telling me to go fuck myself even though it’s obvious I didn’t spend that money.

...

The first thing I’m going to try to do tomorrow is call the Financial Crimes unit at HPD and ask to talk to a supervisor and then insist on getting an investigator on the case, because the lady at the desk told me they would normally take up to 30 to 60 days to assign someone (it’s only been 20 days so far). An officer at another department suggested this to me, so I figure it’s worth a shot.

It’s not like I think they can catch the guys to do this. It’s because BoA won’t talk to me through the normal channels, but I figure a police officer can force them to open up.

I’m posting here to try to figure out my options and the best next steps. I’m already aware of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, but I only want to take it up with them once I’ve done absolutely everything I can and have an airtight case. I’m hoping that calling HPD and getting them more involved will leave more of a paper trail once I get CFPB involved, which seems like I’ll have to do.

I don’t know if small claims court is a viable option too. I’m certainly open to that, but I really don’t want to escalate until I absolutely know that it’s a good idea. And I’m only 25, so no I don’t have an attorney.

Sadly, I don’t have a Twitter account. I wonder if I should start one and get my friend who has a few thousand followers to retweet it.

personalfinance,Door to door solar scam?,"Recently a sales person visited me and was offering solar at a way lower price than anyone else. I'm saying like 5k net after rebates on a 45k system low.

The crux of the strategy is to use MACRS which is typically only for business use. So it goes something like this:

45k system
They charge you 72k.
So you get to claim the 26% federal tax credit on the 72k.

You get set up as an independent contractor who will be paid 7.5k over a period of years (I guess this coincidences with the MACRS period?).
This is done by you putting up their signs in your yard and letting them use your property for pictures in their ads.
Then you get to depreciate the system using MACRS on the taxes the next few years and make back that difference really quickly.

You get an interest free loan for the difference in what you're charged and cost of system that you pay back.

This was all from his pitch and some quick slides he showed me on the computer.
I'm probably missing some of the details (he didn't give me paperwork ""yet"" to review). He offered to let me talk to previous customers though and do a quote for my particular usage and needed system size.

He also claimed that they're working on patenting this financial strategy (is that even possible?)

personalfinance,refinance before second home purchase?,"hi, i bought my first house about a year ago, $160,000 and i paid 20% down, mortgage 4.25%

now I'm trying to move into another home, looking in the $350,000 to $400,000 range but i'm planning to rent out some of the spare rooms. i plan to do a 5% down, 30 year conventional on this one and keep the first one to rent out.

interest rates have of course dropped a lot in the last year and i have very good credit, it looks like i would be able to get rates around 3.25%

my question is, would it be better to do this before buying my second home? because the second mortgage is a lot of debt, would the extra debt on my credit report make it harder to refinance, or maybe give me worse rates?

but on the other hand, if i refinance before buying the second home, would that possibly affect my rates on my second house? because that one is a lot more expensive, so i'd rather have a lower rate on that one.

or maybe i should wait until after i buy the second home to refinance because i could show more income (leases from tenants in second house)?

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.

The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I get paid every two weeks of each month and my first paycheck of February I realize that I wasn’t getting deducted still. So I thought “maybe 2nd paycheck, federal taxes will kick in.”. Today I look my 2nd paycheck and again I’m not getting deducted federal taxes. 

Is claiming two not enough to get ducted taxes? 

Btw: I get paid $19 an hour social security, Medicare are deducted from my check.

personalfinance,Debt Strategy Advice,"Sorry in advance for the long post, couldn't really come up with a TLDR for the whole situation...

I thought I was doing alright managing debt and having a plan, but after some careful consideration due to an unexpected opportunity, I realized I'm not as ready as I thought.

My wife and I bought a condo just about 3 years ago after we got married and we've been paying the standard mortgage payment + extra (usually $500) to pay down the principle.  Ideally, I'd like to hang onto this place when we're ready to move up because it is in a very high demand area.  That being said, it is in an HOA community, and the margins on rental prices compared to the mortgage+HOA (~$2k) are slim; looking at rental prices right now, I expect that I could net $200-300 per month and still be fully occupied.  Obviously it goes against the ""landlord rules"" of charging 1% of the home value to rent, but that's just not where the market is.  Right now I plan on making the extra payments to get out of the PMI window, which we should be out of in a few months.

We also bought my wife a car last year, and have been pretty aggressively paying it down, 200% payments monthly, but breaking it up into weekly payments to minimize interest.  I'm expecting that to be paid off in a little over a year.

So now for the opportunity, the house next door to my parents is being foreclosed and obviously is on the market for cheap.  My wife and I talked about it, and while we don't love the idea of longer commutes, we also don't hate the idea of moving into a great neighborhood with free dog/eventual babysitting before we NEED to move because of space.  The overpayment on the other loans we have has left us with some, but just under 10% of what we would need for the down payment on this new place.

Interest rate for the mortgage is 3.875% and 3.99% on the auto loan.

The questions I have:
1.  Should i keep overpaying the mortgage on the condo once we get out of the PMI area?  I'm curious if the money would be better spent paying down the mortgage principle or saving for a down payment on a bigger place.
1.a.  if I shouldn't keep overpaying the mortgage, should i go all in on the car payment to pay that down faster instead of saving?
2.  Do the ""landlord rules"" apply specifically to places you're looking only to rent, or is there wiggle room for places you're just hanging on to after it was your own primary residence?  Should I just give up on the idea of renting this place out and starting a real estate portfolio?",finance
personalfinance,Butcher Box Worth It?,"Does anyone use a subscription service for food like butcher box? I had a family member send me a $30 coupon to try it.

personalfinance,Sanity Check: Am I ready for my own apartment?,"I (34) currently live in a major metropolitan area with a high COL and have done so with roommates for the last 6 years in an affordable place that costs me ~$1055 a month including utilities. Gross pay for my normal job is $59,308 with a bi-weekly take home of $1400. However, I adjunct teach two classes per semester and that bumps my gross to $76,140 with a bi-weekly take home of $2070 until the summer kicks in. 

I have used this extra money to pay a significant portion of student loan debt so now all I have left is debt with Fed Loan servicing that is on a Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan (3 years in). Monthly payments for 2020 are increasing to $453.03 a month (up from $363 for 2019). 

This loan bill, coupled with my utilities built into my rent, and my mass transit commute (~$80 a month pre-tax) represents the only bills I currently pay. I have $26,000 in my primary savings account + money I put in a retirement plan through work (5% matched)

I want to get my own place. Have wanted to for years, but have instead buckled down to save and pay my debt. My lease renews this summer and I think I am ready to pursue my own 1BR apartment, but I need a sanity check to see if this is something I am ready for.

The area I am looking to live in has an average monthly rent of $1600-$1850. This does not include utilities or other fees and it's the most I am willing to pay for my own place. However, because of my fluctuating income during the summer months (and two pay periods in January), this cost can take a larger percentage of my income. 

I think I am having pre-game jitters. Can I actually afford this? Am I, financially, ready for this big step?

personalfinance,Question about State-specific W-4 form,"Hi. I don’t know how to find this information out because I think it’s assumed that everyone should just automatically know, but somehow, I don’t. So I’m hoping someone here could help me.

I’m in Connecticut. I’m single. I have two jobs; a full-time salaried job, and a part-time hourly job. I’ve been at the full-time job for 5 years, and I just picked up the second job last March. I must’ve fucked up when I filled out the Federal W-4 form, because NO federal taxes were withheld all year. I did my taxes last month on TurboTax and it turns out that between federal and state taxes, I *owe* about $1,400.

Anyway, I think I figured out the federal W-4, but I’m confused about the State W-4. When filling it out, am I supposed to *only* account for the income from the job to which I am submitting the form, or do I account for the combined income from *both* jobs? 

I am supposed to enter withholding code E if “My expected annual gross income is less than or equal to $15,000 and no withholding is necessary.” **OR** code F if “My expected annual gross income is greater than $15,000.” The former is true if I only account for the income from the part-time job, but the latter is true if I account for the combined income of *both* jobs. I’m not sure which I’m supposed to pick.

Does anyone know?

personalfinance,Sell RSUs to clear student loans?,"Hi all. I have about 22k student loans left with an avg interest rate in the 6% range (cleared all my private loans over the last year which was a serious grind). I just vested RSUs worth a little over 15k. I also get a bonus in April, so if I combine that with my RSUs, I can wipe out my student by the end of April.

I am however in a fortunate situation financially where I will have that loan paid off by the end of august if I hang on to those RSUs and let them continue to grow, which would hopefully be enough for a downpayment by the time I am fully vested.

I'm inclined to hang onto the stock personally, however I am open to hearing this subs opinion on my situation.",finance

By consolidating and refinancing both loans, I would save an additional $1,115 or $19/month. Is it worth consolidating and have a much larger payoff amount to save the extra little bit?

personalfinance,Put more money into savings or pay more on credit cards?,"Hey everyone. So, I have been keeping track of my finances currently and have finally come to a point that I can make a decision with disposable income.

Also, not sure if the correct flair because there were a few that I felt could work for it.

As a bit of background, I have two different credit cards open that I have been making very little progress on because of various circumstances (making minimum payments, using them when my bank account gets low, etc). At the same time, I have been able to get a bit of money into my savings account which currently has a promo interest rate of 1.3% currently (not sure how long until it goes to a normal interest rate, if at all) using the 52-week money challenge (it isn't a lot, but it is a start and this is the second year I have been doing it).

Before now, I haven't really had much extra money in my checking account to where I could do anything with it. With current projections that I have figured out (all estimates), it looks like I will have quite a bit more money after setting the usual amount each paycheck. This is going to be a result of working more hours.

The question that I am facing now is whether I should use the extra money that I will have in my checking account to make more substantial payments on my credit card(s) (probably work on one and then the other once the first one is paid off) or set more aside for savings?

I can see some general pros to each side. Putting the money toward my credit cards would help to lower the monthly payment and allow for more payment toward the principal each time I pay it and it would help to raise my credit score, while putting more money into my savings would help to generate a bit more money each month with the higher interest rate. My thought is to pay more on my credit cards, but wanted to get the opinion of the group as well.",finance

personalfinance,Help appreciated in best way to finance new home purchase.,"Apologies for the long post....

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are under contract to sell our house and but a new more expense one. We are not the most savvy people when it comes to personal finance, and I was hoping to get thoughts on what to do with our new mortgage and down payment. Here is what we are working with...

My wife and I make about 160K a year before taxes. After taxes withheld, benefits, maxing out 401K and contributing to our HSA, we take home about $8K a month. 

We are selling our house for 240K and buying a new one for 400K. Our house that we are selling is under contract at 248K with 8K in closing credits to the buyer. We currently have about 200K left on the mortgage so I figure with 5% for the agents, I should net around $27K from the sale of our house. 

For our new house, we were planning on putting 150K down on the house, and getting a 250K mortgage for the remainder. We picked this amount so our mortgage payment is similar to what we are paying now and estimated monthly payment would be around 1800 a month. Our plan for the down payment is...

27K from the sale of our current house. 

26K or so from cash. Currently we have about 20K in checking and 16K in savings. Figure use this money first leaving a few months of emergency funds for a short while. Thinking keep $10K in checking and savings and start rebuilding asap to get back to 6 months expenses saved up. 

50K I have been saving in a S&amp;P index fund. Since I opened this within the last few years the capital gains should be less than selling securities in my wife's portfolio.

50K or so from my wife's investment portfolio that is currently at 277K that my wife's parents set up for her when she was a kid. We both have little idea why they picked the stocks they did in it other than trying to maximize dividends? Figure all of this would be taxed as capital gains and/or ordinary income so take as little as possible from it. 

When I talked with her dad about our plan, he said it would be a bad idea to sell anything from her portfolio because ""her portfolio yield is 5% and highly likely to continue appreciation. tax bite would be heavy, check her basis and deduct 20% tax. Better to borrow and apply dividends against mortgage payments since she has line of credit against her portfolio since yield is higher than our mortgage rate""

&amp;#x200B;

I under stand that with mortgage rates so low it would be best to borrow as much as possible (unlocked rate I have found is 3.125 and will hopefully lock once we are within 60 days of closing) since our investments are likely to return higher than the 3.125 interest rate on the mortgage. However our fear is that we are having our first kid in the next week or 2, so our future budget is not as clear as it has been in the past and in general am looking to keep debt minimal if possible. With an 1800/mo mortgage payment, we should have plenty of money left over every month to save building back up the emergency fund, and be better situated for hardships like one of us losing a job, unexpected medical bills, house repair, etc.   

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are...

1. Do people think we are being too conservative with a 250K mortgage? Should I be looking to increase this amount with interest rates so low right now?
2. Would we really be saving that much by trying to use a line of credit against her portfolio and then use dividend payments to help pay mortgage and a separate loan against her portfolio as he dad suggested? (currently we reinvest dividends). I figure we would either pay capital gains all up front now, or periodically over many years as we use dividends to help pay loans as needed.  
3. Are we making mountains out of mole hills or is there a much better strategy for financing this new house? 

We were going to make an appointment with a fiduciary financial advisor or a tax advisor since so much in our life is changing in the next few months, but was curious what PF would recommend we do for financing our new home. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.",finance

I am 34 and my wife is 29 and I barely just started my retirement account and she still doesn't have one. I only have $25k in my TSP (I work for Fed govt) and I started it 3 years ago. I know I am behind but not sure how behind for my age on my retirement fund. I make $79k/yr (GS-11) and get my next promotion next month which is $87k/yr (GS-12). Currently, I bring home about $2k every 2 weeks after taxes, retirement contribution which I put in 6% and get max out the matching 5% and health insurance. My wife just moved to the US 3 years ago so she has a degree (int'l relation) from outside the US but is pursuing a 2nd degree while focusing on improving her English which is a large barrier. She makes about $16k/yr (after taxes) part-time since she is in school full-time. Since she doesn't have a full time gig, she doesn't get benefits but she is covered in health insurance. I don't know if I start her a retirement fund with our bank (USAA) and if it would also be tax deductible. I assume I would just contribute more to mine and make it a joint account?

&amp;#x200B;

I also receive about $600 in non-taxable income from VA. In total, we make about $5,600/mo after taxes and have about $3,600/mo in expenses which rent is about $2k for 1 bedroom (Los Angeles). We are saving up for a condo or maybe a house if we can ever afford one in East LA. I think I would be retiring around age 65 so in about 30 years from now. I do get automatic annual step increases for the first 4 years so I expect my income to be $114k + inflation adjustment % by the time I retire if I don't promote to GS-13, $135k if I do.

personalfinance,Refinance Decision Making,"Hello all!

So last year we bought our house for $592,500 (appraised at the same value) with a loan of $562,875 at a 5.75% interest rate. We have recently been working on a refinance to get the interest rate down and have locked a rate of 3.875%. 

We just got the new appraisal report back and the value of the house is listed at $623,000. We have $555,000 of outstanding balance and closing costs for the loan would be about 8k. What we're looking at doing is refinancing at 90% ($560,700) value to reduce PMI premiums in the new loan. When it's all said and done it will take our monthly payment from $3925 to $3525 (including taxes and insurance). 

We, frankly, can afford our current monthly payment of $3925 but we're doing this because there's no reason not to save $400 a month and reduce our interest rate. We will break even on the closing costs short term. My wife and I are both 28 and are not sweating another year for a 30 year mortgage at our age. 

However, if my math is correct, this means we have the option of cashing out about $60,000 and keeping the same monthly payment. The house we bought needs work, including all new windows and doors and the kitchen and a couple bathrooms need a face lift (most of the work of which I can do, and I do mean *need*). The property is 16 acres and our long term plan is to convert it into a farm-share wedding/event venue, and this money would go a long way to plant permanent crops (apple trees, blueberries and brambles), renovate the land and perhaps put a down payment on a barn reception hall. The split would probably be 20k on housing renovations, 20k on farming, 20k on a barn (which, whenever that happens would come with additional debt servicing).

There are also some unknowns in our finances. My wife is changing jobs this summer, but her pay will generally remain static. We have free childcare currently, but when my wife changes jobs we will need to get childcare likely to the tune of about $1200/mo (which is about our current budget surplus). I also have 45k of student loans, of which the minimum payment is $500 on which I'm currently making $800 monthly payments and while it's not something I'm at all banking on, I know there's a non-zero possibility that those evaporate a year from now.

SO. What would you do? Cash out, renovate and make improvements to the property as steps towards opening a business while property values are high or take the conservative approach for the short term, lower my monthly payments to cover my monthly expenses on the horizon? How concerned should I be about going underwater on my house if it's a place I never plan on leaving?

I save about 50% of my monthly income after bills/food/travel/miscellaneous. I'm not married/have no children and I'm unsure of what the next few years have to bring.

I feel like I'm in a good place financially for a young twenty-something year old but I am unsure what to do with my savings. Right now, I'm only contributing 2% to my employer-matched retirement plan and I'm unsure if it's a great idea to max that out right now. I'm considering moving most of my \~$25k of savings into a high yield savings account from my regular brick and mortar savings account.

I've been trying to read advice on what to do with finances, but I'm getting overwhelmed with all the information. Last year, I had a non-existent credit score because I had never used credit before. I took out a car loan at a high interest rate of 6% (cosigned by a parent) and got a secured credit card to build credit. My TransUnion score is up to \~730, but I would like to get it up to 750 to refinance my car loan for a better rate.

I'm planning on probably moving back in with my parents when this lease is up to try to save money while making the next plan about where I want to live (they still plan on charging me $400 for rent).

I'm also unsure if I want to go back to school or not. Currently, my income will remain steady but with very little growth due to the nature of the field I'm in. I could make $100k-$120k if I go to grad school but I'm just not sure if my heart is in it.

Right now, I feel like I should be saving for a house or saving for grad school. BUT I don't feel too excited about spending my time or money on either of those things at this time in my life.

investing,Mkt might not be going down because of why you think it is going down,"TLDR:

**so  for now i will try a long in Asian session. and would short into  strength in EU/US Sessions as long as Fed doesn't change it's mind.**

I'd  like to share some thoughts to help me straighten my thoughts because  this is an extremely difficult juncture. I'll try to be very concise.

Narrative  is focused 100% on a few hundred cases in some in and around Italy, for  most traders that is the beginning but in the context of the broader  implications of COVID19, if it was gonna kill US mkts it would have done  so when Wuhan quarantined 11m productive consumers and locked supply  chain for an unforeseen amount of time. Even the DAX which is extremely  exposed to Wuhan was at an ATH of 13800. instead we had a quick V shaped  dip in the US and even FXI / KWEB recovered (not without the national  team but that's another story)

My  explanation as to what was happening was that as long as bonds kept  rallying so much (TLT) it was fine to keep the equity as the central  bankers had our back and there's nothing that the nasdaq loves more than  lower real rates ($TIP &amp; $GLD)

Suddenly  the actual fed chair, Richard Clarida gave an interview to S.Liesmann  where he essentially told the mkt to back off cuz it ain't happening

he's also sending his homies to relay the same message, ie just now :

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-unclear-right-now-coronavirus-calls-for-rate-change-11582670163](https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-unclear-right-now-coronavirus-calls-for-rate-change-11582670163)

📷

And  see that's a huge problem because even if you take the Nasdaq which is  the best index in the world as far as fundamentals go the valuation  doesn't make sense historically unless u consider &lt; 0 real rate that  we were pricing in. if the guy doesn't cut to where we expect him to cut  (2 cuts) then the real rate is around 50bps and we've never had Spooz  trading at 19x NTM PE with 50bps real rate and gold at 1700 suddenly  makes no sense at all.

So my thinking is that this dude spoiled the one thing which made the mkt not fall on a number of bearish items :

* Extremely strong $ which is negative to earnings for big nasdaq names
* Bank  names holding up way better than they ought to given what the curve was  doing assuming great US consumer (KRE is down 4% today)
* AAPL/SMH universe supply chain disruptions in Wuhan
* Comrade sanders gaining groud was dismissed by mkt participants as having no chance vs the Don

And now it suddenly all came to the forefront, crystallized in this italian pasta flu bullshit.

So  now what's next, i think we can have a V shaped recovery because  Chinamen have done an outstanding work containing the disease and  getting back to work asap + they have spared no effort in liquidity and  fiscal measures to help, unlike the fed here.

At  worst this becomes a more dangerous type of seasonal flu and we get on  on our lives. Nasdaq earnings for one are extremely good  but if the FED  doesn't want to help

But it won't  happen if the fed keeps pushing back against what is priced in the mkt  (&gt;2 cuts by year end)  so yeah, i have so many reasons to buy the  nasdaq here but i think it makes sense to stay prudent because unless  Clarida concedes very soon, it will soon mean that the 2yr rate will  have to get back to &gt;1.5 and it is simply impossible for equities to  rally in front of that.

Also you cannot trade here without differentiating btwn timezones:

One  thing that is certain is that Europeans came on board on the FED  argument, that's why the selling has been so harsh during EZ timezones,  in fact all of yesterday's loss came from them. US Simply managed to  keep it flat and only sold today.

Asian  seems to be the only timezone where you can express some bullishness  and i will be trying to that however there is one issue which is  extremely problematic for the Nikkei (and can pull down all indexes with  it) and that's the Tokyo Olympics, let's just say that a lot of hope  rests on it in Japan and tonight's session will depend on how they  interpret this news item

personalfinance,Pay off remaining car loan balance or continue payments to build credit?,"Hi all,

I bought a 2015 Hyundai Sonata in April 2018. I put down $1,500 and got a car loan of $14k at an APR of 6% for 60 months. Since then, I have made all my payments every month. Come April, I will have 36 months left on the loan to pay off but I have saved up enough money to pay off the remaining loan now if I wanted to.

However, I am wondering if this would be a good opportunity to further build my credit. When I bought the car, I only had a credit card with a $2,700 limit that I've made every payment for about six years. I had a credit score that showed it was in the 760s or just over 800 depending on where I looked, including Credit Karma and my Wells Fargo FICO score. Currently, my credit score is around the same as when I bought the car.

I'm curious on what you guys suggest. I was also thinking of maybe refinancing the loan to lower the interest rate. I'm also looking to increase my credit limit on my credit card as well as applying for a second credit card.

Let me know if you need any questions answered. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Figuring out how to pay off student debt.,"Throw away account.

Good evening. Thank you for taking the time to read this post. I'm hoping to reach out to this community to help me better understand how to pay off my student loans. I have saved up about $20,000 over working the past few years. I would like to use that money to pay towards my loans, but I'm not sure what the best way to go about it is. Below is are my current loans:  


|Principal|Interest Rate|Monthly Payment|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$25,402.25 |6.869% |307.58|
| $11,080.65| 7.362% | 90.36 |
| $26,363.36 |4.4%|310.10|

  
In total I owe  $62,846.26, and pay roughly  708.04  per month in student loans.

The first two loans are both refinanced from the much higher rate they once were, and the third is a combination of federal loans that I don't plan on refinancing as the interest rate is relatively manageable.

When all is said and done, I would still like to have about $10,000 in my savings account. I was told to always have nest egg in case of emergency. Is it worth paying off the highest interest rate all at once? Can I divide it over the course of the next few months in case something comes up and I need money?  


I apologize for any  indistinctness in this post, and can gladly provide any other non-identifying details. I would just like some help figuring out the best way to go about this. Again, thank you for your time.

personalfinance,Construction loan/mortgage shopping,"We are building a home this spring/summer and have narrowed financing down to a local bank and a mortgage broker. The back would be a construction loan which would then become a conventional mortgage (subject to rate changes). The broker offers a construction to perm option, which cuts closing costs by almost half, but will likely have a .25 higher interest rate (locked from the start). All information is from recent sit downs and follow up email exchanges.

Should we be doing a pre-approval process with both places now to get final numbers from them? That makes sense to me.

cybersecurity,Password managers &amp; NIST SP 800-63-3,"Hi community,

 I have fairly recently started an IT SEC role (in Europe) for an american company. 

Question 1) My US counterpart is making noise about NIST SP 800-63-3, as we are a albeit, larger than average, branch office based in the UK, with other regional offices in Europe, do we need to take as much notice as my colleagues in HQ are implying?

Reason being is that my understanding is that only US Federal  (of which we are not), are the only organisations that should. Furthermore, whilst I don't have any issue with these guidelines, I am getting push back from my colleagues and senior management, the latter having the most to say about it - senior management in my company seem to be against it because they believe that what we need in Europe is a password manager. 

So does anyone know for sure if a UK or EU division of a US non federal company need to follow the NIST SP 800-63-3 requirements? Other than the bureaucracy of HQ anyway?

Question 2) I have one c-suite superior - that is a big fan of a well known password manager, the vendor seems to be telling him via marketing or ""in app"" that his information is safe as it's scanned against the ""dark web"". I won't mention the vendor name on here. He seems to have attention of his colleagues and has pretty much influenced the people whom I need to be giving the advice too, that this tool 'more or less' will make them follow the NIST password guidelines as being requested by our colleagues in the USA.

I have looked on have I been p..... and I can't seem to find anything relating to the password manager, which then makes me question where and how they are getting the breach info. The vendor doesn't mention anything about NIST either.

Ultimately, what I don't want to do is get orders from HQ and separately have to support a well known password manager, especially if the PM doesn't help at all with any NIST requirements - if that makes sense. I think we will end up having to follow the HQ anyway, however, I don't want to irritate my local senior management. I have trawled the internet, and wondered if anyone has any perspective to lend. 

Oh and one minor detail. I left my last job due to 12 years of bolitics - is there any sector which is a politics free, as I feel I have jumped from the frying pan and into the fire. It crossed my mind today that maybe IT in politics, would be politics free - hehe :)

Thanks and ANY tips, comments or advice will be GREATLY appreciated.

personalfinance,Should I File for Bankruptcy at 23?,"Okay so, 18 year old me really goofed up and now five years later I am (literally) paying for it. Naturally, it started with a couple credit cards, and then my dumbass bought this car from a car lot I knew I should not have trusted and now I’m here posting on reddit for help because I fucked up. 
So, I got this car, with a warranty, but turns out the warranty didn’t really cover shit and only let me use the dealerships ghetto shop that kept telling me the car was fine. (The car was not fine) I ended up maxing my credit cards out repeatedly fixing this POS and it ended up costing me more to fix every month than the payment. I also signed at high interest because teenagers are stupid, and fast forward five years, I got to the point where I was so upside down in my loan I finally took the car to the credit union and surrendered it. I have been trying to pay down my credit cards but high interest is keeping me from being able to do so. My credit is fucked from medical bills initially, and now it’s about to be more wrecked because they sold the car at auction for $1100, and I owed $9000. So my credit cards aren’t super high but including medical debt and the car, I am $14000 in debt. I make way less than median income for my state and fall well within the means for filing for bankruptcy. Aside from shares I can transfer to my father (if anyone knows how to do this through e*trade i need help with that too lmao), I have no assets, I make $12/hour and I go to school so a second job is not an option.

personalfinance,Help on an old student loan.,"So a bill collector reached out to me this year stating I had outstanding student loans. I disputed them in a certified letter and waited for proof.

They just mailed me back. Seems I must have had a federal student loan from 30 years ago and didn't realize it. I had lots of grants and such but didn't remember a federal loan at all. And nobody in 30 years asked me to pay anything on it. Nothing on my credit nothing. Must be a glitch in the matrix!

So they are saying I owe 

$9,600 Principle

$5,080 interest

$2,741 Collection fees 


Now I don't remember the loan, but I was a party heavy kinda guy 30 years ago.  They validated and sent me one page showing a loan for $3,200 with my signature on it (yes it matches) from 8/28/1990. But nothing else.

What should I be doing. Send them another letter asking where the $9,600 principle comes from when they are only showing one loan for $3,200?

If they only show me a signed loan agreement for $3,200 is that what I have to pay, not the $9,600 they are saying I honestly didn't even know about the $3,200 so the $9,600 could very much be a mistake on their part. Are they required to show me loan agreements signed?

If the $3,200 is valid, I have to try to find any banking statements to see if this is something I paid somehow already. What can I ask them to do to get it off my records? Say I will pay the $3,200 and the interest and wave the collection fees for a one time lump payment?  I guess same goes with if they can show me the loans for $9,600. What can they take off for a up front payment. I know fed loans they can't probably wipe away interest or touch the principle in negotiating.",finance

personalfinance,Synchrony Bank / Paypal - Closed Account without warning?,"Hi all,

First time poster here and looking for the best way to get this resolved with the least impact on my credit card.

I opened my account with the PayPal credit card a couple months ago. The first bill was due on 2/17/20. I received a notification to pay the bill about 2 and half weeks prior to the due date, no sweat. When I tried to pay my first bill, my bank rejected the payment with no message. I thought it was a mistake, so I tried paying again knowing that I had plenty of funds to cover it. A few days go by, and again my bank declined the payment. I called up my bank, and in the next couple of days got the STOP hold on all PayPal transactions removed (this was from a dispute with PayPal about 6 months prior). 

So a week before my bill is due, I sent the payment and everything went through; no errors, no emails about cancelling my account, things are looking up. Fast forward to today, and I tried to pay my bill due on 3/17 and it says my account is closed. I went to live chat to ask about it and they originally said it’s because I had a delayed payment - which was not true. Once I pointed that out, the agent said that after two rejected payments the account gets closed.

I’m trying to figure out what my best course of action is so my credit doesn’t get f***ed. They also let me know that since the account closed I forfeit all my rewards, go figure. Submitted a complaint on their website and hoping to hear back; if not, I guess the BBB? I’m not sure what’s next",finance

In current living situation (2 roommates) until end of August, when my fiancé  and I will move in with each other. 

My fiancé would like to get her masters degree (which would cost around $20k-$30k) and get a gig as a school counselor, which in our area would raise her income to \~$50k.

We would also like to buy a house for us to move into in Sept when we get married. A decent house in our market in an area we would like to live would almost certainly cost at least $190k, probably more like $200k-$215k.

Fiance has \~$23k saved up which she hopes to reach \~$30k by our wedding, which her parents are graciously (mostly) paying for. She currently lives at home which helps. Her current income is \~$42k between her FT job and a couple PT jobs. She has \~$20k in debt between her car and student loans. I unfortunately do not have savings that amount to much.

A job change in 3Q19 brought my salary to (now) $61,200 + \~10% annual bonus. This equates to a little over $1,700/biweekly after taxes/health insurance/401k contribution (allocating 6%, which employer matches 100%)

So I have a few questions:

1. What would be the best utilization of my fiance's savings?
   1. Use as a down-payment on a house to try and lower our monthly mortgage payment?
   2. Put towards her schooling as to not take on additional debt?
   3. Use to pay down Current debt with highest interest rates?
2. On my parent-plus loans, my father currently makes monthly payments (minimum) and I reimburse him monthly. I do have access to the account which I can (and do occasionally) make additional payments towards.
   1. Would it be a good idea to use a company such as Sofi to consolidate these loans (\~$22k) at a  lower interest rate? The loans would then be my full responsibility but interest savings seem like it might be worth it. 
3. Is purchasing a house at this time a financially sound idea? We do not want to get into a situation where we would be in over our heads trying to keep up with our mortgage and other costs associated with owning a home. 
4. Really would like a general idea of how to attack the above.

personalfinance,"Selling our home, 50k increase...","Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

We live in a super crazy housing market (small city, big college) and we were able to purchase our own home, an 840 sq foot 3 bedrooms townhouse. We are rapidly outgrowing (gained several kids since then) and want to purchase a bigger home or rent a bigger house.

Our realtor thinks that conservatively she can get about 50k above what we paid (we had a motivated seller and bought just before the market shot up...we would not be able to buy where we are now on the same budget at all). 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is...we have about 40,000 in student loans.

&amp;#x200B;

The debt free part of me wants to take the profit from selling the home and pay off our student loans and start over renting. But renting is significantly more than our mortgage (think- we pay 1000 a month, the townhouses connected to us are renting for 1800...) and in order to rent we would need to move out of the small city.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband things we should spend the profit from the house (presumed around 50k) into a better house and continue to ride this market wave. Maybe if we get in somewhere nicer for the 50k, we'll be able to sell that for even more in a few years? and if not, we'd still have a house that doesn't feel like a game of tetris.

&amp;#x200B;

So- buy? pay off student debt (all federal and 3% or less interest)? Combo? Stay where we are? Rent our house out while renting another?",finance

I grew up living below the poverty line as my parents did not make a lot of money so this is the first time I've experienced having this much money and I want to be able to save and invest right so that I don't continue the cycle of poverty. Because of that fear, I researched a lot prior to graduating college on financial steps I have to take and I want to know if I am doing the right thing.

I am a new college graduate and live in NYC. My salary is 94k a year and make roughly 4.7k after tax and deductions for insurance. I am lucky enough to not have to pay rent because I live with my parents but I do give my parents $200 a month to contribute to some expenses.

I have a savings account with about 6.4k in it for emergencies and future travel plans.

I do the minimum match of 6% to my 403b as my employers will match that after one year of employment. My employer offers TIAA and through it I've invested into the Vanguard Target retirement fund 2065. I didn't want to invest in a Roth IRA until I pay my student loans down. 

I have two student loan debt:

29.5k with earnest @ 4.18%. Minimum payment: $563.10 per month

29.7k with federal loan @ 4.38%. Minimum payment: $236.65 per month

No CC debt because I pay it all off every month.

Currently my plan since graduation has been to pay my student loans within 3 years. I have been throwing 4k a month at my federal loans debt while paying minimum at my earnest loans as that has a lower interest.

I've been prioritized paying down my student loans vs investing more into retirement. However I've been wondering if I should pay less and invest more into retirement.

Due to financial difficulty and situations which have left me with minimal choice, I have had to take out several Payday loans.

Recently, I started a new job with better pay, that currently means I am financially better off. Currently, I am paying £300-400 a month (Each one is about £80-100 a month) for all of the loans collectively. My credit score is shocking (because I am taking these loans out).

Paying off a few of the loans in full will leave me a little bit short for the month (although I am being paid more than normal this month), but will ultimately lighten the load for loan re-payments.

Should I pay off my loans normally by Direct Debit? Or should I pay a few off in full and keep up payments with the remainder?

Edit: The total loan balance is somewhere above £4000. The highest interest rate is something like 1333% (absurd, I know, but I was desperate) and the lowest I think is below 100%. I should also mention that I have recently paid off a credit card, and am about £1500 into another.

Using Turbotax doesn't help. Turbotax has a ""Calculating the Overpayment or Amount Due from Your Amended Return"" section. While it did calculate overpayment correctly, this part doesn't print out. The print-out version omits overpayment.",finance

personalfinance,Pay off a car loan or work on emergency fund?,"My wife and I are at a point where the Dave Ramsey method and the /r/personalfinance flowchart diverge, and I'm not sure which would be smarter.

We bring home about $7800/month after taxes. Our mortgage (with taxes and insurance) is about $2k/month. We did the debt snowball and got rid of the high-interest stuff (student loan, credit cards), but we still have about $20k on a car loan at 4% interest. We've been terrible at budgeting, but are starting over in March with YNAB, but I already know our expenses--especially restaurants and eating out instead of cooking at home--are way too high. Our savings rate, excluding retirement, has been basically zero. What we have is profit from selling our old house.

The car note is $465. We have about $17k in savings. My wife is a teacher, so she's got very good retirement options and she's contributing to them, but my work just got a 401k and only matches 1%, so I'm only contributing 1% to get the match while we're working on the basics.

My question is this: given the decent interest rate on the car loan, should we focus on paying it off and freeing up the $465 a month for savings, or do we just try to cut expenses and save up the rest of the emergency fund while paying the car note? The car won't be paid off until early 2024 if we stick to the 60-month schedule. And no, we're never taking on debt to buy a car again. 

Dave Ramsey says pay off the car, the flowchart says save, but I'm not sure which is better in our situation.",finance
personalfinance,Action Plan for Catching Up?,"I'm sure this has been gone over plenty, but was hoping for some insight on our specific situation. Thanks in advance for your wisdom!

Me (33) and my partner (31) have just married our finances and are realizing we have to play some very serious and very urgent catch-up in order to reach our goals (or even put a single foot on the right path to reach our goals).

Here's the basics:

\-He makes around 67K (pre-tax) working a full-time job. I have 3 part-time jobs (no benefits) but manage to pull in around 55K (pre-tax) between the 3. I just finished a graduate program, so this income level is fairly new for me, but I expect it to continue (god willing).

\-We both have good credit (730 for him and 775 for me)

\-We have no credit card debt, but we do have:  


His personal loan from grad school (15K @ 10.9%)

My private student loans (15K averaging 6%)

One car loan (14K @ 5.95)

One loan from a friend (3K @ 0%)

I also have about 150K in federal student loan debt, but I do income-based repayment on that and don't ever expect it will get paid off. Forgiveness is much more likely, so I don't really consider this loan while making decisions on how to map our future.  


\-We have very little retirement between us. He has some token amount (maybe 6K) but does not have matching employer contributions. He currently puts away $100/month in his 401K. I have no retirement accounts at all.

\-We currently rent, but would like to own a home in the future. We would like to save up the full 20 percent if we decide to purchase. Note: the mortgage will be in his name, because my federal student loan debt would make it much harder for us to get a loan/good interest rate.

\-Possible helpful information: We plan to file our taxes separately because of my student loan debt. Filing jointly would up my income-based repayments and I'd rather put that money towards a debt we can actually pay off. So we don't be getting any tax benefits of marriage.

How would you approach this situation? Are we screwed? Should we save first, or aggressively pay down debt first? Should we forgo saving for retirement/opening an IRA to pay down debt, or should we start planning for retirement ASAP even if it means extending the life of our debt?

\*EDIT/FORGOT TO MENTION\* The first thing we did was create a $1000 emergency fund. I know they say you should have 3-6 months of expenses saved up. Should we bolster our emergency fund or pay debt first? Or do both simultaneously?

We try to live below our means, but we could certainly trim the budget even more and live more frugally. The problem is that we have time-sensitive goals (a house, and children) and feel like our time is running out. I wish I would have done some things in my 20s differently, but graduating into the recession and generic excuse and blah blah blah...hindsight is 20/20.",finance

personalfinance,Negative equity on a Vehicle,"Hi everyone, 

Apologies for the formatting, I’m on my phone and I don’t know how it works. Also this is in Wisconsin.

Here’s the situation, and at the very least I hope this is a reminder for people to not live outside your means. 

Long story short, I had to immediately move my family into a new building due to a domestic situation with my mother in law and safety for my children. 

My rent has doubled, and I’ve also taken on more utilities (mother in law and I were splitting the bills previously). I have 2 vehicles. One is completely paid off, and the other I bought very spontaneously during a time of mental instability in my life about 2 years ago and the car payment is $500 a month. I need to get this $500 payment off my monthly bills in order to survive. The dealership has offered my $14k to buy it from me and I owe $22k on it. If it matters I did get gap coverage and some key replacement nonsense when I was wrapping up the financing. 

I’m insanely aware of how financially irresponsible this is going to be, but in the long term I think it will be best for my family. My thought is to use my federal refund of $5600, and my savings of $1200 and apply that to the negative equity. Problem is that leaves me with an outstanding balance of about $1200 and they don’t take payments. I need to have all the money to pay off the equity. If I can get this car payment off of my monthly bills I can resume living normally, and even begin saving for a home down payment. 

Does anyone have any ideas? I did apply for a personal loan but I’m still waiting on approval. 

Please don’t live outside your means, or assume you’ll always have stability. I made that mistake and now I’m paying dearly for it.",finance
worldpolitics,Trump has to be force-fed - like a toddler,"""We made the ice cream more difficult to reach, we mixed cauliflower into the mashed potatoes,"" said his former personal physician Ronny Jackson.

According to media reports, both Trump and First Lady Melania are said not to have eaten any vegetables or any vegetarian menu that was offered to them in India.

In January 2019, Trump hosted the Clemson Tigers football players shortly after their success in the college championship final. The US President had - somewhat surprisingly - served fast food and commented this with the words: ""We have pizza, we have 300 hamburgers, many, many fries, all of our favorite dishes."" He spoke of ""great"" American food. ""If it's American, I like it.""

Instead of being a role model and eating healthier, it promotes the risk of the common disease obesity!

The unnecessary kilos favor chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure, they promote gallstones and disorders of the fat metabolism, strain bones and joints. Very overweight people usually die eight to ten years earlier than normal people. The danger comes gradually, 15 kilograms more mean a 15 percent higher risk of death.

Well, Trump will die sooner. The bad thing, compared to others, he can afford to be financially healthy, while others have to look after themselves because Trump cuts health care funds.

personalfinance,Help me with my Future Career/Financial Planning Please!,"Hello all. I need some future career/financial planning advice:

* I work in Canada in a defined pension fund as a payroll analyst. Think bookkeeper but for payroll. I'm 30 and I enjoy my job and the work environment for the most part. It's close to home, great social environment, benefits etc.
* I'm PCP certified making $68,000 a year with a bonus each year ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 based on my performance &amp; the companies profits. If the company is profitable, 2% raise each year guaranteed. Looking historically at the F/S, that's a guaranteed thing.
* I'm studying my CPM for payroll which the average jobs pay $75k to $120k. My boss with the CPM makes roughly $90,000 and a bonus of 15-25k yearly. He's about 45 years old and ""okay"" at his job. I tend to take charge in a lot of areas that he should, which is the only thing in my job that bothers me. Also his bosses boss has told me I am management material one day, which is my ultimate goal because I would get paid more and payoff debts.
* My student debt is $70,000 and I only pay interest $240 a month due to a grace period. When I finish my CPM this year, I get a 2 year grace period before I need start paying principle.
* I also have $22,000 in credit card debt. Interest is low at about $230 a month. This debt was from when I got sick I couldn't work for about a year. Sucks but it was the only option I had. (I got my bonus this week and will be closer to $18k...frigging taxes. (I cannot consolidate this I've tried.)

I have a couple of thoughts as to what I want to do but can't decide what is best: When I finish my CPM end of this year, I need to wait 6 months as the company is paying for my classes. I think I'll stay the remaining 6 months and get the next bonus. So realistically, 2 more bonuses at around $4,500 each that will go straight to the credit card. Leaves about $9,000 balance left. I've also budgeted a few things and I think I can get it lower to $5,000 and I can also get the current 10% interest rate lower once the CC reaches below a balance of $10,000 according to RBC.

**At this 2 year point is where I need help with my options.**

**1)  I can stay with the company.** If I stay, it could take 15-20 years before my manager retires and I take his job and I would assume I'd make the same earnings again assuming I'm promoted. That might make it slow on repaying my debt. But if I stayed for 30-40 years, my pension in retirement would be about $65-75,000 a year until I die (before taxes). Which is a good range for me.

**2)**  **Job hunt in 2 years.**  Most CPM positions in the market easily pay $20-30k higher, which would help pay off debt faster. I'd risk not having a company with such amazing retirement benefits. I could keep the benefit amount or transfer it to an RRSP/whatever and truck along that way.

**3)**  **Same as Option 2 above BUT**, I withdraw from the benefit fund and pay off all my credit card debt and as much principle as possible. Rough calculations are around $15-20k payout after taxes optimistically. And with the new job, contribute to a new plan while paying off the remaining student debt.

**4) I could just relax** for the next 2 years and decide then based on opportunities as they come but I'm a planner and like to know what I'm doing in the next 3-5 years.

I know there are a lot of variables. I'm single, live alone and that could change. I don't plan on going on vacations due to the cost so staycations are my thing. I'd love to go somewhere since It's been 8 years since i've done anything.

personalfinance,Traditional IRA contribution worth it if I plan on being over Roth IRA contribution limit?,"Hello all,

This is a 2-part question. My initial question has to do with taxes:

Tax numbers:

W-2 Wages: 13101

1099-INT: 200

1099-MISC: 9770

Federal Taxes Paid: \~1450

TurboTax says I OWE \~1000. Is this correct, due to the 1099-MISC income making me pay self-employment taxes, etc.?

&amp;#x200B;

The next question has to do with IRA contribution. Originally, I was planning on contributing $6000 to a Roth IRA for 2019. However, I could contribute $6000 to a traditional IRA for 2019, and take the deduction. I plugged this into turbo tax, and it brought my OWED taxes down to about \~300-400. Obviously, this is beneficial. However, I plan on being over the Roth IRA income limits in the future, and I would need to do the backdoor Roth. I know that having this $6000 in a traditional IRA later will affect me when doing the backdoor Roth, but by how much? Right now if I take the deduction, it saves me \~$600 in taxes. But down the road when I do a backdoor Roth, the $6000 would be taxed at a higher % because I would be in a higher tax bracket. So it would save me $600 now, but possibly cost me more later on down the road when I go to do the backdoor.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Is it worth it to contribute to a traditional IRA for 2019 and take the deduction, when I plan on being over the Roth IRA contribution limit in the future, needing to do a backdoor Roth? Or should I just contribute to a Roth IRA now, since I plan on needing to do a backdoor Roth in the future? For 2020, I am unable to take the deduction for a traditional IRA, so the traditional IRA contribution would only be in 2019.

Sometime in early 2019, my original loan provider sold off the loan to a company called Freedom Mortgage, so since then I've been remitting my payments to them.

I received two 1098 (mortgage interest) forms for 2019: one from the original loan provider, and one from Freedom Mortgage.

I paid $599 in interest to the original loan provider, but the form they sent me has blank fields for everything else -- e.g. where it says ""outstanding mortgage principal,"" it is blank. Points paid is blank (even though, from looking at the copy of my closing disclosure from Dec 2018, it shows that I paid 77 points at closing, so I'm assuming I should list the 77 points since I never claimed them for my 2019 tax returns?).

The other form I received from Freedom Mortgage has full details for everything and all the boxes are filled in... but Turbo Tax will NOT let me submit my federal taxes until I fill in the ""outstanding mortgage principal"" for the original loan. It tells me to ""check my January 2019 mortgage statement"" if it's not included on the 1098 form -- but I do not have the mortgage statement from January, and since I no longer deal with the same mortgage company, I don't have online access to pull the statement, either.

I'm worried that there is a small but non-zero chance that there will be major student loan reform in the coming years.  My question is can my father-in-law still give us the loan but the loan still be considered a student loan in case there is reform?",finance

personalfinance,Setting up a scholarship - questions,"Hello all -

We had a friend who passed away a few years ago, and we decided to start a scholarship in his honor that is awarded to a student at our old high school. We have all of the basics set up - website, application, promotion, etc. - and we've received a significant amount of donations, a number large enough to pay the scholarship for at least another 10 years. We currently have this money in a low interest bearing account (&lt;1%), and we simply write a check to the winning student each year.

I'm trying to determine if there's something better to do with this sum of money, preferably so that we're earning a better interest rate on it to help with the continued funding of it, and what the tax implications of that interest income are. I'm assuming this interest income would be taxable, but we're having trouble figuring out what those obligations are. We'd also really like to avoid paying an outside company to do this for a number of reasons. 

Anyone have any experience with this, or know where I can find some information on how the finances work for this? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Question Regarding Closure of Secured Credit Card vs. Reducing Limit,"Last February I turned 18, and in June when I graduated high school, I went to Navy Federal and opened a secured credit card with a $2,000 limit. In September I opened an Apple Credit Card with a $1,000 limit. I pay each card off in full every month and have never missed a payment but because my utilization was so high I decided to open a third card just so that my utilization wouldn’t be so high. My 3rd card is a Navy Federal card with a $13,500 limit. Obviously I will never use that much credit but it helps to keep my utilization under 30%

So now that I have a $13,500 limit card, I want to be able to get my $2,000 deposit back for my original card. Navy Federal says that I can’t switch the card to a regular credit card and get the deposit back, but I can lower my limit to as low as $200 and get back $1,800. 

I’m not sure what will affect my credit more, lowering my limit, or cancelling the card all together. Can anyone help/give some insight?",finance

personalfinance,"refinance question again, apologies","Hello!  I am watching mortgage/refinance rates fall with the market and am considering refinancing my home, but want to make sure I go about this the smartest way.  Here are the facts:

\*  Single family home as primary residence located in Los Angeles, CA

\*  Estimated Home Value: $735,000 (per appraisal report dated July 31, 2019)

\*  Current Lender/Servicer: Ally Bank (refinanced August 2019)

\*  Current Outstanding Loan Principal: $487,000

\*  Current Interest Rate: 3.875%

\*  Current Monthly Payments: $3159.00 (including property taxes/insurance)

\*  Credit Score: 800+ (two employed, married co-borrowers)

We purchased the home in June 2018, but with a lender we were forced to use as a condition on buying the home from the selling realtor.  We refinanced with Ally Bank last summer.  One ""perk"" that helped us decide to go with Ally, in addition to their competitive rates, was their courtesy float-down rate adjustment for jumbo loans, whereby if rates fall more than .25% of your current rate, you can call Ally Home Loans and they will automatically adjust your rate downwards for you at no cost to you.  Today, when I called Ally Home Loans to inquire about the current rate, expecting to be able to take advantage of this offer, I was told that their current rate is 3.99%, actually *higher* than my rate.  Now, I realize, the rate they are offering for comparison is not what's advertised as a new home loan or refinancing rate, it's some other internal rate that is clearly not as tied to market performance.  As such, this ""perk"" isn't really much of a perk at all.

Alternatively, I started searching refinance rates online.  With my current info, Ally offers:

\*  3.00% with roughly $10,200 in points/fees

\*  3.125% with roughly $6000 in points/fees

\*  3.250 % with roughly $2500 in fees

I also checked Better.com and found:

\*  3.00% with roughly $6300 in points/fees  
\*  3.125% with roughly $2100 in points/fees  
\*  3.250 % with roughly ($1300) in points/fees  


My questions are:

\*  If I continue with Ally, I imagine my refinancing process will be much streamlined as I am an existing customer and there may be a little discount or some fees they can knock off.  Is this worth not starting over with another lender?

\*  If I do not currently have a relationship with a local bank or credit union, is it worth it to reach out to them to check their rates?  All of my banking is performed with Ally or another major national bank.",finance

personalfinance,Saving instead of paying down rental property?,"25M Canadian: I currently have a rental property at a 2.5% interest rate amortized for 25 yrs, I owe about 100k on it as I had foolishly paid down the principle every year not knowing the interest is tax deductible.

I am currently planning on buy a second rental and would be taking out another mortgage for about 400k, but letting it ride out for the full amortization.

The thing is I still want to set aside the money to pay it off in 5-6 years and should anything happen to my job (not much job security) I would just throw the lump sum down at the end of the term and not have to deal with paying off two mortgages and could even just live off the rental income (roughly 4.5k) while I try to find a different job.

Because of this, I'm a bit weary in investing the amount into the market (I would roughly be setting aside $96k/yr) where would be the best place for me to invest this? I was thinking a GIC (equivalent of a CD in the states) or a HISA but I'm also worried about the CDIC (equivalent of FDIC in the states but only protects $100k) do I really need to open up 5 accounts to have CDIC protection?

personalfinance,2018-2019 Excess Roth IRA Contributions,"Hi!

Yes I'm an idiot. I set up a Roth IRA back in like 2016, set up automatic payments. Eventually I just kind of forgot about the income limit, and in 2018 I was promoted and my income surpassed the Roth IRA income contribution limit (first world problems). I didn't realize this, so I contributed the max (5.5k in 2018, 6k in 2019). I have stopped the automatic deposits now (Feb 2020)

I messaged Vanguard for some suggestions, I think i understand what I need to do with the 2019 contributions. I have till Apr 15, and I can open a Traditional IRA (I don't yet have one, anywhere), recharacterize the 2019 contributions into the Traditional IRA, then I can still convert (backdoor?) that to the Roth IRA. What I don't know is what I'll need to put on my 2019 taxes in relation to taking those actions. (I also contributed 500 in Jan 2020 towards the 2020 tax year but I can probably deal with that also with recharacterization -&gt; conversion)

But I'm pretty confused about what to do about the 2018 contributions, given that those tax deadlines have long passed. Vanguard did have some pointers for me, and I'm still messaging them, but I'm posting here so maybe someone can lay it out for me in layman's terms.

Here's what I heard from Vanguard in our initial message:

&gt;Excess removal of a 2018 contribution &gt;&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Although we are not able to advise you on whether or not you should remove an excess IRA contribution, we can inform you of your options. To avoid a 6% federal penalty, you must remove the excess contribution by the correction deadline which is generally your tax-filing deadline. Generally, if you have already filed your tax return or filed for an extension by the deadline, the IRS allows you an automatic six-month extension for removing an excess contribution, typically ending on October 15. However, you must file an amended tax return.  
&gt;  
&gt;Your options for correcting an excess contribution are:  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Remove the excess and any attributable earnings before the deadline. You will not be subject to the 6% penalty.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Remove the excess after the deadline. You cannot remove the attributable earnings after the deadline has passed. You will be subject to a 6% penalty tax on the amount of any excess each year it remains in your account. If you have contributed to both a Roth and a traditional IRA, IRS regulations require you to remove the excess from your Roth IRA first.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Leave the excess amount along with any earnings in the IRA and apply it to a later year. Vanguard will not change any account records or report any additional information to the IRS. There is no need to notify Vanguard you are selecting this option as you will be responsible for reporting the information to the IRS. You will be subject to the 6% penalty on the excess amount for each year that it remains in the IRA as an excess contribution.

Now, presumably the deadline they're referring to here is 4/15/2019 as the tax deadline for the 2018 year. Since that's long gone, I assume I can rule out option 1.

If that leaves me with options 2 &amp; 3, does that mean I'll be paying a 6% penalty every year for the rest of my life? Option 2 says I can't remove attributable earnings and just have to leave it in there and deal with it. Option 3 I'm a little unclear on. How can I apply it to a later year? If I apply it to a later year, do I no longer have to pay the 6% penalty? where do I report to the IRS that I'm applying it to a later year. Can I apply it to a later year (say 2020), if my income is still above the Roth limit that year?",finance

We're looking at buying a home thru the Good Neighbor HUD Home program. We've already toured the house and are ok with the few improvements that are needed (that we can see) and just are unsure about the process or anything we should be asking.

I've met with a broker and am getting pre-approved (100% no issues) tomorrow but have been unclear as to if I can shop around for rates with this program. When I spoke to the authorized broker, they made it sound as if what they offer is the only option I have with this program.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

We have excellent credit with each of us around 770ish. We've got zero debt.

The home we're looking at is around $300k but our mortgage would be half of that under this program.  Our income (around $135k-160k but only recently that high) easily qualifies us for half of the mortgage we'd actually be paying on and even at $300k we'd get approved.

Questions:

1. Can we shop around for interest rates or with our great credit will the broker be able to give us market rates
2. Anything we need to know about or ask during this process?

&amp;#x200B;

As far as issues with the house, as long as it's what we can see, we're able to get those things fixed by people we know for honest rates and have no issue with having a 'fixer upper' since it's really just flooring, drywall and a few minor things that need fixed",finance
personalfinance,Second opinion on townhouse under contract,"**Tl;dr**: Need a sanity check on if 37% of my take home pay to go towards a mortgage too much

**Background info:** I'm in my late 20s, have been working in my industry 5 years, and I make $120,000 a year; my take home pay is $5700/mo. Currently have \~45,000 saved. I have no student debt, car, or credit card debt. I don't foresee leaving my city in the next 5-10 years. 

Until this past week, I've been on the house hunt to find a nice first home purchase for my next phase in life and to build equity. The other intention is for my SO to move in with me so that we can live together for the first time after dating a few years. The mortgage would be under my name and my SO would contribute a portion as ""rent"". He currently owns his own townhouse (too far from my work to move-in with him) and will be renting it out.

Even though, we've been together a hot minute now, I'm a cautious person, and understand that relationships may change, so I've been house hunting with the default mindset that I would be the sole person paying for the property.

I currently have a townhouse under contract. It is 40min from my work in the city, which is the maximum I'm willing to commute. I'd also be able to drive 10min to a metro station and can take a 30min train into the city (appealing for rainy day traffic). My SO and I are mostly homebodies, but go to this area often on the weekends for eating out. The school districts nearby are good too so that would cover kids in the future.

P&amp;I: \~$1400/mo (3.375% interest rate)  
Mortgage insurance: $132  
Home insurance: $80  
Home warranty: $50  
Property tax: $350/mo  
HOA: $200/mo

**Total monthly home expense:** **$2121**  
$2121 / $5700 monthly income = **37%** (I believe this is called [front-end DTI](https://www.thebalance.com/what-debt-to-income-ratio-do-you-need-for-a-mortgage-4771883) ?)

Estimate closing costs: $7682

My other monthly expenses, utilities, retirement: \~$1350

**Total monthly expenses:** $2121 + $1350 = **$3475**   
$3475 / $5700 monthly income = **61%**  with \~$2200 left over

I close end of next month. I'm excited for this next big ""adulting"" step in my life but also anxious about such a big financial decision. I'd love to hear what my fellow redditors feel on if I can healthily afford this property or would I be stretched thin and rethink a cheaper home.

personalfinance,Advice on approaching credit card debt,"Hi all, would greatly appreciate any advice I could get on the best way to get out of this spot and on a better road! A few years ago, my wife decided to switch occupations and went back to school. Suddenly her income (the lion's share of our household $) disappeared, and since she was living out of state, we had another rent payment on top of our existing mortgage, two sets of utilities, two separate meal plans, etc. Even with student loans, we were spending way more each month than I was bringing in. It got pretty stressful trying to keep tabs on our finances, so I opted for ignorant bliss. Rather than using credit cards to accrue points and paying off their balances every month, we were using credit cards like cash and their balances kept climbing.  


Now, her degree is completed, she's back at home, and working in her new field. I'd like to get our finances in order again. Them credit card balances, however, aren't going anywhere. I'm hoping you might be able to provide some guidance on what might be the best approach for us to take.  


Currently we owe \~$20,200 on 4 credit cards whose limits total $38,300 (53%). Individually, our balance/credit limit on each card is $9,605/$16,500 (59%), $7,800/$15,500 (50%), $2,800/$4,800 (59%), and $0/$1,500 (0%). I will be getting around $4,000 in tax refunds, which I'm planning to apply towards these balances. Then, I'd like to get some type of loan to consolidate this credit card debt.  
I'm concerned that the fact our credit utilization is so high, will hurt our ability to get a loan with a solid interest rate. Currently, my credit score is 722. Ideally, by using the tax return to lower balances on the credit cards, I'd be able to bump my score a bit before applying for a loan. Would I be better served applying the $ towards any card in particular? I know they look at the ratio of individual accounts in addition cumulative credit utilization--would my score rise more if I applied it to the card with the lower credit limit (thereby getting its balance below 30% of its limit)?  
Anyways, my thought is to pay down the debt with the tax refund, wait a month or two for credit scores to reflect new balances/rise a bit, then apply for some type of loan. I don't have much experience regarding what options are out there, and, as of now am thinking of doing a cash-out refinance with our mortgage. I'm under the impression this would be an option to get \~$20k to eliminate the credit card balances, but, to be honest, I don't know anything about this stuff. Currently, we are 4.5 years into our 30 year mortgage, and owe $180,000 of the original $203,000. We have never refinanced. Our rate is 4.25% and I think if we were to originate the same loan today, we would get a rate of \~3.75-4.00%. I guess, what I'm thinking/hoping is I could refinance back to the original loan amount at a similar interest rate, and end up with \~$23k in hand to eliminate the credit card debt. The downside would be that we'd be essentially restarting our mortgage, with the upside of having no credit card balances. Then, ideally, we could use the \~$650/month that was going to credit cards as an additional payment towards the mortgage's principal. Does it sound like my understanding is accurate? Or, am I  off base somewhere?  Does this sound like a good way to approach our situation? Or, is there another type of loan we should consider? Any insight you could provide would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,I need career advice,"Greetings Redditors, I am on mobile so please forgive any formatting errors. So here is my situation:
I live in a cheap, rural state. I’ve been offered a job at two separate companies. Company A has offered me a starting base salary at roughly $38k yearly, with an added ~$10k yearly in overtime/ holiday pay. After 4 years, this will automatically rise to $54k yearly base salary plus the aforementioned ~$10k, totaling ~$64k. This will be a night shift position with rotating shifts (2 on, 2 off, 3 on, 2 off, etc) with little opportunity for advancement. 

Company B offered $16/hr, but this is a Monday-Friday job with all federal holidays off. Quality of life would certainly be better with this job, but the pay is substantially less. 

Both companies are roughly an hour commute each way, so I need to factor in time spent commuting and wear/ tear on my vehicle. Would it be wise to try and negotiate for a higher hourly wage at Company B? For further information, I exceed both job requirements in both education and experience, with a bachelor’s degree and 8+ years.",finance

economy,Impact of Dollar liquidity in the market Vs the Coronavirus,"Hi, I'd, like to get some opinions on whether or not this downturn can be exacerbated by the demand for dollars that is occurring due to risk-off. 

The Fed's not QE is stopping slightly faster than expected, tie this in with higher demand for dollars from across the globe due to the virus. This seems like a recipe for recession and significant downturn in the market (more than 20%). 

If the Fed does decide to ease, would this not cause inflationary pressures as there is already supply side pressure pushing prices up?

So where can the fed actually go from here?

I have an auto loan that I am currently about 3 payments ahead on, which I’ve been tracking on an excel by using the interest rate, number of days between my payments, and payment amounts. This method has tracked almost to the penny with my account on the bank statements for the loan. I understand that I have the option of either making my next monthly payment early, or towards principal only. The former option is like paying in advance, the latter is paying “extra” in that I still owe the next regular part. Interest also accrues daily, regardless of what my principal balance is. My question is, if I were to get 12 months ahead on payments, I could choose to pay towards principal only on the loan for the next 12 months? Because interest is always accruing, even if I were to pay the principal down to zero, I would still owe the interest that has accrued the last 12 months. Is this a true statement? Also, please feel free to ask any questions to clarify if I didn’t explain well enough, I’m very interested to see what answers I get here.",finance

personalfinance,How do these housing numbers look,"Hey PF, I have been a long time lurker and the wife and I are looking at purchasing our first home.

&amp;nbsp;

Our gross yearly pay is 174,969 with a pay increase starting in march of 12k for my spouse. We are both federal government employees on the GS scale.

Breakdown of finances per paycheck (every 2 weeks, Rounded numbers):

&amp;nbsp;

Item | Me | Spouse | Total
---|---|----|----
Gross Pay | 3,420 | 3,309 | 6,729
Health Insurance | 59.29 | 48.47 | 107.76
Retirement | 663 | 642 | 1,305
Taxes | 724 | 716 | 1,441
HSA | 100 | 0 | 100
Dental | 0 | 26 | 26
Other Insurance | 13 | 13 | 26
529 | 50 | 50 | 100
**Net Pay** | 1,808 | 1,812 | 3,621
All Other Expenses | - | - | 1,430

&amp;nbsp;        

This puts us at $7,242 per month in net pay. The house we are looking at is about 555k and we currently have the 20% down as well as another 25k saved away in an emergency fund. Currently, we are saving about 4k a month. We are looking at a monthly payment of $2,682 (Including property tax, and HOA fee) according to one of our possible lenders. 

&amp;nbsp;

Our monthly leftover would be $2,860 if we account for a modest increase in spending for a home.

personalfinance,Keep paying debt or invest in retirement accounts during market dip?,"Hi, all. Apologies if this has been asked and answered recently - I didn't see anything, but this sub has so many posts. 

I have completely paused my retirement contributions (16% of salary to a 401k - no employer match, intending to open a Roth when I start again), in order to pay off my 6% interest federal student loans. 

I know that many on this sub suggest buying into the market more heavily during a dip. Should I be restarting my retirement contributions to invest during this down-swing? If so, what percentage of my salary is reasonable? Should I go back to 401K contributions or open a Roth? I have a long way to go on my loans - one year if I am extremely aggressive in paying them off, and longer if there are other financial emergencies.

personalfinance,"Relocating to the US, zero credit history. What's next?","I'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed because in 2 months I'll be landing in the US from the other side of the world. I'll have zero credit history obviously, which I know makes it hard to apply for loans or credit cards.

I'll be applying for no-credit-history credit cards to try to build up my credit history, but as I understand it takes some time to translate into a good credit score. I'm not worried about not being able to pay off my bills or rent because I'm starting a very well-paying job, and I have quite a fair bit in savings too.

More importantly, I'd also need a vehicle for commuting, and I'm eyeing the 2020 Prius Prime (I did my research and it seems that with the $4500 federal tax credits it'll be cheaper than a used car). 

1. Should I rent a car until I have enough credit history to qualify for a car loan at favorable rates? Or is it cheaper to just buy a car anyway at not-so-good terms?

2. I have enough to pay in cash without financing, which would solve the problem of no credit score. But I read that it's a bad idea to pay upfront, and it's better to finance it.

I'm new to the US system, and it's also my first time buying a car, so I'm pretty lost. I've been reading a ton of articles and Reddit posts to learn as much as I can, and it helps but it's also quite confusing. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,2020 Federal Tax Withholding W4 changes,"I think this has been covered in another thread - the IRB revised the W4: [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf). The IRS recommended that employers notify employees of the W4 changes and have them complete a new one in 2020. Of course, this guidance was issued in December 2019. My employer never notified me (even though I'm a fed employee), so I never did a new W4 this year. Now onto the issues, since my husband started a new job this year and completed the new 2020 W4.

The whole point of the 2020 revision is to set taxes at the appropriate level for a dual income couple. But it requires a calculation for expected salary and you have to 'pick' one of your jobs as the highest paying. I guarantee that my spouse did not use my paystub when he completed his W4, but you cannot do this without your spouse's paystub or last year's W2! As a result, the federal tax withholding rate is coming out at 44% of his taxable salary; mine, on the other hand, is 14%. Overall, if we continue this way, it's withholding WAY too much...by like $50k.

I am pretty sure that my payroll is still withholding according to the 'old' W4. This is now a big issue since my husband's is using the 'new' 2020 W4. And that explains why our withholdings are so different and not right. (Unless, of course, my husband completed his W4 wrong, which is also entirely possible.)

Our accountant is figuring out the appropriate withholding for us so we can both file updated W4s, but I wanted to give everyone a heads up about this. It was implemented with little advance notice. Basically, BOTH people should complete a new W4 to ensure that together, the appropriate amount of tax will be withheld. So, talk to your spouse.",finance

I was claiming 4 allowances previously due to the MIC, my wife not working, and having our baby. Ive already filed my taxes for 2019. We got a nice 3k+ refund from federal and 700 for NC state. 

So my question is to make the refund smaller and get more on my checks should I claim two dependents on my W4? I was also claiming 0 for state but should that be 1? Since I was at 4 allowances I want to make sure I dont lose money on my next check by only claiming 1 dependent

With current trends (current coronavirus fears not withstanding) I will probably have enough to cash out and payoff my mortgage within a year, definitely within 3.

personalfinance,Car Purchase Question (first post),"I have a car that I am upside down in (owe 3500 worth maybe 1500).

It will not pass inspection in November as it barely passed this last November. 

I have some options (unless you wise redditors know more):

1. Spend the 3k on fixing up a 2012 with 150k miles (body work - water comes in the car, wiper fluid reservoir, rear brake light component, exhaust, keys are ""sticky"" in driver door lock, etc). 
2. Buy a 3k  older model car straight out.  Get two-three years out of it while I pay off the money I still owe on the current car. 
3. Try to get a loan for a used car with high interest rate and be upside down. 
4. Go to a dealer and not turn in the car and let it get taken away via lender.

I don't like three... I'm between 1 and 2 however I don't think 2 is a viable option.

business,Help finding a software solution,"Hi all, I’m looking for some help figuring out a solution to what we are currently doing.

We still print everything for file, though I am trying to save copies to the digital file as well, it’s not a universal practice. From my standpoint, I’m only in touch with the client pretty much annually to get them to review new rates or a contract, but the contract manager should have a lot more contact, and there’s a disconnect in keeping everyone up to date in the goings-on. Additionally, it’d be nice to have a centralized area for customer information and rates that everyone can view and we can use as gospel.

My problem is mostly my family. They currently are against the idea of getting a PhD, because it will take too long. You see, I give my family a bit of money, monthly, to help with rent. My mom also has problems with loans which I plan on helping her with once I graduate. They are not high interest loans, but it does add up. I also have my own loans to worry about which I am currently attempting to mitigate by paying the highest interest rate ones first. My dad is out of the picture.

I can just get a masters which is the in-between path, but I would rather stay and finish off the PhD. I do not want to have to go back to school.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin at it's root is protection from suffering due to the poor decisions and actions of others. It correlates with the lack of faith in government to do the right things, and lack in faith in citizens to elect the right leaders.","Bitcoin's design around decentralization, mathematical scarcity, and self-sovereignty are all valuable in a world where theoretically centralization fails. It is leaderless and trustless, not because leadership is bad, or trust is bad - but because faith in these things can tend to fail or let us down - with terrible consequences.

It is not difficult to see the failure of leaders all around us. Politically, we see the Chinese Communist Party operating perhaps no much better than President Trump in the efforts against Coronavirus. We continue to see failure of the Federal Reserve economic policy, devastatingly destroying the value of the US dollar (and all other world currencies) over the decades. We continue to see failure in basic economic education, and a spread of socialism and an appeal to handouts - rather than rooting out the problem of inflation. We continue to see a lack of educated consumerism, continuing to buy goods manufactured in China with only regard to price, and total disregard to the poor working conditions and humanitarianism. It is hard to have faith in people around us.

In a world without Bitcoin, there is no way to shield yourself from these issues and people in a convenient manner. That is, you suffer from the stupidity of others. But Bitcoin allows you to secure value and money - which is critical to life in our modern world - against poor decision-making of others.

This is not to say, people should simply buy Bitcoin and let the world burn. But rather, perhaps while fighting the war against ignorance, be smart and protect oneself from all the collateral damage and unintended consequences of the foolish of which you have little to no real control.

Will Bitcoin succeed? Perhaps only as much as leadership fails, and the people's ability to elect very good leaders fails, and at least for me, that's a sure bet as any in today's day and age.",cryptocurrency

This 8-10k is for room/board/transportation/miscellaneous.

**1st idea:**

Take 18 credits per semester, do one or two online classes per summer, and finish a semester early. I will hopefully have a summer internship each summer that has okay pay, and work throughout the school year. (my school offers block rate tuition that charges same tuition for 12hrs or 18hrs. I was going to take advantage of that to save money, plus the extra semester worth of living expenses). 

**2nd idea:** 

Take the regular 15 credits per semester, focus on classes/getting good grades, and still pursue the summer internship. Maybe spend more time participating in extracurriculars/leadership clubs, not working at all during school, and taking out a private loan for approximately 8-10k/yr to cover what financial aid won't cover.",finance

personalfinance,Lender calling us about refinancing 1 year after purchase due to lower rates than last year?,"Just need some input, perspective, or everyone's thoughts...

Some quick info...

* Wife and I closed on our home last year, Feb 28th, 2019
* We are first time home buyers
* The home is a brand new build, and our warranty is about to end this month
* We purchased it for $260,000,  did close to 10% down ($25k), at 4.35% (*builder had put up $10k towards closing as part of the deal, and after closing costs, etc, there was still $5k left, so we used it to buy points*)
* Loan is an FHA Loan
* We made 2 additional small principle payments back in December
* Most recent ZEstimate for our home is $278,000
* According to our end-of-year statement, principle paid was little over $4k

We still have the same lender, even though a few months back, we did get a letter stating that they sold the mortgage to themselves (*which I am confused about. They basically transferred it from them-self to them-self*)

Anyway, we have gotten a couple calls from the lender basically stating that since interest rates are lower, we were screened, and that they want to reach out and see if we were interested in refinancing?

I wasnt expecting to even be bothered by such offers, and definitely not after barely a year into our 30 year mortgage!

I mentioned it to several friends / family about it, and some say I should do it, others say its pointless, and probably a waste of time / money. I do know that in several years my wife and I, once we hit 22%, were planning on refinancing anyway to get out of the MIP payments that our FHA loan has.

I mean, I barely have any equity at the moment (*$25k down + $4k in payments equals $29k*), barely a little over 11% at the moment.

Why would I getting these offers from our Lender? Feels like they are just trying to take advantage of me personally. But someone pointed out that its probably because our home increased in value by $13k, so the lender wants to take advantage of that?

personalfinance,Technically buying a second home with a family member on the first mortgage,I am moving to Vegas soon and would like to buy a home. The current issue is with my uncle who is part of a loan that was signed to keep the families house. Now he never had much credit at all and now he has built it for a little over 2 years. That is why I decided to help in the first place - plus I live there for cheap. The issue is that he does not make a considerable amount of money and he is concerned that to get my name off the mortgage he is going to have to absorb a higher interest rate on his own. I guess my question is what options do I have and what are the best? Do i even need to get off of the mortgage? Is that going to negatively effect my own purchase of a new house?

&gt;Former Dallas Fed President [Richard Fisher](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/people/richard_w_fisher) told CNBC on Thursday he believes the market has become too dependent on the [Federal Reserve](https://www.cnbc.com/federal-reserve/) in times of turmoil.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fisher’s comments came as futures were pricing around a [70% chance for a quarter-percent cut in March](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/27/market-pressure-heats-up-on-the-fed-with-at-least-three-cuts-priced-in.html). The market now expects three rate cuts in 2020 as global stock indexes sink on intensified concerns about the coronavirus’ economic impact.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“I think the market is getting ahead of itself because the market is dependent on Fed largess,”** Fisher said on CNBC’s “[Fast Money Halftime Report](https://www.cnbc.com/halftime/).”  
&gt;  
&gt;Fisher, who led the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from 2005 to 2015, said the “Fed has created this dependency” among a generation of money managers who were not working in the field during previous moments of economic challenges.  
&gt;  
&gt;They were not around in 1974, 1987, the late 1990s and “even in 2007, 2008, 2009,” he argued.  
&gt;  
&gt;**“They have only seen a one-way street. Of course they’re nervous,”** Fisher said. **“The question is, do you want to feed that hunger, keep applying the opioid of cheap and abundant money? Money is already cheap and abundant.”**

**...**

&gt;Fisher conceded Thursday he was at the Fed over the stretch during which the “dependency” he lamented was developed.  
&gt;  
&gt;He also said he was not specifically saying the Fed should not cut interest rates in response to the coronavirus. He said he believed it was a “debatable question.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m not saying I’m against it,” he said, adding: “I think we have to consider whether you want to continue whether you want to continue to feed the market in this way.”

personalfinance,Is it a bad idea cosign a loan to save my kid from a high interest car loan?,"My kid is newly 18 and while I'm quite proud of his initiative in getting a car by himself, he was taken by the dealership, a bit. The loan is 23% interest for $8500, which includes gap coverage and a service plan. The car itself was $5875.  

I am on his account at our credit union and they offered to refinance, and I was approved. Somehow. I don't make very much money but my credit is decent.  

I don't yet know the interest rate they are offering, but it surely must be lower. He has until Monday to cancel the gap insurance for a refund, so I'm having him do that.

personalfinance,I have a high interest loan that needs to go. How should I approach this?,"I made a mistake about a year ago of taking out a loan worth $8,500 at 12.98% interest rate. The loan is down to about $7,400 now. I bring in after taxes about $1000/month (currently in last couple semesters for bachelor’s degree). I’ll be starting an internship that’ll bring me in about after taxes $1800 for 3 months, but then I won’t have a job (at least as of this moment). 

I graduate in December and I’m going to try to make sure I can find a decent job before I’m out. How should I approach my loan?

I’m keeping my expenses as low as possible. 

I thought about potentially throwing in $600-700/month to the loans prior to my internship - I live with my parents and have $60/month phone bill outside of these loans. I’ll cut food spending to a minimum. With this in mind, I can reduce it to the $5600 range. I could then hammer away at the remainder with the internship money. Any feedback is appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,"Should I pay off loans, invest, or save?","So, I was recently hired to work for an investment firm in the IT department, and the recent downturn has me a bit spooked. I am hoping that they'll ride out the volatility and not lay anyone off, and I am also riding on the fact that nearly a third of the workforce is contractors, so in the event of a downsize, I *might* be safe.

However, I am a new hire, so I am a bit worried. Here is what I have:

Salary: $70,000/yr

Debts:

Checking: $1,300  
Savings: $1,000

Now, once the grace period ends, I'll be paying just under $950 a month on my loans, and have total mandatory monthly expenditures of around $1,700. Should I pay extra on my student loans, or should I save some more money, just in case?

Note: The $1,700 is low because I'm more or less ""renting"" a room at my parents' place. If I move out, that figure could easily balloon to $2,400 or $2,500 a month., given that rent around here is god awful.

EDIT: Before anyone says so, yes I understand investing my money in a tax advantaged account like a Traditional IRA or a Roth IRA would be better than a plain old investment account. But I want to retire before I hit 59.5, and I don't want to be hit by penalties for early withdrawal.",finance

investing,Concise explanation of why stocks could fall 20% more from here,"I see so many comments on here anytime the market drops like ""stocks are on sale"" or ""if you loved stocks last week, then you should love them even more this week,"" which seem to focus only on the price, without understanding what the price of a stock or the market consists of: future earnings expectations. 

Just because the price of a stock was X last week doesn't mean that price has any relevance to the price this week. And just because a stock rose 100% last year, doesn't mean that the stock is any more or less attractive today based on its past history, at least from a fundamental perspective. 

When you are only factoring in past prices (without analyzing new, forward-looking information) you are engaging in **anchoring,** a psychological concept that overweights initial information you are presented with. 

Here is a relatively concise analysis of the current market's outlook from Frank Curzio, who like every analyst, has had his hits and misses, but is usually quite bullish that actually displays analysis based on new information related to earnings. I would link, but this came from an email update.

\*\*\*

According to Capital IQ, S&amp;P's research division, companies in the S&amp;P 500 are expected to generate a combined $181 in earnings per share (EPS) in 2020. That's 14% higher than the $159 in combined EPS the S&amp;P 500 generated in 2019. 

Now that the coronavirus has spread... there's no way earnings are growing 14% this year. In fact, Goldman Sachs—which once called the virus a ”short-term problem""—just published a report saying earnings will not grow in 2020. 

I think this is conservative, given the number of companies that have lowered earnings over the past two weeks (including Apple and Microsoft, two of the biggest names in the S&amp;P 500). But it's important that investors understand these numbers. 

If we see no earnings growth in 2020... that means 2020 earnings will come in at $159 a share, at most. But if we divide the current price of the S&amp;P 500 (about $3,050) by the $159 in combined earnings... we can see that **the S&amp;P 500 is** **already** **trading at 19x forward earnings.**

In other words, even though the market pulled back more than 10%... the S&amp;P 500 is still trading like there's no coronavirus. (Remember, earnings are falling alongside the markets... that's why the market is still expensive despite its 10% correction). 

At 19x forward earnings, the markets are still pricing in significant growth. Yet, earnings probably won't grow at all in 2020... 

What does this mean?

**There's likely another 20% downside from here.**

With no actual growth forecast for 2020, the market should be trading closer to 15x—the 10-year average... and more than 20% lower than current levels.

Of course, this downside could be limited if we find a vaccine for the coronavirus in the short term... or if we see massive government intervention to help backstop the markets. (Things like lowering interest rates, preventing short selling, or injecting cash directly into the markets.)

\*\*\*

So anytime someone says stocks are on sale, or cheap, or a good time to buy, you should ask them, ""what are you basing that information on?"" The fact that the price is cheaper than it was last week/month/year means nothing without understanding the earnings picture.",finance

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

The fact that the FED is even considering to think about using monetary policy to counter the economic consequences caused by Corona is one of the most ludicrous statements I have heard in a long time.

personalfinance,(US) We're trying to trade-in our financed motorcycle for two cheaper ones.. or better options.. need advice!,"My SO and I purchased a motorcycle from Harley-Davidson about a year ago with about an 18% interest rate (our first loan), monthly payment of $450 and a term of about 5 years. We've put about 25,000 miles on this bike within a year because of our commutes to work (which is one of the main reason we went for a new motorcycle with a warranty / maintenance program). 

Currently, I'm the only one out of us two who is able to drive this but we are working on getting my SO their endorsement and a bike of their own as well, but with that in mind, we do *not* need a bike as big as we currently have for only one person. Ideally, we would like to trade this bike in and get two, smaller, motorcycles. 

The dealer gave a trade-in evaluation of about $10,000 and we still owe around $18,000 left, so we would be negative around $8,000 to the new loan for the other two bikes - but the bank won't let us finance two other motorcycles while we still have this one.  My SO's  credit is in the mid-600s and mine is in the high-600s, it's going up every month with our bike payment, so at least it is good for something right now, despite being so high. 

What are our options here?

We were advised by the dealer and a friend to wait a few months, pay off more debt a little faster, then go back in and see what they say - but my mom strongly advised against a trade-in, that it's a terrible idea. In the future, refinancing this bike is an option, but when it comes time to change the clutch cable / tires (roughly every 10k miles), both tires cost around $1k to change, despite our services being free and major issues that aren't wearable being free it is still too expensive with the wearables. We can afford it right now, but sometimes it's cutting a bit close and we have to take a small payday loan until our next paychecks (only because the way our paychecks are spaced out).

stocks,Market might not be going down because of why you think it is.,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f9iydb/mkt\_might\_not\_be\_going\_down\_because\_of\_why\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/f9iydb/mkt_might_not_be_going_down_because_of_why_you/)

Hi Again !

The TLDR from my previous posts was that Clarida has started this mess by fighting the mkt and so far as I had predicted the asian sessions were always better than the EU/US ones. but now the situation has become more complicated and at least on my list of concerns, Corona is not number 1.

Bearish themes:

* Trump botching up Corona response (cut CDC funds for the stupid wall, Muzzling CDC &amp; Health authorities in a shitty attempt to keep confidence and markets up, not reacting aggressively and professionally enough, putting Pence who is a religious zealot who has a poor track record in even believing in science in charge etc..) is seen as hurting his re-election chances.
   * And increasing the chances of Sanders who is the defacto front runner
      * !Silver lining is it seems JoE still has the black vote and a big win in SC would be encouraging and would def help stonks.
      * [https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3698/Who-will-win-the-2020-US-presidential-election](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3698/Who-will-win-the-2020-US-presidential-election)
* Another very serious issue is the potential implosion of the $XLE complex. if you've looked at a chart of energy stocks lately u will notice that it looks like they are going to 0. if oil curve stays like this and given the maturity wall that we are facing in the next 3-6 months (It means that a ton of $XLE companies have credits maturing which need to be refinanced and oil being so low makes it complicated to hedge future production in order to secure the credit)
   * This one big reason why the FED SHOULD CHANGE THEIR MIND ASAP THIS IS BAD BAD BAD. bunch of bankruptcies around permian ARE NOT WELCOME right now.
   * Second reason why FED SHOULD CHANGE THEIR MIND ASAP is that the spread between the 2yr interest rate and fed funds has been inverted for a month and honestly there are enough good reasons to cut the rate : Inflation missing, VERY strong $ is killing EM &amp; friends (and not helping europe so might as well help those who can be helped), stop nuking the banks. hopefully Clarida recognizes this soon.
* Corona : i don't think the whole Corona thing will ever be as big as some claim, most of my conclusions have been shaped after listening to various experts but especially this JH conference on the subject [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6cQ5Pqqa3k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6cQ5Pqqa3k)
   * My base case is that this will become a seasonal type flu that is more severe than the flu but not quite comparable to anything like SARS or MERS (or EBOLA). and we will move on. However in the meantime this can induce a demand choc which will be temporary at worst\*Turkish / Russia conflict in ME : this is low key so far.
* Turkish / Russia conflict in ME : this is low key so far.

**So it all hinges on whether you believe that the FED will do the right thing or not. i think they will so i bought &lt; 2900 in futures today.**

**but of course we won't be able to rally until they officially change their mind or suggest it in the wires.**

We had the seller pitch in a lot to cover closing costs and other fees and now it seems that we will have a credit at the end of closing.

How significant is that 20% number? Is it a break point that will net me a significantly lower interest rate? I'm aware of the sales tax and 10% penalty for withdrawing early from a 401k. Ideally I won't be pulling more than $10k from the 401k, and I won't pull more than $15k in any case.",finance

personalfinance,Would it really be better to NOT pay off my student loans in full?,"I have three student loans, each worth about $8,000 of debt, so $24,000 total.

Loan A is 3 years old, 3.76% interest
Loan B is 2.5 years old, 4.45% interest
Loan C is 1.75 years old, 5.05% interest

The first issue is I didn't get my first credit card until 4 months ago. I don't have any other loans, a car payment, etc. This means paying off my student loans would drastically reduce my average credit age, which from what I understand could severely lower my credit score.

Another thing to consider, my employer matches 401K contributions up to 3% of my salary, (which comes out to about $185/month for me) BUT they offer an option for those repaying student loans, they'll 'match' up to that $185/month of my student loan payments. In other words, I get money put into my 401K by my employer without me having to put in any myself, as long as I'm paying back my student loans up to or exceeding 3% of my salary.

It really seems like paying off my student loans in full would actually do more harm than good, and that it would be in my best interests to just make the minimum monthly payments to keep those accounts open as long as possible, and invest the rest of the money, especially since I can reasonably expect money invested to have a higher rate of return than the interest rates on my loans (current market craziness notwithstanding).

I guess I'm fighting a lifetime reinforcement of 'debt bad'. Am I missing something here?

I'm also considering paying off just loan C (the highest interest one) and keeping the other accounts open as long as possible.

personalfinance,[Investment and general advice] Have an investment account that I've been negligent about. Trying to become an adult and could really use some advice/help on getting started.,"A long time ago, the accounts were managed by an investment manager. They just fed it into an algorithm which split the Roth up to some insane number of stocks, and I'd like to combine it into something more manageable/conservative, considering my age and risk tolerance (quite low). I left them but never worked up the courage to actually manage my accounts properly. Hoping to change that now.

I have been neglecting things, initially out of fear and laziness, and then out of shame about not being on top of things and being an adult. I'm trying to change that now, and part of that is taking charge of my finances. The dip certainly has a part in this, but I am trying to see it as a good kick in the pants for me.

I'm 40, married, and we own our home outright which is where most of our equity is. Our cash accounts total about about $50k in a high yield online savings account, and $20k in our local credit union. Want to bring this down to $5-10k in the next month or two as I consolidate, and will look into moving some of the online savings into low-risk short term investments like CDs, but the interest rate differences almost don't seem worth the effort with current interest rates.

The investment accounts are split about 200k investment, 100k roth IRA. All investments are in Fidelity.

I've been reading the Bogleheads' guide, and I'm a fan; I'm certainly not the kind of person to try to be a day trader. I am extremely new to all this, so I'm sorry for the dumb questions.

My specific questions would be:

* I want to consolidate a Roth IRA of a ton of tiny stock holdings into a few large chunks of funds. Do I just sell the stock holdings directly, wait until those funds move into the cash account, and then purchase any selected funds?
* If I sell a bunch of my holdings, does it matter (for next year's tax purposes) if I let the cash sit in the account for a few weeks while I get my shit together?
* I'm looking for actual funds to invest in, but am finding it difficult to actually get started with my investigation. I am going to Fidelity and Vanguard today to ask for prospectuses or try to dig them up online, but are there any that people recommend as ""starter"" funds that I can look into first?

personalfinance,"Debt Consolidation, Pros and Cons","Me again. I made an edit to my post yesterday concerning grouping billing and payments all onto 9me day a month. My edit asked opinions on getting a personal loan to pay off all other major debts, and have one consolidated payment, hopefully consisting of a lower interest rate than all other debts collectively. 

Do creditors look at the fact that an individual has filed for a large personal loan, to make smaller loans paid off and done as bad money management? Or will they brush it off as, eh, they got stuck, and figured it out. I feel that anyone in finance could understand wanted a lower consolidated payment compared to 4 or 5 payments, each consisting of their own interest rates. 

I have the coin and on one side I see; you have your debts, you've been paying your debts, just press on and pay them off as they were given. On the other side; you can consolidate all your debts, (aside from large orders such as student loans and mortgage) and have a lower payment, one single interest rate, with the only obvious repercussion being you are essentially starting all of your debts over. But the other repercussion could be the potential affect on future purchases, as if my wife and I wanted to move or build a house.

worldpolitics,BREAKING NEWS Dow ends worst week since 2008 as Fed suggests possible interest rate cuts,"Fear and greed. The two emotions the markets operate on.

I'd say the key emotion now is fear which is a sign of the market's take on the world's response to this virus.

As such, this is a clear referendum on TrumpCo and their response (and other world leaders' responses) ... clearly the steps being taken by the US, and how they are being communicated, is not convincing investors.

And so we have the market caving in on it's own tax-cut-fueled, sugar-high, and market valuations are correcting.

It's when the bubble of voodoo economics called tax cuts for the rich and ""trickle down"", meets kakistocracy.

Here in the US. The reckoning is real. It is mostly Trump created. And let's hope it continues to cost him the election.

My schadenfreude is keeping me warm from now to November despite the losses in my 401Ks.

investing,To borrow or not to borrow when investing,"I've always been told ""don't borrow to invest"". However real estate is literally borrowing (mortgage) to invest (rental) which pays off the mortgage. If this works SO well.... then why don't people borrow as much as they can to invest as much as they can and use the earned interest to pay off loans instead? (Like a mortgage) especially if the return rate is higher than your loan interest rate? 

Separately and more importantly, what investments exist that are low enough risk such as real estate (don't say it's high risk or else every landlord is a fool, which they're not) but produce a higher return than borrowed money say at 5%? There's too many influencers and pages on money and articles with onslaught of information nowadays... You get lost sometimes...

TL;DR
why are homes good investments even though you need to borrow to make money, which is always advised against? 

What other investments are a safe borrow-to-earn?

This may even be an understatement, but this past year has been incredibly rough for me.  I want to point out that this is my own responsibility, and I don't want to get any of my family involved as it was something I've gotten myself into.

I have been laid off for 3 months now, and my EI benefits are barely keeping my above ground with my debts.

I have gotten behind in all my payments and have been getting dinged on my credit report hard the recently.  My parents are also in no situation to be helping me out, the best they are doing is letting me live with them.  

I dealt myself a shitty card and kept thinking I can pull myself out of it, but everyday feels like a heavier burden and my mental fortitude is at an all time low.  I don't pay rent (live with my parents) nor do I own any major assets.

I've always been a redditor since high school but have never made an account and I've seen some personal advice here in the past.  

I am getting my feet off the ground and hopefully will have a full-time job around the same pay in the next month or two, but even then I will be heavily behind in all my payments.

&gt;  
&gt;We encourage you to identify another IRA provider that aligns with your investment strategy and needs.   
&gt;  
&gt;As of April 1, 2020, IRA CDs will no longer renew at maturity.

&gt;If you have not already taken steps to transfer, roll over or withdraw your IRA CD(s) by the maturity date, we will close the account(s), pay all accrued interest and mail the proceeds to you.

**Controlling the outbreak is going to become increasingly difficult.**


[To control the majority of viral outbreaks, for R0 of 2-5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3·5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced.The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1·5. For R0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(20\)30074-7/fulltext) 

[Researchers estimate the R0 value of COVID-19 to be likely between 4.7 and 6.6. Further, they speculate that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1)

**The Case of Africa**

With the continent's [high volume of air traffic and trade between China](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0771-1) new outbreaks are inevitable.

Without treatment or vaccines, and without pre-existing immunity, sustained Corona Virus outbreaks might be devastating due to the multiple health challenges the continent already faces: rapid population growth and increased movement of people; existing endemic diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and malaria; remerging and emerging infectious pathogens such as Ebola virus disease, Lassa haemorrhagic fever, and others; and increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases.

[Governments are already anticipating demand and addressing supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30411-6/fulltext): large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents.

IMO, the market for the products of Corona Virus stocks will increase exponentially when new outbreaks begin in this continent.

Things are about to get way worse.

[The Harvard Business review predicts that the peak of the impact of Covid-19 on global supply chains will occur in mid-March, forcing thousands of companies to throttle down or temporarily shut assembly and manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe.

**The USA**

More cases are likely to be identified in the coming days, including more cases in the United States. It’s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in the United States.

As of 2/28. there are now 61 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the United States, according to an update today by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These include:

* 43 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship

* 3 people repatriated from China

* 15 US cases

[The 15 US cases include nine in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. Among these cases, there are two instances of person-to-person transmission, one in Illinois and one in California. The latest case in California did not have any relevant travel history or known contact with another infected person, suggesting it could be the first instance of ""community spread"" of the virus in the United States, according to health officials.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/health/us-cases-coronavirus-community-transmission/index.html)

If the were going to provide each state and local health departments with testing capabilities, this might be a signal that test kits developed in the private sector will be distributed.

**Looking Forward to Next Week**

IMO, the virus news this weekend will be off the charts. As new outbreaks occur and the sustained outbreaks continue, the demand for these corona virus stocks will rise. 

I still stand by the recommendation from my initial posting, in which I suggested investing into the companies producing test kits and personal protection / medical equipment. 

I am still currently holding $APT, $AHPI, and $CODX. No vaccine companies at the moment. I feel that there is a great deal of profit to be made swinging these stocks using 15 second candle chart &amp; the 50, 100, and 200 day moving average. Take a look at how the stock behaved the last two days and find a plan that can work for you. Watch the volume in premarket as well on the various virus stock to get a sense of where the interest is for that day.

My Portfolio Breakdown:

* 65.5% AHPI: On Friday AHPI reached a crazy premarket high of $67 a share. Upon market opening, price dropped steaply down to $16. Looks to be continuing along a trend line for now. The reason I increased my holding % here is because the float is considerably smaller than APT. https://imgur.com/u9BO2UY

* 6.3% APT: Similarly to AHPI, the price reached a big high premarket and corrected its self to the support from 2/27. https://imgur.com/orOnmri

* 28.2% CODX: Big swings here. Had been previously following the 50 day moving average and corrected down to the 200 day / trend line. Still waiting on FDA approval or PR from the company on order numbers. Will sell upon receiving FDA approval for their test kits. https://imgur.com/MTTw8Y1

I decided not to take the money out at the time as these were investments for the mid to long term. My worry now is the sentiment in news seems to have changed from just a 'coronavirus' problem to something far deeper. Being talks that interest rate are set to be cut further and we are heading into a recession territory.  Originally I had in mind that the markets would just come back up in possibly 4-7 months but my fears are now we could be on the turn of something far worse and longer.

So it would be good to get some experienced advice and opinions on this if there is any truth in this and if it is now worth (before it gets even worse), taking my money out of these investments?",finance

I work for a sales company which is fine but I revived a degree in Economics and would love to do something with my degree that doesn’t involve stocks and sitting in a cubicle banking. I just don’t know what other options I have

My goal/dream is to move out to San Diego and all I ever hear is how expensive it is. I’m making roughly 2.5K a month and my Student loans start accumulating interest in August at a 7% rate. 

Should I focus on paying those off as soon as I can/ is there a way to refinance my loans to a lower interest rate? Or should I save money while gradually paying off my loans 

My credit score is 741 so I’m sure I could get a better rate I just have no idea how to do so

&gt; Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.

&gt; The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.
*****
&gt; “Look out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,” Michelle Meyer, Bank of America’s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. “It will take time for the ‘hard’ economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.”

&gt; The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed’s March policy meeting.
*****
&gt; Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. “ISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,” he said.
*****
&gt; The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide “early insight” into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.
*****
&gt; Cutting forecasts
&gt; Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.
*****
&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.
*****
&gt; Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&amp;P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.
*****
&gt; To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.
*****
&gt; “The level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,” Paulsen said.
*****
&gt; Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.
*****
&gt; Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including “bond king” Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.

# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19

&gt; The coronavirus outbreak—or Covid-19 —has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&amp;P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.

&gt; “The Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.”

&gt; Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.

&gt; **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3–4 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter—possibly 2–3% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5–6%—followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China’s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government’s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China’s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25–0.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy—the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date—may comprise 0.2–0.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.

# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?

&gt; It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.

&gt; Of the 97 S&amp;P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&amp;P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&amp;P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**

&gt; Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.

# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&amp;P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off

&gt; Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&amp;P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&amp;P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**

&gt; Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&amp;P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**

&gt; While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.

# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)

&gt; It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**

&gt; Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**

&gt; The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**

&gt; Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**

&gt; Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**

&gt; This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.

# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs

&gt; The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.

&gt; At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&amp;P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

# Just Four S&amp;P 500 Stocks Up This Week

&gt; There's still another day left in the week, but unless things improve on Friday this will go down as one of the worst weeks for US equities in history. Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&amp;P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&amp;P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**

&gt; On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.

&gt; One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Banking scams? Advice please.,"I had a phone call last week from a woman who was calling about a suspect activity on my Santander Visa card, she was trying to confirm whether or not I had spent $645 with Best Buy, and I said no, I had spent that much but it was for an airfare, and moreover I do not bank with Santander.    


She rung off at that.  But it made me wonder what was going on, so I opened my phone and compared the number to the bank customer service number online, they were the same so it was a legitimate call, from Santander, unless they somehow spoofed Santander's customer service number.    


I know of Santander as a Spanish bank but did not know they actually did retail banking in the US.

So to be sure I phoned Santander and spoke with their customer service, told them about the incident, and asked if there was any way that call could be traced back to a legit employee, who I did not catch the name of because I was driving at the time of the original call, she said her name just as the phone switched from phone to bluetooth over the car's speakers.  When I said I had not bought anything from Best Buy for that (or any) amount she said my debit card would be disabled and I would have to get a new one.  I said hey, you can't disable my debit I have to leave on a road trip tomorrow, so she said I would be allowed to use it but not for internet transactions.    


I have a fairly unique European name, there are at most just one other person in the US with the same first and last name, the customer service guy at Santander said they had two customers with the same name.  But, not with my address or phone number and I gave him my social to check if any of the accounts with their bank was using that social.  He said no, so I was relieved at least if theere is something untoward going on it would not impact my credit, I am in the middle of buying a house 3,000 miles away and have an approved mortgage, closing first week of April.    


But, I keep coming back to why a legitimate Santander employee would call me who addressed me by name and obviously called my phone number to ask about a suspicious purchase with a Best Buy.  I did not giver her any information that could be used to access my accounts, not th name of my real bank, or social, or address, nothing.  The second guy I spoke with, Chris,  when I looked up their number and spoke with him which I know is legit, but then on the 25th I woke at 3:30 in the morning and someone had tried to access my real bank account with my credit union a half hour before.  There was a failed attempt security notice from my bank.    


Last, I have a close friend who lives in Colorado now that got into drugs last year and is facing a number of felony counts; one of them is identity theft.  I don't know enough about the nature of his charges nor even about identity theft to accuse him of doing something like this, but I am under the impression that he did screw up an Ex's credit (made a mess as he put it in a text).    


I am wondering if my friend has opened a number of accounts using my name and phone number, but not my social, and how that is possible.  There have been no further attempts to access my real accounts, nothing suspicious shows up on my credit, and there have been no further phone calls.  But I can't freeze my credit either because there are too many things I need to do like establish utilities in the new state, get insurance quotes, and the closing itself will require a last credit check.    


Advice?  Any of you have anything like this happen?",finance
personalfinance,I owe 10k in taxes after filing,"I didn't realize that taxes weren't being taken out of my paycheck and now I owe 10k that I want prepared to spend. This is my first job out of college and I did well enough saving that I can pay it, but it completely throws off my budgeting, investing, and emergency fund.

Basically what happened was I interned over the summer in 2018 with the company and didn't make enough so I filed as exempt. After finishing school I started full time and didn't update my w4 apparently. I worked through the year not realizing that taxes weren't coming out of my paychecks and now I owe everything at once when I should have payed over the course of the year. 

It's my fault yes, but now with the market dipping like it is it especially hurts. 6500 to federal and 2500 to state (roughly). Needless to say, I have now updated my w4...",finance

personalfinance,Just checking that I'm doing my taxes right... tax refund is x3 lower this year?,"In the past few years, I was getting a tax refund of around ~ $1500. This year, Turbo Tax is telling me my refund will be $500.

I started a new job in October, so between my two W2s, I made $73,232 and paid $9,457 in federal taxes. I also pay around $1k in student loan interest.

As a single person with the standard deduction, does this seem right?

I'm just trying to understand why my tax refund is so much lower this year.

Edit: I am not complaining about this. I just don't understand what happened that caused the change and want to make sure I am doing everything correctly.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance or is there a better option?,"I have 2 mortgages left on my rental properties.  They are similar terms: $46k balance on each, about 15 years into 30 year terms, fixed interest rates of 6.5%.  P&amp;I of $400/mo each, roughly half going to interest.

I expect to have enough cash savings to pay off both loans by the end of next year.  Paying that $5kish/year in interest is annoying me, but paying to refinance for such a short time doesn't make sense.  Maybe if I could roll both notes into one loan, is that an option?  I'm sure I could find some private lender, but they'll probably want a higher interest rate than what banks are offering on investment property loans, so not worth the effort.

Any options I'm missing?  I wish I could just call the lenders and ask for a rate reduction, without having to go through a refinance, but I'm guessing they'll just laugh at me.

Thanks for reading, hoping someone sees something I'm missing!!",finance
personalfinance,Putting Money in Index Funds in Case PSLF Falls Through?,"I’m a second year medical resident (psychiatry) and have a high federal loan burden ~290k currently at 5.9% interest.

I have a savings of about $50k hat I’ve put in a high yield savings account.

I am considering starting to transfer my savings into a vanguard low cost index fund account as a means to save money to go towards loan payments if PSLF falls through. The interest on this account would likely be higher than my loan interest, especially if averaged out over the next 5-8 years (I would continue to contribute to this fund regularly and at higher amounts following residency). I’d continue to max my Roth (backdoor after residency) and meet my employer match until loans are payed off. Does this seem like a reasonable strategy?",finance
personalfinance,Home Refinance - On title with parents but not mortgage.,"My parents and I bought a house together (all three of us are on the title/deed?) last year with the agreement I would pay half.

I am, however making the payments.  Interest rate seems high to me at 4.4%.  What would be the best way to refinance and drop that rate?  I would like to be on the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

I was extremely confused by how they have everything laid out and didn't see how to exchange these funds to where I should. I was trying to put that into a different fund (Wasn't positive where yet but something like total stock or such funds.) Either way I couldn't figure it out, and ended up buying VOO with basically as much as I had in funds. At this point I assume that is not how this works. I'm used to my employer 401k's (TSP) that you just select a fund in a drop down and you go about your day and this is nothing like that. I think I found out how to exhange funds, whic haccordign to the investing - IRA wiki it says to throw it all in a  Vanguard Target Retirement Fund... unless you have over 50k.

personalfinance,Received a Financial Gift; Pregnant/Married in Grad School,"Hi Financial Wizards,

I received an unexpected check of 9,000. I'm not sure if I should put $3000 of this toward my student loans, keep it in savings, or invest some of it (?).  We have no other debt and total income of 55k. 

I have four student loans. (1) \~$470 w/interest rate of 4.6%. (2) 2,630 w/interest rate of 4.6% (3) 5,369 w/interest rate of 3.8% (4) 5, 360 w/interest rate of 3.6%. 

Does it make sense to pay off (1) and (2) and then start making monthly payments (they are technically deferred b/c I'm enrolled full time) of $100 on the other two? Or are the interests rates low enough that I should use my money in other/more lucrative ways?

**BACKGROUND (not strictly necessary to read!)**

I'm married--he has an okay job working in shipping (makes about $40k) and I make between 25-28k as a PhD student. I also receive $500/month from a relative (I have asked them to stop, but they send it anyway. This is largely how we have built up savings). We rent in a HCOL area. We currently pay 1470 but are moving b/c baby, probably to a 2br in the same complex at 1680/mo. We are looking into a house purchase at some point, but likely will not be buying until I graduate and we move somewhere with a lower COL/better housing options. We pay for utilities as well, a few subscriptions (netflix, student acct w/hulu/spotify/showtime, HBO), all the usual stuff like groceries/clothing/gas and use credit card (cash back) for most spending that we pay off every month. 

We have a good chunk of savings currently (about 16k). We have older vehicles ('07 camry and '10 Silverado) in decent shape, mostly due to the fact that my spouse keeps them up and can fix most things himself. No plans to purchase vehicles in the next 2-3 years unless necessary. 

We are expecting. I will have paid maternity leave next fall and will return to school/work in Spring (my department is very supportive!). My husband works an offbeat schedule (usually 5:00am-3:00 or so PM). I anticipate needing some childcare but not full-time, since my only out of the house responsibility will be teaching 2-3 days/week for 1.5 hours. I'm hoping to find an in-home day care or nanny/sitter. In 2021-2022 I anticipate needing a similar amount of childcare since I will be in the dissertation phase with some teaching, I will not have to attend class.  

There will be some baby related purchases in the near future. I would like to get all furniture used and most baby items used as well. I anticipate getting hand-me-downs from older siblings who have kids a bit older too. I'm not sure how much we will end up spending, but don't see it being much more than $5000.

I would like to start a modest 529 plan for the little one once they're here and contribute a small amount monthly. 

My husband has a retirement account, but I'm not clear on the details. It has only been set up for a couple of years so we essentially have no investments/retirement accounts.",finance

In 2019 she made less than I did. Collectively we made almost $38k in 2019 and currently owe $860 federally(we haven't gotten to state yet). We both had no medical benefits last year from our employers and she only had $100 in a 401k from an old job that we aren't putting back into a 401k. Our jobs last year was a behavioral health for my wife, and I was an IT intern. She also has student loans from FedLoan which is getting paid monthly at a more than minimal requirement amount. We got married last year if that helps with any suggestions with plan(hopes) to be looking at homes 

So my questions are:

Should we not file jointly this year?

Since she made less is there something different we should do?

What can be done differently to our current checks for 2020 withholding to not owe as much?

Should I make sure I'm not marked head of household?

Is there anything else I'm not thinking of that I should ask?",finance
personalfinance,Parents helping pay for graduate school - best options?,"Hi there r/personalfinance,

I'm helping out my significant other with some research and thought this would be a good place to ask some questions. My girlfriend just got into graduate school, total cost is ~80-100k over 2 years. She was approved for the maximum unsub federal grad loans (20.5k per year @ 6.08% I believe). Now, her parents are offering to pay for half of her schooling, and we are trying to figure out the best/cheapest/smartest way to accomplish that. It seems there are a few options:

1. She takes out private student loans herself (potentially co-signed by parents for a lower rate?) and parents help her pay her loans monthly. 

2. Parents take out parent loans (Parent PLUS or private?) for half of her schooling costs. 

3. She takes out federal Grad PLUS @7.08% and parents help pay half of her loans.

What are your thoughts on what is best? From my research, it seems option 1 would give the lowest rate and boost her credit some, but I've heard some negative things about private loan servicers. Option 2 basically absolves her of any real liability on the loans. Option 3 would be simple and all through federal with good income drive repayment options etc. 

Is there something I'm overlooking? What are your thoughts on what is best, and why? If she can take out private loans for the entirety of her costs at a lower interest rate, would it be worth it? Thanks in advance.

Edit: downvotes for trying to figure out the best options for student loans? Really?",finance

**QUESTION: How would you invest in a taxable account in terms of asset allocation considering a high federal and state income tax bracket (Maryland)?** 

*Background*

Ages: 32/31

Desired Asset Allocation: 60%/20%/20% US Stocks/International Stocks/Bonds

Base Combined Income:  $435,000.00

Possible Additional Bonus Compensation: $40,000.00-$140,000.00

*Current Financial Portfolio*

Cash Reserves: $172,794.00 ($160,000.00 set aside for anticipated new home purchase closing costs)

403b/457b: $229,010.38

Roth IRAs: $46,083.47

Estimated Home Value: $170,000.00 (paid off)

\*\* We are probably going to sell this, but may keep as rental if we can outsource work and have 0 headaches. It is a sketchy area so not ideal renter clientele. Also, my wife wants to buy in a competitive area that is hard to get offers accepted that are contingent on selling one's home. It drives me nuts that we have so much money parked in cash and our home since we have missed out partially on a historic bull market. However, my wife is much less risk tolerant so it is what it is :).  \*\*

&amp;#x200B;

*Gameplan going forward*

We are a bit off our desired asset allocation. I usually re-balance every 6 months. However, now that we are going to start monthly contributions to a taxable account I was thinking of re-balancing by buying funds in the taxable instead of selling within the 403b/457b. I have changed our asset allocations to our 403b/457s to 80/20 split between VINIX/VBTLX. My plan was to buy combinations of VTIAX, VTSAX and VTEAX as a methodology to get to our desired asset allocation as above. However, I am not sure if VTEAX Tax-Exempt Bond Index fund within the taxable account is the best approach. Rather, should I instead rebalance to have the bonds all parked in the 403b/457s? We will be contributing all our additional cash above $160,000.00 for the foreseeable future.

personalfinance,Debt consolidation - a few questions,"Hi all! I'm in debt, and I want it to go away. Bad. I have about 5 different sources of debt and it is very difficult to manage minimum payments at my pay of $13 an hour (small raise and bump to full time coming soon!). I've decided to pursue a debt consolidation loan through my personal credit union, Penfed.

What I want to know is this - what should I do before I make any payments to my creditors? Obviously i want to pay them all off, but is it worth calling them and trying to negotiate a smaller settlement due to a one time payment, or should I bite the bullet and just pay completely? If i were to negotiate, how do I justify them giving me a discount when the debt is rightfully mine and I 100% owe them every penny?",finance

investing,Impact of Interest Rate Cuts on Demand Shock vs Supply Shock,"I don’t think we’re on the cusp of another Great Recession and after reading these two paragraphs (quote below), I wonder if further rate cuts will really move the needle for the economy. Basically, the Fed (and PBOC et al.) can further flood the market with even more cheap money, and with less consumables available (thanks beer flu, manufacturing slowdown, etc.) and consumer confidence being a big factor in propping up the economy, will further rate cuts really help?

With the 11% slide of the S&amp;P in the last seven sessions, and the markets betting that a 25-50 basis point cut is almost a guarantee, rate cuts seem like they’re bound to happen. I just question the efficacy of lower rates in a supply-shocked economy - though, it may be great for the stock market in the near term.  But 1-2 years...?

I know there are a lot of factors to consider and am genuinely curious on everyone’s take.

**Quote:**

&gt;The Great Recession of 2008 and 2009 was largely a “demand shock,” as banks neared collapse, home prices plunged and trillions of dollars in household wealth were wiped out. People and businesses suddenly had less money to spend, tipping the economy into a deep recession.  
&gt;  
&gt;The virus threat is a “supply shock” — one that stems from a sudden slowdown in economic activity as China, the world’s factory, struggles to get back to work and as crucial industries come under strain against a backdrop of travel restrictions, limited public gatherings and shuttered schools.

personalfinance,Taxes question - married filing jointly vs separate greatly changes refund vs owing money,"So my husband and I noticed last night that married filing jointly this year makes us owe about $5000 in state and federal combined. Which I don't get. Last year it was the opposite, nice tax refund. 

He changed jobs mid year in 2019 so we now make about the same (90k vs 94k). Would this change affected our tax refund vs owing by that much even with the job change mid year? Nothing else financially changed during the year (I switched to his employer paid healthcare plan, not sure if that matters though). 

Quickly redid with married filing separately and it shows owing $1600 federal a refund of $2200 in state. This makes zero sense to me but obviously if filing separately this year makes more sense we'll do it. What I don't understand is why we would possibly have to owe, we didn't change anything except the job. We didn't change from a ""1"" to a ""0"" on our W4. Would love to understand what is going on and how to never have to end up paying the government again come this time of year. I'm sure there is an obvious explanation, just looking for some answers:)

Thanks for the help!",finance
personalfinance,Recently getting robocalls with death threats including my personal information. What to do?,"Over the past four days, I have been receiving robocalls containing threats of bodily harm and property damage, including references to my SSN, date of birth, full name, home address, and my party affiliation. This is very scary because death threat phone calls are dangerous. But I have reason to believe these are robocalls. The phone calls contain strong language such as ""if you do not pay us $1,500, we may consider sending a Hitman to your address to invoke extreme and persistent damage to you and your love ones or even opt to open fraudulent bank and credit accounts in your name. We may even make fraudulent credjt freezes to prevent you from intervening.""

personalfinance,Looking for decent interest and low risk,"A little about my situation: I'm married, between the 2 of use we gross about 80k/year (net around $74,000). We own 2 homes in creative circumstances (split with my sister), 1 we live in and the other we rent. Total mortgages we pay for the 2 homes is about 4,500/month. The rental brings in about $4,400/month. If you slap those things together my housing is very cheap. In ""reality"" I pay about $900/month to my sister in ""rent"", and she pays me about $500. It's creative, but it works for us.  

On to what I'm actually asking about: I've got about $30k sitting in my checking account at some abysmal interest rate. This account used to just be about $10k as an emergency fund, but I recently started working again (my wife was the only one working for a couple years while I got our daughter up to school age). With the second income that bank account has grown nicely, but I'm sure taking no interest on the 20K I don't need as an emergency fund is a waste.  

We're looking to use this money as a down payment on a new home some time in the next 2-5 years. We have other investments we can call in for that as well. I would prefer if the money could be made available to in a matter of weeks if needed, but if it is a much better deal to grab something like a 3 year CD I'd probably be willing to take the lock-in.  

Basically what I'm looking for is a high interested savings account or a money market account that will get me 1% or 2% interest. It would be great if it was something I could just keep adding to as well, so every time the bank account goes over 15K or so I can add 5K to the investment account.  

I'm open to any ideas or suggestions for my situation. Thanks in advance.",finance
worldpolitics,How should we manage boomer bucks aka Federal Reserve Money?,"It’s inevitable that boomer bucks will he inserted into the stock market. But how active this program is and who benefits the most can still be fought for.

A big reason for the stock market’s growth the last few years due to apps that cater to individual retails from their phone. We need financial policies that empower these communities against predatory financial systems who charge high fees and provide no transparency.

For example, I need at least a 25k balance to be a pattern trader? That’s ridiculous! Why is a bank being given an unfair advantage?

An active Federal Reserve in the market will continue the acceleration of the wealth gap. And if alternative path isn’t decided soon, the Fed policies will again benefit only those who own equities. 

The URL below shows a bunch of stats on age groups and stock ownership. It also says a lot about income brackets and stocks too.

The URL shows that most stocks are owned by boomers. With an active Fed, the banks will expand boomer wealth grows faster than millennials. If you’re poor, the wealth of the rich will accelerate faster than yours.

personalfinance,How to I minimize the amount of interest I’m paying on my car loan?,"Totaled my car late last year. Tried to make a logical financial move for the long run and decided to finance a used car.

The car cost me about $12,500 at 8%. I took out a loan for five years. Minimum payments are $215, and I thought if I made $250 payments for now it will be helpful. I just realized a good portion of my payments, $65-$80 goes straight to interest.

I'd make larger payments, but I'm currently working on my student loans. I know the rule of thumb is to pay the loan with the highest interest, but my student loans are 3 times the loan and I rather knock those out first.

Is it possible to refinance my auto loan? Any advice in how to save the most? Just for reference, my other two students loans are:

Private student loan: $18,300 @ 4.3%

Federal student loan: $12,500 @ 4.4%",finance
personalfinance,"If I loan money at a set interest rate for an investment, do I minus the inflation rate off of that to get the 'real' interest rate?","Title should say I’m BORROWING 

For example, a $400k loan at 4% and inflation at 1.5%.Am I paying $16k a year in interest, or do I adjust it against inflation for the 'real' number of $10k in interest?

Looking at buying a second property in a few years which I will rent out and I'd like to do the numbers but I'm unsure of how to get the 'real' and adjusted numbers on costs and returns.Additionally - If my property goes up by 5%, did it (my purchasing power) really go up by 3.5% with an inflation rate of 1.5%?

All these figures are probably over-simplified. Or maybe not. Idk, I'm in way over my head.

If anyone has links which explains this stuff that would be great, I couldn't find much with a quick google unfortunately

Thank you!

worldpolitics,Equities versus cash,"If you were a boomer with savings in the stock market, why wouldn’t you sell right now?

Yeah, holding cash and low yielding investments will lose to inflation, but as boomer retirements near and incomes decline, and old age becomes common, liquid cash is what’s needed to pay expenses. The whole narrative around holding equities and saving money in pensions was to have money to spend for the reasons.

However, this realization does support the idea that US equities is the world’s best store of value. If this store of value was more liquid, than the sell-off to cash wouldn’t be necessary.

I wonder if anyone has a solution for this...of that’s right — there is one! In fact, there’s many. So many blockchain companies have been innovating and building liquid equities using smart contracts. Ideas like Facebook’s Libra is a way to turn illiquid equities into a currency like product.

We’ll see who evolves faster. The Federal Reserve has a lot of pressure to save the legacy pluming of the US and global market. They can pump it arbitrarily but this strategy can only go so far. Demographics and real world events will continue to act against slow moving central bankers.

We’ll see on Monday. Is the Federal Reserve going to reverse last week’s losses? Will  the Fed fight against sell pressure?

Will the virus continue to impact supply chains and behaviors of market participants? Will inflated equities continue to drop until we reach an equilibrium?

personalfinance,"I may have to pay for my final year at my University, about $9k/semester, and I’ve only got about $2k saved up.","So I have had small subsidized loans (totaling about $25k) for the first four years of my undergraduate studies, but I’m taking an extra year to graduate and my parents will not be helping me pay for the final year. Should I take a break from school to save up that money? 
I live at home, I work tutoring at $15/hr and barely get 3-6 hrs in per week. It’s just $200/month of spending money, I save most of it as I don’t spend it on frivolous things. However with helping my parents with groceries and gas and then sometimes going out with friends/SO, the savings aren’t substantial. 

There’s a few options I can go for, if I declare myself as financially independent on my FAFSA this year, do I get more loans from the government? Would I be eligible for grants? 

I could take out a private loan, as job perspective for my field would be very good once I graduate, and I would probably be able to pay off the private loan. I just really don’t want to have to do this. My credit is great and I’m terrified of how high interest rates can be for private loans. I don’t want to end up worse off than I am now, in the off chance that I don’t graduate within my intended field of study. 

And the final option is taking a break from school to work and build up the money to then pay for my last year. I just don’t know how long it would take me to build up about $20k worth of savings. 

Another option is working full time while attending school part time. Or doing both full-time?

What seems like the best course of action for me right now?
