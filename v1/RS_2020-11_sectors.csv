business,Bread Seller,"I'm working middle management in a SoCal supermarket and recently I'm given charge of a bakery inside the store. My responsibilities are ordering and selling (finished and semi/finished products depending on category), scheduling for employees and checking for compliance with health department and company regulations. The second and third parts are easy. The problem is that I have no idea how to make or sell bread.

From my previous observations of this bakery, I know that: 

1. The products are subpar quality both for their taste and visual appeal and there's not much to be done about it because the bakers must cook according to a strict SoP designed by HQ. The price tags for these shitty breads are not cheap. The profit margin is thin because of the high cost HQ charge us.
2. The employees are mostly bored women in their 50s waiting for retirement. Minimum wage with no chance for raises and being short staffed means that they are not at all motivated to work harder than normal or take on extra responsibilities. They're also prone to get in arguments about ""who does what and what isn't my job"" with one another. 
3. Among other cheat tactics, HQ would occasionally force shit products that nobody orders to the bakery and charge full cost (or a generous 5% off) for it, all the while demanding sales and profit to grow because of the ""extra push"". 

 I don't know the products (\~400 total, of which \~200 are being sold regularly), I don't know the baking process or how much work it takes to produce. I'm not a shopper, I don't follow sales, I don't know what's attractive to customers because I'm never attracted as a customer. I always buy what I need when I need and bread's never been on that list. I'm also terrible at shilling products to strangers. I'd tell the customer that the bread is shit and they can get something better for cheaper next door.

I'm used to mostly pushing papers and handling maintenance, HR and customer service. I have access to the store's finances and have looked in to it, but not so much as to be very familiar with it. I still keep my old responsibilities so I've only got about 3 hours a day to learn and run this bakery. 

Any suggestions on what I should work on and how would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,My student loan interest rates have changed?,"I have around $53k left in student loans (originally \~$68k). They are all federal loans, some subsidized and some unsubsidized. I have always had a running loan amortization calculator going in Excel because that's just something I like to do.

CryptoCurrency,Invest in Crypto without investing in a specific currency,"Hi all,  


I am a believer that e-cash/cryptos will be one of the solutions for the overhaul of the financial system. But I do not believe that a non-government (FED/ECB) regulated currency (like most of the current coins like Bitcoin etc) will be the final widely accepted payment solution.  


  
My question, therefore, is **if there is a way to invest** in the technology without investing in currencies. I think that investing in Bitcoin is not really investing, but rather speculation. Of course, Bitcoin can serve as a good general proxy for the crypto tech, but I would rather not.  


Do not know if crypto ""etfs"" exist nor if they make sense.  If you could educate me on the matter, that would be great.

MachineLearning,"[D] NEAT vs HyperNEAT applicability for non-cartesian, sensorial input","I am currently refactoring the [UnityNEAT](https://github.com/lordjesus/UnityNEAT) repository. While refactoring I thought about adding the option to use HyperNEAT + CPPN's instead of just NEAT, hoping to get better performing agents within my experiments, with more organic/pattern like movement. 

The UnityNEAT project uses an example experiment, in which cars are evolved to drive around a racetrack. I believe that this example is a good approximation of the average use case for NEAT in Unity. Sensory input (approx. 5-20 inputs) and output which is actuating locomotion, either by rotating/moving the whole entity, or just parts of it (such as within Karl Sims' Evolved Virtual Creatures). Personally, I am extremely interested in the latter and would love to get some creatures made out of joints, muscles and bones to evolve interesting locomotion, for which I can imagine the HyperNEAT symmetries and patterns could be beneficial.

UnityNEAT also benefits a lot from the observability of the training process - the NEAT evolution happens fast enough to be exciting to watch and to witness improvement.

In some papers I have read that HyperNeat specifically takes cartesian coordinates as an input, i.e. the configuration of the Substrate. But since with Unity the aim should be sensorial input, I am questioning the applicability of HyperNEAT in the Unity project for the sake of evolving movement altogether, since in most projects one wouldn't input coordinates, but rather sensory input.

I am contemplating whether it is even necessary for this use case to implement CPPN's into UnityNEAT. Hopefully someone can help shine some light on my situation:

* How much would the evolution process get slowed down when using HyperNEAT instead of NEAT?
* How would one design a Substrate for an entity that is fed with only sensorial input (e.g. 5 angled, raycasted distances) and actuates movement - i.e. inputs that are not taken from some cartesian space? Is that even possible with HyperNeat, or does it defeat its purpose?

stocks,Bloomberg: The U.S. stock market could be headed for a lost decade,"""When the history of the modern financial era is written, there’s one comment that’s almost certain to merit inclusion: “Stocks only go up!”

Sports-blogger turned day-trader Dave Portnoy’s pithy observation this summer was designed to both amuse and provoke. But if you’ve put money into U.S. stocks since the market bottomed out in 2009, the chances are you think Portnoy is basically correct. Plenty of professional asset managers would concur. 

Perhaps the most important question for those considering investing savings today, when stocks are by some metrics among the most expensive they’ve ever been, is whether Portnoy’s philosophy is about to be turned on its head. In other words: “what if stocks don’t always go up?”

There are reasons to think this fantastic period for the U.S. stock market might soon be followed by a prolonged hangover, possibly lasting a decade or more. Such a stretch of disappointing equity returns would have profound implications for millennials and generation Z. The standard advice around financial planning and retirement saving that’s worked so well lately — put your money in an index fund that tracks the market and forget about it — might no longer work so well.

In the past decade, investors who bought an index fund that mirrors the S&amp;P 500 Index and reinvested dividends have enjoyed a 13% average annual return, according to Bloomberg data.

Even a deadly global pandemic that’s triggered a deep recession and widespread unemployment only briefly interrupted the ascendancy of U.S. stocks. The Federal Reserve rode to the rescue once more, and the S&amp;P 500 hit fresh record highs (though lately investors have since grown cautious again). Young investors may conclude that bumper returns are all but guaranteed in the years ahead. If only steadily rising stock prices were always the case. Consider the FTSE 100, an index of some of Britain’s preeminent pharmaceutical, energy, mining and consumer goods companies. In price terms (ignoring the impact of reinvesting dividends for a second), the U.K. benchmark is lower now than it was two decades ago. It’s not alone.

The Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark also remains beneath its dot-com-era peak while the MSCI emerging markets index topped out in 2007 and has yet to recover. The market that really refutes Portnoy’s assertion though is Japan: The Nikkei 225 index remains about 40% below its 1989 peak, when a massive financial bubble burst.

""Stocks Only Go Up""?

Following a financial bubble Japanese investors suffered years of poor returns

Could the U.S. market face a similar fate? There’ve been bleak periods before, most famously in the two decades that followed the 1929 Wall Street crash.

Long Hangover

U.S. stocks took a long time to recover from the 1929 Wall Street crash

As recently as 2012 the S&amp;P 500 was below its 2000 peak. Value-orientated asset managers like GMO’s Jeremy Grantham think something similar could happen again, but it’s not just well-known Cassandras who worry. Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates and Blackstone’s vice chairman Tony James have both warned about a “lost decade” for equity investors. 

If you’d followed GMO’s advice in 2013 to steer clear of American large-cap stocks and load up on emerging market shares, you’d have missed out on seven years of stellar returns. So what’s different now? 1. Extreme valuations Equity valuations have grown even more extreme. During the pandemic, they have become completely divorced from economic fundamentals thanks to the Federal Reserve’s largess. A stock market bubble pulls forward expected returns from the future, setting investors up for probable disappointment later on. “It’s exactly when past returns are most glorious that future prospects are most dismal,” investor John Hussman, another famously bearish investment manager wrote recently. He’s described today’s menu of choices for passive, long-term investors as “the worst in history.”

Expensive Stocks

U.S stock valuations aren't at dotcom era levels, but they're certainly not cheap

The CAPE ratio uses a ten-year average of inflation-adjusted earnings to smooth out short-term noise

 1. Ultra-low interest rates Low interest rates are often portrayed as bullish for stocks because they boost the value of future corporate cash flows in today’s money and reduce the cost of servicing debt. But with U.S. short-term rates now at zero, the Federal Reserve may find it harder to juice the stock market. Ultra-low rates also reflect pessimism about future economic prospects. “When real rates are low, future returns on equities and bonds tend to be lower rather than higher,” Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton wrote in Credit Suisse’s 2020 compendium of past market returns. “Investors should assume a sober view of the likely excess returns equities can generate from here.”

 2. Profit margin reversion A key determinant of equity returns, profit margins have been unusually high over the past couple of decades. But corporate profits have now suffered a massive hit due to the pandemic. Even without the virus, those oversize earnings should eventually dwindle as competitors spy an opportunity. Monopoly power may hinder this, but dominant tech companies are starting to face more competition and stricter antitrust enforcement. Globalization is also in retreat and workers are demanding are a fairer split of the rewards of capitalism.

 3. An aging population This is often considered a key reason for Japan’s prolonged stock market slump. Although the U.S. is aging less rapidly, the demographic changes underway are bound to have an impact on future equity returns. An aging population may be less productive, lowering potential economic growth. Furthermore, by 2030 the large and asset-rich U.S. baby boomer generation will all be over the age of 65, and they may need to cut their exposure to risky stocks or sell financial assets to fund their retirement, weighing on prices.

While this all sounds bleak, it’s some comfort that over the very long term stocks have tended to go up. In nominal terms, one dollar invested in the U.S. market in 1900 was worth $58,000 by 2019, according to the Credit Suisse market returns study, or an annualized 6.5% return when adjusted for inflation. In the meantime, there are a few things young investors can do to avoid being caught out by a duff decade for U.S. stocks. For starters, if returns are lower I’m afraid you’ll also need to save more to build wealth. Consider adding some exposure to non-U.S. equities, which may at last be due a period of outperformance relative to the U.S. And by reinvesting dividends you can still obtain decent returns even if stock prices go nowhere. (The FTSE 100 has fallen 19% since the turn of the millennium, but investors who reinvested dividends received a 63% return in that period.) Hopefully, the gloomy scenario I’ve painted won’t materialize and U.S. companies will develop new technologies that power the economy and the stock market to new heights in the next decade. But if that doesn’t happen, you’ll be prepared.""

investing,"Anyone else tired of hearing about how ""overvalued"" the stock market is?","I don't mean just in terms of the recovery over the last six months... Even pre-COVID, couldn't help but hear about how PE ratios and the Shiller CAPE are near historical highs. But isn't it silly to consider those valuation signals without the context of interest rates? After all, the biggest alternative to equities is bonds. Given that bonds are near historical low yields, isn't it to be expected that stocks be at historical high valuations? The way I see it, [the spread between (stock) earnings yields and bond yields](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf) is substantially higher than it has been in the past, implying that stocks are undervalued.

financialindependence,"Thinking of taking a 6 month career break / mini-FIRE, but scared in these times","I have enough liquid savings to cover my current lifestyle for 1.5 to 2 years including health insurance. I'm a tech product manager and been experiencing major burnout/stress since Feb of this year. I started seeing a therapist in July who has helped me manage my mental health during the pandemic and other personal stressors in my life. He's fantastic and helped me get through a lot of shit outside of work. Now, work is really the only stressor in my life.

I've been job searching for almost 6 months as well. I'm exhausted and drained in both my job search and my work. I find myself longing for the weekends and weeknights, where I can do things that fulfill me more. I don't like feeling this way. I'm the type of person that wants to enjoy their work, so I'm considering taking a 6 month career break or mini-FIRE to do that. My goal with FIRE is not to stop work entirely, but to have the freedom to work on anything I want to w/o worrying about the money. I'd want to volunteer my tech skills to charities and spend more time with family/friends and on my hobbies.

The grass sounds greener on the other side, but I'm scared of taking the jump because of COVID. I have a handful of friends who have been unemployed since the pandemic started and they've been job searching since then. I also worry that it'll be 5X harder to get a job after my 6 month break, especially during these times. I feel many people will say to me that ""I should be grateful that I even have a job"" and I get very mixed feelings hearing that. I'd rather not have this job and I would gladly give this job away to someone else who desperately needs it.

Any thoughts or advice people can give? I was unemployed for 5 months before although I was job searching the entire time. This time, I'd want to treat it as a mini-FIRE, so I'd stop the job search entirely to focus on how I'd live my life as if I achieved FIRE.

Current spending is at the moment
Student loan : €75 per week, due to be completed in October 2022. No interest rate.
Diesel for car : €50 per week


I have an emergency savings fund of €3200 with a further €1800 due for medical tax in the next 4-6 weeks.

A further €100 is also set aside for travelling as well. After 3 years, this would amount to 15000 which I intend to use for 6-12 months of backpacking however long I can last it for.

Mortgage saving : €300
Travel fund : €100

personalfinance,Home mortgage: Case for down payment versus liquidity,"**Short version**: What is the argument for making a large down payment rather than maintain a cash reserve and simply make extra monthly payments toward principle?

**Discussion:** Received wisdom for a home mortgage seems to be to aim for a 20% down payment. The main advantage of this seems to be to avoid paying PMI and getting a somewhat lower interest rate. But, 20% can be pretty daunting in a lot of metro areas, it locks up a lot of cash, and mortgage rates right now are already extremely low. 

So, if you can't get to 20% to avoid PMI *plus* a comfortable buffer/emergency fund, I'm trying to understand whey you would do anything more than the minimum, and keep a larger cash reserve. 

Say you *could* make a 10-20% down payment, but instead you make the lowest the lender will go with (maybe 3.5% FHA or 5% conventional). Then, from net income and/or from savings *not* allocated to down payment, you simply make extra payments toward principle each month and/or put it into some investment vehicle to close the difference in interest. Then in an emergency, if you experience reduced income or there's damage to the property, you can simply go back to the minimum payment or cover it from the reserve. 

Short of avoiding the PMI penalty (which you could get rid of after a few years anyway), retaining the flexibility of cash seems like a better strategy, especially given the opportunity costs of alternative uses (at least at these interest rates). The downside seems to be that a long-running downturn could become expensive in terms of interest--but committing tens of thousands in down payment would also leave you more vulnerable. 

Am I missing something obvious?",finance
investing,Beyond doom and gloom: A nuanced discussion of multifamily rentals / REITs in very high cost of living cities (VCOL),"Obligatory disclaimer: “predicting is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future”, and I’ve been very wrong before (most recently about the market rebound). But it’s fun to have a discussion and what else is there to do now that it’s cold with a COVID surge?  
&amp;nbsp;

Full disclosure: Despite my arguments below, I hold modest positions in several of the apartment rental REITs. One reason is simply to hedge against me being wrong. I also think there’s a gap between the eventual modest decline in valuations and the 40-50% decline we’ve seen in luxury coastal apartment REITs (Essex, Avalon, Equity). The public REITs have investment grade credit rating, and several of them (Equity, Avalon) have recently issued debt at ~2% due to the accommodative corporate credit environment. Many also have suburban portfolios which could prosper from the urban departures.

This is clearly ridiculous. “Cities” are the engines of economic growth in every developed economy. The 100 largest metropolitan areas contain 65% of the US population and 68% of total economic activity (and closer to 75+% of patents, intellectual property development, etc). Cities as a whole will continue to grow and expand in the United States as they have for the past 200 years. 

On the flip side, not all cities are created equally. I think a very reasonable question to ask is how will the multifamily real estate markets in very high cost of living cities (VCOL), loosely defined as San Francisco, NYC, Boston, and maybe LA fare in the near future? 

I’m personally a big believer that external shocks very rarely generate new trends but tend to accelerate existing underlying ones. And when looking at the future of VCOL areas we have a story about demographics, affordability, schools / child care, job dispersion, supply, and immigration. 

&amp;nbsp;

# Thesis 

My thesis is that VCOL, and in particular the dense urban cores, will see flat to negative growth in populations, rent, and condo prices as Millennials age into child-rearing years and move to areas with more affordable housing / better schools. Older generations will continue their preference for warmer, lower tax areas while foreign immigration remains depressed. This trend will be compounded by the increase in luxury rental units as projects initiated in 2018, 2019, and early 2020 move onto the market. More flexible work from home policies will also contribute modestly to this trend, but is not the main driver. Single family housing, even in VCOL areas, will likely be unaffected due to severe supply constraints. 

&amp;nbsp;

I see Millennials primarily moving to 3 distinct areas of the country:

- Cheaper areas outside the urban core in Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), e.g. Worcester MA in the larger Boston metro area, suburban areas in NJ adjacent to NYC, etc. 
- Smaller, emerging high-tech cities such as Pittsburgh, Boise, etc. that offer relatively affordable housing, walkable communities, and often close proximity to national parks, ski areas, etc. 
- Sunbelt / Southern “mega-cities’ such as Phoenix, Austin, Atlanta, etc. with affordable housing and booming populations 

# What do the public markets say?

One of the features (not a bug) of private real estate is that it moves much more slowly and is oftentimes uncorrelated with public markets. Case in point, residential housing prices peaked in the US around 2006-2007 and then decreased until 2012 (i.e. 3-4 years after the stock market and other public markets fully reflected the valuation shifts). Luckily for today’s investors, one major difference between 2008 and today is that we have large, national, publicly traded REITs in both the apartment and single family rental sectors. Even better, the apartment housing REITs have different geographic concentrations and economic consumers (i.e. luxury, affordable, student, etc.). We also have large, publicly traded companies involved in single family home building / renovations that are also great proxies for the single family housing market. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, how are apartment rental REITs in VCOL locations doing? The first one to consider is Essex Property Trust (ESS), a member of the S&amp;P 500. They have luxury apartments primarily in LA &amp; San Francisco (~75%) and also in Seattle (~25%). They are down ~40% from their all time high in February. Next up is Avalon Bay (AVB), the largest apartment REIT, which owns luxury apartments in VCOL coastal areas in Boston, NYC, SF, etc. They are down ~40% from their all time high. Equity Apartments, similar to AvalonBay but with a slightly worse credit rating of BBB+, is down ~50%. UDR, another coastal luxury apartment REIT, is also down ~40%. If you read the most recent earnings calls from Equity / Avalon, one thing they both cite is their high rental collection rate (~98%) and the high household income of their tenants (~$150,000). 

&amp;nbsp;

Let’s contrast that to the sunbelt / mid Atlantic luxury REITs: Camden Property (CPT) and Mid America Apartments (MAA). These REITs have extensive holdings in Texas, Florida, Phoenix, etc. Mid America is down ~22% while Camden is down ~25%. 

&amp;nbsp;

The market is currently discounting luxury apartment rentals in VCOL by almost 2x the rate as more affordable sunbelt / Southern cities. This is despite the fact that rental collection rates remain high and that these properties have affluent tenants who are least likely to be affected by the recession. 

&amp;nbsp;

The contrast is even more stark when comparing against single family rental REITs, the largest of which is Invitation Homes (a spinoff of Blackstone, INVH). They own ~90,000 homes across the Sunbelt, upper mid-west, and more affordable areas of the West. They are down only 9% off of all time highs. The US home construction ETF from I-shares (ITB) which tracks home developers such as Lennox and home supply stores like Lowes actually set an all time high in September 2020. 

&amp;nbsp;

The bottom line is that public markets suggest that luxury, apartment rental housing companies have lost 20-50% of their pre-pandemic value, with VCOL losing almost twice the value of luxury rentals in booming sunbelt / southern cities. In contrast, single family home rentals remain extremely strong with valuations of home building companies trading at all time highs. 

As an aside, if you’re bullish on VCOL areas I would strongly suggest purchasing these REITs. The dividend yields are ~4.5% which is the widest spread over 10 year treasuries (0.8%) in many years. If you listen to the earnings call from Equity, Avalon, etc. you’ll also hear the CEOs cite the high private market valuations of their properties. If the market is wrong you’ll lock in relatively high dividend rates with price appreciation. 


# Demographics 

Even before the pandemic, VCOL had stagnant or modestly declining populations. Government census records estimate that NYC lost ~76,000 residents in 2019, a drop of around 0.4%. It’s worth noting that NYC  has for years experienced net negative domestic migration, but foreign immigration balanced out the departures. The Boston metro region stayed flat while San Francisco declined slightly (~0.2%). While economically vibrant, the populations of these cities had clearly started to plateau and even modestly decline prior to the pandemic. There’s a nice graph at rent cafe that summarizes the metros with the highest and lowest net migration over the past decade. NYC and LA top the list, with Boston at the number 8 position. In contrast, the metros with the highest migration are Phoenix, Dallas, and Austin in the Top 5.  	

&amp;nbsp;

If we look at the composition of these cities, the largest age bracket is from 25-44: 37.5% in San Francisco, 33.2% in Boston, and 33% NYC. This essentially encompasses the millennial generation, who the census defines are born between 1981 - 1997 (~23 to 39). The millennial cohort comprises ~75 million individuals and is the largest generation since the baby boomers and significantly larger than the next generation, Gen-Z. 

&amp;nbsp;

The millennial cohort entered their mid-20s during and immediately after the Great Recession. Millennials with technical or advanced degrees flocked to the new “knowledge” jobs in tech, consulting, marketing, etc. at employers clustered in VCOL areas. With significant disposable income, these millennials fueled a rise in service industries that attracted other millennials to work as baristas, waiters, etc. At the same time, new single family home construction declined significantly due to the fallout from the housing bust. 

&amp;nbsp;

As a consequence rents held relatively steady during the financial crisis than surged during the recovery. As one data point, rents increased ~50%+ from 2010 to 2019 in SF. As Millennials willingly paid rapidly rising rents in these VCOL, a narrative emerged that millennial were somehow different. They were comfortable renting forever, they didn’t need much space, they believed in the sharing economy and wouldn’t purchase cars, etc. The data appeared to support this data, as the number of renters earning $150,000 increased at twice the rate as home owners.  

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately there is increasing evidence against this narrative. A linked MIT Sloan study suggests millennials may actually utilize vehicles more than older generations. The linked survey from ApartmentList suggests that over 90% of millennials want to own homes eventually. Millennials, based on all the studies and surveys I’ve seen, have similar aspirations as older generations. They want to eventually own, not rent, a residence and personal vehicle while raising children. All of these goals have simply been delayed due to financial constraints. 

As we’ll see in the next section, these aspirations are effectively impossible for the vast majority of millennials in VCOL areas. 

# Affordability:

There’s a popular stereotype that the average millennial is a 4 year college graduate, making $100,000+ in tech, who walks around in Patagonia vests sipping $5 lattes (fuller disclosure: this stereotype hits uncomfortable close to home). According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) only 44% of millennials even have 4 year or higher college degrees. Moreover, at age 39 (i.e. the oldest millennial), an income of $100,000 is in the top ~25% of incomes. The median net worth of the prime home buying aged millennial (30-34) is only $35,000 (including home equity), while the 90th percentile of this group is only ~$260,000 (including home equity). In 1989 (when baby boomers were the equivalent age of Millennials today) they held about 21% of the wealth in the US. In contrast, Millennials today have ~3%. 

&amp;nbsp;

For the median millennia household, who has an income of ~$69,000 pre-pandemic, buying even a modest apartment in a VCOL is difficult to impossible without extensive family assistance. Let’s assume that most millennial households want to have at least 1 child (a Gallup poll found ~87% of millennials without children eventually wanted to have them). That means long term millennials are likely to settle in at least 2BR and more likely 3 BR and up apartments / homes. 

&amp;nbsp;

The median priced condo (not house) in VCOL areas (pre-pandemic) is approximately  ~$1.2 million in SF,  ~$650,000 in Boston, and ~$667,900 in NYC (Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens). This understates the lack of affordability, because these prices reflect a mixture of studios to 3+ BRs. I couldn’t find detailed sales pricing for condos segmented by number of bedrooms, but glancing at Zillow / Redfin the prices for 3BR apartments or single family homes across all VCOL areas seems to be at least $800k and above depending on quality, location, etc. 

&amp;nbsp;

Rents are luckily far more transparent. According to Zumper, the rents for 3BR apartments and above in VCOL (pre-pandemic) areas were ~$5,000 in SF, ~$3,500 in Boston, and ~$4,000 in NYC.  As an aside, if we use a 30% rent to income ratio than a millennial household would have to make at least $10,500 per month (or an annualized salary of $126,000) to rent a 3 BR in the cheapest VCOL area. For households with families in 2017 between 30-35, an income of $126,000 is at the 80th percentile. As we’ll see in the next section, childcare dramatically adds to a households costs. 

&amp;nbsp;

So let’s focus our analysis on the wealthiest 10% of millennials (who coincidentally are also most likely to have affluent parents who can assist with a home down payment). These millennials, particularly those in the prime family formation years of 30-35, make over $170,000+. Given the well documented trend in associative mating, they are also likely to partner with other high income millennials. Let’s assume that ~5% of millennial households make  &gt;$200,000 per year (for comparison, the top 10% of all households made over $200,000 in 2019). These households can easily afford even San Francisco rental prices. And at first glance, a millennial household making $200,000 could save for a downpayment of a $1 million dollar home (~$240,000) within ~6 years if they saved 20% of their gross income. But what about affording the monthly mortgage payment? 

&amp;nbsp;

As rough numbers, a household making $200,000 in Boston, MA would be left with $148,712 after taxes. If they maxed out their 401k, they would have $121,135 or ~$10,000 per month. Redfin estimates that a $1 million home in Boston will cost ~$4500 a month based on a 3%, 30 year mortgage and including home insurance + property taxes. If we assume maintenance + furnishings + misc expenses we can probably assume a total housing cost of ~$5500 per month. Our hypothetical household is thus left with ~$4500 per month to spend on food, entertainment, vehicles costs, etc. while also maxing our their 401k. 

Let’s assume there are roughly 31 million households between 25-39, so back of the envelope math suggests that there is a pool of 1.5 million households available to buy real estate in VCOL areas (5% of 31 million) if they could afford the down payment or receive family assistance. 

There is one giant impediment to that math though: affordable childcare and public schools. 

# Child Care

The biggest single reason in my opinion that millennials will leave VCOL urban areas is the the cost of childcare (averaging $2000 per month)  and the persistent poor performance of public schools.  

&amp;nbsp;

The premier public school districts continue to remain in the outer suburbs of urban areas. A list of the top 15 public school districts in America shows numerous school districts in suburbs surrounding Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, Boston, and Philadelphia. In contrast, public school districts in dense urban areas often receive mediocre ratings. 

The simplest alternative to these urban public schools is to pay for private school. Private school tuitions in VCOL areas range widely between ~$25k and ~$70k per child. These means a family of 4 could easily pay $50k or more in combined tuition, on top of the $66k ($5500 monthly) in housing expenses noted above. These two expenses alone would effectively consume the entire after tax income of a household making $200,000 per year. 

&amp;nbsp;

The crushing expense of childcare shows up in declining birth rates in VCOL. Since 2011, the number of babies born in NYC has declined 9%. San Francisco has the lowest share of children of any of the top 100 metros. Families with children older than 6 are in decline in high density urban areas. (There’s a great Atlantic article from Derek Thompson linked below) 

&amp;nbsp;

The bottom line is that for all but the wealthiest ~5% of millennial households settling down and raising a family in a VCOL area is essentially unaffordable without significant tradeoffs or parental support. Buying a modest home in a VCOL area, sending your children to private school, funding your retirement, and owning a modest vehicle combined requires a household income of close to $300,000. 

&amp;nbsp;

Before the hate mail begins, the key word in the sentence above is trade-offs. I’m well aware the maxing out a joint 401k is puts a household ahead of almost all other American families. Unlike some personal financial columnists, I’m in no way suggesting that earning $300,000 per year is close to poverty or any other nonsense like that. Clearly, earning $300,000 a year as a household is a rare privilege that lets you enjoy a very comfortable lifestyle. 

The point I’m making is that in a VCOL a $300,000 salary does not make you feel affluent. You’re still likely stressed about money, still having to save for years to afford a down payment, driving a modest vehicle, etc. Meanwhile, any of your friends who live in Austin, Denver, etc. are able to enjoy a more stereotypical upper middle class life. Not to mention that your friends who move to Boise, Pittsburgh, etc. likely feel flat out wealthy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Taxes are also worth a passing mention. Households making $200,000 in salary, maxing out both partners 401k, pay ~$10k in state / local taxes in VCOL areas (LA, SF, NYC, Boston). It’s worth noting that RSUs, i.e. the bulk of employees compensation at Big Tech firms, are taxed as regular income. Texas, Florida, Nevada, Washington, and New Hampshire all have no income taxes and most have booming metropolitan areas. The recent tax law changes passed by President Trump have also compounded the situation by increasing the standard deduction to $24,000 for married couples and capping the state and local tax deduction to $10k. 

# Job Dispersion:

As I mentioned above, the VCOL areas had stagnating or modestly declining populations even in 2019. In stark contrast, the sunbelt &amp; Southern cities are booming. Austin, TX experienced a 2.8% population increase in 2019. Denver, CO experienced a 1.5% population increase. Boise, Idaho was the fastest growing city in the US over the past decade. Even Orlando, FL is growing at over 1% a year. 

&amp;nbsp;

And employers are more than happy to open offices in lower cost, “business friendly” locations. Palantir announced its intention to shift to Denver, CO. Tesla plans to open up its Gigafactory near downtown Austin. Startup funding in Austin continues to rise (albeit from low levels).  

Even well established Silicon Valley offices have rapidly growing satellite offices in Austin, Denver, etc.  Facebook has 1200 employees in Austin (compared with ~15,000 in San Francisco). Google has &gt; 1500 employees in Austin as well. Google also employs 1500 employees in Denver / 
Boulder. 

&amp;nbsp;

Many of these regions are anchored on world class research universities as well. The University of Texas at Austin has top 10 computer science and engineering programs. Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh is a Top 5 computer science school and leader in Artificial Intelligence research.  The University of Minnesota has a top 2 Chemical Engineering program. 

&amp;nbsp;

We unfortunately can’t discuss job dispersion without addressing the vociferous work from home debate. I frankly don’t think the pandemic will significantly impact the work from home trend long term. Many high paying sectors have already moved towards flexible work arrangements. Glancing at McKinsey’s website, we see that many of their positions list 20+ major metros as possible locations, including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, etc. Snowflake, the hottest company of 2020, lists 237 open positions on their website. Only 86 of those are in listed as San Mateo (their SF Bay Area headquarters), mostly in engineering / internal operations. The reason is obvious: over 125 positions (i.e. 55+%) are in customer facing roles in sales, professional services, etc. Companies want a geographic dispersion of these roles both across the US and internationally. 

&amp;nbsp;

It’s also worth mentioning that “elite” companies, who provide a disproportionate number of the jobs for high income millennials, frankly don’t have that many employees. Alphabet and Facebook combined have only ~200,000 employees despite a market cap of approximately $2 trillion dollars. Bain &amp; McKinsey combined only have ~30,000 employees. JP Morgan chase has 256,941 employees, but only 37,000 (14.4%) are in New York. The largest single office for JP Morgan is actually in Columbus, Ohio and houses 11,050 employees. 

We’re also seeing a bit of a “resource curse” for VCOL cities as the extremely high costs of living / business drive out firms who aren’t as profitable per employee. McKesson, #8 on the S&amp;P 500 list by revenue, moved its HQ from San Francisco to Dallas in 2018. Charles Schwab, is leaving San Francisco while expanding its offices in Denver &amp; Dallas. 

&amp;nbsp;

The bottom line is that the trend was already clear pre-pandemic. The leading companies, who pay the highest salaries, are actively investing in satellite offices or remote positions across the United States. For tech and management consulting companies, this helps distribute their customer facing sales and service teams. For financial and other companies, they are able to lower their costs by moving back-office operations outside VCOL areas. Meanwhile, companies who aren’t able to match the compensation packages of elite firms or want to lower their cost of business are relocating to cheaper areas. 

As a final point, Forbes has an interesting article about the top 15 metro areas ranked by revenue of Fortune 500 companies headquartered there. While the New York metro area dominates the list with 65 companies that earn $1.7 trillion in revenue, and the greater SF / San Jose area is second with ~$1.5 trillion, the next 2 spots are Dallas ($996.2 billion) and Chicago ($842.2). Minneapolis and Houston also are in the top 7 spots, above either Boston or Washington DC. 

# Supply:

Concerns about multifamily supply had already started in mid 2019. Years of low interest rates and strong rental price growth had led to dramatic booms in apartment housing. Fannie Mae (the government agency) has detailed insights into the multi-family market across major metros. Helpfully they also include rent growth predictions from 3 large real estate analytics companies.  

&amp;nbsp;

The Boston, MA core urban area had a projected ~10,000 units in the pipeline for 2020 (estimated at 4-6% new supply).  Rent price increases were estimated at average of 2% and trending downward pre-pandemic.San Francisco had planned delivery of ~5,000 new unites in 2019 and 2020 with a projected increase in vacancy rate of 5% (trending towards balanced). New York City already had a glut of luxury apartments in 2019, with stagnant or negative rent growth projected pre-pandemic. 

It’s worth noting that while single family home construction has continued to lag demand, multi-family home construction rebounded to pre Great Financial Crisis levels by 2013. By 2015, multifamily construction had hit the highest level since 1987. 

&amp;nbsp;

We can see the effect of supply in the fact that average rental prices in several VCOL had started to plateau around late 2018. Boston, MA saw rental price growth of only ~2-3% annually between 2016 and 2019 according to RentCafe. RentCafe also shows San Francisco average rents increasing from $3450 in Nov 2016 to $3683 in Nov 2019, for an annual increase of 2-3% as well. Brooklyn, NY average rents increased from $2603 in Nov 2016 to $2928 in Nov 2019 for a total increase of 12% or ~4% per year. One thing to keep in mind is that these average rents don’t take into account hedonistic adjustments, i.e. people moving into nicer, new luxury apartments and paying slightly more. 

# Immigration / Baby Boomers / Gen Z:

With evidence pointing towards a modest decline in the number of millennials in VCOL areas, could other groups offset their departure? What about foreign immigrants? 

&amp;nbsp;

Regardless of your thoughts on the Trump administration, it’s clear the administration has kept its promise to reduce foreign immigration into the United States. In 2018, the New York Times reported that net immigration to the US was only 200,000, the lowest level since the Great Recession. The same article, along with a related article from PBS also notes in particular that Chinese student attendance has dropped significantly due to concerns over visas, geo-political tensions, and violence. The current pandemic and recent trade tensions are likely to only exacerbate the situation. The Department of Homeland Security websites shows that “Persons obtaining lawful residence in the US” dropped by ~150,000 between 2016 and 2019 (or ~10%). This is a problem for VCOL which have relied upon foreign immigration to make up for net domestic migration. Foreign investment has often followed this migration. 

At the moment, there also isn’t an obvious political constituency to argue for increased legal immigration into the US. The Democratic Party’s immigration policy is largely focused on legalizing the Dreamers, i.e. children born to undocumented immigrants. The Republican Party’s immigration policy has largely focused around halting illegal immigration.

&amp;nbsp; 

What about baby boomers returning to the cities for their golden years? The New York Times cites census data which indicates that 17.8% of 54-72 year olds live in urban areas (defined by density). This compares with 21.6% in 1990. Moreover, while more baby boomers are renting, they seem to prefer to do so in suburban areas. 

&amp;nbsp;

Well, what about Gen Z (those born after between 1997- 2012)? First of all, the generation is smaller than millennials by about 5 million individuals. Second, a Pew research study has found that for the oldest Gen Zers (18-23), over 50% have reported that they or someone in their household has lost a job or pay in the recent recession compared to 40% of millennials and only 25% of Baby Boomers. Last, but likely most important, the millennials successfully revitalized and then gentrified large parts of the VCOL urban cores. As a consequence, to borrow a phrase, the rents are already too damn high. Gen Z will enter the workforce already facing sky high rents in VCOL while dealing with a weaker labor market due to the COVID induced recession. 

&amp;nbsp;

The bottom line is that there is no obvious group to replace the millennials if they start exiting core VCOL urban cores in large numbers. 


# Final Thoughts:

Whew, if you made it this far congratulations! I started writing this as a way to organize my thoughts, then frankly became fascinated in the topic. 

If I were to summarize this article, I would say “demographics is destiny” or “the pandemic accelerates, but does not change, existing trends”.  The 2010s saw the largest generation since the Baby Boomers delay the traditional milestones of adulthood to focus on their careers, education, and finances. Millennials preference for dense, walkable urban areas with deep job markets led to the urban renaissances of VCOL areas and accompanying spike in rents. A boom in multifamily construction followed as real estate developers rushed to deliver luxury rental apartments to cater to this new class of affluent urban dwellers. 

&amp;nbsp;

The 2020s will see VCOL areas deals with the consequences of their success. Most millennials simply cannot afford to raise families in VCOL areas. Even before the pandemic we saw net migration increasing out of VCOL towards the booming Southern / Southwestern areas of the country. Companies are more than willing to follow suit, either by moving directly or by opening satellite officers to take advantage of cheaper real estate and lower taxes. Unfortunately this increase in departures is occurring exactly as multifamily supply continues to increase in VCOL areas due to a multiyear boom in construction. And there is no evidence that I've seen of any other demographic group who will rush to fill the vacancies generated by millennials. Baby boomers continue to prefer warm, low tax, suburban areas. Foreign immigration is depressed and likely to remain so for a variety of factors. Gen Z, with ~5 million fewer members than the millennials,  is graduating into a depressed labor market with rents already inflated far past what the median salary can afford. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to emphasize that this is a modest shift in population, not a panicked flight. A number of affluent millennials will continue to reside in VCOL areas and even purchase long term residences (particularly with parental aid). Millennials who were able to buy in 2012-2014 have enjoyed significant real estate appreciation and are also likely to remain in those areas. But these modest population decreases will lead to a flat to negative rent price growth in VCOL areas as the market struggles to absorb additional luxury supply. 

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, as has been a recurring theme during this pandemic, the pain will be felt most acutely by small-scale landlords who bought properties recently in VCOL areas. Residential Real Estate is in some ways a zero sum game in that each tenant can usually only occupy one unit at a time. The large, publicly traded coastal REITs are currently tapping the corporate credit markets to push out their existing debt maturities and raise additional capital at historically low rates. They can, and are, offering deep concessions for their luxury units to attract tenants. They also typically have diversified into suburban areas and can invest opportunistically into high growth areas (notably Denver). They also have historically attracted the more affluent tenants who are willing to pay a premium for amenities (concierage, gyms, etc.) and are least affected by the pandemic. 

&amp;nbsp;

To end on a positive note, I think the migration of millennials to more affordable, emerging cities is a net positive for the United States. Entrepreneurship, measured by small business formation in the US, has been dropping for years. I think part of the problem is that millennials in VCOL are locked into high paying career paths to afford rent, childcare, etc. Likewise spreading economic growth across the country and revitalizing other areas of the US may help bridge some of the bitter partisan politics.

A couple months back I found myself behind on a few car payments by not budgeting properly and some unaccounted expenses, In the panic I was in and pressure from my father I sought out to get a loan online.
I searched through i think it was lendingtree or something and couldn’t find one with an acceptable interest rate until I came across Helix Loans, their initial payoff stood around 1200-1600$ I can’t remember for an 800$ Loan.

personalfinance,Help a new “adult” budget for a stable future?,"Hello there. My girlfriend and I both graduated college last year and I’m coming up on a year at my first “real” job in January. We both live with my parents rent free and they told us we can stay as long as we like. Our goal is to use this time to pay down our student loans aggressively so we can eventually get married and buy a home. 

This is more about my budget. Gross I make about $3500 a month. My monthly budget looks like this: 

$500 - Car and Insurance 

$1000 - Student Loan Payment
 
$200 - Roth 

$300- Savings
 
$150 - “fun” spending money
 
$70 - Gas 

$20 - Cellphone
 
$5 - Apple Music 

I try to keep my spending incredibly low so I can throw as much money at my loans as I can. Most months, I spend far less than my “spend” allotment and just end up throwing it into my savings account. 

In terms of my assets I have: 

Around 10K in savings. 

Around 5k in checking. 

10k in my Roth 

15k in savings bonds. 

As soon as the 0% for federal loans expires, I’m going to make a lump sum payment on my loans for the entire 15k. 

I have about 60k worth of loans. They are federal and currently at the 0% rate. My girlfriend and I have the goal to have our loans cleaned up within 4 years so we can then start saving for a house. My parents said we can stay as long as we like. It really isn’t bad since we have our own level of the house with a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Is it bad to stay this long if they allow it? It feels like a great opportunity to pay off loans and save money. 

How does my budget look? My only weak spot I believe is my car and insurance. I’m 23 so insurance is very expensive. Public transit isn’t an option for me so I need to drive to work. 

Granted, I’d love to improve my income. I’m not sure if 42k is considered “good” for a first job out of college. I’m thinking about getting more schooling for free through my company. They will reimburse tuition in exchange for 2 year contract. I’m considering on getting an MBA part time since it’s free. Does that sound like a good way to boost my income? I like the company so I have no issues with staying for a while. I’m lucky because I have an interest in finance / business and was able to find an entry level job in it even though my degree is Political Science (yeah I regret that a ton). 

I work for an OEM so the car was bought with employee discounts. The discount made it cheap enough where it will never be underwater. When I’m ready to move out, my plan is to sell it and dump any positive equity in my loans. 

Are there any other surefire ways to boost my income in the future? Combined my girlfriend and I make about 110k so I’m hoping that’s enough to live comfortably enough until we can boost our incomes. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Best course of action regarding defaulted student loans and their affect on my credit score,"So I'm not entirely sure how to phrase this, but my credit score is hovering around 500 - largely in part due to the fact that I defaulted on my federal student loans and haven't started repaying them. I have about 7000$ due, and I'm not entirely sure how time factors in (interest notwithstanding). I know some debts can be struck from your credit record after 7-10 years so that they don't impact your score any longer, but does that apply to federal student loans? The loans were taken out between 2016 and 2017, and I haven't made any payments. 

As my finances stand, I could *possibly* manage to pay 100$ a month to start eliminating my debt, but will this help my credit score? Would it be better to open a credit card and focus on making regular payments on that instead? Will my student loans be struck from my credit record if I give them another 3-4 years? What would be the best course of action to repair my credit score with limited disposable income?",finance

My question might be stupid but id rather be stupid with money than not. I have around 30k of lines of credit, no cc debt and no jobs.

Im wondering if theres a way to take a 30k loan and clear all my debts with a lower interest percentage. I also have a financed car at like 5.99% that has 7k on it that i could clear as well ?

I used to have a great credit (790) for my income (45k) now its dropped to 750. Im wondering if i even qualify for those loans or not... if i do, do i just show up at my bank (credit union desjardin) (or td) and ask for a loan or how do i proceed ?

CryptoCurrency,A Couple of Reasons in my Mind Why Buying Bitcoin is a No Brainer,"Now and then, people (especially newcomers) wonder whether they're still doing it right by buying Bitcoin at the current price.

They often think they're already too late and had missed the boat.

&amp;#x200B;

[Did you miss Bitcoin?](https://i.redd.it/5dowxvm13rw51.gif)

But here are a couple of reasons, in my opinion, why buying Bitcoin right now is a no-brainer.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. There are very few proven assets that offer the same promise of yield over the next decade or so.**

When you think about failing bank interest rates, the stock markets average 7-10 annual return for indexes, government bonds, and even gold; there are no assets that come close to Bitcoin in terms of annual yield in the long-term.

Over the past ten years, five years, and even this year amid the pandemic, Bitcoin has yielded investors' highest returns.

It's up around 70% YTD, and every-time Bitcoin drops 15-20%, it typically rebounds to recover way more than it lost.

**2. The 21 Million Limit Has Been Key**

Bitcoin's 21 million supply cap and the issuance schedule triggers the feeling of scarcity and why most people (including corporations are buying).

We are talking about the most scarce and valuable asset in the market right now, yet not many people get it.  

Publicly-traded companies [currently hold some 786,059 BTC](https://bitcointreasuries.org/), while large funds like Grayscale are still getting started, in my opinion, with around $5 billion in assets under management (AUM). Grayscale's Bitcoin fund will, at some point in the future, hold $100 billion in AUM, and we're just getting started.

Meanwhile, we're yet to talk about retail investors' supply being consumed on exchanges and apps like Cash App. 

Oh! and PayPal recently started selling Bitcoin too out of the 21 million cap.

The real scarcity is yet to kick in but is almost here.

**3. Regulation is Still Happening**

Many countries still prohibit citizens from buying Bitcoin or make it seem like a crime (India is a good example). As more countries begin to regulate, rather than frown at Bitcoin as an investment, one can only imagine the rate of new entrants to the market over the coming years.

Some users also have to deal with tax headaches when they pay or spend crypto, and any regulation that lifts that burden will be critical to mainstream usage of Bitcoin.

This has already become long, and I can still go-ahead to mention several other reasons why buying Bitcoin is a no-brainer.

For instance, we're yet to see a Bitcoin ETF in the U.S ([that will happen at some point](https://coinfomania.com/sec-chairman-says-were-closer-to-bitcoin-etf/)), and the number of Bitcoin ATMs globally is still just above 10,000.

The room for growth is immeasurable, and there's little reason to doubt that people buying Bitcoin now are making a mistake.

I won't bet that Bitcoin would be worth less in five years than it is now. If you're not willing to place such a bet, then like I mentioned at the onset, **buying Bitcoin is a No Brainer.**

I'm not going to make any future price prediction...

stocks,NIO Manufacturing TL;DR (with currencies translated to USD),"Hey all, 

Read through the 10-K filings and figured I would highlight the risk catalysts and manufacturing agreements NIO is currently involved with to give you a better idea of their output forecast and so you can research yourself as to whether or not they can be sustainable: 

&gt; We have entered into an arrangement with Jianghuai Automobile Group Co., Ltd., or JAC, for manufacturing the ES8 for five years. In April 2019 and March 2020, we entered manufacturing cooperation agreements with JAC for the manufacture of the ES6 and the EC6, respectively.

---

&gt; The ES8 and ES6 are manufactured in partnership with JAC at its Hefei manufacturing plant. JAC is a major state-owned automobile manufacturer in China and it constructed such Hefei manufacturing plant for the production of the ES8 (with a modified production line for the ES6) and potentially other future vehicles with us.

---

&gt; **we pay JAC for each vehicle produced on a per-vehicle basis monthly for the first three years.**

---

&gt; In addition, for the first 36 months after the start of production, which commenced on April 10, 2018, to the extent the Hefei manufacturing plant incurs any operating losses, we have agreed to compensate JAC for such operating losses. Cooperation after the first 36 months will be subject to further negotiation between the parties.  As of December 31, 2019, we had paid JAC a total of $90,310,656.80, including $49,772,468.20 as compensation for losses incurred in 2018 and 2019 and $40,538,188.60 for manufacturing and processing fees.

---

Risk catalysts mentioned: 

&gt; Beginning July 1, 2018, the tariff on imported passenger vehicles (other than those originating in the United States of America) was reduced to 15%. As a result, our pricing advantage could be diminished.

*(In English: The trade war between the West and China is killing any chances of NIO achieving market share in places outside of China.)*

---

&gt; Pursuant to the 2018 Negative List, the limits on foreign ownership of auto manufacturers were lifted in 2018 for NEVs and will be lifted by 2022 for ICE vehicles. As a result, foreign EV competitors could build wholly-owned facilities in China without the need for a domestic joint venture partner. For example, Tesla has started constructing a factory in Shanghai without a joint venture partner. These changes could increase our competition and reduce our pricing advantage.

*(In English: China is incentivizing FDI (Foreign Domestic Investment), which is leading to competition from corps like Tesla who are much more established and have the funds to outpace NIO.)*

---

&gt; We believe that our sales performance of ES8 and ES6 in 2019 was negatively affected by the reduction in the subsidy standard. The current 2020 subsidy standard, effective from April 23, 2020, (i) reduces the base subsidy amount in general by 10% for each NEV, (ii) sets subsidies for 2 million vehicles as the upper limit of annual subsidy scale; and (iii) provides that national subsidy shall only apply to an NEV with the sale price under $44,826.60 or equipped with battery swapping module. Further, the 2021 and the 2022 subsidy standard are expected to be reduced by 20% and 30% respectively as compared to the standard of the immediate preceding year.

*(In English: Less government incentive = lower operating margin = less revenue growth.)* 

---

&gt; Our servicing will primarily be carried out through third parties certified by us. Although such servicing partners may have experience in servicing other vehicles, we and such partners have very limited experience in servicing our vehicles. Servicing electric vehicles is different from servicing ICE vehicles and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques

*(In English: NIO cannot afford to achieve [vertical integration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp) yet and relies heavily on outsourcing to other, much smaller companies to get certain jobs done. Their supplier network is likely to be inefficient at times and falter under macroeconomic headwinds like government intervention (think trade war and tax credits) and covid-19 and this makes NIO's operations all the more compromised.)*

Some outside data to look at: 

[China Total Vehicle Sales: 1997 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/total-vehicle-sales)

*Overall seems incredibly cyclical but in an upward trend over the next 5 years. Long term investors shouldn't worry about demand.* 

[China GDP Annual Growth Rate: 1989 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth-annual)

*China believe it or not is still considered a developing country which is defined by its high GDP growth rate and low standard of living. It averages 6% a year but due to covid fell harshly. Right now it is sitting at 4% but is expected to return to 6% within the next two years.* 

[China Consumer Confidence Index: 1991 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/consumer-confidence)

*Consumer confidence forecasts are predicted to rise as the world recovers from covid-19. This in turn can translate to increased spending and economic stimulation (aka more potential demand and orders for NIO vehicles.)*

[China Car Production: 2005-2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/car-production)

*China is set to return to the 25 Million vehicle production milestone it often flirted with over the past decade. Should it overcome the impact on manufacturing from covid and the trade war, it may very well achieve even higher historical output although that is a very optimistic outlook given the current geopolitical situation.*

---

My personal outlook: 

I'm getting a lot of comments assuming that I'm bearish on NIO. Overall I'm neutral but hopeful that there is more to come once they move past their growth phase. Here is what I think they need to focus on to achieve Tesla levels of growth: 

* Achieve vertical integration to lower cost of goods sold as much as possible 

* Focus primarily on R&amp;D investments (management has been doing that!) 

* Don't focus on international expansion. That can wait until after they've established a steady footing financially and have achieved a significant market share in China. Right now international expansion is too expensive and risky given they are still in a growth phase and cannot be 100% confident in the numbers from the factory or the sentiment from customers. 

* Make sure Tesla does not succeed in China. It currently has a factory and is working on fighting NIO for market share. If Tesla wins NIO will remain a smaller competitor and not achieve nearly as much growth as people are hoping for. I see a lot of people banking on them monopolizing the EV market in China. That is a naive assumption at this time and it is still anyone's guess as to who will come out on top once the dust has settled. 

* Pray for tax incentives. Tesla did so well in the states because the fed and state authorities gave tons and tons of tax credits for renewable energy investments and made it very attractive to buy electric vehicles. Right now China is on track to reduce these incentives which as I mentioned above will hurt NIO's bottom line. If green energy credits can be expanded upon within China it will make NIO's products much more attractive and the production of them financially feasible for NIO given their current state.

We will see how all of this plays out over the coming week as several important make-or-break announcements will be coming out regarding the company that can very well decide if it is the next Tesla or not.",finance

investing,Bruce Flatt (CEO of Brookfield Asset Management): Real Estate Will Be Repriced to Double,"Disclaimer: I'm a BAM shareholder with about 15% of my portfolio.

Great interview two days ago from one of the great asset managers of all time (IMO): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PXxqCc24q4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PXxqCc24q4)

Since COVID I still kept holding my BAM shares. Bruce Flatt is a legendary value investor.

In this interview he says a number of interesting things:

\- BAM has up to $80B in dry powder and will look for distressed opportunities over the next 18 months

\- He thinks retail is going through a consolidation, but that strong will get stronger. They want to own the best mall in any given city, and its likely that the bottom half of malls will be bulldozed.

\- Bullish on return to office (boomer comment from him IMO)

\- Very interesting: Thinks that real estate prices should be 2x now due to the low interest rate environment, and this is starting to happen for BAM. But he also thinks people aren't quite comfortable doing these transactions yet and things are trading at big discounts

I really agree with him on the last comment. Bruce Flatt knows how to smell a good deal. Buying Real Estate may be the best value opportunity in the market today.

I'm primarily (80%) invested in tech (QQQ/ARK/individual picks). But I have been building up some dry powder since August or so, since values got out of hand.

As a complete side note, I went to a ""top"" mall today to go to the Apple Store. The mall was absolutely packed.

The problem for altcoins is that the market hasn't picked one to be Yang, they pick all of them all at once. Altcoins are suffering from being too plentiful...an ever increasing amount of altcoins are ever inflating are fighting for the same slice of the pie of altcoin pie. They are all weighing each other down. One could argue the market doesn't need just one altcoin. Pretty much every coin in the top 15 has a unique structure, team, and purpose. I think many assume that every ""altcoin"" just wants to replace the dollar because BTC does, when in fact many of these coins never tried to be an all purpose currency, and in fact have much more nuanced value propositions. What is clear to me is that Bitcoin remains the unchallenged king, despite having thousands of coins competing.

*Ethereum*, the largest altcoin, has many problems growing going forward. You have to remember why billionaires and millionaires are buying bitcoin and giving bitcoin a high valuation in the first place: wealth preservation and USD/fiat hedge. They aren't buying it to get rich, because well, they are already rich in the first place. In contrast, the entire appeal of Ethereum is going from rags to riches in the altcoin casino, and casinos generally appeal to people who aren't rich. Not to mention Ethereum isn't a technical currency, doesn't have a supply cap and is far more centralized so it doesn't act as a fundamental hedge against fiat. You have to remember ETH is a platform where users are more attached to the content hosted on the service rather than the service itself, and risks becoming ""myspaced"" if another service becomes more attractive. ETH will risk getting left behind if it doesn't update itself in 3.0, 4.0, 10.0, 100.0, etc... but also risks becoming too centralized and aliening it's userbase if it changes too much.

*Defi* has even more problems. Most of them are inflationary by design and most investors are oblivious to the actual monetary policies within the coins. Defi operates in a legal grey area among most of the world, and if they aren't already illegal in many countries already under existing law, they will be illegal soon in most of the world for facilitating unlicensed/unregistered borrowing and lending, and money laundering. There is a reason why these services require things like KYC in real life, because smart contracts aren't actual legal contracts. If software  code were passable as contracts, you would not be required to sign a Terms of Service contract on every website you browse.

&amp;#x200B;

*Stablecoins* look to be taking over the altcoin market silently, and USDT is on pace to overtake Ethereum by next year. Stablecoins have the biggest potential to become bitcoin's Yang, but it will probably be in the form of an official stable coin released by the US Federal Reserve. I think USD vs Gold will turn into Digital USD vs Digital Gold.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,A look into Monero (and privacy coins) from a Third World Country person point of view,"Ok guys, so I work in the traffic department of the state government in a third world country, and I see a lot, and I really mean a very big amount of bribery where I work (not specifically in my sector). Some colleagues in other cities make 5 times their salary only on bribery monthly, and it pretty much disgusts me.  

Obviously they only take cash, because otherwise it would raise suspicion from the ""IRS"" here with bank transfers and such. This results in many problems such for the non corrupt employees as having the same salary for 8 years now, even with a 50% inflation during this time.

We already have had tried to go on strike (I think that's what is called) without success because those people that take huge amounts of bribery, which are the biggest branches didn't join, so basically it was a mess and had no results.

You can't open any business without paying some money to whoever works in the City Hall that takes charge of the sector you're trying to enter, or building any construction without paying someone there as well. And this goes on on every level, for example there was a senator like a week ago that got caught up hiding cash in his underwear when federal police arrived, and it wasn't the first one to do so. I honestly think corruption is the biggest problem in third world countries.

Point is, Monero and other privacy coins facilitates this by a huge amount for obvious reasons, once someone took a bribery much more easily it can't be tracked anymore, and this is something that I think that needs to be addressed in such cases. Of course there is a huge positive side on having a privacy coin so you can spend your money without being constantly watched (to name one), but I think the downside in places such as where I live is more relevant.

HELOC 59,000 @ 3.25% adjustable rate based on fed rate.  around $400 min. payment with 10 year window to repay.  400/month will have to inflate payment when mortgage is paid off.

Pros- mortgage rates are record low and the adjustable APR scares me, frees up a bit of cash to invest in retirement accounts.

investing,The future of fiscal policy without traditional constraints: Covid response has shown inflation and interest rates no longer dictate limits on debt,"https://www.ft.com/content/aa63c3d3-5331-4984-b6e7-ebd47ea6e246

Article:

The surge in public debt in the major advanced economies caused by the pandemic continues apace.

Even on the very optimistic assumption that there will be no need for further major economic lockdowns, Fulcrum economists calculate that the ratio of gross government debt to gross domestic product in the major advanced economies will reach about 141 per cent next year, a rise of around 26 percentage points from 2019. More than half of this extra debt has been absorbed by the central banks.


Few economists argue that this remarkable policy response to a global emergency is mistaken, but it could profoundly alter perceptions about the appropriate settings for fiscal policy.

As the vast expansion of public debt has not been constrained by concerns about rising inflation or interest rates, at least in the short term, the traditional reasons given by governments for controlling their budgets will have less political force — especially in the US, if Joe Biden sweeps the board in next week’s presidential elections.

Lawrence Summers, whose speech on “secular stagnation” in 2013 was the most perceptive economic pronouncement of the past decade, has argued that macroeconomics is experiencing a “revolution” similar to the seismic shift towards inflation control in the late 1970s. From now on, there will be “a focus on assuring adequate demand and fairness in our economies”, driven mainly by expansionary fiscal policy.

Mr Summers admits that this policy choice will come with risks but, in the immediate future, it will probably bring net benefits. The medicine needed to treat the pandemic may prove appropriate in future years as well.

The structural economic changes that have shaped the policy response to the pandemic have been persistent for several decades. Real and nominal interest rates in advanced economies have trended strongly downwards since the early 1980s, mainly because private savings have been excessive relative to investment — the prime symptom of secular stagnation.

Inflation has been held at very low levels for the same reasons, encouraging central banks to expand the monetary base by acquiring government debt. This form of monetary expansion has defied the pessimists by having essentially no effect on global inflation.

Leading central bankers, including the US Federal Reserve’s Jay Powell and Christine Lagarde at the European Central Bank, are therefore demanding more, rather than less, support from fiscal stimulus. This is very different from the attitude after the 2008 financial crisis, when many leaders in global policymaking argued the rise in public debt should be brought back down.

Such has been the change of mood, even among the most orthodox of economists, such as Olivier Blanchard, that it is natural to worry lest the temptation to spend more and tax less will get out of hand. There are plenty of causes — for example, the green economy, a universal income and infrastructure renewal — that would encourage much higher budget deficits under an administration led by Mr Biden.

With the buffers of inflation and interest rates removed, how can investors tell when politicians are delivering too much of a good thing? Although solvency crises seem improbable in advanced western economies, which can pay down debt by creating money, a wise government will want to limit the risks of debt ratios rising indefinitely. Bond markets and inflation may be somnolent, but they are not comatose.

When the pandemic is over, policymakers should, therefore, seek to limit any further trend rise in debt ratios. With interest rates below the growth rate of the economy, debt sustainability models indicate this can be achieved while continuing to run deficits on the primary budget balance (ie excluding interest payments), but there needs to be a ceiling on deficits over the economic cycle.

For example, for the US to hold its debt ratio below 140 per cent of GDP, it could run an average primary deficit of about 4 per cent of GDP, assuming nominal interest rates at 0.75 per cent, real GDP growth at 1.6 per cent and inflation at 2 per cent. This is broadly in line with IMF forecasts on announced economic policy from 2022-25.

The temptation for a Democratic administration would be to run even bigger deficits than this, in which case debt ratios and fiscal risks would certainly begin to rise — even before adverse demographic trends demand still higher borrowing in the 2030s.

At some point, debt will reach a limit, but most economists are now betting that this is a very long way off.",finance

As you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.

The unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it’s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.

As you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.

So the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.

Despite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.

Apple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.

This dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.

A couple analysts have recently changed they’re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit’s today. That is quite good upside for the company.

As you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.

Also I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.

Facebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple’s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.

While google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.

Alibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.

Ford just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM’s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.

Some important earnings coming this week are :

Paypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on

Wednesday Qualcomm will announce that will be a great insight to see what Apple’s iphone 12 is doing as Qualcomm is the biggest supplier for apple and on Thursday Alibaba (with ant group ipo) coming also on the same day this stock could see a surge in value.",finance

personalfinance,Help a “new adult” budget ?,"Hello there. My girlfriend and I both graduated college last year and I’m coming up on a year at my first “real” job in January. We both live with my parents rent free and they told us we can stay as long as we like. Our goal is to use this time to pay down our student loans aggressively so we can eventually get married and buy a home. And yes, we will not combine finances / buy a house until married. 

This is more about my budget. Gross I make about $3500 a month. My monthly budget looks like this: 

$500 - Car and Insurance (more insurance than car payment. I work for an OEM so the car was cheap) 

$1000 - Student Loan Payment
 
$200 - Roth 

$300- Savings
 
$150 - “fun” spending money
 
$70 - Gas 

$20 - Cellphone
 
$5 - Apple Music 

I try to keep my spending incredibly low so I can throw as much money at my loans as I can. Most months, I spend far less than my “spend” allotment and just end up throwing it into my savings account. 

In terms of my assets I have: 

Around 10K in savings. 

Around 5k in checking. 

10k in my Roth 

15k in savings bonds. 

As soon as the 0% for federal loans expires, I’m going to make a lump sum payment on my loans for the entire 15k. 

I have about 60k worth of loans. They are federal and currently at the 0% rate. My girlfriend and I have the goal to have our loans cleaned up within 4 years so we can then start saving for a house. My parents said we can stay as long as we like. It really isn’t bad since we have our own level of the house with a kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. Is it bad to stay this long if they allow it? It feels like a great opportunity to pay off loans and save money. 

How does my budget look? My only weak spot I believe is my car and insurance. I’m 23 so insurance is very expensive. Public transit isn’t an option for me so I need to drive to work. 

Granted, I’d love to improve my income. I’m not sure if 42k is considered “good” for a first job out of college. I’m thinking about getting more schooling for free through my company. They will reimburse tuition in exchange for 2 year contract. I’m considering on getting an MBA part time since it’s free. Does that sound like a good way to boost my income? I like the company so I have no issues with staying for a while. I’m lucky because I have an interest in finance / business and was able to find an entry level job in it even though my degree is Political Science (yeah I regret that a ton). 

I work for an OEM so the car was bought with employee discounts. The discount made it cheap enough where it will never be underwater. When I’m ready to move out, my plan is to sell it and dump any positive equity in my loans. 

Are there any other surefire ways to boost my income in the future? Combined my girlfriend and I make about 110k so I’m hoping that’s enough to live comfortably enough until we can boost our incomes. Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Is there a good spreadsheet for calculating total cost for a home with mortgage and taxes?,"My girlfriend and I are looking at homes right now and figuring out what we can afford based on our incomes. We're looking primarily in town A and town B. Town B is much more expensive as an initial cost, but the taxes are roughly 50-75% less than town A. Town A is less expensive, but the taxes are much higher. Both are considered great towns to live in, the schools are excellent, and both are very safe.  

I know there are a few online calculators that will figure things out, but many of these are tied to advisors and will try to get you to sign up for their services rather than give you the detailed results.  

Ideally I want to be able to punch in a few numbers: home cost, insurance, if PMI will be necessary, interest rate, and see what our real long term cost will be with taxes and other costs.  

I can write something like this in Excel, but my knowledge of PMI rate is very low, and I want to make sure I'm producing accurate numbers. If anyone can point me in the correct direction, I'd be very grateful.  

Some additional info, just so people don't get distracted by the elephant in the room, we're both in our 30s, both have professional careers, both serious about the relationship, she owns a home already which she plans to sell to contribute to a down payment, and we're likely going to be engaged in the first half of next year. So the cart is not before the horse. I just want to make sure I can make the most informed decision when I'm looking at listings.",finance

personalfinance,(USA) Student Loan/Credit Card refi,"Hello all,

I previously had applied to SOFI, but my credit score was below the threshold because of a few late payments (my bank refused to remove them despite me having made a payment like a day before it rolled over when i thought it would show up on the next statement but didnt...long story, but maybe someone can help me with how to manage getting that off my report)

My score now is above 710, i dont know what it is exactly but i believe i should be able to qualify for SOFI.

I have 2 student loans, but I think i only want to refi one of them. The first has around 10k on it, at an ABSURD 10% interest rate ive been paying for the past 4 or so years. the 2nd is much lower, only around 2.5k, but also a federal subsidized loan at only 2.5%, i think, i cant tell right now because it shows 0% due to COVID 19 relief. 

I dont think SOFI will beat the fed loan interest rate, however the other one i obviously hope to refinance at a much lower rate, possibly using my parents as a cosigner to increase the chances of an even lower interest rate.

My main question, actually is in regards to a credit card. I have a card with around 7k debt, mostly due to college expenses and some recklessness on my part. This cards interest rate is closer to 9% than 8%, which is again rather high. Is it possible/smart to try and refinance this debt with my student loan debt? I am working on paying it off, but in the past few years my dog required multiple surgeries, which being a fairly recent grad i didnt have the cash on hand, but it IS on a 0% repayment plan that i intend to finish a month before its end date, so I'm not overly concerned with it. The interest on the credit card however is having an impact on my overall financial situation. 

My fear with that idea, is if i do refinance that with the student loan, depending on the term it may be increasing my payoff date on both the student loan and the credit card loan. Once i have the 0% APR credit paid off I intend to pay higher amounts on this other card, but if i refinance it like this, i cant really directly focus on paying off that debt.

Is there a better approach to refinancing i can take to lower my interest rates?",finance

investing,PIC - Does the XL Fleet Spac interesting?,"First of all why Spac and not IPO?

The hype both around the electric vehicles and around the SPAC shares gives the company an option to raise funds quickly and at a good price (for the company, and perhaps also for investors)

The company intends to use the cash it raises to increase the production and installation of its systems

The company has working products that work similar to $HYLN Hyliion that turn vehicles with combustion engines into hybrids and plug-in hybrid and in the future fully electric and hydrogen cells. The system is mainly suitable for commercial vehicles and small trucks, and develops systems for large trucks

The company has over 200 customers with a fleet of vehicles such as Pepsi Coca-Cola FedEx DHL and more

Currently the company claims their margins are positive i.e. to make a profit one has to increase production and installations, alongside more contracts, compared to other companies that still need to improve the technology and reduce costs to be profitable

In the company presentation, it can be seen that the company expects to be profitable in 2022

At a price of $ 10 per share, the company's market capitalization will be $ 1.43B (relatively cheap compared to its competitors in the field of electric vehicles)

On the negative side, about half of the amount that will go into the fund from the merger will be paid as a debt of the company and you may have to raise more funds

vet,After two months without breast milk my kitten and his mom picked up the habit once again and now he is always puking,"I have a teen kitty by the name of White that about two months ago stop receiving his mother's milk. We fed him raw chicken and kitten chow almost immediately after and he seemed healthy and really enjoyed his food.

His mom was always coming and leaving the house. She was always hostile to him after stopping the breast-feeding but since he always wanted to play with her we couldn't always avoid confrontation between them. Things got different however, when momma cat had kittens once again (we couldn't see the kittens so we don't know if they are even alive at this point), we gave her cat chow since she was skinny and it has been working fine.

Her behavior towards white really changed, she wasn't hostile anymore, and they started playing, this happened about the same time White started puking. First we thought it was maybe due to the chicken so me suspended it and only sticked to kitten chow, but he kept on puking so we talked last night and decided to take him to the vet but just this morning I discovered he was being breastfed.

He is there for hours and refuses to eat anything else, I've tried stopping it but they resume the activity in a different part of the house or backyard.

I don't know what to do, should I even do something?

TL;DR: My kitty is being breastfed by his mom 2 months after he left it and refuses to eat anything else now, which we believe is the cause for his constant puking.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, November 2, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 2, 2020**

Stocks opened today’s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.

After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.

On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.

Regardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus 

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until “at least 2023”. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed’s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, “too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.”

On Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.

The US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. 

Last week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it’s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC).
* Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk.
* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!
* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles’ Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles’ Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Single’s day is a counter to Valentine’s Day that celebrates being single. Normally it’s held on Nov 11. This is the world’s largest shopping festival. According to Fortune Magazine, BABA shipped $38.4 billion in gross merchandise value on Singles’ Day last year. Amazon’s Prime Day, by comparison, sold around $6 billion in goods last year.

gaming,Is Super Dragon Ball Heroes WR too easy or am I OP?,"Hi,

I've recently started SDBH on the Switch, and I'm fairly early into the Story Mode (just beaten the SSJ3 Vegeta fight and the Jackie Chun bonus fight in the extradimensional space in Ch.1). However, every single fight I've had so far I've just one-shotted or two-shotted, including SSJ3 Vegeta who's a 4\* Boss fight, so obviously this has me concerned about the difficulty of the game.

Here is an image of my team: [https://imgur.com/a/9cSeev5](https://imgur.com/a/9cSeev5) . I used my Gacha tickets at the start of the game to get a few cards, the strongest ones being used in my team. I also have whats probably quite a good collection of items - as u can see on the pic of my team the first 3 cards are heavily buffed, all my item slots are filled, my team HP is about 35000 and I've never taken substantial damage so far in the game.

Like I said above, ive OHKOed or 2HKOed every fight so far including SSJ3 Vegeta whos a 4\* Boss, so I'm concerned that either the game (or at least story mode) is terribly easy, or I've ended up being OP with good cards and items (probably more so the items, look at those buffs). I've done a bit of googling and haven't found any substantial information, so my question is clear:

# is SDBH just a very easy game (at least the story mode) or am I too OP???

All comments and opinions are appreciated. Ofc if you've played the game urself, comment how u found the difficulty early in-game and how ur team was compared to mine. I wanna know if the game itself is easy to start with or if I'm OP this early in the game, and whether i should start a new save or stop using items to make myself a bit weaker lmao. I'd expect some form of challenge or at least a level fight against a 4\* boss lmao.

personalfinance,Am I better off taking out a loan to consolidate CC debt?,"First time poster here. Thumbed through the Wiki but was hoping for some feedback because I feel stupid and insecure. The title says it all. I've attempted some research and was wondering if anyone could give me some good advice and insight based on these numbers:  


Discover balance of $7,000, 16.99% APR, $141 minimum payment

Paypal Credit balance of $3,321.91, 19.99% APR, $87 minimum 

&amp;#x200B;

I used [unbury.me](https://unbury.me) and at this rate, assuming I do not charge a cent on these accounts between now and then, I can have this debt paid off by March 2027 by paying just a little over the minimums. I need this debt gone sooner, and I was hoping there was a type of loan I could look into with a lower APR. I'm willing to work to pay a bit over the minimum every month, but I just have this gut feeling that these current APRs are horrid and could be improved if I only knew better. My credit score is just okayish. It's currently at 698 thanks to a recent hard pull from a fraudulent credit card application that thankfully declined. It normally hovers at 700+ thanks to on-time payments, but I have high revolving credit. Even if I have a solid year of smart payment all it takes is one emergency (in March I had to put $2.5k on that Discover card) to set me back to where I was and I'm fed up. In a year I've paid the Paypal down from $4k to how it is now, but it's slow progress. For the record, I don't spend on these accounts anymore (save for the aforementioned emergency) but it's such a slow burn due to the interest alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on what to do? I don't really have assets to sell. I live paycheck to paycheck making 19/hr thanks to high rent. The other option I've seen folks talk about is taking advantage of certain credit card promotions where you can transfer the balance to another cc company with 0% APR for one year, for example. But would that mean I'd need to find two separate promotions for each Discover and Paypal account? Will the hard inquiry hurt my already dwindling credit? And how hard is it actually to find another promotion when the previous is about to expire? That's why I feel a loan (people say with a Credit Union, but idk who) might be the better, less-hassle choice but I don't know. Thanks for reading in advance, I don't have anyone I can talk to in order to gain insight and I feel desperate and stuck af.",finance

personalfinance,Looking at Refinance my Mortgage,"Hello all! Just wanted to start off by thank you lot for all of the wonderful advice y'all have offered over the years. My financial life is much more stable thanks to following a lot of the advice I've found on this subreddit!

Anyhow, as the title suggest, I am currently looking at refinancing my mortgage. My wife and I got our first mortgage for our primary residence back in 2017. I know that it hasn't been all that long, but when we got our first mortgage, our interest rate was set at 4.35% With interest rates at historic lows, I've been doing some shopping around on refinancing with the goals to primarily lower our monthly mortgage payment and secondarily to save ourselves some money over the long term. 

In shopping around, I've seen rates as low as sub 3%, but to be quite honest, it's all a little overwhelming. Mainly I was looking for some advice as to the main things I should be looking for in a refinance. What are the common pitfalls I should strive to avoid? Anything that should count as a straight away deal breaker? 

Here are the main questions I'm struggling with: 

Escrow vs paying insurance and taxes out of pocket? Are there any benefits to one or the other? Should I roll the closing costs into the sum of the loan? 

As of right now, from most of the offers I've received, the closing costs + the amounts I'd have to pay up front are a little out of my reach in terms of paying out of pocket. Is this a problem, and does that mean I should avoid refinancing for now? 

The best offer I've received so far has an interest rate of 2.875% and an APR of 2.949% on a 30 year fixed-rate mortgage. The appraised value of my home is $198.5k, and the loan total (including closing costs rolled into the loan) would be $158.7k. This would keep me at under the 80% LTV, meaning I'm saving myself the PMI. Closing costs are figured at $3,583, and ""total est. reserves/prepaid costs"" are set at $6,626.66. The mortgage agent told me that since, taxes are due just next month that they'd have to pay that upfront, and that if I am using escrow (which I am), whatever is in my escrow account would be paid back to me in form of a check. My escrow account currently has near enough to pay off my taxes for the year, which are $4250 or thereabouts. So I'm imagining that I'd be getting a check for near around $4000, and that money would go straight back into paying for the ""reserves/prepaid costs."" The rest would be rolled into the loan. Is that a correct assumption to make?

I'm pretty excited about this offer because it would reduce my monthly costs from what I'm currently paying, approx $1450 a month, to $1155, all while avoiding having to pay a PMI. That $300/month would go a long way. 

Is there anything I'm missing here? Anything glaring that might make this a deal breaker? 

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated, and please let me know if there is any additional information that I'm missing in order to be able to determine the best option here, or if y'all have any questions. 

Thanks again!",finance

cybersecurity,Carreer path options,"Hello fellow cyber security professionals!

I would like to know your opinion on which career path to take since I currently found myself in an odd situation. I'd like to mention that in the long run and from a career point of view, I am aiming for the CISO position.

Let me briefly describe the background. I am 25 y.o., currently finishing my master's degree in IT management and at the same time have been working in a local bank as a junior cyber security analyst for 2.5 years. A couple of weeks ago I was nominated to be promoted to a senior position by my boss and this decision was (AFAIK) approved by management of the company but did not take place yet. After some reminding and discussions with boss (CISO) he assured me that it will be done but could not promise any raise in salary. In addition to that, I was recently approached by our internal audit department with a job offer that would yield approx. 25 % increase in salary.

Right now I see 3 different outcomes:

A) Stay in CyberSec dpt. and patiently await the promotion to Senior Analyst, although with no salary raise;

B) Take the job at the internal audit, stay in the company I already know, get a huge raise, different experience and some general insight into IT;

C) Use the job offer as a leverage and negotiate a salary raise in addition to promotion to Senior Analyst.

&gt;!It's also worth mentioning that the option C) might be seen as a ""cheap-shot"" by my current manager and may cause some bad blood because we are currently understaffed (and once in a while have to work overtime - not paid). Switch to a position outlined in option B) would also bring some more work/life balance. !&lt;

**So my question is: what approach would you take in order to achieve the ultimate goal (CISO position)? Reasoning and comments are most welcome.** 

Thank you for reading all the way here and huge thanks for your answers and opinions.

retirement,Trying to finalize my retirement strategy,"Hi all! Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to this. I recently acquired my first position with retirement benefits at 29. I've been spending a lot of time studying retirement strategies to supplement my real estate investing. I'm fairly confident in the direction that I want to go, but have had enough positive experiences with Reddit on the finance space I wanted to throw some ideas out there.  


**Goals**

\-Create enough passive income + retirement to reliably live my \~40-50K in a relatively rural area per year lifestyle without working if I chose not to.  
\-Save enough to continue my goals of, in my local market, purchasing about 4 more properties at 50K-100K each over the next 3-5 years.  
\-Develop a retirement strategy with a high probability of maintaining the 7% average return over the next 40 years, with a stretch goal of 10%.  
\-Continue a strategy that aligns with my wife and my value of maintaining divisive finances.

**Relevant numbers**  
Current salary: 53. 4-7K in variable side income.  
Current cost of living, 900 (my half, includes mortgage)  
Average monthly income: 4000 conservatively, 4500 most months.  
Wife's salary - 36K, 2000 take home pay monthly, standard federal government retirement contributions.

**Current investments**  
 \- 2 rental properties netting 1450 (1800 before 1 mortgage), will have $125K in equity  and full ownership in 10 years.  


**Current retirement tools**  
10%:10.5% match to TIAA 401A averaging 9200 in net base retirement contribution. 0 previous retirement contributions or rollover.

1700 in an Optum Bank HSA. 2000 annual contribution. After 2000 in spending per year, I receive an FSA for the remainder of my deductible.  
I also have access to a 457B.  


**With all that being said, here's the strategy I'm currently contemplating.**  
Step 1.) Create a Roth IRA, max contributions. Invest in VTSAX. Max annually indefinitely.  
Step 2.) Max contribution to HSA, put money towards high dividend stocks that will take advantage of HSA tax breaks. Pay for health expenses out of pocket until I hit my FSA.  
Step 3.) Put TIAA contributions and match towards TINRX+TEQKX.   


Step 3.5 This current formula would allow me to hit 3x salary by 40 at current trajectory with 0 raises or additional contributions. At this point, I would use leftover funds to save towards reaching real estate investment goals (currently, 1500 a month, and my wife would save 500+side hustle funds). I would decelerate that aggressive cash saving as I was approaching my real estate goal and then transition to:

Step 4.) Increase 401A contributions until I hit max.  
Step 4.5.)Stop contributing towards HSA once estimated retirement funds are around 200K because of additional fees associated with the HSA if not employed.  
Step 5.) If I'm still with my workplace, open up a 453B, and maximize contributions in a three-fund portfolio slightly more conservative than what would be suggested at my age.  


Again, I'm a total noob at this, and just crafting this with a month or two of research. Please tear this thought process apart. Any resources you can provide to help me understand the faults in my logic would be amazing as well.  


Thank you so much for taking the time to review this. Security is such a strong core value of mine, and I love the idea of being able to pass that feeling of comfort on to my family. Wish you and yours the best!",finance

My problem is deciding whether or not to consolidate my loans or not. I would prefer to consolidate all of my loans into one account, and then go to grad school. However, with the CARES act, no federally held loans are accruing interest. My privately held loans' grace period is over soon, and I don't have a job or any way to make payments. I'm just not sure where to start to be honest. I don't know whether to ask for a deferment on all my loans, or to consolidate them or what. Any advice is needed and appreciated.",finance

Forex,EUR/USD Buying Opportunity,"Going into the elections tomorrow volatility and uncertainty are high. This caused a rally in the USD and selloff in the SPX 500.

My theory is that with interest rates at record lows, election results available, and stimulus talks this will cause uncertainty to go back down and buyers to come back in to the markets. This will cause the USD to lose value over the short term.

EUR/USD is sitting at a strong level of support at 1.1620 on the daily chart which is also at the lower bollinger bands. The ADX is relatively flat and the candlesticks are shrinking indicating that the selloff has lost its steam and a reversal is likely.

This trade has a potential to capture 100+ pips within the next 30-45 days with a risk of 90 pips.

personalfinance,Freshman in college in need of help with budgeting,"Hello! As the title says, I am a freshman in a community college (enrolled for the free two years) and i recently got a part time job about a month ago. Although i'm pretty happy that i managed to get a job during these weird times, i realized after i got hired that i need to learn how to ""personal finance"". I've done my fair bit of research on the topic but I do need help with personal budgeting and figuring out where to allocate certain funds to where. I'll give you guys some info and my rough outline.

Working $12 per hour and i get about 20-25 hours each week (more or less since my work schedule is extremely flexible) so i end up with a rough estimate (pre tax) of $240 to $300 weekly, $1040 to $1300 monthly, and $12,480 to $15,600 annually. I get somewhere around $424 to $521 every pay period (every two weeks) after taxes so that'll be roughly $848 to $1042 per month (let me know if this math is correct) This is the part that troubles me the most since I'm not exactly sure on what my salary is and I only have rough estimates to work with.

I do not pay rent just yet. I do want to start helping out with paying some bills such as water bills and internet bills (each are around $60 to $70 per month) 

I'm not paying for medical and dental insurance since long story short, the government is covering for my dad since he is unable to work. Since my dad cannot work, I like to send him about $100 dollars after every paycheck. He uses those for groceries, paying bills, or other things. Not too sure if that should stay in the budget or not but its something that I want to keep doing. 

I do not have a car yet either. Once i do get a car, my mom will help me with my car payments. My share of the car payment should flucuate somewhere $80 to $104 (trying to keep the payment equal to 10% of my monthly wage).

I did open up a credit card account with a limit of $750 to start building up credit score. I am planning on spending at least $100 before paying it off since I want to keep my credit card spending in check (heard many stories of terrible credit card debts and warnings against CC but I feel like i can be responsible enough to keep myself in line). I'm mostly using this credit card to pay for food, which seems to line up fairly well (not too sure if this statement is correct) since i don't eat out as much. 

Combining all of those

$120-140 - bills
$100 - payment to my dad
$80-104 - car payments (once they come around)
$100 - Credit card payment (give or take)
__________________________________________________
$400-$444 combined costs

Which leaves about $448 to $598 left for other costs

Now I am planning on opening up a savings account to throw in any extra funds and i do have emergency funds (around $600) in case anything happens. I'm not too sure how much I will be putting in there but I should probably start saving up for college tuition (trying to get into a 4 year university)

I've considered investing in stocks but my friend told me that it would lessen the amount I get from federal aid for college since I would earn more money (not too sure about this statement as well) so I guess I'm holding off unless told otherwise.

I'll probably take $48 to $60 to spend on whatever i want unless my budget allows for more or less.

I'm not certain if i have to stick to this budget to the exact dollar or if i should be flexible with it and if so how flexible should i be.

Let me know if you need any other info or see any holes in the budget!",finance

btc,How Stackk's governance work?? On-chain governance model in Bitcoin Cash,"&amp;#x200B;

[Stackk governance model using STAK tokens](https://preview.redd.it/ymlmrr08vzw51.png?width=1223&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bee4aa6f68e98fda96cd9244c9449cc14971787)

As some of you might noticed, yesterday I published [my first Flipstarter](https://flipstarter.stackk.app) campaign which is a federated layer 2 social network with on-chain governance. In this post I like to explain the process of governance a bit.

First of all, Stackk uses BCH for most of the transactions or functions in the platform. However, the result of one of these transactions (which is called Content Staking) has a reward for the user which is minted SLP token through a smart contract without any third party control. It's similar to Yield Farming but instead of liquidity, users are putting their content and some BCH as investment in the platform. Most of those BCH can be refunded to them automatically and 20% is paid as service fee to Stackk and the user which is running the community server (everyone can run one!)

Token holders of STAK have the ability to vote on features and roadmaps of the social network and come up with proposals in a separate voting portal. The voting portal would be similar to Github Issues (or any forum) but it enables users to start proposals, support it and vote for it.

Conditions for the proposals to get supported or to be accepted are as below:

**Support stage: 5% support from overall token holders**

**Voting stage: 60% of the participants**

**Proposal period: Unlimited**

**Voting period: 10 days**

It means that every proposal can stay in the system for a long time until it reaches the support from 5% of the token holders. After that, an email will be sent to all the registered token holders and invite them to vote on the supported proposal. This is the stage that it can be accepted or rejected in a 10 days window.

The voting process is by nature non-binding, however, since the only utility of this token is voting, Stackk team keeps it their mission to design a binding infrastructure for the votes. If the votes are not respected, the value of the token and overall system would be affected which obviously is not in the favor of any parties.

**Why not 51% for voting approval?**

Requiring a majority of 60% on votes helps to prevent the acceptance of controversial changes which nearly half of the community are opposing that. It's part of our philosophy that not making any move is more peaceful and inclusive than making contentious changes.

I work full-time for a public university and have a traditional pension plan through OPERS.  I also opened up a 457 plan a couple years ago ($6k balance) for additional income for retirement.  I'm planning on staying at the university until I retire.

I've read to have the following retirement goals:  Aim to save at least 1x your salary by 30, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67.  A small part of me is concerned that the pension might go away since I am 30 years away from retirement and pensions are so rare these days (hence why I opened up an additional 457 plan).  I was contributing 6% to that until recently - I dropped it to 1% as I upgraded my vehicle and my goal is to pay that off as quickly as possible since the interest rate is 5.75%.

My questions are: what should our retirement goal be considering I have a pension?  Should we focus more on contributing to retirement or trying to minimize vehicle debt as much as possible?

personalfinance,Which refinancing option is better?,"Really struggling here. Not very savvy at all with this kind of stuff.

We currently owe 409k on our mortgage.

Option 1: offering a 2.5% interest rate, but we have to buy it down and it’s going to bump the loan up to 439k from the 409 we currently owe. Saves us $418/month in monthly payment.

Option 2: offering a 3.125% interest rate, no buying it down, bumps up current loan to $421k. Saves us $350/month in monthly payment.

I’ve run it through calculators and despite the larger principal, we end up paying less over the life of the loan with the first option. That’s assuming we stay the whole time though, right? If we decide to move in 5-10 years. The second one is better? 

Which one sounds better?

personalfinance,Refinance before or after paying a chunk of student loan?,"I currently have an interest rate of 5.5% on my private student loan.

I also want to throw about $10K at the loan. Is there any benefit/harm in paying off a chunk of the loan before refinancing? Or should I refinance then pay off the chunk?

personalfinance,An extra 1k was withdrawn from my account from my rent check. How does this happen? And what can I do?,"I was very surprised this morning when I noticed that $1,814 was missing from my checking account this morning. I dropped off my rent check of $814 to the apt complex office yesterday. When looking at the check scan online on my account, it clearly says in numerals and in writing $814. I made no mistake on my end. Would this be the apt management's fault or the bank's? I believe they take the checks directly to the bank, so a teller must have processed this; it couldn't be a mobile deposit or ATM error. I've already contacted management and they said they'd give me a refund and it'd be 5-10 days. When I called my bank (PNC) customer service, the representative said the only recourse really would be to dispute the transaction, and that it would also take around 10 days. Is this really all there is to do? Am I really just gonna be waiting until next week for my money to be returned to me? I'm lucky in that I can afford for this to happen temporarily, but I am fed up nonetheless.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Update: I learned that the apt does NOT take the checks to a bank, but rather scans them and sends them to corporate (they own many properties across the eastern US). I went into my local bank branch and talked with someone to get it straightened out. Basically there was an encoding error with the amount when it was virtually submitted to the bank, as many of you said. I guess my period between the 814 and the 00 wasn't big enough for something, or it was just straight up wrong, but no human is at fault. PNC has already given me a credit of the 1k, and I notified my apt management that I had gotten it resolved through my bank, but that I would not be giving them checks anymore and negotiated that they waive their convenience fee for paying online via card for the rest of my current lease since it was an error on their end when processing the check.

Thanks to all who have given advice, it's much appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing loan after 6 months of purchasing,"Hi there!

Love using this sub, so much knowledge here! 

I have a question about refinancing, especially during these historically low-interest rates. 

My question is, we recently purchased our first home, a conventional fixed mortgage, 30 years. We locked in 3.5% and got our closing costs covered ($7000\~). Our mortgage broker is one of my closest friend's cousin so he has been great with giving us all the advice and even covered our loan fees. 

He told us the best way to go is by getting our closing costs covered and then refinancing in 6 months. I just talked to him the other day and he mentioned rates are around 3% now. 

Having never done a refinance, what should I be looking at specifically when refinancing? And what else are we comparing outside of the 3.5% &lt; 3% difference?

Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,ISO Credit Card Recommendations?,"Hello! I have two credit cards, both of which are associated with stores (Old Navy and Sears/Kmart). I pay them off in full each month. I got the Old Navy card as I buy many of my clothes there and I receive a discount when I pay with the card. The Sears/Kmart card was the only one I could get when I graduated from college due to my credit history only being Federal student loans.

The Sears/Kmart card is part of the Shop Your Way rewards program. Historically, I use the points at Black Friday to purchase the majority of my Christmas gifts for free. However, I'm restricted to exclusively using the points with Sears or Kmart.

I think it's time for me to get a general credit card that offers more versatile rewards points. The primary use of this card is to purchase gas, online shopping, and any large purchases. I'm definitely open to using it for other purchase categories should it be beneficial from a rewards standpoint. Again, I completely pay off in full each month.

My family lives 900+ miles away so in normal years I fly to see them somewhat regularly. A way to earn points to cover those flights would be helpful, but I always fly on whichever airline is cheapest, rather than with a specific airline. But I also enjoy using the points for online shopping at the holidays.

A friend who is financially wise likes the Chase Sapphire Preferred card and had recommended it, but I don't like the annual fee connected. However, my friend reports the points are generous enough that they more than cover the annual fee cost. 

I just bought a new home last month. Outside of the mortgage, my only debt are my Federal student loans. I anticipate needing a new car in about five years but am actively saving for that so I can purchase in cash. To my knowledge, there are no upcoming life events for which a hard inquiry on my credit score would be harmful. When I purchased my new home, I had a 800 FICO score.

I will confess that I don't exactly feel like I have a ""grown up"" card as the two I do have are store-branded. However, I do want a better rewards program than what I've currently got available.

Can anyone recommend a good general card to potentially apply for and/or give more insight about the Chase Sapphire Preferred card?",finance
personalfinance,"Starting a Roth IRA at 18, How Do I Find the Annual Interest Percentage?","Hi there!

The issue is - I have zero clue who to actually trust and how to know the yearly interest rate.

Obviously, I want to plan for retirement and save money (plus those tax benefits), but whenever I look into opening up a Roth IRA say with Fidelity, which I see a lot of sources/friends recommend, I see the annual interest rate is 0.01% - my Dad wanted me to start one with a bank like CHASE, but they offer the same of 0.01% interest - how do I actually find out the whole 5% average or look for higher % interest rates?

personalfinance,Help with Refinancing my Car (Newbie),"Hi! :D
I'm a little lost when it comes to refinancing my car and am hoping to get your feedback. My main question is - do you think I should refinance my car? I'm thinking of refinancing my car for three reasons 

- I'd like the car to be under my name. My dad put a couple thousand down for a 2016 Juke back in 2016 but I quickly took over the payments. The car is still under his name but he's onboard with transferring the title to me. 
- The monthly payment is $430 which is okay for me right now but I would like to move to another apartment soon where I'll have to save more money. I am hoping to get a lower monthly payment around $230. 
- I think (not sure) it's still important to get the interest rate down. The dealer gave my dad a terrible 7.7% interest rate on the original amount of $24,650. So far, I've paid $15,626 for the Principal and $6,302 have gone towards the Interest. The payoff amount is around $9,909. (Disclaimer, this is about to be a very stupid comment - The only reason I say I'm not sure if it's still important to get the interest rate down is because I heard somewhere that I paid the interest up front and now since I'm paying towards the Principal/car value, lowering the interest rate wouldn't do anything).  

I tried getting the car refinanced early on in 2016 but my credit was really low. Since June of this year my credit is at 757 and I think I have a good shot with refinancing. My second question is - if you do think I should refinance, do you have any credit union recommendations? (I live in Los Angeles). 

Thank you for reading through my questions! I'm a newbie with these types of things and would really appreciate learning from you!",finance

personalfinance,Applying for mortgage with no payment history on student loans,"I am a 30 year old teacher planning to buy a house with my wife in a little over one year from now. My credit score is 740+ and I have a low DTI. My only concern about applying for a mortgage is that, while my student loans (\~30K) are all in good standing, I have no payment history on them. 

In short, I finished my bachelor's degree at age 25 with about 20K in loans, and ended up working as a full-time substitute teacher for a few years. During that time, I was very poor and could not afford payments, so I got them deferred under financial hardship. Shortly after I became a licensed teacher at 27 and began making more money, I enrolled in grad school and then my loans entered automatic forbearance due to my status as a graduate student. 

After taking out more loans for grad school (will be about 12-13 grand for the entire degree) my loan balance now hovers around 30K and will be around 35K when I finish my master's next year (around the same time I plan to purchase a home). Realizing that I need to establish some payment history on my loans, I recently applied for a payment plan with Fedloan--however, Fedloan denied my application, saying that I am not eligible for any payment plans because my loans are not due at this time. They said I can reapply at the time my loans come due. Since I have no amount due, should I just begin making payments anyway? Obviously, making payments generally a good thing to do, but would these payments help to establish my DTI if it's just an arbitrary amount that I choose, rather than a set payment amount determined by Fedloan?  I've read that lenders typically calculate a 5% payment if there is no established payment plan. 

Note: One of the reasons I have not made payments on my loans is because I will qualify for a substantial amount of loan forgiveness in 2 years, due to working in special education at a Title I school.",finance

investing,ETG Tax-Advantaged Dividend Fund,"Hi all, long time lurker. I know chasing dividend yield is generally frowned upon for long term investing growth but I'm looking a for a medium risk place to stash some cash for 5 to 10 years that is going to do better than a 0.4% interest rate on a HYSA. I'm okay with the risk of a market downturn in that time frame.

I've been looking into dividend funds that hold mostly blue-chip stocks and came across ETG. Current dividend yield is about 8.5% a year, paid monthly, but the expense ratio is over 2%, half of which is due to interest on the fund's debt.
 
Considering it's trading 12% below its NAV, has a good monthly yield, but taking into account the high expense ratio, I feel it would be a reasonable mid-term investment. My main portfolio is VTI/VXUS with a few individual picks thrown in and will remain that way but I dislike the idea of money just sitting around aside from the 6 month emergency fund, which remains in a HYSA.

A promissory note was drawn up. We also sold our own home, made a decent return, and paid his parents $225k back with the proceeds. We now still owe them $315k. I was thinking this would be easy - I go get a mortgage against our new home for $315k and pay the balance of the loan.

Today I learned from the first lender I talked to that a) this is a cash-out refi, b) we must be on title for 6 months before we can do a cash-out refi.

Is it really though? We aren't asking for any additional cash above what we owe. We just want to pay the balance of the loan. Why does it matter whether we owe money to my in-laws or to another bank? I have the paper trail showing that we owe money that was used to purchase a home. Is there any way we can get a refi earlier than 6 months?",finance

personalfinance,"Do we sell now and rent, or continue scraping by.","Hello all, new member here!

So the wife and I own a home that we bought roughly 5 years ago.  Here's the long and short of our back story.  We have been doing fine up until last year.  We probably bought more house than we needed, but we were getting by fairly well for the first few years.  Then jobs changed and a 3rd kid happened. Last year we had to do a mortgage restructure (I believe that's what it's called) as we got behind and that is what brought us current. 

We were managing again and just wanted to get through a year so we could sell and be in a spot to buy (I was told we had to have on time payment history for a year to get a new mortgage once we sold) and then covid hit and the wife lost her job due to the company eliminating a lot of positions.  She's working again, but not making anywhere near the money she was before and we are Tight with a capital T.  We have been exploring options and have come up with a few, but as we clearly haven't always made the best financial decisions I wanted to see what some people might think that are more financially savvy.  Do we keep barely scraping by and hoping we can make the mtg payment on time for a while?  Or do we sell and take some of the money profited from the sale and get ahead?  We have some other debts, but not a ton. I've got about $1500 in CC debt, we have one auto loan with about $20,000 left. Both have high interest rates because of our iffy credit history.  

I know renting is a money pit and ideally selling to buy is normally the better option. But here's my thought.  We bought for $223,000 5 years ago. I think our principal balance is around $215,000 now.  Smaller houses in our sub have been going for around $280,000.  So, my thought was. If we sold and rented it could almost be a reset for us.  I know the realtor gets their cut and I know the price isn't a guarantee, but if we did sell and we're able to use the profit made to pay off our debts we could almost start in a year with a clean slate.  Pay off the debts, find a place to rent where the monthly is cheaper than our mortgage (we'd have to downsize for a bit) so we can walk away as close to debt free as possible and have some extra in savings.  

I'm also open to other ideas as well, these are just the ones we are mulling over.  Also it's a bit of a ramble so if anything is confusing, please let me know.  Thanks in advance!",finance

1. Put 20% or $100k from saving as down payment, and use pre-tax retirement account for remodeling, paying cash, it will be taxed at 22 to 24%
2. Put 50% or all of my $250k as down payment, which lowers my mortgage rate and monthly, and take out a $100k HELOC to pay for the remodeling at around 4% interest
3. Put 20% down, get a loan from renofi to pay for remodeling, presumably at higher interest rate than HELOC, but I don't have to take a lot of money out of my retirement all at once this way and could use income generated from it to pay a portion of the loan
4. construction loan, after talking to lenders, I'm kinda giving up on this due to complexity and fees involved

personalfinance,Is thid FB post true? Tips?,"I found this post on Facebook, is any of this true:

Buy a house and get a 15 year fixed mortgage rather than a 30 year mortgage. Saves a lot of money in interest over the life of the loan. If you must get the 30 year mortgage, verify that there is no prepayment penalty. This gives you the flexibility of paying it off early if you are able. But it also gives you the option of making lower payments when times are tough...

When you start your job, get an HSA account and not FSA and get the high deductible health insurance. It will lower your tax bracket and the money is yours to use. You also earn 40% in most cases after 10k!!! 

Never buy a car brand new! I’ve watched Escalades go from 100k (new) to 35k four years later.

Get you an LLC (incorporate your name!!) and run it as an S Corp. Remember Jay-Z quote “I’m not a Businessman I’m a Business Maaaaaaaan....” Let that sink in.
Build business credit! The loans are bigger and the interest rate is lower.

Once your LLC has been established you can then hire your children and pay them an annual salary up to $12,400 which serves a tax break for you and lowers your yearly liability, at that point your children can use their earnings to pay for things like their tuition, school trips and any other activity or upkeep that you were originally going to be financially responsibility for so their needs are met, you're assisting them in establishing a good work ethic but more importantly you're decreasing your taxes and keeping more of your earning in house 

Get a business bank account (in most cases this costs around $500 to start). Some people got two stimulus checks (one from Trump and one from the SBA). Also no fees.

Go to Community College first and transfer into a four year college (unless you have scholarships to help mitigate the costs) as a Junior. School is a power move you must be able to secure the bag. Majors in STEM will always be needed, are in high demand and the skills can directly help the community.

Get life insurance for you (L.I.R.P., IUL, Indexed Annuity for no losses in the S&amp;P) and your children as soon as they are born (one thing is for sure is we will die..might as well leave your kids or family something extra). The sooner you get it, the cheaper it is. And you can borrow against it to fund certain projects. Also, the ones that pay out dividends are the best! They normally are associated with the market (money market accounts). IUL’s are great! 

Get the people in your immediate family to save collectively! If 10 people save $500/month, that’s 60k every year. You could buy 3 starter homes every year and in 4 years all ten of you are home owners. Buy on the same block or neighborhood if you can...this way you control the value of the homes (remember Monopoly!).

We need to promote financial literacy. Building capital and creating equity to create generational wealth. Having financial freedom is everything! This is not being taught in the school curriculums or our education systems! We must do it ourselves!

Please copy and repost this on their pages and groups and spread financial literacy!

The finance charge is $12,310.93 and the total payments says I will pay $37,788.30... for a Jetta.My first payment of $572.55 begins on 12/11/2020 and ends after 6-years.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently make $17.25/hr and work 40/hrs a week. I do not have any other financial obligations aside from community college, which is affordable with my grants.

I can drive for Lyft again, which averaged me $300/day in an 8-hour shift, however that is not an ideal option for me because I do not want to rack up miles on my car.

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know is that assuming there are no penalties for early payments, like I was told by the dealer, will paying double my monthly payment eliminate my interest rate? There is no way that I can afford to pay an extra $12,310 for a car when I need that money for school.

If there is no way to beat the interest rate, what else can I do? I feel like an idiot.",finance

personalfinance,Withdrawing from retirement,"Hi guys so I need some insight,
Age: 32 
Annual income: $100k up $40k from 2019
Current Employer match: 1.60 to every dollar (I believe) up to 6%
Savings: $0
Stocks : about $3k 
Current debt: 
100k -
$60 student loans (45 in federal 15 private)
$ 25k credit cards
$15 k automobile 
I started a new job and previous 401k has $28k
My utilization on CC has gone up quite a bit so my credit score is kind of out of whack (no late pays, no collections....only negative thing is I am leveraged). 

Should I take a 15k withdrawal (~ 19,250 after taxes fees etc) to pay off half of my debt to place me into a better position to refinance and restructure the remaining credit card debt into a long term loan? 

My plan is to increase my contribution to my current employer 401k to the max and try to rebuild retirement by contributing $1,000 monthly (my contribution + employers) to my 401k starting January (I will hit a year Q1 2021 and will be vested in 3 years, I am also in the InfoSec industry and am poised for further growth each year, company is well established and is posting billion dollar profits YOY)

My goal is in the next three years to purchase property by leveraging my retirement for a down payment if possible.  

My reliance on credit cards will no longer be necessary as I will have more cash on hand to be able to avoid the need/want to use them. 

TLDR / should I take out $19500ish from my 28k retirement to pay off 1/2 credit card debt and then restructure the remaining cc debt into a long term lower interest loan?",finance

economy,The Bank of Japan Cartel,"Japan's post-war economy is the stuff of legend.

Indeed, it is even referred to as Japan's 'economic miracle'.

But how did they do it?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, they had a war-economy system, adapted to the production of consumer goods. 

Cartels controlled competition within Japan, but of course there was no such arrangement internationally and Japanese companies soon became dominant in many markets in the world.

The Japanese established a trade surplus with almost all of its trading partners, most prominently with the United States and the European Union.

***During the 1980s, there was even talk about Japan's economy someday overtaking that of the United States.***

Some compare it to the current situation between the United States and China - the difference being that Japan is effectively a US puppet due to military leverage, which is not the case with China. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Ministry of Finance were the top dogs in Japan's post-war economy.

They controlled most aspects of the economy.

The Bank of Japan, Japan's Central Bank, had to report to the Ministry of Finance.

***However, the quantity of credit creation and its allocation was decided by the Bank of Japan.***

Via a process known as window guidance, the Bank of Japan was able to dictate to whom and for what banks could issue loans.

Essentially, the Bank of Japan told the Commercial Banks how much they will have to lend in the coming quarter and which sectors they would have to lend to.

Whenever the Ministry of Finance would inquire about the Bank of Japan's Window Guidance policy, Bank of Japan staff would engage in complex discussions, full of technical jargon - to make the process seem impenetrable to non experts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, Central Banks such as the Bank of Japan like to have full independence and establish absolute power. 

So how did they do it?

Well, they needed to create a bubble, which would then lead to a crisis, which would then lead to the power grab.

The Bank of Japan began to significantly increase window guidance loan quotas, average yearly loan growth quotas were close to 15% in the late 1980s.

***Essentially, they forced the commercial banks to engage in ridiculous levels of credit creation.***

This caused a boom in the stock market, and in real estate.

Between 1985 and 1989, stocks rose around 240% and land prices rose 245%.

Although Japan is 26 times smaller than the United States, its land was valued at 4 times that of the United States.

Therefore, instead of being used to limit and direct credit appropriately, Window Guidance was used to create a giant bubble.

The Bank of Japan was well aware that the only way for banks to meet their loan quotas, was to expand non-productive lending and therefore these asset bubbles in stocks and real estate formed.

&amp;#x200B;

OK, so we have a bubble. 

Time to pop it.

Yasushi Mieno, in his first press conference as the 26th Governor of the Bank of Japan in 1989, said that

***""Since the previous policy of monetary easing had caused the land price rise problems, real estate related lending would now be restricted.""***

Well, the press lauded him - fighting against this silly monetary policy.

In fact, *he* was Deputy Governor during the bubble era, and *he* was in charge of creating the bubble!

Starting just a week after his appointment, from late December 1989 until August 1990, the Bank of Japan *heavily* increased interest rates. 

Soon...the Japanese asset price bubble of the 1980s...popped.

Bankruptcies galore.

Between 1990 and 2003, the stock market fell by around 80% and land prices in the major cities fell by up to 84%.

Of course, mainstream economists were relieved - the downturn demonstrates that Japan's economic system was not so successful after all.

Thou shalt embrace neoliberalism.

According to Mieno:

***""Thanks to this recession, everyone is becoming aware of the need to implement economic transformation.""***

By the way, and this is important and very often overlooked, after his five-year term ended in 1994, Mieno became a Director at the BIS, the Bank for International Settlements, the central bank for central banks...

&amp;#x200B;

In order to end the recession and improve performance, it was claimed that Japan must shift from welfare capitalism back to shareholder capitalism.

Of course Japan, a country that had run a consistent and significant trade surplus, needed to change its economic system to become more competitive...

It certainly has worked a treat - check out Japan's debt to GDP ratio since the asset bubble popped around 1990.

Oh, there's more...

***Soon after his post ended in 1994, Mieno embarked on a campaign, giving speeches blaming the Ministry of Finance for the creation of the bubble and the long recession.***

He lobbied for a change in the Bank of Japan law.

He suggested that it was the Ministry of Finance who had pushed the Bank of Japan into the wrong policies and, of course, to avoid such problems in the future, the Bank of Japan needed to be given full legal independence.

***In 1998, monetary policy was put entirely into the hands of the newly independent Bank of Japan.***

datascience,Meaning of the math behind Principal Component Analysis,"Hey, 

So I'm a fresher to datascience and lately I've been catching up on principal component analysis (PCA) and the math behind it. For anyone who is well versed in Linear Algebra, i have a question that's been itching in me. Now i know PCA is used to increase the Signal to Ratio, basically the information fed into our data. But the way to do so is little unclear. 

Firstly I went through the link [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mathematics-behind-principal-component-analysis-fff2d7f4b643) to understand what was happening. As a beginner in Linear Algebra, I understand what eigenvectors and eigenvalues are. Let me try to define it below, please let me know if I'm thinking straight:

&gt;Eigenvector is one, who when undergoing a Linear transformation through a matrix A will not change its orientation but only will be scaled by the eigenvalue. 

So in this aspect I was checking PCA, when it was mentioned we try to find the eighen vectors for Linear transformation given by the Covariance Matrix. Now this is where I have a hard time understanding the concept. Why are we seeing Covariance Matrix as a linear transformation, how does finding a vector that does not change its orientation and finding the eigenvalue help us here?

What are we trying to achieve by doing that? And is there any benefits in learning this particular mathematical concept? Or is it better to just leave it as it be and mug the concept?

I'd love some help as I'm unaware who to raise this question to. Hopefully I could find some help here. 

If its the wrong place to raise, please guide me as to where I can do so?

Basically the deferred balance does not have any interest accrued. but it is due in full when 1 of the 3 criteria is met from above.

Credit cards have been maxed due to Covid issues, my unemployment for a month, car repairs and frivolous spending to be honest. Now that our cards are maxed we have no credit to try a balance transfer card to pay it down quicker. So we then tried a personal loan to consolidate the debt into one payment with one interest rate and that was a no go as well . My credit is straight awful. A repo and a couple cards that were closed with a balance owed. I’ve paid these off since but the effects are still lingering. So now were thinking about asking my wife’s mom to either co-sign on a loan or asking her to open a credit card up with us to get a better interest rate. Together we make about 80k. Every month our chase accounts go negative. And it’s getting to the point to where it’s unbearable. And has seriously fucked my state of mind. Growing up in a non stable home has given me super bad anxiety about money. I’ve done plenty of research on how to pay it off quicker (debt snowball technique) etc. idk what to do anymore. I wanted to give up on it and just stop paying it and have some peace of mind for a couple of months and then try to settle it.

This is very welcome, as I coincidentally have a large expense coming up that will cost $4k-$5k. I’d rather not go in to detail about what the expense is, but it suffices to say it’s essential and the cost is firm.

Now, my first instinct is to just use this very well timed bonus and and then carry on as normal. However, I also have $10k in very high interest credit card debt, which is messing up my credit score, since that puts me at 53% of my utilization (my score is 680). 

This has me tempted to instead dump all of my bonus in to my credit cards, fixing my mediocre credit. A month later I would then apply for a $10k personal loan to finance my crucial expense, and use the other $4k-$5k to pay off the remainder of my cards. That way I get the money I need, PLUS all my high interest cards are finished. I’m then left the same amount of debt, but now it’s gone from a 23% interest rate to something much lower (my credit union has good rates).

So my cousin has been unemployed for a while now due to the pandemic and she was starting to get worried about her loans come January. She received an official-looking letter in the mail from a company called Amerifed Doc Prep claiming they would consolidate her loans and she would have her loans paid for by the US Government and forgiven after a set period.

She ends up calling them up and the representative on the phone proceeded to ask her for sensitive information about her student loans and personal info (which to be fair, she handed over to them). From what she tells me they reset the password to her account so that they could log in and fill out the paperwork. They took her bank information, social security number and sent her over the paperwork from her student loan servicer about the loan consolidation which she signed and sent back.

After the whole thing was said and done, they stated that they were not affiliated with the US Government or the DOE and that she had to pay a $799 one time fee and would pay $39 each month from here on out.

She started to get the vibe that something might be off about this and asked them to cancel the application. The representative said that it was unfortunate but that they would cancel the process and not charge her. However, she wakes up two days later to $799 being withdrawn from her bank account in the form of an electronic check.

When she reached out to the company they said that they would refund the money via mailed check within 5-7 business days and that they were not a scam. A quick google search pulls up a bunch of negative reviews on BBB ([https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/tustin/profile/legal-document-help/amerifed-doc-prep-llc-1126-1000067425/customer-reviews](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/tustin/profile/legal-document-help/amerifed-doc-prep-llc-1126-1000067425/customer-reviews)), however, they are a registered LLC in California ([https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?filing=&amp;SearchType=LPLLC&amp;SearchCriteria=amerifed&amp;SearchSubType=Keyword](https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?filing=&amp;SearchType=LPLLC&amp;SearchCriteria=amerifed&amp;SearchSubType=Keyword)).

Bitcoin,"To you older hodlers out there, How do you feel about bitcoin now?","Not sure if this is how all hodlers end up feeling but i feel something about this run up and how 2020 has played out has really changed how i view bitcoin. 

When i started messing around with it in 2015 buying stuff online and mining on my gaming pc it was just a cool idea and some cool way to transact with people globally, i kinda viewed it like runescrape gold but without the runescape part. Still appreciated its potential as a digital gold and global currency but was still like yeah, you can dream.. Didn't think it would actually achieve more than a dream back then.

Now feels different, im glad i decided to hold onto at least a bit of my coin. Ive had way more before, but looking back i can't imagine any way i could have convinced myself holding more, things were different back then, bitcoin was a speculative dream in a lot of ways. 

Seeing the stimulus we have had this year and the level of economic destruction that has occurred in my country let alone the rest of the world im seeing bitcoin as a way out of the system. We're seeing it failing in front of our eyes, can't not see it anymore. Its all around us, some people might be still happy with their 100k jobs but people around them are falling down. I just don't see how USD is going to maintain power or lots of other currencies for that matter, maybe Chinese yuan might not fall as much but bitcoin is yours and dollars are promise of someone's future labor (thanks fed for a debt backed currency..). What happens when people aren't able to pay dollars to anyone? The system fails. 

Now im not saying bitcoin wont go up forever or down from here. Expect it to go down and dont get worried. Expect USD will strengthen as people scramble to get dollars together at all costs to pay their obligations. USD is deflationary right now even with so much stimulus. Expect a fed coin or something in the next few years, expect them to try regulate bitcoin and get rid of it. This is a big risk im not sure if people understand it as the threat it is. If bitcoin was banned outright with jail time (big motive is govs wanting control of their own taxes, own rates, bonds etc..), assuming the courts still work there will be no legal institutional investment and use cases. This would kill lots of potential future capital and growth, putting bitcoin outside the law, much what it was like in the early days. 

Not saying thats going to happen its just a different risk to what was before. Years ago it was a speculation risk, that it was a bubble, that it was worthless. To be fair it was a bubble, it didn't do ""much"" for a 100b market cap. Today bitcoin is gaining serious, undeniable growth, real use case, real safety and as an inflationary hedge. It always was seen as being a good inflation hedge but i think we are seeing that crystalize today and only more so in the future. 

Is this the similar thinking to you older hodlers out there? Did you stop worrying about price fluctuations because you know things were always going to be a hard way up and to almost expect it to fail, but to always end up knowing that the almost cultural backing and common ideas behind bitcoin would never die and as time goes on you only believe in it more?",cryptocurrency

I have an old car loan at a 6.0% interest rate. Since I can no longer contribute to the TSP I wonder if it would be better to leave the money in the TSP to grow or just withdraw the money and pay the loan off. The total payoff for the car loan is $5600 at $393/m. The remaining funds would be enough to pay off a second loan with a lower interest rate.

I have no CC debt or other high-interest debt other than the above. I do have emergency savings and contribute to and fully vested in a pension plan and will be contributing to an IRA once I'm debt-free.",finance
stocks,"Qualcomm stocks jumps, what does I mean for Apple stock? Stock market news, updates &amp; predictions [11-4-2020]","**Qualcomm just surged 13% what does this mean for Apple? What’s going on in the stock market, let’s talk about it** [BANNER](https://ibb.co/6FGqkY6)

Hey everyone and Welcome I am going to react to the latest Qualcomm earnings and what they mean for Apple as well as a quick update of the stock market and what’s coming next

So Qualcomm stock jump after the bell yesterday at one point being more than15% up but closing the after-market session up almost 13%. The company beat the Non-Gaap and GAAP by more than 25 cents and beat the revenue estimates by more than 500 million dollars. [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/C1DVGwc) That is a increase of more than 35% year over year and the company offered great guidance for next quarter as they expect to see a even bigger increase in EPS and revenues beating the outlook expectation on that also. The company also estimates that next quarter they will also more than double the shipments of 5G handsets, a increase of more than 200million units is expected that suggests that the iPhone 12 sales are very good. Qualcomm is a very good company to own for the futures, the 5G cycle in coming and the company will benefit a lot from this, while they offer both growth and value by giving out dividends.  [QCOM FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/VwKqCVh) Apple is using the companies modem and other complementary chips in the iPhone 12 lineups so expect Apple to do very well in the next quarters, as some other suppliers like SkyWorks Solutions also saw an spike in demand. Apple will continue to be a stellar company for the foreseeable future with the likes of the Apple One bundle just launching. 

Apple is also more than 20$ from it’s all time high and has finally broken the down trend that started in October, as it has found a level at around 115$ were I believe will have a lot of support and upside from here. The Rsi also indicates the company is a buy at the moment, far away from overbought conditions. Apple stands to benefit from easing antitrust issues also now, with a big tech brake up a lot less likely now. [Apple Chart](https://ibb.co/sQY33fT)

Yesterday we saw a big jump in most of the stock market, with the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 leading the way up more than 4,4% [Nasdaq CHART](https://ibb.co/TtyYqbg), while the S&amp;P also rose more than 2% [S&amp;P CHART](https://ibb.co/WkPzcH7) and the Industrial heavy dow jones was the laggard only being up 1,3% [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/3zv5Rck) .  The Volatility Index (VIX) or the fear gage in the stock market also saw a huge drop of more than 16%, closing the day under 30 for the first time since the middle of october [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/RpxZ306). There wasn’t to much breath in the stock market though as only 51% of the companies were advancing but we did see a huge difference in new highs vs lows. The average trading volume is still down but I expect that to regain momentum in the next period [CHART](https://ibb.co/T4ZqM8z) . The leaders of the rally yesterday were the Health Care, Communications, technology and consumer discretionary while the laggards were materials, utilities, financials and industrial all being down more than 1% as a hole [CHART](https://ibb.co/n8n05f0) . The momentum and growth stocks especially the large caps were the leaders yesterday as small cap and value plays did suffer [CHART](https://ibb.co/L9H52GR) . Here is a heat map  [CHART](https://ibb.co/BNp47Cp) of the stock market as The biggest losers yesterday were companie like Caterpillar, Vulcan Materials and united rentals while the biggest winners were the tech companies with the likes of Uber and Lyft which received great news from California as well as Faceook, Paypal and also we saw some great gains from the health sector with United Health and Biogen which had some great announcement for the Alzheimer treatment. 

I was very interested to see what the US crude oil inventories will show yesterday and we have received some great news as the inventories decreased by almost 8 million barrels as they were expected to increase by almost 1 million. That is a huge difference and seems to be pointing to a great restart of the economy with the inventories mostly decreasing since July.  [OIL CHART](https://ibb.co/K2Nysg2)

Today i will closely watch the Fed announces as they still expected to hold the short term rate at a quarter of a percentage

Today we will finally here from Peloton as they will release earnings results with the EPS estimate at 12 cents, I do believe they will beat this and i expect it to be in the same ballpark as last quarter at least. I believe the company will continue to grow especially with the lower priced products becoming available and the subscription based model which provides a very stable recuring revenue stream. [PELOTON EPS](https://ibb.co/6ZVTDLF)

Meanwhile Pre-Market trading has started in the green again as the Nasdaq100 leads the pack again, up more than 2% with both the S&amp;P and the Dow being up around 1%. [PRE-MARKET](https://ibb.co/wzjpypK)

Also while recording this video Alibaba just announced a beat of EPS but a miss on revenue,which missed by 500milion $ but is stil 30% up year over year. The monthly active users also increase 7 million since last quarter giving the company a continued user growth, the stocks was up about 3% in pre-market before the announcemt but has since dropped to a lose of about 3%.

personalfinance,Should I stop paying federal student loan?,[removed],finance
personalfinance,Should I roll my IRAs into my 401(k) so I can do backdoor Roths?,"I am above the Roth IRA income limit so I am unable to make contributions directly to a Roth IRA. As such, I'd like to begin doing backdoor Roths each year at the max, but I have a Rollover IRA (\~$20k) from a former employer's pension plan and a SIMPLE IRA ($5k) from another former employer. As such, I would need to pay taxes on the conversion. 

To avoid taxes, I could roll these into my current employer's 401(k) plan. The downside of that is that it isn't such a great plan. The only decent fund it offers is some mysterious ""Vanguard 500 Index"" with a ticker that doesn't correspond to anything real (I believe it is maybe VINIX wrapped in some proprietary security). They have mysterious percentage-based fees that amount to about 0.56% annually that HR has just shrugged off my questions about despite them not appearing on the disclosure form. Any sort of action with them tends to result in more fees and I'd guess the roll-ins would as well. I already hate having to contribute money to this plan, which I've been maxing out each year, but it is currently my only tax-advantaged option. 

I have confirmed that my 401(k) does not offer the features that allow for mega backdoor Roths and that my Rollover IRA and SIMPLE IRA are both eligible for roll-ins to the plan. 

So my options are:

1. Leave things as-is and don't attempt to do a backdoor Roth. I've currently been using any spillover from maxing out the 401(k) for taxable investment accounts, so I'd continue that. 
2. Roll my tax-deferred IRAs into to my current 401(k), thus enabling tax free backdoor Roths, but subjecting these funds to a plan that I do not like. 
3. Leave things as-is, do the backdoor Roth, and just eat the taxes. Looks like taxes would be about $1000 on a full $6000 contribution this year just for federal (and I'm in a high income tax state) which seems probably higher than worth it. 

Thoughts? Any experiences with going these different routes and having positive or negative outcomes because of it?",finance
personalfinance,Suggestions for a 27 year-old with some very specific numbers and background info (long read),"I would like some advice on my specific situation and current plan. I broke it down into background info, assets/debts summary, income expenses and budget, and my long-term plan. It’s a long one and a lot of background info so thank in advance if you take the time to read:

**Background**:

· Got my master’s degree immediately after undergrad from a one-year program at UGA between 2016 and 2017 that put me 40,000 in student loan debt. My parents covered undergrad (bless them) and let me have their 2003 ford Expedition to start life living on my own (bless them more). Out of grad school I started with a $60,000 salary and was living in a nice but expensive apartment that was close to $1,500 a month after utilities. I also bought a $6,000 used Ducati motorcycle and payments were around $155 a month. After about a year, I wanted to get serious about saving. In the Summer of 2018, I sold the motorcycle, moved into a 3-bedroom apartment with 2 roommates, took the cheapest room (smallest one with no windows), and my rent dropped to about $560 after utilities. I also got a raise and now had an income of $66,000. I decided I wanted to stay in that apartment for 2 years or so to save. I got another raise summer of 2019 up to $72,000. Over the course of the 2 years, I decided I would rather save up for a house down payment than invest in my 401k for 2 reasons: my company didn’t match - so other than tax advantages and loss of potential gains, I wasn’t leaving money on the table, and real estate was booming in my area. By March of this year (2020), I had saved about $25,000 and pulled the trigger on a house to move in with my soon to be fiancé. I put 5% down on a $340,000 house ($17,000ish) to leave myself $8,000 in emergency savings. PMI is only $75 and I was splitting everything with my girlfriend at the time which included the mortgage, taxes, financing, PMI, and home insurance and the total was about $1150 a person. I pulled the trigger on an engagement ring in July and popped the question (yay). The ring was about $6,000 and I am financing at 0% interest over 18 months. I plan on paying the remainder off when I get my tax return in February/March 2021. Fast forward to October 2020 and I got a new job with a salary of $88,000 and a guaranteed 10% bonus and potential 15% bonus depending on company performance (apparently the 15% has hit for employees the last 5 years in a row), so essentially $100,000ish (yay). Additionally, they will match up to 5% 401k which I will start once I become eligible. My fiancé also received a raise up to $58,000 so about a $160,000 combined income. We frugally furnished the 5-bedroom house with mostly used furniture with the exception of our master bedroom which we recently financed at 0% interest and payments will be about $75 a month each. Also, I am purchasing a German Shepherd in a couple weeks (not financially smart, but I have never had a dog and have waited 27 years and finally have the backyard to have one). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Income/Expenses/Budget** (Finance and I have not combined finances so going to keep this separate to just me for this one but for simplicity sake - she makes $58,000 before taxes and saves around $500 a month)

&amp;#x200B;

· **My Income** – after 5% to get the match of 401k, taxes, health/dental insurance, pet insurance, and including my lowest bonus of 10%, my monthly income will be about **$5,150**

o Car insurance: $40

o Haircuts: $30

o Groceries: $450ish

o Travel, weekend fun, miscellaneous purchases: $675ish

· **My money Left in my pocket each month**: $1600ish (not including $500 going towards my mortgage principle, another $240 in tax returns from my mortgage, and about $650 going towards my 401k including the company match)

&amp;#x200B;

**Plan**

· Between now and summer of 2022 - Build up emergency savings to about $30,000 which will be about 9 months of living after I pay off the ring and another $10,000 for when my car inevitably breaks down

· Pay off ring when I get my $4,000ish tax return in the spring 2021

· Pay off remaining furniture with my 2022 tax return 

· Start putting all excess income after saving the $40,000 into my student loan debt 

· Put all excess income after loans into increasing my 401k contribution and/or Roth IRA

· Put all excess income once I max 401k and Roth into a non-tax advantaged brokerage account and maybe and to cash reserves for future children.

Please let me know if you see anything I could do differently to benefit myself.

personalfinance,Learnings from a Home Purchase and Mortgage Closing,"Wanted to share some tid-bits with everyone in hopes that this may help someone.

1. Mortgage Loan: shop around like crazy. Send quote from every lender to every other lender. Once you pick a lender, negotiate further by asking all lender fees to be waived (credited).
2.  Wells fargo is the only lender in the nation that takes your relationship pricing BEFORE closing/pre-downpayment, meaning you can get a huge discount even if you are paying a big amount of your assets for downpayment.
3. Look for relationship pricing: Move some assets, including retirement money to save on interest rate. Look at BBVA Compass for great discounts for as little as 25K (many finance forums have details)
4. Negotiate a agent commission refund: Upnest, redfin, unlockedhome etc. you can negotiate upto 2.5% being refunded to you. Even on new construction commissions. Always take an agent to new construction, easiest money you both will ever make. No the builder won't just reduce the price without an agent. They need to keep comps up. EDIT: As a buyer you can get the buyer's agent to give you a refund from the commission they receive in the sale.
5. Negotiate a seller credit: upto 3% of of purchase price. its better to get credit than $$ off sale price. credit directly offsets your cash required to close.
6. Negotiate with the Title company: don't give in to bull around rates filed with the state. negotiate. Even if you are using a seller's specific company, and paying from the seller credit, still negotiate. 
7. Ask for a full notarized, certified copy of all closing docs. Costs about $50 extra, but couple attorneys told me the importance of asking for this. My title/escrow company was confused with this request, but ultimately accommodated. Keep the physical paper copies for atleast 2 years.
8. Get a full inspection: Full inspection isn't just Home and Roof inspection. Call a tradesman for electrical, foundation, plumbing, and insulation/energy inspection. 
9. Read every closing doc carefully. Ask for a certified copy of all escrow and loan docs. Most escrow companies will be confused but will honor the request if you insist.
10. Opt out of arbitration with the notary, escrow, seller, agents anyone that will let you. Always preserve your right to a day in court, if ever needed.
11. Put in as many full loan applications as you can within 45 day window. Multiple pulls only affect your credit score once. Full loan applications also give you more bargaining power as the lender knows you are serious.
12. Freeze all your credit reports after getting a mortgage. MANY MANY MANY people see a ton of your info including SSN and accounts is good to keep everything secure. Remember there are four. Not three, bureaus.
13. Optional: i closed all my accounts and reopened under new account numbers for all docs that went to lenders as I was shopping around, to ensure security of my accounts. 

Good luck!",finance

Currently waiting to hear back from one making about $75k base, so I'll be able to dig myself out of this soon enough.

My 401k has about $11,500 in it currently. I tried to get a CARES act distribution, but my company opted out of following that guidance so I couldn't get any of those benefits. I can ask toxic employer to approve a loan program (which I'm doubtful they'll even take my calls; they're a horrible company), or as I understand cash it out and pay whatever the taxes are for my income level, plus the 10% early withdrawal penalty.

personalfinance,10 year ARM vs 30 year fixed,"I am just about to take out a home loan for over $1M.

I am inclined to go with a 30 year fixed mortgage to lock in the historically low rates.

But I could save some money by getting a lower interest rate on a 10 year ARM. 

Ideally I would keep this property forever, and if I were to buy another house in ten years, hopefully I will have enough money to rent out this property and still buy the other house. 

But I cannot predict the future, and it is certainly possible that in 10 years, I want to move somewhere else and have to sell this property to buy the other one.

How should I make this decision?

Edit: thank you so much to everyone that has responded so far! I am just adding this edit based on some of the comments I’ve gotten so far. 

I get that if I were sure that I’ll sell the house in years, I should go for the arm. And if I were sure that I’ll keep the house forever, I should go for the 30 year fixed. 

The dilemma arises because as a first time home buyer, I don’t know if I will sell or keep the house after 10 years. So I am looking for advice on how to plan for that uncertainty.

So basically, is it worth paying the few extra grand every year to be sure that if I decide to keep the house after ten years, I can keep paying the lower rate? Or is it worth saving the few grand every year, and see what happens after 10 years because who knows what’ll happen in 10 years and most people tend to keep a house for less than 10 years anyway?",finance

stocks,A Look at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS),"#**Introduction**

The market crash caused by COVID-19 allowed investors many opportunities to buy strong companies at low valuations. The S&amp;P 500 has now rallied almost 60% since the March bottom and value has become significantly harder to find in a market where high valuations are king. Retail investors have turned to struggling companies in the airlines, cruise lines, and hospitality industries. Many of these companies have a very real bankruptcy risk and are not good candidates for value investing.

However, there are still strong companies that are fundamentally undervalued due to the Pandemic, primarily in the financials sector. One such company is [Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS)]( https://www.vhinny.com/display/GS).

#**Description**

Goldman Sachs is an investment banking firm in the capital markets industry. The Company’s trading business accounts for approximately [60% of revenue]( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-results/trading-becomes-a-plus-for-goldman-once-again-during-coronavirus-rout-idUSKCN21X1M1), making the company less susceptible to decreased revenues from low-interest rates. The Company also is involved in consumer banking and asset management. Goldman plans to further expand into these two categories, [especially digital consumer banking]( https://fintechranking.com/2020/07/23/inside-goldmans-product-roadmap-for-digital-bank-marcus/). 
Goldman’s most obvious competitor is Morgan Stanley, who [recently acquired E*TRADE]( https://www.morganstanley.com/press-releases/morgan-stanley-closes-acquisition-of-e-trade).

#**Valuation**

Ticker|Company|Mkt Cap|P/E|Fwd P/E|PEG|P/B|Div
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
GS|Goldman Sachs|68.41B|10.97|8.22|1.27|0.89|2.53%
MS|Morgan Stanley|93.02B|8.68|10.09|2.34|1.01|2.72%

Goldman Sachs shows clear potential as a value play with a P/B under 1. Its PEG of 1.27 shows future earnings expectations are reasonably priced, compared with the sector average of 2.32. Goldman’s trailing P/E comes in at 10.97, with a sector average of 18.22. 

Goldman pays a sustainable dividend of 2.53% with a payout ratio of 27.70%. The dividend yield follows the sector average of 2.21%. 

The average price target for Goldman is $255, with a current price of $202. Analysts are expecting upside of over 25%. These metrics indicate Goldman is a strong value buy.

Valuation data sourced from [Vhinny](https://www.vhinny.com/) and [Finviz](https://finviz.com/).

#**Outlook**

Goldman recently beat third-quarter estimates, with $9.68 EPS instead of the predicted $5.57. The beat was primarily due to gains in their bond trading and asset management businesses. The trading division of Goldman Sachs saw a 29% increase in revenue from the same quarter last year.

This strong earnings beat shows that Goldman is less impacted by low interest rates when compared with primarily consumer banks. Goldman Sachs can focus on its core businesses of trading and investment banking operations, without losses in consumer and business loans having a significant impact on revenue.

Furthermore, Goldman has recently started to expand its FinTech presence with Marcus. Through Marcus, Goldman provides [high-yield online savings accounts, personal loans, and financing through MarcusPay]( https://www.marcus.com/us/en). Goldman’s entry into the space will likely serve as a positive catalyst for future growth.

personalfinance,Calculating Capital gains how to apply state tax.,"So,
1. do  I do standard deduction before anything? 

2. Do I do the federal and state tax separately for capital gains? Like let's say I have 100000 in short term capital gain , do I tax the 100000 short term gain with the federal tax and then tax the 100000 short term gain with the local state tax? 

3. When im doing the federal tax, is it progressive? Meaning the first 9,875 I make is taxed at 10% then the rest is taxed at the higher rates and so on .

gaming,Help me remember the name of this game please,"So, there was this online game. I believe it used to be on MiniClip. This is back from like 2010 btw. It was a pixel art style and the main character was a guy with brown hair. It is a three part game. In the first game, he goes to get a video game from the mall and some little girl bought the last copy so he has to  convince the girl to give it to him and she wants a new stuffed animal I think? So he gives her a squirrel I think? Then in another part he gets trapped in a mall and has to escape and there's a venus fly trap and a mannequin store? And there's another part where he is in a village and there's a dog.... and a lady who likes pies?? And in another part he gets eaten by a whale.

investing,Today and yesterday are prime examples of why you don't try to time the market,"I don't want call this person out, but there was a discussion on r/investing before the election about the wisdom or lack thereof of transitioning into bonds at ""strategic"" moments when it is so ""obvious"" that the market is about to tank.

A few weeks ago this nameless Reddit user said he was transitioning 60% of his portfolio into bonds until after the election was decided because he knew the market was going to go down.

He scoffed at my advice that investors who try to time the market often miss gains from some of the biggest trading days and can pay a huge price as a result.

Several [analyses](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/investing/stocks/tempted-to-sell-missing-just-a-handful-of-the-best-stock-market-days-can-tank-your-returns/) show that if you miss out on just the 10 best trading days over a 20-year span, your investment gains will be CUT IN HALF.

This Reddit user was so sure the market would tank after the election, but I'm sure today he is crying into his Chablis.

After my back-and-forth with this user I taped a little sign to my computer monitor as a reminder: Keep Calm and Buy and Hold.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, November 5, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 5, 2020**

Stocks kept rallying today, extending this week’s gains, as market participants closely monitored the outcome of the US presidential election, which currently hangs in the balance with several key states still counting the votes. The surge in mail-in ballots this year caused this delay in vote-counting.

The market has rallied strongly at the likelihood that the White House and Senate will be split, meaning one is Republican and the other Democrat. While a split government would likely reduce the size of a new stimulus bill, it greatly lowered the odds that any new regulation or policy change from the Democrats could be passed.

Stephanie Miller, managing director of Fiscal Note Markets, said, ““What Wall Street wants more than everything is for nothing to happen in Washington. There is so much of a bias for a static policy environment – that you can actually make business decisions and have those decisions hold the test of time beyond a couple of years. And so more gridlock in Washington tends to be better.”

Several key swing states, most notably Nevada and Pennsylvania, have yet to finish tallying their votes. As of the time of writing, Joe Biden has 264 electoral votes to President Trump’s 214, according to the Associated Press. Biden only needs Nevada’s 6 electoral votes for victory. Candidates need 270 electoral votes in order to win the election. Results below are taken from the Associated Press.

* **States called for Trump**: Ky., W. Va., S.C., Ala., Miss., Tenn., Okla., Ark., Ind., N.D., S.D., Wyo., La., Neb. (4 of 5 electoral votes), Kan., Mo., Idaho, Utah, Ohio, Iowa, Mont., Fla., Texas
* States called for Biden: Vt., Va., Conn., Del., Ill., Md., Mass., N.J., R.I., N.Y., N.M., D.C., Colo., N.H., Calif., Ore., Wash., Hawaii, Minn., Ariz., Maine (3 of 4 electoral votes), Wis., Mich.

In the Senate, the “blue wave” Democrats were hoping form didn’t materialize. Democrats look like they are going to net just a single new seat in the Senate, leaving a high likelihood that Republicans maintain control. In Georgia, both Senate seats up for election this year could head to runoff contests in January, based on results in the state as of Thursday, according to the Associated Press.

Republican Sen. David Perdue held 50% of the vote Thursday morning. If that tally ends up below the 50% mark, he'll face Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff on Jan. 5 in a runoff. The other Georgia Senate seat contested between GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock, senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, already appears headed to a runoff next year. The races could play an important role in the makeup of the new Senate, though Republicans are likely to keep their majority.

In an unfortunate note, the US again broke the record for new daily coronavirus cases with 100,000 new cases yesterday. Fifteen states set new daily records for infections Thursday, including Missouri, Washington, Nebraska, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Idaho, Iowa and North Dakota, according to data tracked by The Post.  Eleven states — including Iowa, Missouri, West Virginia, North Dakota, Nebraska, Idaho, Oklahoma and Minnesota — reported record numbers of patients hospitalized with covid-19, according to data tracked by The Washington Post.

The Federal Reserve held short-term borrowing rates near zero in a decision Thursday that characterized the economy as growing but not near where it was before the coronavirus pandemic hit.

stocks,Market and Options Summary for Nov-05-2020,"## Daily Synopsis 
* The S&amp;P 500 increased +1.95% today while the NASDaq added (+2.56%). The Russell 2000 rose by (+2.8%). The Dow ended in positive territory at (+1.94%)
* All sectors ended in positive territory today. The best performing sector was Materials(+4.08%) while Energy(+0%)was the worst performer.
* Presumably, the market remained pleased by the prospect of a divided Congress, meaning it would be difficult to pass new legislation like higher taxes. Regarding the presidential election, there was still no projected winner, but former Vice President Biden led President Trump 253-214 in the delegate count, according to The New York Times. 
* In addition, the bullish price action likely exacerbated a fear of missing out on further gains, particularly among investors who sold the market last week. Today's advance increased the S&amp;P 500's weekly gain to 7.4% after falling 5.6% last week. 
* Separately, there were no surprises in the FOMC policy statement or Fed Chair Powell's press conference. The fed funds rate was left unchanged as widely expected. Mr. Powell said the current pace of asset purchases remained appropriate for the current situation but added that the voting committee discussed options if more accommodation is needed. 
* Treasury yields were subdued all session following yesterday's rally in longer-dated tenors, which was another supporting factor for growth stocks. The 2-yr yield was unchanged at 0.15%, and the 10-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.78%.

personalfinance,Is my mortgage lender being sketchy during the refinance?,"Hello everyone, 

Just looking for opinions on our situation. 

To start off, we completely understand these are unprecedented times and everyone in the industry is swamped, so we’ve been really patient and understanding from the very beginning. 

We are going through a mortgage refinance that started early July, we did a 45 day lock during the first week of July. 

Everything was great at the beginning, it seems like our mortgage officer was on top of everything. We turned in all our paperwork requested and got a loan estimate. 

I started getting a weird feeling when I contacted our mortgage officer a week before the rate expired as we had not heard anything (this was mid august). He assured that everything was fine and told me he would reach out the week of the rate expiring. Well he didn’t end up reaching out. Again, we figured they are swamped and trusting this person, I waited another week before messaging him again, but it almost seemed like he forgot about the rate expiring. But he said they’ve extended all locks for no charge. 

Since then, he’s been completely vague and unresponsive at times. He keeps telling us like, “oh it’ll be another week” and when I reach out again, he’s like “oh I meant another week until you move on to the next phase.” 

It’s been like this since then, we continue to trust that this is going to happen and justify the timeframe with the current environment. At the end of September, I sent him a message explaining that we wanted a clear timeframe even if it was next year - I even told him that if he doesn’t know that’s fine, I rather him tell me that he doesn’t know versus saying it’ll be another week. He responded saying that we will be done by the end of October, but if we wanted to cancel we can but that we wouldn’t find a better deal than his, he also threw in something about a change to the federal tax so we would have to pay 1500 plus closing if we went somewhere else. Because he gave us a clear timeframe, we continued. I reached out last week of October and he said 2 more weeks, so back to the same situation. 

At this point, i would rather go with someone else who is just more honest about the timeframe, even if it means paying more and even if it takes like 6 months. But my spouse and even my friends have suggested to stick it out. 

Is this normal behavior from a mortgage officer? Any red flags ? Anyone recommend just going with someone else? Any thoughts are appreciated. 

Location AZ, going from high interest rate to a 2.99,  30 year conventional if that matters. 

Thank you all in advance !!",finance

I am 26 y/o , I've been working in my Mom's husband factory for about 4 years now , my core duties are Book keeping and Purchasing manager but on a whole I do a lot LOT more.

I'm the designated driver when raw materials or something that cannot wait for a standard delivery needs shipping , meaning I drive around the country when need be.

I am the designated point man for the accountant , I help in however  they want me to help.

I am responsible for everything related to import and export , since no one else knows how to use DHL.

I am responsible for collecting and fixing the worker's work hours at the end of the month so I can pass them on to our accountant and eventually give them their paychecks.

I am co responsible to help our bank since I am a confirmed co signer in our company (meaning I can write and sign checks and do every action with our bank that my boss can do).

I am responsible for tracking and paying our suppliers (and of course to book keep).

I am also my boss go to guy to whatever the hell he wishes me to do , he can tell me to go buy him lunch in the middle of my book keeping operations or he can tell me to drop everything I am doing and go make a "" VERY SERIOUS AND IMPORTANT QUOTATION TO THIS CUSTOMER "" or whatever else ,if something needs to be done , I am the one he turns to.

I am also the company's IT guy since I am the only one with any knowledge of networking and computers.

My point is , I do A LOT  of stuff in our company , I fill maybe 3-4 roles and I do a lot of the stuff that my boss or someone else would have to do if I weren't around.

Because I am doing so much stuff , I am liable to make mistakes and I sure as hell do not excel in any of the professions because I do all of them.

Let me also note that I wasn't trained for ANY of the roles I was given, I was thrown into the job and got told to just do it so my only teacher is experience of 4 years.

Lately , I've been taking my book keeping job more seriously  and because of that I saw how many mistakes I've made in the past and am now hard at work at resolving them.

I also need to add that my boss is an engineer playing as a company owner, he's not a true CEO and it shows in how he runs his company , one could say that he's the one that's bringing money to the table and I am the one who actually runs the company (from a logistical stand point).. he doesn't take my job very seriously and he can be a real asshole when trying to ask him questions regarding some of his business decisions that also effect my work (like giving late discounts to customers and not telling me about it or getting paid in cash and not telling me about it or giving out checks and not telling me about it thus really fucking up my books)

After all that being said , I've been feeling very down lately. 

I feel like I don't get compensated enough for the work that I do and I feel like because I do so many jobs that essentially each one of them can be considered a full time job for any other individual , my stress levels rise as I learn more and begin to understand how many mistakes I've made and how much work is needed fix all of them.

Because of my situation (that my boss is also family of some sorts) , I've been throwing into this position that I want to ask for a raise but I was too stressed to actually make the move, so my mom talked to me about it yesterday and after I've explained all of my woes to her she went ahead and confronted my boss (her husband) after which he called me at 10 pm and started to drill me if I enjoy working for him because he heard that he's making me uncomfortable and he's sort of bringing my confidence down and whatnot , basically my mom confronted him.

I told him that I didn't want to talk about it on the phone and after insisting on my position for some time he said ""well I don't want to talk about it tomorrow ""(I am coming over to dinner at their place) and that everything will stay the same , I said okay and hung up.

Today my mom came over and basically told me that he is not planning on giving any raises to anyone since he has a lot of expenses and she basically urged me to quit my job if he refuses to give me a pay raise since he'll never ever ever give  up on me since I do so much.

So I am left wondering on how to approach this, I believe that I 100% deserve a raise even if I make mistakes, I can't avoid making mistakes for god's sake I do at least 4 jobs..

I am fed up with his attitude but I am afraid to make that serious move if it means really losing my job..

What should I do? how should I approach this ?",finance

personalfinance,Strategy for Debt Payment in Prep to Buy a House,"Hello! I’m hoping to buy my first home sometime next year but need to work on my debt to income ratio. No cc debt but have 1 student loan and 2 personal loans. My current score is 820+. I’m worried about my credit score dropping as I pay off my loans. I know mathematically it makes sense to pay off the loan with the highest interest rate, but wondering if there are other factors I should consider. Any advice on what order I should pay these in to ease the impact on my score when I start to look for a mortgage loan? 

Here are some numbers:
Student loan: 2.5K @ 2.25% ($100/mo)
Personal loan 1: 3K @ 6.49% ($200/mo)
Personal loan 2: 13K @ 6.99% ($500/mo)

CryptoCurrency,Why I’d use banks to hold my crypto,"Warming: This is a thought experiment/ramble...

...

So it sounds like 2021 is probably going to be retail banks competing with each other to offer crypto holding (and I’m guessing staking). I base this on the fact that regulators cleared the way for banks to be custodians of crypto.

In that scenario, I have to say. I’d be tempted to use a retail bank; depending on fees...Now that I’m used to being my own bank and earning my own interest through staking, I can see myself not wanting to give up any possible gains.

But I could see how paying an entity to look after my assets could feel like a “premium” service in the future. (Although if blockfolio can just connect and read from my normal bank account then even that proposition is weakened). But other “premium” service is the not having to worry about securing my key , I can just hand over responsibility to someone else that I trust and is regulated.

And once the banks have my coins, they’ll of course be wanting to reinvest in more traditional ways by lending it to someone else.

And while I could theoretically lend it to someone else myself using Defi, and ordinary person (or even myself) probably doesn’t want that hassle and risk. But I can certainly see a hybrid Defi /CeFi market place for investing capital in the future. 


Defi would need to adhere to the same regulations as CeFi though, so in the US, the SEC, Fed and others are going to have to severely up their game in the next few years as let’s face it, they are deer caught in headlights as the world moves rapidly around them.

Anyway I’m just thinking through what the future might soon look like and it seems to me that the two most significant events we can wish for in 2021 that would totally legitimize the space would be a crypto ETF and a crypto high street bank account.

And I know you want to tell me  “we don’t need their seal of approval raaah!” (Cue meme of screaming woman from Real housewives)

or “Defi means no need for Any entities raaaahh” 

or “Not your keys not your coin Raaahhh!”

..Right, right , I get it. I’m just speculating here on what, realistically, the world may look like in a 1-3 years.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Closed mortgage account in ""derogatory"" status - options for next home purchase?","I'll try to keep this organized and short as I have a couple different questions.

Now my credit report shows those missing payments, a derogatory account status, and remarks of ""settled - less than full balance"".

I guess all that's expected, but is there anything I can do to make this drop off my report? From what I understand, it will automatically drop after 7 years, correct? If so, is that 7 years from sale date?

Lastly, I ask all this as I'm looking to buy in the next two years with my fiance. Both our credit scores are about 720. She was not involved in my last home. She has a more limited credit history, but no negative marks. My only negative mark is said mortgage. 

If we buy prior to my derogatory account getting off my report, will we be greatly affected (interest rate, approval amount, etc) by my negative mark? Is it really worth it to wait, all else equal?

personalfinance,Aggressively pay off loans or save for a house?,"My husband and I have only been married about a year and are currently living in a small house on my parents’ property. It’s less than 750 square feet - tiny, but functional. The two of us and our dog fit there comfortably enough (still in the newlywed stage so not a ton of need to have personal time from each other at this point). The biggest benefit to living in this house is that we’re not paying rent. This has allowed us to live on as little as possible while we pay off student loans. We refinanced a balance of $118,000 in February to consolidate and get a lower interest rate, and as of today the principal is down to $65,000. At this rate, the latest we plan to have loans paid off is by the end of 2021.

We recently started discussing the options of putting off this aggressive repayment in order to save for a house. Our goal is $70k, which will be enough for 20% down on a $350k house. If we wait until loans are fully paid off, it will take about a year to save up this much and then start house hunting by early to mid-2023. This will save us the most money by paying debt off faster, but will take longer to get us into a house. 

There are three main reasons why we are considering switching tracks. The first is the benefit of a very low mortgage interest rate which may not last until we’re ready to buy. The second is that the area we want to live in is developing immensely at this point and about to become a huge buyers market. Finally, while we are being careful, a surprise pregnancy would be disastrous in the small house we’re in now. We don’t have room for a crib, bottles, diapers, absolutely nothing. We’d have to find a way to move into a larger place as quickly as possible. 

We’ve discussed options such as putting half of our extra money towards loans and half towards savings, so we’d reach both goals around the same time but if we *had* to move out sooner we could have something saved up and depending on the market, get something smaller than we wanted or put less than 20% down. If we only paid the minimum monthly payment for loans to save up for a house quickly, we would resume aggressively paying loans after reaching the $70k goal. 

Extra tidbit: even if we were to only pay the minimum payment for loans until completion, they’d be paid off by the end of 2023 with around $2500 more paid in interest than the original plan of paying loans off first. 

We got paid today and the thought of not putting the money into loans honestly makes my stomach turn, but I believe there are legitimate reasons to save for a house instead. I’d very much appreciate any advice or insight.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto week in a nutshell Pt. 1,"With the tons of news coming out lately I've decided that we lack some kind of summary to check up week by week. So I present you ""Crypto week in a nutshell Pt. 1"" where I try to summarize whole weeks worth of crypto news in a small bite size chunks each friday. I hate long introductions so let's start this one up.

&amp;#x200B;

* **$1B of Bitcoin from Silk Road wallet moves for first time since 2015**

 An anonymous crypto user moved 69,370 Bitcoin from an address associated with the Silk Road darknet market, with a prior 1 BTC test transaction. Later on found out that the US authorities seized the funds from an unknown hacker who had gained access to them. The seizure takes a swath of the digital cryptocurrency out of circulation at least temporarily. In the past, federal authorities have auctioned off seized Bitcoins, but usually months after acquiring them.

&amp;#x200B;

* **TRON Main-net Suffers Attack, Brings Block Production to a Halt**

 So our beloved cryptocurrency of Justin Sun have suffered an attack  in which the attacker executed malicious transactions during  a routine upgrade on the morning of Nov. 2. Production of blocks  halted, and no transactions were processed for several hours until the  issue was resolved. Justin Sun later on encouraged it's users that all have been resolved and well.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Strapped for international currencies, Iran is turning to cryptocurrency to allow imports to continue to flow.**

 The Iranian government has adopted bitcoin and possibly other mineable cryptocurrencies for international  trade as the country’s economic crisis deepens, with rising Covid-19  cases, depreciating rial, and intensifying sanctions imposed by the U.S.  government.  Notable that law seems to work only on currencies that are mined locally and are presented by local miners directly to Central Bank of Iran. Notable is that energy used by mining will be subsidized by the government.

&amp;#x200B;

* **MicroStrategy Now Owns Half a Billion Worth of Bitcoin**

 MicroStrategy invested $425 million in Bitcoin during August and September of this year. By time of writing this I estimate it could be around 600 million dollars with the recent BTC bull run. Opinions are varying if this brave step will lure other corporate investors in the space. I personally think that sentiment around Cryptocurrencies are shifting drastically and the pioneers of this space will be rewarded proportionally. Only time will who next gonna shift onto Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investing.

[Both acquisitions of MicroStrategy](https://preview.redd.it/1k9gfr777nx51.png?width=1140&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=140f320b9a30f83d2f319d7ace2ee0cabb9c7c4a)

&amp;#x200B;

* **Ethereum 2.0 Countdown Begins With Release of Deposit Contract**

 The deposit contract is the first ""physical"" implementation of Eth 2.0 for everyday users. The deposit contract acts as a bridge between the forthcoming proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain and the current  proof-of-work (PoW). The word is out that it might be possible to stake lower amounts as previously mentioned 32 ETH with forming staking alliances of lower amounts, tho at this moment I can't back this up.

&amp;#x200B;

* **PayPal plans a much wider embrace of cryptocurrency, including Venmo use**

 Paypal announced the possibility of trading cryptocurrencies  on their platform. The size of the waiting list for access to crypto, which is now  available to 10% of PayPal customers, was two or three times as great as what the company anticipated.  “Digital wallets are a natural complement to all forms of digital currency,” said Schulman, adding that PayPal is in close talks with central banks and regulators to explore new uses for these wallets. They had mentioned in the past about bringing Honey’s capabilities into PayPal and being able to spend the crypto in any store using paypal system.

 Worth mentioning is that the Internal Revenue Service treats any crypto transaction as taxable  event, like selling a stock or a piece of real estate—meaning a PayPal  user who buys a coffee or groceries from a crypto account could be  forced to declare a capital gain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final thoughts.**

 Crypto space is undeniably booming again, this time with way bigger support from corporate investing. Same with interest from banks and financial services corporations like Visa and Mastercard. The Infamous Bitcoin Stimulus Check is now Worth \~$2500. More and more countries are waking up to the idea of using cryptocurrencies in some way that benefit them. I feel this time bull run is way more warranted and backed up but only time will tell if this is sustainable. 

 Finally, I tried to explore many formats how I would publish these new summaries and I feel there will be many more iterations along the way. For sure there must be some news I left behind but I tried to mention everything that seemed to contribute the space in meaningful way. Any suggestions are welcome, see you next Friday Cheers",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Question about Paycheck Taxes (Recently Married),"I recently got married and submitted a Federal W-4 form to my payroll/HR department. I was thinking/hoping my paycheck would be slightly higher after this, but it's actually the opposite - about ~$85 lower for net pay for 2 weeks. The only difference comes out to ""Federal Withholdings"" - previously $615, now $700; everything else remained the exact same (401k, insurance, FICA, etc). 
Possibly relevant info: 

* I make ~$85k, my wife makes ~$65k (total ~$150k)
* We have one job each and plan to file married jointly 
* We live in TX so no state income tax
* Following the W-4 form and step 2(b) using the tables, I entered $9420 for line 1, skipped to line 3 for 26 biweekly pay periods, and concluded with $362.31 used for Step 4(c) of the form. 4(a) other income and 4(b) deductions are 0.  

So my question is why did my paycheck go down instead of up? Did I do anything wrong? Will I see this reflected in my tax refund instead? Am I missing something here?

personalfinance,Refinance and prepaids bring rolled into the loan,"I'm about to close on a refinance, and the latest disclosure has our total loan amount increasing significantly due to prepaids. Our property taxes are due this month, so in addition to funding the escrow account, a full payment for taxes is now included in the prepaids. The lender rolled the full amount of prepaids into the closing costs, which has increased our mortgage loan amount by about $7k. Ouch! 

Does this affect the break even calculation for refinancing? 

When I get my escrow refund check from the original bank, should we apply it to the principal balance and bring the loan amount down again? Our new interest rate is 2.875% on a $280k loan if that makes a difference.

Or should we dump it into a retirement account since the interest on the mortgage is so low anyway?

Some other option?

 Husband and I disagree and would appreciate some outside advice. Thanks!

Edit to add: paying the taxes up front at closing versus rolling into the loan saves us about $25 per month over the life of the loan.",finance
investing,A Case Against Maxing Your 401K,"Today I came across this article (written last week), by Nick Maggiulli, who is with Ritzholtz Wealth Management. He uses data to re-evaluate whether you should max your 401k or not.

[https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-i-max-out-my-401k/](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-i-max-out-my-401k/) 

The conclusion that he comes to is that:  


&gt;Regardless of whether you have a Roth 401(k) or a traditional 401(k), the benefits of contributing beyond the employer match are much smaller than you might have initially imagined... This is why it’s hard for me to support maxing out your 401(k) for an extra 0.34% per year.  That illiquidity premium is just too small to be worth it *even if* you don’t need the money for something like a down payment on a house.  And for those with a traditional 401(k), the benefits are likely to be even smaller given the current trend of U.S. deficit spending and likely future tax increases.

For me personally, I found this article and supporting data to confirm some of the thoughts that I've had regarding the illiquidity premium of having your money tied up for decades with the only early withdrawal option being to take a withdrawal penalty. 

When you compare that to a taxable account where you can either liquidate or access your money at near the fed fund rates (presently under \~1.59% w/ IBKR) with no set repayment schedule, no penalties, and without triggering a taxable event (short cash can be cleared by depositing money when you have more available), it really makes you think. In the case of accessing your money in an emergency without triggering a taxable event, the messaging is not to use margin recklessly, but barring a catastrophic event, 1.2x-1.3x (20%-30%) margin should not result in a maintenance call when invested across a body of non-leveraged equities or when diversified across an entity like the SPY; especially if you've been contributing to the account on a regular basis in lieu of extra contributions in your 401k (this continuously reduces your short cash position, bringing the aforementioned hypothetical 1.3x down every time you add cash to your account).  


The primary benefit of maxing out the 401k appears to be to combat investor *behavioral problems* rather than to provide some kind of mathematically improved future outcome. 

Yet, despite this, I still max my 401k out every year in addition to contributing to my taxable accounts. Maybe I'll change my mind in 2021.

What do you guys think?",finance
personalfinance,Paying more into my mortgage vs increasing 401k vs opening IRA?,"Only debt I have is the mortgage ($300k) on my house at 3.125% interest and maybe $3k in student loans at 1.something % interest. I am paying more the monthly due to reduce the interest rate ($500 more on top of the monthly payment going to principal). My boyfriend is moving in soon and will be paying me some rent...

I don't spend much. So a lot of my money is just sitting in savings. Currently, I am putting in 10% in my 401k where I have already max's my employer's contribution. That is all I have for retirement (in my early 30s). As I went the grad school route, I haven't been in the workforce for long, so only been contributing to 401k accounts for 3 years.  Based on the 2020 limit, I will hit the 2020 401k contribution limit at ~15%.

I have been looking at IRAs. I make over $75K, so I don't qualify for any tax deduction.

So two questions:

1) If I open an IRA, as I don't qualify for a tax deduction. I don't think it make sense to open a traditional IRA, If I decide to open an IRA, I assume I should open a roth over traditional as it gets funded with after-tax dollars and I don't qualify for a tax deduction for the traditional.  Is this statement accurate? 

2) I want to put away about $500/mo plus the rent my boyfriend going to give me when he moves in (he's going to give $600, where I will only use $100 to pay the utilities).. So I have $1000/mo to put somewhere, where is the most beneficial place to put it? Mortgage vs increase 401k or open a Roth IRA?",finance

 A government sanctioned blockchain with proof of citizenship mining. Replacing the current system of debt as money. Citizens download an app and KYC and once done the user would receive a UBI every 12am. This would be the new legal tender of the state and all taxes, fees, fines etc. are required to be paid in this currency giving it a demand. A certain percentage of every transaction is paid to a gov. smart contract and a certain percentage is paid to a UBI contract where it will be recycled back to the people. Obviously there would be a lot of nuanced mechanisms to how it would have to be built such as what percentage of transactions would need to be ""taxed"" but that could be worked out by some big brains. This seems like a really good start to how a government fiat blockchain could work. We would still have the option of using any other crypto we wanted but this seems like a good way to issue money into an economy through a UBI itself and wouldn't actually be debt based money but would still have a demand as many taxes, fines, tarrifs, etc. will still give the currency a demand.

personalfinance,"Tried to transfer money from my TD US account to my TD Canada account...transaction failed, US reversed the transaction, but Canada still deposited the amount?","I periodically send money back home to my parents to help out with their expenses. Three weeks ago, I made a Visa Direct transfer from my easyweb account (the canadian side) to debit my US TD debit card with the amount and deposit it in my joint canadian USD account that I have set up with my parents. Unfortunately, the transaction failed due to a system error, and that it will be reversed. In my mind I was like ""ok, fair enough, I will try again a few days later"". 

A few days later: I noticed that my TD US account had indeed reversed the transaction (as in, the money was taken out, but was placed back in). On easyweb, however, it shows that they deposited the transaction amount! **So essentially, I just made this amount because of their system error.** I thought this would be taken care of by TD automatically or something, but so far nothing has changed.

Earlier this week, I called in to figure out what is going on. Unfortunately, nobody knows what is going on. I tried calling cross border banking which led me to reach an associate on the US side. They said because the transaction was initiated on the canadian side, that I would have to talk to someone on the Canadian side. Once I finally got to the canadian side, the associate said they've ""exhausted all options to figure out what went wrong"" and suggested that I speak with someone on the US side, and then got transferred back. This kept on going on and on until I got fed up with this and asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor was also out of ideas, but said that on the US side, they will review the transaction in person and determine the appropriate actions, and I can call in towards the end of the week, which is today.

Today: I call in, and they still haven't figured out what is going on. Still no answer for me. Said that they will need a few more business days to look into this.

Has anyone ran into this issue before? Any tips for my next steps? I can't go into a branch as I live in the west coast and don't have a TD bank to visit.

The rental income pays that mortgage and then some. So we have been putting the extra 300 a month towards principal on that. We have roughly an extra $1000 that we are looking to put towards paying down this debt. Where should we put it?

personalfinance,"Leasing a vehicle while trying to trade in another with an ""accident history""","Hi y'all,

I am most of the way into a lease of a 2018 Subaru Crosstrek Premium, it is up in about 4 months. A couple years ago the car was hit in the parking lot of a market and the bumper was scuffed, no major damage. The repair was paid for by the insurance of the person who hit my car, and the incident was reported to CarFax.

I am looking at leasing a similar car with a bit of an upgrade, a 2021 Subaru Crosstrek Sport (larger engine). I have been talking to some dealerships and I have heard a surprising statement from a few of them. They claim that because my existing leased car has an accident history, then its value is substantially decreased and the dealerships in general have no interest in acquiring the car for resale. They report that they won't sell any cars with known accident histories (regardless of the degree of damage, whether it was just cosmetic, etc), so the car will ultimately be sent by Subaru to auction. Bcause of this fact, no dealership I talk to is willing to cover the remaining payments on my current lease as part of a deal to get me into a new lease.

My argument to them has been that the car is in excellent condition, under mileage (I leased the car for 35k miles and I have driven 25k miles with only 4 months left in a 42 month lease), and highly desirable on the market. I can find cars online, my exact model year and trim, with twice my mileage and accident histories who are being offered for more than 1k above what these dealerships are claiming my car is currently worth. 

The main, confusing dilemma I am facing is that dealerships are telling me that I would lose a significant amount of money by turning in the car early as I would be responsible for paying the remaining lease payments (~$1500). They tell me that if I just wait it out and turn in the car on time, then I won't owe anything left on the car and we can do a new deal for a lease at that point.

It confuses me as to why a dealership/Subaru wouldn't want a car earlier when it would have lower mileage and less wear and tear today than it will have in 4 months. The accident history would be the same regardless, and the resale value today would almost certainly be higher than it will be in a few months given continued depreciation, mileage accrual, and wear and tear. The only way this would make sense to me is if Subaru believes that the intrinsic resale value of the car today will be essentially the same as it will be in 4 months, which doesn't make much sense to me. I recognize that leasing is essentially financing depreciation, and that most depreciation occurs within days to months of acquiring a new car, but it still seems a little strange.

Do I have any recourse for this? The ""accident"" I had was very mild and resulted in zero structural damage to the car. It sounds like whoever gets this car at auction will get a great deal.... It doesn't make sense to me to be responsible for payments on a car that would no longer in my possession if I were to turn it in early...

Tldr: Subaru thinks my current leased car is worth substantially less because it was involved in an ""Accident"", and it's making it hard for me to get a good deal on a new lease before the end of my current lease.",finance

personalfinance,Bank of America Rewards Program- An Analysis,"I know a lot of folks who have Bank of America, but either haven't heard of or don't really use their Preferred Rewards program. Which is sad, because it's literally the only reason I still stick it out with BoA. I did this analysis of how much cash back / savings I get to show a friend, and figured I'd share it here with y'all.

**What is Bank of America's Preferred Rewards program?**

It's a tiered rewards program, where you earn a variety of perks of various amounts depending on how many assets you have with BoA. You get cash back boosts, better loan interest rates, waived fees, a priority support phone number and more.

**What assumptions does this analysis make?**

This assumes you have $100,000 in assets with BoA; I know this seems like a lot, but I consolidated our family's IRAs and 529 college savings plans into Merrill, which is owned by BoA; I also moved money out of high-yield savings into BoA savings and closed my other brokerage accounts. (Edit: the first rewards tier starts at $20k in assets)

I've altered some of the numbers for what my family spends each month and the values of our loans to be more generic and easier to work with. Obviously your spending will be different.

We use the BoA Cash Rewards credit card for *everything*. You get 3% cash back on the category you choose (we went with online shopping, thanks Amazon), 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else.

**The Numbers**

|*ITEM*|*DETAILS*|*REWARD*|*VALUE*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Car 1 Loan|$25,000 / 3% APR / 5 Years|0.5% Lower APR|$332 Lifetime|
|Car 2 Loan|$25,000 / 3% APR / 5 Years|0.5% Lower APR|$332 Lifetime|
|Home Loan|$250,000 / 3% APR / 20 Years|0.375% Lower APR + $600 Fee Waiver|$11,751 Lifetime|
|Safety Deposit Box|$75 per year|Fees Waived|$75 / Year|
|ATM Fees|1 per month at $2|Fees Waived|$24 / Year|
|Cash Rewards Credit Card|$2,600 per month / 1-3% Cash Back|75% Cash Back Bonus|$1,218 / Year|
|Cash Back Deals||Featured 5-10% Cash Back Bonuses|$480 / Year|
|Cash Back Deal Milestones||$5 per 4 Cash Back Deal Redemptions|$60 / Year|
|***TOTAL***|||***$1,857 / Year + $12,415 Lifetime***|

**Explanations**

Cash Back Bonus: In addition to the 3% we get for online purchases, we get an additional 75% boost, effectively meaning we earn 5.25% cash back on most of our purchases.

Cash Back Deals: A rotating variety of businesses will offer larger cash back deals, usually ranging from 5-10%. We try not to eat out often, but when we do, it's because there's a cash back deal.

Cash Back Deal Milestones: If you redeem 4 of the cash back deals within a certain timeframe (\~3 months), you get a $5 bonus. We can usually claim this bonus twice before it resets the clock, so we make $10 every couple months.

**Does this make sense for me?**

Everyone should run their own numbers, but after adding it all up, it was easily worth the time and effort to move our accounts over from Ally Bank, Schwab, etc, even with the lower savings interest rates or higher fund fees; this was the case even *without* having our loans through BoA.

**Wait a minute, do you work for Bank of America?**

Nope, I'm a programmer in the tech start-up world. I just see people ragging on BoA all the time in PF, so figured I'd explain why I still stick with them. I hope it helps at least one person start earning money they're missing out on.",finance

Bitcoin,Overtaking other financial subreddits,"""bitcoin"" is at 1.7m users 🎉🥳 I remember not to long ago we reached the big 1 million. If you look at the other biggest financial subreddits, we have ""investing"" at 1.2m, and ""wallstreetbets"" (wsb) at 1.6m and other smaller communities.

For some reason, if you post or comment anything Bitcoin related, even if relevant to the questions like discussions about monetary policy, digital dollars, gold standard etc. You mention Bitcoin, and you instantly get downvoted as if it taboo to them and an outright scam.

Then you have WSB who are autistically betting high leverage and making massive gains and massive losses on options/puts bets and get praised for it. (We're way more disciplined then that).

Question is, when will Bitcoin ever become relevant to other investment and stock subreddits? How much more popular does Bitcoin have to be until it's universally accepted (or at least tolerated) in those subreddits? Maybe when r/bitcoin reaches 5m? 10m? users.

Maybe for those of us who are in these other financial subreddits, we should upvote our fell comrades whenever we see them (relevantly) make good comments about Bitcoin, so they don't just disappear at the bottom somewhere, but then they can start to think about it, and maybe see this community is actually bigger then them and might actually be something..

I don't have any debt and last I checked (last month) my credit score is 810. 

I realize its a 13 year old car so its typically not wise to finance a car that old, but it is a 4Runner that been well maintained (these cars easily go for 300k miles). 

A typical auto loan from a big bank for the remaining $5-6k I know is out of the question due to the car being older than 10 years, so what options do I have? Is it true some credit unions will do it for a car older than 10 years?  Is a personal loan the way to go?

investing,Why you shouldn't grow too comfortable with the stock market (specifically index funds),"It is no secret that the fed has slashed interest rates to historical lows this year. It is also no secret that the fed's interest rate has been at unprecedented low levels for the past 10 years since the 2008 financial crisis. Not only that but the interest rates on 10-year treasury bonds have been slowly deflating to alarmingly low levels for the past 25-odd years. The average certified deposit rate today is a fraction of what it once was a few decades ago. The return on nearly every other alternative to investing in the stock market has plummeted in recent decades. The effects of this can easily be seen in the performance of the stock market. With no other place to store their money, entities instead shovel their money into stock market indices which promise much higher returns on investment than all other alternatives. The market has skyrocketed in the past decades because of this, as without any effective place to store capital, people simply reinvest dividends and other earnings into the market, driving the price of stocks ever higher. 

The stock market is a tower, and the yields on government bonds and alternative investments are the foundation of this tower. At any given moment, there are only so many resources to go around, the most stable building will see a balance between the height of the tower and the strength of the foundation. Putting too many resources into the foundation and the tower would rarely fall, but it wouldn't be very tall either as there wouldn't be enough to build it very tall. Putting too much towards the height of the building and it would be extremely unstable, falling fast and hard at the sight of any trouble due to a weak foundation. 

We are stuck in a very tall, very skinny, very unstable skyscraper. In an effort to appease financial institutions and rescue dying industries, we have gutted our rates to near zero. This cannot and will not last. The only question is how much longer it will be until the rates have to come up and the stock market pops like a balloon. If I had to guess, it'll probably happen when the government can no longer run a massive deficit every year and has to reign in spending and lending towards financial institutions.

7. I save $600 a month in cash and am on track to have \~25k in cash saved by the time I pay off my loans and am ready to move out

So I guess what I'n really wondering is, if you were teleported into my shoes, would you be doing the same thing or doing something different? And why?

The way I see it is that instead of throwing away interest money to the bank I throw it back into my 401k. Also because it’s an older (2008) vehicle, I could drop the full coverage and get regular insurance (saving a little money, around $100/month). I also like the that the payments would come out of my check weekly and I wouldn’t have to really worry about it (although I would pay extra to get rid of the debt sooner). I also think that with all the drama going on in the world, it would be nice to be able to outright own the vehicle instead of my bank (however I am not too worried, just more of a thought, that if something does happen to my job, that I could just take the tax hit of an “early withdraw” rather than losing my vehicle to the bank)

My current interest rate is 4.4going to the bank), and the 401k loan would be around 5% (going to me). I understand that going up in interest rates isn’t necessarily great, but with the interest going into my account plus the amount I would save on insurance, I feel like would be slightly ahead of just paying the bank.

investing,Unpopular opinion--don't agree with Ray Dalio's perspective in many ways,"Despite how much I like listening to his philosophy, in a lot of ways I don't agree with Big Ray. 

In a rhetorical sense, he speaks in complicated manners about concepts that are actually really simple when you break them down. More than that though, he doesn't actually get to a point. He suggests certain things--like cycles, reserve currencies, etc.--but doesn't really make a coherent prediction that he can point to and validate. I think he does this because his suggestions haven't always panned out. E.g. now that the Fed has stepped in, his market crash call that had been pending for three years and running is off the board. 

I also think he's kind of into bear porn. It's not that I necessarily disagree with him as much as I want to hear his opinion with the consideration of counterpoints to his opinion. Okay, so China is rising, and the U.S. is printing money as a sign of a dying superpower. But can China overcome quickly slowing growth, a corrupt system, and a system that chooses surveillance over business? Another example: China has a plurality of the world's IPOs--okay, but large IPO numbers indicate bubbles too. 

I guess it just seems like he doesn't use his imagination to challenge these extremely broad, bold views in many ways. I just hear the same thing over and over (and why is he on TV and media so much anyway?), to the point where it feels like he has stake in it, and that this stake is his company, brand, and merchandise. 

Overall, yes, I disagree with him. Not with his views as much as the certainty of his views, and how they're such 'simple, repetitious cycles'. Why wouldn't 1971 been when Russia took over, when we finally went off the gold standard? Why is MM3 now suddenly the time when China will be the one to overtake us, despite their incredible flaws? It just doesn't add up, and there isn't enough humility and uncertainty for me to really trust him. Also, when he says that diversifying is a way to lower risk but maintain the same returns--yeah, no. 

I still really respect him. You can't get to where he is without being a legend. But I think he's kind of a cult figure at this point. The reason I love Buffett is because everything he says is exactly as simple or complicated as what he's talking about. It's straightforward, without any launching predictions or starry-eyed proselytizing. For all Dalio's transcendental practice, I think he's got some blind spots.

CryptoCurrency,The Petrodollar Era - What is the Endgame?,"After World War II, a new international monetary system called Bretton Woods was created.

Bretton Woods established three main things:

(1) the U.S. dollar was to be an international reserve currency, 

(2) the U.S. dollar would be backed by gold at a price of $35 per ounce, and 

(3) any country could exchange dollars for gold.

&amp;#x200B;

Countries running trade surpluses with the US sought to exchange their dollars for gold, and this rapidly shrunk US gold reserves. 

This then led to the so called Nixon shock - President Richard Nixon effectively ending the Bretton Woods system in 1971.

The world economy entered a new era: the US Dollar became the global reserve currency.

&amp;#x200B;

The US made no effort to rein in deficit spending, in fact quite the opposite.

Therefore, the US needed to continue to find ways to sell government debt (i.e. to find buyers of US Treasury Securities) *without* driving up interest rates.

That is, the US needed more buyers for its debt.

But by 1974, the enormous flood of dollars from the US into top-oil-exporter Saudi Arabia suggested a solution.

That year, Nixon sent new US Treasury secretary William Simon to Saudi Arabia with a mission...

The task: neutralize crude oil as an economic weapon against the US and find a way to persuade a relatively hostile kingdom to finance America's widening deficit with its newfound petrodollar wealth.

The basic framework was simple: the US would buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment.

In return, the Saudis would plow billions of their petrodollar revenue back into US Treasuries and therefore finance America's spending.

A win-win: the Saudis would receive protection from geopolitical enemies, and the US would get a new place to unload large amounts of government debt.

This became known as ""petrodollar recycling"".

By *spending* on oil, the US was creating new demand for US debt and US dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, since Saudi Arabia dominated the OPEC - the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - this dollar deal was extended to OPEC overall, which meant that the dollar became the preferred currency for oil purchases worldwide.

And so the petrodollar era began.

This petrodollar system has had *massive* implications for US foreign policy, which has essentially involved imposing 'freedom' on any major oil-exporting state that moves towards ending its reliance on dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2000, Saddam Hussein, then-president of Iraq, announced that Iraq was moving to sell its oil in Euros instead of dollars.

Following a particular catalyst event in 2001, the US invaded Iraq, deposed Saddam Hussein, and converted Iraqi oil sales back to the US dollar.

Of course, this exact pattern was repeated with Gaddafi when he attempted to create a unified African currency backed by Libyan gold reserves to sell African oil.

Shortly after his announcement, rebels armed by the US Government and allies overthrew the dictator and his regime.

After his death, the idea that African oil would be sold on something other than the dollar quickly died out.

Other regimes that have called for abandoning the petrodollar include Iran and Venezuela. 

The US has called for regime change in both of these countries...

&amp;#x200B;

Although they have tried to keep it under wraps, Saudi Arabia is believed to be one of America's largest foreign creditors.

Undoubtedly, Saudi holdings of US debt and other assets are significant.

All else being equal, the US should be growing less dependent on foreign holders of debt, certainly in terms of Saudi and OPEC-held debt, since the global role of OPEC and the Saudis has been diminishing in terms of global market share.

But all else *isn't* equal, and the US has been piling on ever-larger amounts of debt in recent years. 

In 2019, for example, the annual deficit topped *one trillion*. 

&amp;#x200B;

This immense growth in debt obviously makes the US regime more sensitive to changes in demand for US debt, and ever more reliant on foreign demand for both US debt and US dollars. 

In order to avoid a crisis, the US must ensure that interest rates remain low and that foreigners want to acquire both US dollars and US debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Were petrodollars and petrodollar recycling to disappear, it would have a twofold effect on US government finances: 

First of all, a sizable decline in petrodollar recycling would put significant *upward* pressure on interest rates. 

The result would be a budget crisis for the US government, as it would have to devote ever-larger amounts of the federal budget to payments on the debt. 

(The other option would be to have the US central bank monetize the debt by purchasing ever-larger amounts of it to make up for a lack of foreign demand. But this would lead to growing price inflation.)

Furthermore, if participants began to exit the petrodollar system (and, say, sell oil in euros instead) demand for dollars would drop, exacerbating any scenarios in which the central bank is monetizing the debt.  

This would also generally contribute to greater price inflation, as fewer dollars will be sucked out of the US by foreign holders.

The result could be ongoing declines in government spending on services, and growing price inflation. 

The US regime's ability to finance its debt would decline significantly, and the US would need to pull back on military commitments, pensions, and more. 

Either that, or keep spending at the same rate and face an inflationary spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

Or...how about another option?

Anyone fancy a Great Reset?

Bitcoin,The Petrodollar Era - What is the Endgame?,"After World War II, a new international monetary system called Bretton Woods was created.

Bretton Woods established three main things:

(1) the U.S. dollar was to be an international reserve currency, 

(2) the U.S. dollar would be backed by gold at a price of $35 per ounce, and 

(3) any country could exchange dollars for gold.

&amp;#x200B;

Countries running trade surpluses with the US sought to exchange their dollars for gold, and this rapidly shrunk US gold reserves. 

This then led to the so called Nixon shock - President Richard Nixon effectively ending the Bretton Woods system in 1971.

The world economy entered a new era: the US Dollar became the global reserve currency.

&amp;#x200B;

The US made no effort to rein in deficit spending, in fact quite the opposite.

Therefore, the US needed to continue to find ways to sell government debt (i.e. to find buyers of US Treasury Securities) *without* driving up interest rates.

That is, the US needed more buyers for its debt.

But by 1974, the enormous flood of dollars from the US into top-oil-exporter Saudi Arabia suggested a solution.

That year, Nixon sent new US Treasury secretary William Simon to Saudi Arabia with a mission...

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 9th, 2020.

# **After sharp bounce, market may take a ‘breather’ on lingering election uncertainty, virus outbreak  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/06/after-sharp-bounce-market-may-take-a-breather-on-lingering-election-uncertainty-virus-outbreak.html)**
*****
&gt; After an initially exuberant election reaction, stocks may trade more cautiously in the week ahead, as investors watch election developments unfold and track the course of the coronavirus. 
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up more than 7.3% in the past week, at 3,509, and the Nasdaq rose 9%, the best weekly performance since April. Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.
*****
&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.
*****
&gt; “I think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,” said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon’s Wealth Management chief investment officer. “Perhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.”
*****
&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a “blue wave,” where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.
*****
&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.
*****
&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.
*****
&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.
*****
&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald’s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.
*****
&gt; “I think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There’s still a lot to figure out here,” said Grohowski. “The equity market’s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.”
*****
&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. “What I’m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.” After the votes are all in or recounted, “a sweep is unlikely but possible.”
*****
&gt; “I think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Different than 2000
&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.
*****
&gt; “In 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,” said Stovall.
*****
&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. “Historically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,” said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.
*****
&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.
*****
&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.
*****
&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October’s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market. Another is that investors are so skeptical.
*****
&gt; “What does still exist is a great deal of dry powder. There’s $4.3 trillion in money markets alone,” he said. “I can tell you, being in touch with investors of all shapes and sizes this week, there’s still a lot of skepticism. From a contrarian view, high cash and a lot of skepticism is a contrarian indicator.”

&gt; # Presidential Election Anticipation Is Keeping Us Waiting

&gt; While we all anxiously await the final count and outcome of the U.S. Presidential Election, here are some possible scenarios for 2021. Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.

&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.

&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.

&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here’s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**

&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan’s fifth year with a split Congress – a testament to how “The Great Communicator” was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43’s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it’s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.

&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise

&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.

&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed—those out of work for 27 weeks or longer—continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “While the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,” noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “With total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there’s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.”

&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.

&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month’s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don’t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.

&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks

&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**

&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are ""looking for a correction"" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**

&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.

&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See

&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don’t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. “Once the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Of course, 2020 isn’t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.”

&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90

&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.

&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win

&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**

&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**

&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.

&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency

&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**

&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.

&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.

&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**

&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.

&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**

&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**

&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.

The credit card interest rate is 23% and the personal loan rate is 18%.  While I am paying the loan down, I'm struggling to maintain minimum payments on the credit card.

personalfinance,VA Interest Rate Reduction Notices - I bought my first home 9 months ago at 3.222%. VA IRR is advertising 2.25%. Pros and Cons?,"I have been receiving multiple notices in the mail that through the VA interest rate reduction eligibility program, I can refinance my home for 2.25% (2.485% APR). I am currently paying 3.222%. 
-My FICO credit score from my bank is 815. Not sure how that would compare to other reports. 
- I built the home for 318k in Feb. Initially assessment of the house is 280,000 based on 2016 rates, all the homes built around me (same street) are similar/smaller and have been sold for 340k plus. 
-I live in Connecticut where half of my mortgage is taxes, and my county is about to do a full 5 year re-assessment of my home, likely to raise the value of my property by about 40K at least.

I am worried about the effect of re-financing my home 9 months after I bought it on my credit score. It was very time consuming and a lot of different people were involved in the original purchasing of the home, with lots of fees I wasn't initially expecting. Huge headache

If I were to apply for a re-finance of my home, what is the minimum reduction in interest rate to make it worth it?

Background on me:
-30 Yr old, married, wife makes about 65K, I make About 90K. 2 kids.
- I don't have much debt (about 1k, and I could pay it off I just try to keep activity on my cards. 
-Wife has 6K left in student debt, I have none. Both have bachelors degrees.
-I own a 2015 Altima, and I am making payments on a 2017 Ram 1500. I valued at about 28K, owe 18K. 
-I have 10K in emergency savings, 30K in my 401K, and 30K in EFT/Stocks.",finance
stocks,So what is the deal with RKT ?,"I saw RKT being discussed quite a lot on r/stocks  and most of the threads I read were bullish on it. As I want to diversify my tech-heavy portfolio , I put this stock in my watchlist and did some rough DD :

1.  COVID-19 crisis prodded the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to 0
2.  RKT is nation's largest mortgage originator 
3. Their app allows customers to get everything done on cellphone so more attractive to younger generation . 
4. No  loan officer involved so less cost.

All these factors make this stock appealing and yet  its performance has not been so impressive ever since IPO.

stocks,Can Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth Do Business in the US?,"I've noticed, as most of you have, that marijuana stocks are wayyy up post-election, likely because Biden is going to win.   


My question is whether these Canadian owned companies like Aurora and Canopy can even do business in the US with marijuana currently illegal at a federal level. From what I've read it seems like they really can't, which would make it pretty unimportant that multiple states legalized recreational marijuana and pretty notable that our government is going to be divided and it may be hard to pass federal legalization.  


Can someone who knows more than me about this explain it?  I am invested in marijuana ETFs in the meantime to hopefully get US exposure.",finance
personalfinance,Question on a student loan refinance,"We're currently looking to consolidate my girlfriend's student loans. Her balance is $20,900.31 with the 5 different groups having interest rates between 3.760% (the lowest) and 4.660% (the highest). We've been paying $258.76 per month, and have an offer from Elfi that includes a 10 year term at 3.65% or 15 year term at 3.83%
With the 10 year we'd be paying $208.15 or $152.82 on the 15 year.

What I'm wondering is whether it would save us more to take the longer term and just pay something close to what we've been paying already like $250 to pay it down faster or if the lower interest rate from the 10 year is better.",finance

btc,"BTC is for fiat lovers, BCH is building peer to peer electronic cash!","Opinion

Whatever people say BTC hasn't made real progress in several years.  Core aspects of its utility were deliberately broken.  New advertised solutions to those problems are long roads to nowhere.  This project is basically a trampoline since 2017 for former wall street traders and others to play USD/BTC.  Meanwhile the US dollar, well just look at it.  The fake news with their ""X says bitcoin is a failure, Y says bitcoin will go to $100k"" garbage all the time.  I believe my dirty socks will go to $200k.  The ongoing reality with this project is: ""BTC Pumps as Fed confiscates BTC.""

Like everything beautiful what happened was the insecure and ugly people came over to wreck it.  Bad actors got involved online even before 2013 and distortion narratives were being conceived and supporting factors were being planted by then.  As it turns out it was not hard to take BTC after Gavin was out of the way.  Some of the biggest gangsters on earth were involved though, I am sure they used the usual methods.  I don't think we forget the whole Gavin thing.

About Craig Wright I know he has been categorized but what I think happened is probably dirtier than most people guess (that's my take).  Greg's frequent involvement is a major clue.  My view is Craig may actually have some perspective but the thing is he is owned.  As a patsy it turns out he wasn't needed for the taking of BTC then he later activated in the failed coup against Bitcoin Cash and ultimately parked over at BSV.  

Bitcoin Cash effectively had to start over in 2017.  What I think happened here was, VIP hires dev to prepare client because there was something funny about all that Segwit malarkey and VIP was not fooled at all by it.  That mission got accomplished.  The new weenies behind BTC raged and start pulling all stops.  Bitcoin Cash community handles ongoing full frontal attacks pretty well actually.  A more conventional obstacle occurs when the dev with new status with big potential embraces community without really understanding it, and has own ideas.  About to be demoted.

Bitcoin Cash is still impressive.   I think it's the best, live triple entry ledger available today.  Sometimes I think maybe the wool is being pulled over everybody's eyes just until new implementations from the banks can be put forward.  BCH is still world changing and the massive potential user base is still out there every day.  People will re-learn the importance of good money real fast when their money becomes bad money.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I want to move! Should I sell or rent?,"We bought a small house in 2014 in a nice metro area. Its about 1300 sq ft and our family of five is bursting out of it.

If we sell we will get over 100k, and def put down 20% on our next home with about 30k left to save. However, if we rent out our current house our monthly payment on a new house would almost be covered with the rent on our current house, but we would not be able to put 20% down.

I've been through somewhat of a rabbit hole lately and I came across this video that got me thinking of the anti-federalists and the federalists that came up with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Long story short the anti-federalists believed the states should have more power whereas the federalists believed in a central government. And there is anecdotal evidence that what the anti-federalists feared of the Constitution came to fruition. I'm not saying one side or the other was completely right, but it might be a good place in history for us to read up when building Voltaire.

personalfinance,Refinance Mortgage?,"I've never really posted on Reddit before so I apologize for any formatting issues and the length of the post. Here it goes. I spent a lot of money in the last year (\~$45k) but I got married, went on a New Zealand honeymoon, and bought my dream car. So I can't say I regret any of it but it did leave a nice dent in my wallet. However, I do regret signing up for a 7% on the dream car loan. Due to the age of the car, that was the best rate I could find. My wife and I were planning on selling our house in Spring of 2021, but we have changed our minds and we are committing to staying in the house for another 5 years. Based off of this timeline, I reached out to the same mortgage broker I used to buy the house to discuss current refi options. 

These are the facts: San Diego, CA. 33yo. No kids but we are trying. 2019 pretax income \~162k. 2020 income on track to be about \~175. I have \~$78k investments and IRA (mostly IRA). She has $0 in retirement but that will change this year (just paid off all debt except car to $0 and was supporting her mom). We have a $20k emergency fund and about $10k each in our checking accounts. We are both in stable careers. Wife drives 2013 Hyundai that we got used, payment is \~$225mo. I daily drive a paid off 06 Toyota truck.

 I have owned the house for 4 years. Current balance on the mortgage is $381,540. Current monthly payments with impounds is $2370.97. Current rate is 4%. House will probably appraise between $530-570k. I am looking at two refi options, these are not set in stone yet but will probably be very close. 1) No cash-out new rate of \~2.65% approx. monthly savings of \~$270. Total refi cost: \~$3238. 2) Cash out \~$17.5k to pay off balance on the dream car (have 28 months left on that loan @ $613mo). Rate \~2.99% approx. monthly savings \~$150. Total refi cost \~$2809.

 Is it worth the higher monthly payment, and interest rate, to pay off the balance on the car with the cash out refi?  

We are also looking to do about $20k in home renovations now that we are going to stay in the house for 5 more years (roof, septic, 200a panel, carpet, and patio). Should I consider a HELOC for these? More cash out on the refi? Pay cash for them over time with money saved from not having a car payment any more? What am I missing or not thinking about? Any recommendations are welcome.

So late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk’s prime minister, Canada’s prime minister, France’s president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden’s.

personalfinance,15 yr vs 30 yr mortgage,"I've seen similar questions asked before, but it didn't give the answer I'm looking for. I'm contemplating buying a house. I'll have 20% dp at least. I want to get a 15 year mortgage to avoid an additional 100k or so in interest if I went with 30 years. This was just me taking principal X 12 months X 30 years and comparing it to vs 15 years and seeing diff in how much I'd pay over time.  My in laws tell me I should get 30 yr mortgage but pay it off in 15 in case something happens and I have that flexibility of paying lesser amount for some months just in case. 

My question is, if I pay off a 30 yr mortgage in 15 years, is it really the same amoubt of interest paid as if I got a 15 year mortgage? Isn't interest usually added on up front so would that mean my 30 yr mortgage would be more frontloaded? I know the biggest factor in answering my question is dependent on the rates.

personalfinance,Never thought I'd buy a new car. But maybe I will?,"I'm in my late twenties with 2 young kids and a third on the way. I have a very stable career that has not been impacted by covid. My wife works part time in an equally-stable career. Together we make around 100k per year in a high COL area. We've been extremely frugal for our twenties and have been careful with our finances in a way that I am proud of. Because of this, we have no debt outside of our mortgage. We own a house that we bought a year ago and it's already worth 80k more than we paid. We bought the cheapest and smallest house in an up and coming neighborhood. We kept our first house as a rental and we cash flow 350/mo on that and have around 100k equity in it. My retirement is stable with deferred comp, IAP, and a pension. 

Since we got married, we've never had a car payment. We started with a clapped out civic I bought from a guy who had felony warrants (as I found out on the way home getting pulled out at gunpoint by the cops). When we had our first kid I bought a 2003 Subaru Forester for 3k. Used it for a year until the head gasket catastrophically failed in Arizona over 50 miles from any town. That sucked. Then I had another serious of s-+-boxes until our 2007 RAV4. Great car. Moved across the country in it. We had another kid and had the opportunity to buy an '07 Pilot from my wife's parents. We got a great deal and have had that for two years now. 

In our current situation, we have two cars: our family car that is the Pilot which is big, safe, reliable, and has 175k miles. I also have a $1,500 Subaru Loyale (1993) that I drive 2 miles to work and back. I don't let my kids or wife drive it because it's got no airbags. The Subaru gets 25/32 gas mileage and the pilot gets 19/24. Our family will take at LEAST 5,000 miles worth of road trips (10-hour and 18-hour one way trips to see family and then back) in addition to our normal driving, so we're pretty high mileage, around 12-14k per year. We also are pretty adventurous and are constantly on dirt roads and even 4x4 roads to get to trailheads and campsites. We take my kids on those trips usually, too. We also have to drive in snow just around town for 3-4 months out of the year as well.

The Pilot does okay in all those categories, but not great. 24mpg on a 1,000 mile road trip hurts. Especially on the way home. It does okay off road but it's not fantastic. It's fine in the snow, relatively safe. But with three kids I gotta figure something else out. I need something with captains chairs and a 3rd row. That also gets good fuel economy and that's also safe in the snow.

We landed on the 2020 Toyota Highlander Hybrid. Specifically I'm looking at the upper level trims. I'm not here asking for car recommendations. I've researched it into the ground and have rest driven several. The Toyota might not be best at everything, but it's good at most like the Pilot. Except better than the Pilot. It's got 36/35mpg, 3rd row, insanely good safety features, tons of luxury and comfort options, is about the same amount of capable off road as the pilot, and it's a Toyota. Which to me means that the car over the course of its life is cheap to maintain, very reliable, and has great resale value. 

So the numbers. If we bought the Highlander, ballpark it would be $50k out the door. We have 25k that we could out down easy. We've been saving it, it's just sitting there, our emergency fund and retirement stuff wouldn't change, etc. That means we owe 25k. Toyota is doing 0.9% apr on 2020 highlanders right now, so on a 5-year loan I'd only end up paying like $550 in interest. The payment for five years would be $425 or so, which we could easily afford. 

My main thing with new cars is depreciation, obviously. I recognize 5 years is generally the sweet spot of where depreciation starts to slow a bit while the vehicle has the most life yet. However, the 2015 highlander only gets around 3/4's of the gas mileage that the 2020 gets because it's a different hybrid system and only comes in 6-cylinder. So that's why I'm considering new: all the good stuff plus insane fuel economy for a third row SUV. 

So of I were going to keep the Highlander for 20 years I think it'd be a no brainer because it'd be paid off after 5 and that amount of money would just be worth it to have such a safe and versatile vehicle for my fam. Plus the fuel economy savings would add up over the years. But let's consider just the first 5 years where depreciation is hard and fast. 2015 fully loaded hybrid highlanders right now are selling with around 40-60k miles for between 28k-37k. Let's say we use ours hard with 3 kids and it's higher miles so we can see it for 30k after five years from now. So the cost to own it has been 20k for five years (50k total cost minus 30k resale) or 4k per year. Let's add on $1500 per year for maintenance like oil changes and brakes so now it's $5,500k for five years to own a brand new dream car for the fam. That ultimately ends up being $460 per month for 5 years. Obviously there are some unforeseen possibilities like a recall or something. But those 5 years I'd expect needing to hardly think about maintenance at all, definitely not major costs. Also, it's under warranty most of that time. So I'd have a lot more peace of mind about it. Additionally, I would feel good that my family was in the safest vehicle possible that was also capable of taking us to fun places AND came with simple comforts like a heated steering wheel. So maybe that stuff is worth $460 a month for me. If we kept it longer that cost to own would go down, too. 

Basically I just needed to type this out and get my thoughts about it situated. I guess I'm finding that we are actually in a place where we could afford a new car for once. We have the money to where it wouldn't break us. But does that mean we should? Typically I'd answer no because we could definitely just pay cash and have a 5-year old car that did the trick. However, nothing that ""does the trick"" gets 35mpg, holds my family, keeps them comfortable and safe, and gets us to the trailhead.The options are pretty limited for us. A minivan couldn't get us up dirt roads in the mountains. A Tundra has bad fuel economy and no third row. A Suburban or Denali has poor fuel economy. The highlander is a remarkable mix of our needs and priorities so maybe it is worth buying it even if I have payments for 5 years.

I've just never considered buying new but for the first time I'm thinking it might actually be worth the money. I think maybe the 0.9% apr is what's changing my mind. It's such a tiny amount of interest rate. The depreciation in the first five years sucks but if I look at it as the cost to own it's not that bad. Plus we might end up keeping it for long enough to be worth it. 

Any thoughts? I'm very open to being talked out of it. Or hearing suggestions. I'm interested in opposing viewpoints and I know this sub hates car debt as they should. So let me know what you think.",finance

stocks,2 energy stocks with a Biden connection,"Jonathon Silver is a green tech CEO who worked with the Obama administration (so with Biden as well) investing a $40 billion green energy fund. He's currently heading-up green tech investment for Guggenheim Securities but is still on the board of two companies:

PLUG

NGG

PowerPlug has seen some gains recently, presumably from a presumed Biden win. Its valuations are a little crazy (23 p/s, 21 p/b) and debt-to-asset ratio is not great. Still might materialize into great value though, especially if Silver ends-up serving a role in the Biden admin. Seems like hydrogen, while it won't compete with EV's for personal vehicles has a niche in commercial vehicles (b/c of weight and range issues).

National Grid, while a much different company, has more palatable valuations (p/e 25 p/s 2.2 p/b 1.6) and less leveraged than PLUG. They have been moving into renewables and AI/IoT tech upgrades to grid management. Election day provided a bump but NGG is still trading below its 52 week high by a bit.

Not promising that either stock will moon because of this connection, but its something to keep in mind as Biden preps his transition team. If Silver's name gets dropped a few times, it could be worth keeping an eye on these stocks.

Hi everyone, new to reddit and this subreddit. This year has been crazy, due to graduating in a pandemic and all. Fortunately, I accepted an offer back in November 2019 and started two months ago. I moved from the Bay to LA and am currently living in a room w/ private entrance. Here is my income + expense breakdown:

Income:
 ~$1900/biweekly after tax + 401(k). 
Total: $3800/mo

Expenses:
 - $650/mo for Rent + Utilities
 - $90/mo for Gas
 - $450 every 6 months for Car Insurance. Since I started working, i’ve been putting $150/mo for payment in January payment. After January i’ll be putting $75/mo to the side.
 - $150 budgeted goal for Groceries. Don’t really cook a lot.
  - ~$400-$600 girlfriend expenses. (Eating out, gifts, etc)
 - $200/mo for fun stuff

Total: $1565-$1840/mo

Savings:
 - Just started traditional 401(k). Company offers 6% match if you put in at least 8%. I put in 10%.
 - $4000 in Roth IRA. I put in ~$120/mo. Currently investing in VTSAX
 - $1000 in HYSA for trips + goals. Put in $400/mo 
 - $8000 emergency fund. Plan on building it to $10.5k

Loans: 
 - ~$19000 in my own student loans. Planning to put in ~$1200-$1500/mo for it. Plan on paying it off by beginning of 2022
 - After i pay my own student loans off, i plan to pay off the parent plus loans that’s under my mom ($13k). In the meantime, she’ll be paying for it and it’ll probably be around $5k-$10k when i’m done with mine.

Adult stuff is overwhelming. I looked at all these numbers and I felt like I’m being too specific. I use YNAB and it’s been helping. I don’t want to reach the point where i’m focusing more on my financials than living out my young years.

So: focus on paying off loans now, invest more to potentially max out my 401(k) and roth, or keep doing what i’m doing? Other pieces of advice is appreciated :)",finance

CryptoCurrency,Watch what happens to the Turkish lira in the next few hours. No one seems to be paying attention.,"The head of Turkey's Central Bank was fired this weekend. And now their finance minister just resigned (also this weekend).

The Turkish lira is one of the worst performing currencies this year.

Turkey has been backed into a corner, with a leadership that doesn't seem to understand money. Either they raise interest rates in a few hours or their currency plummets when FX markets open. It could actually plummet regardless of their Central Bank response.

Bitcoin is highly manipulated, so I expect a lag in its response. But I am guessing that BTC will eventually rise in response to the likely dump of their currency in the market.

Personally, I'd buy BTC on any pullbacks now. I know that this is WAY overplayed, but the government debt and idiotic mismanagement of our currencies is only going to become more apparent as governments print money and lower rates at an ever-accelerating pace.

The people I know in Turkey are asking about BTC right now.

Turkey is a big deal. I'm not saying that chaos will erupt in a few hours. But I'm not saying that it won't, either.

investing,Leverage on BND. Is it too good to be true?,"The prerequisite is that LIBOR is below 0.5 so that I can margin with sub 2 percent interest rate according to Interactive Broker, which makes bond profitable. Actually, BND's CAGR is 4% but I will be more conservative.

Portfolio is 100% on stock + 50~100% on BND (low volatility, high sharpe, high sortino, minimum max drawdown, which turns out to be bond etf). Yes, this is leveraged from 1.5x to 2x. As everyone knows, the real risk of leverage is margin call, which forces you to liquidate at the bottom. 

But with this kind of portfolio, if my stock crash like shit so that there is a margin call, I could just liquidate BND with almost no loss(the MAX DRAWDOWN is 4% from 2008/01!), therefore I can solve the risk of margin call. Plus, the stock and bond is already hedged by nature. If the stock crash, the bond is likely at ATH. I wouldn't be mad if I had to liquidate it. It's like an arbitrage that I can cancel anytime. I know LTCM did this kind of arbitrage and eventually collapsed. But they were leveraging like crazy (20x~100x) and their tricks were more complicated. I wouldn't call this method risk-free, the risk is both stock and bond crash but is that really possible in real world?",finance

Never invested directly in the market before. Played a little with crypto as a toy but that's it.

Objective is to load money in now and invest a chunk each month going forward to build to $500-750k so I can retire under the 4% rule with my $60k pension + $20-40k extra so around $80-100k a year total for retirement. In about a decade or so. Which charts show may be achievable investing a third of my take-home, and I'm currently saving more than that anyway as cash. The part I suck on is budgeting, basically I don't do that at all, but I know I can live on $60k or less without having to think for the most part about how I spend the money.

What are some strategies for moving up to $100k into a lazy portfolio through a broker (Vanguard? no idea what broker to use...) in a way that is risk-appropriate? I'm aware of dollar-cost averaging.

Great run in the Shares of marijuana producer Tilray Inc (TLRY), surging last 3 weeks. This is a classic Tilray bull flag breakout stock chart after a week of bullish consolidation. Tilray ran from $4.40 to $6.70 two-three weeks ago. This was the beginning of the election cycle move they have predicted. Over the last week, it pulled back, forming a bullish inside bar/bull flag. Now the stock is surging 10% to $6.11 by lunch time. Based on the stock chart setup, this Tilray bull flag breakout stock chart has upside to nearly $12.00/share. Hedge funds are extremely underweight marijuana stocks based on a chance of a Democratic sweep. It has happened, vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris has stated they will legalize marijuana on a federal level. If that happens, these stocks are worth double or triple where they are trading. Hedge funds need to pile in prior to the election even just on the chance that happens. Tilray has a great stock chart and a ton of upside.

personalfinance,IL: 401K to 529 Plan for state tax deduction a good idea?,"My employer 401K program offers a loan using my contributions into the program and paid back through after-tax payroll deductions. My contributions used to back the loan are no longer affected by stock or bond returns, equal to the remaining loan balance. So each monthly payment on the loan is like as if I'm ""recontributing"" to my 401K minus interest. ""Recontributing"" does not affect my actual 401K contribution limits. 

I'm thinking about taking a loan out of 401K to my 529 Plan to maximize my state's income tax deduction for this year. The loan will be allocated into the 529 Plan exactly how it was in my 401K plan. The expenses on these plans between 401K and 529 are low and similar.

The loan and tax details:

401K Loan interest rate: 0.75%

401K Loan one-time fee: $50

401K Loan term: 60 months (5 years)

IL State Income Tax Rate: 4.95%

====

It seems I'll save a couple of hundred dollars if I execute this plan. For example, if I took out $10,000 from my 401K, I would have paid a total of $241.8 in interest and fees over 5 years. On the other hand, that $10,000 contribution toward my 529 plan would save me $495 in taxes immediately. So overall I come away with a savings of $253.2.

Of course there's the opportunity cost or savings during the few days the fund gets transferred from my 401K to 529, but let's assume it's neutral.

Is there anything else I'm missing here or should consider?",finance

worldpolitics,"Dear Trump Supporters: A message about hypocrisy, double-standards, and complete disregard for basic logic","***I know*** so many people in this subreddit are not in here for the actual politics, but rather about the random and seemingly unrelated posts... But if politics isn't what you're seeking, then please leave, rather than atrack me.

With that said, enjoy the read if you bother, and here's my TL;DR: I hope most people who voted for Donald Trump realize that literally everthing that happened on election week is karmic irony.

-----------------------------------------------------

Before I begin, please note that I use the word *most* often, and it's on purpose. You will always easily find at least one exception to all that I will say, and if you have one or three counter-example to prove me wrong, but I can throw three times more that prove me right, my wording still stands.

-----------------------------------------------------

The Trump presidency is (likely) coming to an end, about the same way it started: People could not believe the results.

The country is more divided than it ever was, and what began as a clan mentality of ""my group"" versus ""not my group"", has now evolved to a cacophonic flame wars where nobody listening what the other side says... While pretending they do and have all the arguments against.

Most Democrats are tired to listen to mangled logic, and have stopped trying to do anything beyond calling Republicans idiots for half the stuff they parrot. It's not because they don't have solid, science-based arguments that can be backed up by scholarly articles of independently fact-checked information... It is rather that it hurts, it really hurts to the time they are wasting when their lengthy scholarly argument is met with ""well, you're using cherry-picking or biased stuff, and not even considering my cherry-picking or biased stuff."" I know, I've been on that side a lot recently.

Most Republicans are tired to hear insults that seem baseless to them, because they specifically only heard that in the last 5-6 years. This has led to them not accepting anything that comes from Democrats, basically equating a vast majority of what was told in the last 4 years to ""Orange Man Bad"". They feel that everything a Democrat says is objectively an attack to their intellect, they feel like it's impossible to sit down and talk with them, because Democrats acts as if they were inherently superior.

Understandably, when the debate is parrot versus insults, bothing good can ever come out of it.

I am going now to do the impossible: As a Democrat supporter, I will be complimenting one point of the Republicans, because I have to admit it is sound logic. ***When you have the opportunity to save yourself time by listening to analyzed information from someone whose job it is to be more intelligent and informed than you, it makes sense to listen to their opinion.***

There, I said it. I said the thing that most Democrats would never suggest admittinh, and wow, that actually lifted a bit of a weight... But anyways, back to the point.

The issue here, isn't the logic that most Republican use as to why they parrot what they hear. It is factually who they consider experts. What kind of information seems to be circulated as truth, with enough vehemence and confidnece that it seems to be properly analyzed, and the conclusion they have come to is (overall and inherently) the only possible conclusion that can be found here, and any other conclusion is false.

-----------------------------------------------------

I am doing a break here, because what I'm about to say is something important: If the only proof that something is real, is a lack of proof combined with silencing attempts... Then what you have is a conspiracy theory, not a fact.

I know some people will point out that some conspiracy theories have turned out to be true. I also know some people will also point out that by extension, the fact that some of those conspiracy theories being true means that every single one of them should be given a fair scrutiny.

But the most important thing about a conspiracy theory, is that until it is brought to light, there is factually nothing you can do about it, and dictating your every decision based on speculation, hyperboles, and unproven statements only leads to rash actions that will harm more than they help.

Please, stop taking decisions based off unproven conspiracy theories, for the good of everyone.

-----------------------------------------------------

But, none of what I have written here addresses the title of this post, does it? So, I plead guilty to a massive preface, and let me rectify everything here:

I think Trump supporters are the most hypocrite, double-standard heavy and illogical voters on the planet.

This isn't a baseless accusation, and before any one of you guys picks up a pitchfork and tries to jam it through my throat... I'll start explaining exactly why I say that.

***------------- Electoral shenanigans -------------***

In 2015, when Trump won the Electoral vote to enter office in January of 2016, but lost the popular vote... Democrats called bullshit. A large portion of the planet called bullshit, and those who didn't saw Trump as a willing puppet. But, despite everyone seemingly being pissed off that the one winning the popular vote didn't win the election, when Trump supporters told Democrats that ""This country isn't a democracy, it's a republic, and the republic has spoken. Suck it up."", Democrats calmed down. They calmed down, because they realized you were right about that, and contesting that would lead nowhere.

There was heavy evidence of collusion with Russia leading to a Trump victory. The victory was gotten using open racism, half-formed ideas, and disproven ideas. ""The emails"", Trump kept pushing. The goddamned emails. Do you really think that homeland security would have let Hillary use that provate email server for official white house business? Don't think so, and most certainly not withouy a tooth and nail fight.

But this year, though. This year, what happened is an overall shitshow... Trump attacked the concept of voting from tge start of the campaign. A vote would only truly be valid it is was cast for him, in his opinion. He attacked mail-in ballots, he attacked absentee ballots, he attacked early voting, he attacked late counting. This election wasn't an election: It was an attack on the very concept of what a republic is.

For those of you who don't know, a republic is defined as a political system where the supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and whose leader is either elected or nominated. In the case of the US, basically nominated by the electoral college, which serve as elected representatives.

***The attacks on the legitimacy of the elections in case of a loss completely undermines the concept of a republic, and should actually be seen as a crime.***

The restrictions put in some polling locations, the changing of voter registration laws, the restrictive time window to go vote, and the whole COVID-19 situation all made mail-in voting suddenly... A lot more attractive... Which is why, when Trump realized that mail-in voting would be his downfall, he began attacking it, by making false claim after false claim that it would lead to voter fraud. I can attest it is false claims, because several news outlets on both sides of political spectrum have had a view of the process to validate the mail-in votes... And yet, Republican outlets used the stringent vetting process as a risk for discrimination against voters, and Democrat outlets used the stringent vetting process as being a proof that it would be hard (or near impossible) to cause sorting fraud.

Reaching the end, though Trump was losing. In an attempt to save his seat, he clamored to, and I quote, ""stop the count"". Trump supporters have echoed those words loud and clear, through dismissals and explanations that no invalid ballots have been counted, and all of them had been mailed at the latest on election day. This led to his second attack: Recounting everywhere he can. To be fair, recounting is a recourse he is allowed to do, so I will ***not*** be attacking that.

The only thing that could make tgis situation sensical, is if the whistleblower that was supposedly brought to light about how some votes that were mailed past the election day were set aside, then poststamped to the election day to make invalid ballots seuddenly valid. There should be an investigation here, but I hardly believe that this would lead to a drastic shift in the result (I could be wrong.)

And now that Republicans lost, what happened? They are throwing a tantrum. Biden isn't their president. They refuse to calm down because they were robbed of their power. When they are told to suck it up, it's all aggression, some screeching for violence and war. Trump himself is showing as little grace as a drunk uncle trying to dance in a staircase in the middle of an earthquake. 

This is hypocrisy at its finest: When Republicans tell Democrats to suck it up, and accept the result, Democrats do it. Have some respect for yourselves, and do the same when the roles are reversed.

***------------- The cherry-picking double-standard -------------***

So you think that my argument on gun control, universal healthcare, and other people-centric policies are cherry-picking. I'll accept that you have an opinion that differs from mine, but... Let's define cherry-picking for a second:

*Most people would define cherry-picking as the practice of choosing and using only information or arguments that advantage your point of view, ignoring any opposing information and/or argument(s).* If you have a differing definition, then you might want to re-think it.

When I point out world-wide data points, studied logistics, and talk about healthcare, gun violence, economics and other polarizing policies (as they arise, none are coming to mind right now), I am giving and using the biggest data source that I can. I will throw in a direct comparison to the same numbers in the US, and why logistics are questionable... But at the end of the day, if I cast a wide net and analyze everything, I am not cherry-picking.

But what I often get in response to gun control, is ""yes, but what about Detroit?"" Detroit is a statistical oddity, most statisticians would agree. It should be ignored to look at the trend in the data, and not used as a proof to the data being wrong. ***And before anyone accuses me of this: No, I am not saying that the data in Detroid is wrong or invalid, but rather that it may be showing that guns are masking another problem entirely. Or a whole list of other problems.***

I could probably tackle universal healthcare and economics the same way, but you get the point, probably... But just in case: My wide-cast net of data-points is ""cherry-picking, and thus wrong"", but your one data point is accurate and should be heeded as a warning... Which most people who understand how data and information works would call cherry-picking. That's a double-standard that hurts everyone at the end.

***------------- The emotional impulsiveness double-standard -------------***

So, I have heard a lot of bad things about Democrats, especially women on that side, or the younger generations... Depending on which Republicn you end up talking to.

- ""The youth is too much of a snowflake generation.""

- ""Women are too emotionally unstable to make decisions.""

- ""Minorities are feeling oppressed over someone ordering a coffee the wrong way.""

Those are things I have heard so many times, I have no energy left to debate them... But it seems that other arguments can be made, and those are still infuriating to Trump Supporters. 

For instance, your fanatic patriotism is overall creepy. Daily pledge of allegiance? Really?

Another good example: Preferring to pay extra for health care, just so that you don't have to pay for your neighbor's son via taxes?

Should we talk about how you get violent about guns being restricted behind being responsible? How your feelimg are all that matter when we talk about abortion? Any talk of disliking your religion for being used as a justification for hatred?

Teaching kids about sexual education stuff gets your panties in a bunch, mentioning any version of US history that you don't accept as fact gets you all choked up and speechless with rage, and let's not even imply that some stuff you didn't learn in school are things being taught like humans are animals, or that climate change is an objective thing that no environmental expert is even thinking of debating.

We may be snowflakes for basically asking for equal opportunity, to not get gunned down, not to be thrown into what will soon be more debt than money we can make in a lifetime just to attend education for our goal profession thanks to inflation...

Yeah, we may be snowflakes, but you're not any less emotional. Your emotions are just not fear, hope and uncertainty, like ours are. We fear for our lives and our future, we hope you'll hear pleas form expert and reason, and we are uncertain about anything at all because of your emotional voting for the stuff you don't want to change from the old days...

But somehow, our emotional voting and actions is bad, and yours is good. That's another double-standard that we are fed up.

And as a side note: Republicans are the ones who won the Civil War to free the slaves. The hell are you guys doing waving a Confederate flag, being racist, and pretending like that's a valid poinf of view?!

In conclusion to this open letter from the heart of a Democrat supporter, to a Trump supporter, I hope you see why Democrats hate you, and everything you stand for... Not becayse youa re inherently bad people, but you keep justifying bad people, and you are a restless angered mob when the roles of the 2015 election are reversed...",finance

So the stock market and economy seems to love the fact that Biden has won the election and that the Government will likely be split with the Democrats holding the House and the Republicans holding the Senate. The fight for the senate is not over as there will be 2 important elections in early-January to decide this. Even if both the seats are won by the democrats, that would result in a tie which would then be decided by the Vice Kamala Harris but people are not talking about the filibuster problem.

The filibuster is a political procedure where members debate a proposed legislation act to delay it as long as possible and this is sometimes called as „talking a bill to death”

For debates to end there is still a 60% majority vote required for the talks to end,so i believe there is no immiment danger for any tax raises or something landscape shatering to happen.

The only thing that Democrats can do in Senate without this problem is appoint executive branch nominations, federal judicial appoiments and as of 2017 they can also decide on Supreme Court nominations.

So any imminent tax raises or any other more radical decisions that would affect the stock market are very unlikely.  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/JQTTXPk)

My job has been unaffected by covid and all my loans are federal, so I've been able to take literal years off my repayment schedule during this time. Part of Joe Biden's platform was student loan forgiveness, including $10K in forgiveness as part of a Covid relief plan. Chuck Shumer has already come out and said he hopes for Joe Biden to forgive some loans via executive order in his first 100 days. 

I understand nothing is guaranteed with politics and it's certainly possible he's unable to make this happen. Since interest is suspended, however, would I be losing anything by continuing to set aside my loan payment money, but placing it into my savings accounts? Interest is suspended until at least January. So even if forgiveness doesn't seem likely I could just make the payments when interest resumes in January.

vet,new vet scuffed my cat; should i go back?,"recently went to a pet hospital for yearly checkup/vaccines-we’ve been here twice before and i really liked the nurses and doctors. they were always so sweet with handling my cat, like he was their own. picking him up, cooing, making kissy noises, anything to make him feel more comfortable. my cat has never attacked or scratched anyone–even when getting his temp checked via tushy lol. However, this time around was the polar opposite. i had never seen this doctor before but the first thing i notice is him grabbing my cat from the back of his neck. although i know it probably didn’t hurt my cat, i was still taken aback just because i have never and will never grab him like that. he looked so scared and confused. i thought “surely there’s a better way to handle the worlds calmest cat”. then they took him to the back, which they’ve always done shots and temperature checks in front of us. when they gave him back to us, my boyfriend held him in his arms and he was shaking with his tail between his legs. it seriously broke my heart, i’ve never seen him this stressed.. i can’t tell if im being a sensitive cat mom or not, but i just couldn’t wrap my head around why this time was so different. i understand it was a stressful situation but goodness :( was wondering if scruffing a normal way to handle cats? especially one that isn’t being “difficult”?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Don't let perfect be the enemy of good,"I wanted to make a meta-post discussing my example of making personal finance 'personal'. Pre-pandemic, my husband and I were sticking to a super-aggressive debt payoff plan where we were throwing $3,500/month (70% of our net monthly income) at our student loans (~$38k balance with 6.8%-3.4% interest rates) with a plan to pay them off by September of 2020. 


Once student loan interest was suspended, we shifted to paying off our Prius ($16,500 balance with 4.5% interest rate). We paid off the car in May 2020 and our savings grew to over $20k as of October. After the student loan interest suspension was extended to the end of 2020, we tweaked our student loan payoff plan to pay a lump sum of $24k to student loans as of January 2021 and completely pay them off by June 2021. 


Our far-away goal after becoming debt-free was to buy a house. We originally planned to stick to the ideal rule of personal finance and put 20% down. However, we have lived in the same rental townhouse for several years and rent is trending up. It would have taken us 1-2 years of continuing to rent after paying off the student loans to save up a 20% down payment. 


On a whim, we got prequalified for a mortgage. We realized that we could buy a house with 5% down, $60/month PMI, all at 3% APR. We decided to buy a 2,700sqft new construction 4BR 3BA home priced at $302k. The home will be ready at the end of March 2021. With a mortgage of $1,650, we will still be able to pay $2,300/month to our student loans while maintaining a 6-month emergency fund. It will only cost us an extra $3,000 ($1,500 in additional student loan interest and $1,500 in PMI) and we will pay off the student loans in August 2022. 


After the student loans are paid off, we will beef up our emergency fund to 1 year of expenses and begin paying extra on the mortgage as of April 2023. We project that the mortgage will be paid off in late 2028 or early 2029.


So the moral of this story is not to let perfection be the enemy of good. If we had done everything perfectly according to the rules, we would have saved a whopping $3,000 and we would have had to wait an extra 1-2 years to buy a house. We think that we have reached a good middle-ground between super-aggressive debt payoff and getting what we want. Of course we can second-guess ourselves until the cows come home, but for right now we feel happy and excited that we will own a beautiful home in about 5 months and it won't hamper our financial goals too significantly.

CryptoCurrency,ECB executive highlights risks of digital currencies like Facebook's Libra - says they may threaten financial stability,"Source: https://www.ft.com/content/518a94cf-91e2-4e9f-bca8-5f29693340e7. Pasting full text here.

When Facebook’s digital currency project was redesigned earlier this year, the aim was to overcome regulatory and political resistance. The scaled-back Libra 2.0 project is certainly far less ambitious. But worryingly for its backers, it still seems to be lacking official support.

In [a speech](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp201104~7908460f0d.en.html) last week, Fabio Panetta, a senior executive at the European Central Bank, spelt out why regulators are still unhappy with the idea of a big technology group such as Facebook moving into the world of payments by launching a new “stablecoin” system. 

[Stablecoins](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/10/31/1572543245000/The-stablecoin-anathema-/) are digital currencies designed to minimise the wild price swings that have plagued other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, by tethering themselves to reserves of fiat currency held at commercial banks against which they can be exchanged. 

Bitcoin itself has had a resurgence recently, with[ its price last week](https://www.ft.com/content/26cff9b3-57cf-4f86-87f2-bb682c97779c) rising above $15,000 for the first time since 2017. But this rally has been driven by speculative bets rather than by any increased use of the cryptocurrency to make payments in the real economy.

[Libra](https://libra.org/en-US/blog/libra-developers-the-path-forward/) was initially designed to fill this gap by creating a hybrid between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies that could provide an alternative to the US dollar, to be used by anyone to transfer money or buy products online without a bank account. 

These lofty ambitions were [scaled back](https://www.ft.com/content/79376464-72b5-41fa-8f14-9f308acaf83b) in April when, instead of creating a single new currency, Libra unveiled plans to launch a series of different digital coins, each backed by a different government currency. 

It also plans to build a Libra coin that is a “digital composite” of some of those coins, which will be available for cross-border transactions.

Yet the changes do not seem to have convinced Mr Panetta, the ECB executive board member responsible for payments, who warned of “the host of risks [stablecoins] can pose to our social and economic life”. He identified three core problems with stablecoins. 

Firstly, he said that Big Tech’s data-driven models “could pose a risk of misuse of personal information for commercial or other purposes, which could jeopardise privacy and competition and harm vulnerable groups”. 

By outsourcing part of the European payment system to a foreign company, he said a stablecoin “could raise potential issues of traceability in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion.”

Secondly, he said that stablecoins could “threaten financial stability and monetary sovereignty”. This is based on the worry that a big shift of bank deposits into stablecoins could increase financial volatility, while monetary policy could be disrupted if the new currency’s issuers influenced interest rates when moving around their reserves.

Finally, because stablecoins lack the government guarantees that bank deposits enjoy, Mr Panetta said they would be “vulnerable to runs” if stabecoins’ holders feared a fall in value or an inability to absorb losses on the part of the issuer.

The coronavirus pandemic seems to have spurred central bankers to home in on digital currencies, after the virus caused cash usage to fall in many countries in favour of online payments. And [the ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/Report_on_a_digital_euro~4d7268b458.en.pdf) has suggested it might prefer to launch its own digital currency, as it is considering now, than to see Big Tech or countries such as China create a popular payment system.

More than eight out of 10 central banks are examining the possibility of launching their own digital currencies, according to [a recent study](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap107.pdf) by the Bank for International Settlements. The ECB will decide whether to go ahead next year.

Until then, if Mr Panetta’s comments are anything to go by, there is little chance of Facebook, or any other Big Tech group, being allowed to make a grab for a dominant position in the world of payments by launching their own stablecoin.",cryptocurrency

Recently, we found a 2 acre lot in our area that has Internet. To find a lot of this size in our area is almost unheard of. Most acreage in the area is being sold for large neighborhoods or townhomes. The lot is $135k and we would look at a total purchase price of ~$525k. We would put down about $70k and do a build to perm loan. Our loan would be for $471k, 30 yr mortgage with a rate of roughly 2.99%. 

The lot has a very long gravel driveway, it’s tucked away but still close to civilization. It’s in the best HS district (our current is 2nd best in the area, so still good) and we can have more privacy and we can make changes to our land and home without dealing with an HOA. 

Our current home will likely sell for about $320k - $340k. We would conservatively have $80k from the sale. This would be enough to cover the down payment of the new home and the monthly “draws” needed to start building. Our monthly payment once we move in would increase by about $600 (to $2412). 

My husband brings in $5000/mo. I bring in $2600/mo. I plan to increase my salary over time (federal employment, lots of opportunities to grow). Our monthly payments include one car payment ($250), regular utilities, and some misc. payments that I feel would still be covered. In my world, I feel like my salary would be all mortgage, and we would use my husbands for everything else. 

I’m so torn because we are in such a good situation, but we have a rare opportunity to build a home the way we want. We’d have more privacy and freedom.",finance
personalfinance,Employment not taking out federal taxes,"Hey guys, I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I didn’t know where else to ask until I’m able to get through to the irs. Yesterday I was going through my paycheck stubs at work and I noticed that at the bottom part of it where it has the Medicare, Social Security, and Federal Income Tax deductions that I had 0$ next to the federal income tax deduction for that paycheck.

personalfinance,School debt from 2013 because they kicked me out need HELP,"Okay, so I am going to make this as short and simple as possible because I have a few questions. So, in 2013 I went to school got 1 scholarship through the school and then the rest I got in federal loans and a little bit from FASFA not a lot I think it was like 1-2k because my mom made too much when I put her down. 

So, I went to school they were on a quarter system I was 1 day called to my financial advisors office because he said I owed them 5k and if I didn't give them the 5k before the 3rd quarter (Last quarter to finish the year) that I would be kicked out and evicted from my dorm. So, I scrambled to come up with 5k but couldn't so I was eventually just evicted because they basically told me about a week and a half prior maybe 2 weeks can't recall.

Anyways, fast forward to today and now I have a debt collector calling me saying I owe 18k to the school? Not really sure how because I had student loans through the government and when I went to school I signed a paper saying I just had to pay about 5k-7k back at the end of the year. Which turned out to be not true since I got evicted and then now I apparently owe the school 18k even though I only had 1 scholarship and the rest are actual loans against me that I have set up through federal. So, I am trying to figure out what can I do about this? The school got bought out by another school so I don't know who I could even call and I am really not sure what to do to be honest.

2020 has already been rough enough and I am just trying to figure out what I can do. I was kicked out and thrown a bunch of debt on top of me when I was in good academic standing for no other reason than apparently having to pay all tuition upfront but wasn't advised about it. What can I do?

TL;DR Went to college in 2013 got evicted because I had to apparently pay the entire tuition up front that I didn't know about. School kicked me out before the year was over and now debt collectors say I owe the school 18k.",finance

investing,Brokerage Force Selling Stocks In Your Portfolio,"So I currently use M1 Finance. You can use margin in your account at a 2% variable interest rate. I searched everywhere on the internet and through margin agreements with the brokerage and I can't seem to find an answer to my question.

Can your brokerage force sell your stocks if your portfolio was ABOVE the margin requirements?

(Let's give a hypothetical scenario)
Let's say I have $100,000 portfolio and took out $10,000 in portfolio margin and bought SPY. Let's say 6 months later, SPY drops 10% below where I originally bought it from. If M1 Finance (for whatever reason) decided to force sell my securities to cover the call, would they be aloud to do this? Obviously I would be far above margin requirements but is this a risk that could/would actually happen?

The reason I ask is if (hypothetically) SPY were to drop say 30% or more I would consider taking out margin. I am a long term investor investing into safe dividend companies. So I would theorectically take out margin and invest into companies to hold them for years and use my dividends to pay the loan interest. If I only margin out like 10% of my portfolio then the only way I don't meet margin requirements is if SPY drops like 90%.

TLDR

If stocks were to drop 30% or more would it be a smart idea to take out margin to take advantage of the low prices of safe stocks?

Can a brokerage force sell your securities at any time even if you are well above margin requirements?",finance

economy,"In at Least One State, Taxpayers Will Foot the Bill for Trump's Election Recount","There’s no federal guidance on how recount procedures should be funded, so the decision largely comes down to the states. Most states have some sort of established protocol: 20 states, including Pennsylvania, pay for automatic recounts when there’s a tight race (typically if the margin of victory is one-half of 1% or less), and 43 states, including Michigan, allow candidates to request a recount if the results are close (or, in states like Minnesota, for any reason at all). In states where recounts haven’t been enacted automatically, the political campaign requesting the recount covers its cost, and the money is refunded if the results overturn the election’s outcome.

But some states don’t have any related laws on the books, which means they’re forced to absorb the cost of a recount, no matter what results.

Such is the case in Georgia, where Trump’s camp is pushing hard for a recount. In a statement Friday, Trump campaign attorney Matt Morgan claimed the team is “confident we will find ballots improperly harvested,” and that Trump will “ultimately prevail” in the state.",finance

Greedy Boomers over the past 20 years completely fucked over the Stupid Boomers that voted them into democratic positions while giving them full control of monetary and fiscal policy. The Greedy Boomers gutted payments into pensions and retirement funds to create unnecessary capital expenses while taking massive amounts of fees. Stupid Boomers are now retiring into record low interest rates and will quickly need draw down on their principal. Once they do, they'll need to start selling literally everything to survive.

To cover their asses, Greedy Boomers (doesn't matter if it's the Orange one or the old one), need to make the money printer go BRRR to give the Stupid Boomers social security to survive. When this happens, everyone who holds a dollar will essentially be socializing the losses and being taxed through inflation. This is already on top of record student loan debt, record costs of living, and massive blockages to real wealth building investments through asinine regulation that prevents any of us from playing the same game the Greedy Boomers play.

stocks,"As Biden gets in office, Gold and Gold mining stocks will shine.","Trump was great for gold- low rates, big QE, booming deficits, etc. Gold has been up 50% since 2018. Imo this trend will continue. 

As were headed for 12th year in this bull market, it seems logical that it has to come to an end soon. I personally don’t think it will end. The Federal reserve will push the market upward at any sign of downtrend. 

The question is, how long can the dollar sustain its value with this much stimulus pumping in before it faces a major devaluation? I predict that in the short term, the stock market and gold will both rise together. Eventually the dollar will break downwards and push gold a lot higher; it could be in a month, or years. There’s no telling how long this can continue for, but eventually something will give out. 

With Biden in office we’re going to get a far more dovish fed chairman. Rates will stay at 0 and QE will be going on at a faster rate. Also, expect bigger deficits, Biden will be easier on China. Gold has a lot of momentum heading to $2000, but I still don’t think it has enough enthusiasm in the trade yet. 

I think gold needs to break $2300-2500 to really gain some interest. I especially think the gold miners will rise significantly when gold breaks that psychological $2000 level.

At $2500 gold, I can’t imagine where silver would be. Possibly $100? There would be tons of selling at $50 an oz. I could see a scenario where people hold onto it and ride it to 100 if it’s going up a weekly with a lot of momentum. I think $50 is just a huge barrier for silver that might be tough to break.",finance
personalfinance,Condo Refinance with Family Loan - Drawbacks?,"Hello PF reddit. I purchased a condo in July 2019 for $274,000. I got a first-time homebuyers mortgage product at my credit union that only required 3% down with no PMI. The drawbacks include the interest rate of 4.25% and that it's an adjustable rate (10/1 ARM). 

Ever since I did this, I've had slight buyer's remorse. Basically, I wish I had more equity on the off chance I needed to sell in a bad real estate market (I have no plans to do this anytime soon). I'd also love to take advantage of our current environment and have a lower interest rate locked-in for the life of the loan. This all got me thinking...

Are there any drawbacks if I were to approach my parents with a request for a loan of about $23K which would be applied directly to my mortgage in order for me to have 20% equity and thus be able to easily refinance into a conventional 30-year fixed? This would be a formal loan written up as a promissory note at the current Applicable Federal Rate (AFR) of 0.39% on a term of 5 years. 

Just wondering if I haven't thought of any particular reasons why I shouldn't do this...assuming of course that the 'rents will agree to the loan terms. We have a very good relationship and they have the means to do this so I'm 100% confident they will if I work up the courage to ask.",finance

CryptoCurrency,[Speculation] Crypto may really hit the limelight in the next 1-5 years.,"I keep reading big time investors and companies doing things to gear up for a possible crash in the economy. (Most of my awareness and consideration is for US markets). I think a lot of people in the crypto space already know that USD is inevitably doomed. My habit for trading is to ride a wave up, then sell, back to fiat. I’m starting to think soon this will not be a good idea, considering the devaluation of usd is on its way. When will that be, idk. During Covid feds printed like at least 3 trillion dollars. 

Another thing, I’ve read multiple prominent figures saying economic recession as a result of covid has yet to really set in. Furthermore, Joe Biden (not inciting political alliance in any way) wants to raise min wage to 15$ in 2025 which I think will really impact the relativistic economy. 

I’ve read some people say crypto rides waves along with stocks and economy, and to a degree that has been true. But I think the two spaces will become untethered when one becomes obviously destabilized, that one being usd. I’m not sure how things will go during this time, I just imagine people dumping stocks as usd depreciates, and also prices of everything in general will jump. Meanwhile crypto was doing its own thing while the usd did the dance of volatility around it. 

By this time crypto should really be a prevailing thought in the minds of many average citizens.

Tangent to all of this, bitcoin is estimated to half around 2024. I really think the next halving will do btc in once and for all once the block rewards are so low and transaction fees so high, people will seek alternatives. I feel like ethereum will really shine as the standard for crypto, the foundation of erc20.

Before Corona, I was paying off my student loan debt at double the monthly payment, ($500 vs $241) to get it paid off quicker and try to minimize the burden later on. I've gotten the balance down from 26k to about 15k, also thanks to my company's 1k a year payment program. The only expenses I have are my car payment and insurance which are about $425 a month, and I'm still living with my parents. See the following table for the loans.

Loan Amt | Interest
--------|--------
1,313.68 | 4.41% unsubsidized

Or should I just drop as much as I can when the payments start up and start with a lower principle? Thanks in advance for your advice!",finance

personalfinance,"US citizen living abroad, have a 401K with my former employer that they are requesting I roll over to another plan, I need some help to understand what my IRA options are","I am a US citizen living in another country. I contributed to my 401k at my last job and the balance is between $1000 and $5000, very likely between $4000 and $5000. 

I have tried to open an IRA to roll the funds over to, but some major brokers (like Vanguard) won't open accounts for US citizens living abroad at all, and some others (Interactive Brokers) seem to have restrictions depending on whether or not I am a *resident* of the US, though what standard is used to determine this is unclear to me. Interactive Brokers had no issues opening the account, but there's a flag about me having an employer located in the country I live in but declaring an address (my long-term mailing address) in the US as my residence.

My questions are as follows:

1) For account purposes, am I a resident of the country I live in? I believe that even if I wasn't in tax year 2019, I will be in tax year 2020, since I will probably pass the IRS's bona fide residence test (the one used on Form 2555). 

2) Are there any decent brokers that will allow me to open an IRA as a US citizen living abroad? (Or I guess more fundamentally, *can* I do this as a US citizen living abroad?)

3) It is my understanding that were I to desire a Roth IRA over a traditional IRA, I would first need to roll the 401k into a Traditional IRA and do a conversion to a Roth IRA, is this correct? 

4) I read the [wiki article](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) about Roth vs. Traditional, does this all still apply to me as someone living abroad for the short-term or medium-term? As additional background, I am early on in my career and expect to be making $60k-70k USD in the next year or so, but will probably be returning to school for a graduate or professional degree in the future. If we both contribute to IRAs, my wife and I will probably stay right at the top end of the 12% federal bracket for the next couple of years, but my earnings potential with a professional degree in my field will definitely put us in the 22% or 24% bracket five to seven years from now. 

5) If I cannot open an IRA, do I have any options besides having the money in the account withdrawn and paying early withdrawal fees? My employer had a pretty aggressive matching scheme, so I think about 40% of the money in the account was essentially ""free"" money.",finance

29y/o, married, one kid, my annual is about $100,000 give or take $10,000, hers is around $35,000.

I’m selling a piece of property. It was purchased a few years ago for $50,000. Selling for $225,000. Nothing invested. After paying off the mortgage, capital gains and closing costs I’m looking at a net of just north of $150,000.

My primary residence market value is around $180,000, I owe $145,000 and the interest rate is solid.

I have, let’s say $10,000 in outstanding debt that I plan on closing out to avoid any interest.

My monthly expenditure at that point will be around $3,000.

So to get to the bottom of it, I am going to have $140,000 that I don’t want to squander on hookers and blow. My wife is recommending that we sell our primary residence and move into a bigger house to expand our family, and I’m not opposed to the idea provided we live comfortably within our means, but I’d like to take a chunk of this money and reinvest it. It’s the first time I’ve had a mediocre amount of money to make money with and I don’t know what my best options are.

I have no grace period left on my loans however as I took a semester off to work full time in the industry. I have about 2k in savings a car that is paid off, and about 650 in credit card debt that is 0% APR for another year.

My monthly bills are ~750 a month and that includes paying 50 a month towards my credit card debt. My monthly income is about 1.5k after taxes are deducted.

I wasted a lot of time after highschool before deciding what to do with my life and so I don't have a lot of assets built up and am late to start a career with stable income.

I'm looking for advice on how to best utilize the small inheritance my father has left me. My initial thought was to pay off all student loans, but now I'm not sure as there is talk of the federal student loans being forgiven under Biden. The remainder I was thinking of saving half and investing half. Any advice is welcome. 

Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Is my 401k even worth it?,"I recently graduated from college and got a job which offers a 401k plan without employer matching. I live in a state with no state income tax and my marginal federal income tax rate is 12%.
The 401k plan charges a 1% ""recordkeeping and administration"" fee.
Given my income tax situation, I would imagine it makes the most sense for me to invest through a Roth 401k rather than a traditional one.

Now let's assume I invest $10,000 every year for 40 years into the Roth 401k and get an average annual return of 7% (6% after the fee). I would retire with about $1.64 million.
If I invested the money through a regular brokerage and got the full 7% instead, I would retire with $2.14 million instead.
Since I'm effectively paying a 23% total fee to the brokerage and since even the highest capital gains tax bracket is only 20%, it would make more sense for me to forgo the tax advantages and just invest through a regular brokerage.

I did the some math on the traditional 401k as well and I would have to be able to defer a total of 30% tax on my annual investment (investing $13000 annually) just to break even between the tax deferred 401k and the regular brokerage. And at that point it might still make more sense to go with the brokerage and have it taxed as capital gains upon withdrawal, rather than as regular income.

Am I missing something? Or is it really just not worth it to invest through this 401k if my employer doesn't cover the fees?",finance
personalfinance,2+% cashback (category agnostic) cards,"Hi folks,

Wondering if anyone can solidly recommend any 2+% cashback credit cards for *every* type of purchase. I have cards for much higher percentages on specific purchase categories.

I'm looking to replace my current paying-general-bills card (Navy Federal Cash Rewards 1.5%). I'm trying to move away from Navy Federal because their customer service has waned as they've grown exponentially, and I recently lost this card, so, having to memorize a new card number seems like as good a time as any to press forward with this plan.

I am in Texas, so I opened an RBFCU account, as they have lots of billboards around for their 2% card, but I needed to call them for assistance with online banking, and was quoted a 42 minute hold time. That's unacceptable to me, so I won't be pursuing them further. I also will not do business with Citi, so the Double Cash card isn't a choice for me. (I realize I'm pigeonholing myself by having high standards for who I conduct business with, but that's more important to me than maximizing CC rewards.)

The one I'm looking at now is with a credit union I've never heard of called Alliant: It's 2.5% back, but I'm not sure if anyone else has used this card/CU and can verify if they're legit or have decent customer service.

To head off this question, the revolving balance on the card in question will be high enough that the extra 0.5-1% cashback is significant. A modest annual fee wouldn't scare me away. Thanks for any recommendations.",finance

I bought a used car last year with high interest and was looking into refinancing.

personalfinance,Scared Money Don't Make Money - ISO Advice - House Hack? 22 y/o $70k salary,"Hello.

22 y/o. $20k in bank. $60k student loans recently refinanced to 20 yr / 4.8% . Living at home with parents not paying rent. $70k annual salary.  No credit card debt.

So after reading the side bar and similar posts I decided to post as I  don't like a lot of the avenues suggested. In particular I hate any advice given by Dave Ramsey. Interest rates are dirt cheap, he wants you to pay off debt I say lever up.  I see no reason for someone with risk tolerance to pay off a 4%  interest loan when the stock market runs an 8% average return before inflation.

So that being said, I have pretty healthy monthly cash flows (especially from living at home), all of my debt is at a reasonable rate so I will be making minimum payments on that (I just extended from 15 years to 20 while also getting the interest rate 130 bps lower), and I'm sitting on a chunk of cash.

I want to be aggressive. I 'm 22 with no kids. Nothing to lose.  Money is cheap. To be perfectly honest even the stock market doesn't seem like a great option (I understand the ""can't time the market"" argument but its higher than it was pre coronavirus which doesn't make sense to me, and you can't lever up on the stock market unless you're trading on margin which isn't an attractive option to me with markets at new high). So, what do you guys suggest?

I'm really leaning towards a house hack. $200k house 3-4 bedrooms, live in one room rent out the other 2-3 to make mortgage payments. Interest rates are dirt cheap (3.5% ish), and I could probably be close to cash flow positive even while taking up one in the rooms. Only need to put 3.5-4% down on the house (FHA). Live there for a year then buy another? Would have enough cash after a year for another, then after a  few years I could pull equity out to buy a third.

What do you guys think? Is there a better aggressive option out there? Any reason to talk me out of the house hack? Go for it? Let me know. Appreciate the advice.",finance
personalfinance,Financial Advice for an Incoming U.S. Medical Student: Thank you so much!,"Hi everyone! I hope you have had a beautiful day so far. I'm very grateful to have accepted to medical schools (in the U.S.).  During this gap year prior to my matriculation, I want to better my financial literacy as best as I could. I know I'll be in a lot of debt and I want to make careful, wise financial decisions when it comes to borrowing student loans. 

1) **Background:**

 I have $14500: original undergraduate student loan + $153 interest amount (I have 3 types of ONLY subsidized student loans with interest rates as 3.400%, 4.660%, and 4.290%) 

\-It's currently in forbearance until 12/31/2020

\-Have $10,000 in my saving right now. Checking about $200

\-No family financial support. 

\-Extremely frugal. Live below my means. No car loan and no credit debt. The only debt I have is my undergraduate student loan. 

2) I'll be attending medical schools in July/August 2021. 

**Questions:** 

1) Should I be paying off my undergraduate student loan as much as I can prior to my medical matriculation? or should I save up my money for emergencies and other expenses in medical schools? I will not be able to work during medical school. 

2) For physicians, can you please share with me what you wished you had known about finance and had done differently prior to medical schools? 

3) Any advice or pointers that you want to share with me, I'd also appreciate it. 

I come from a very disadvantaged, low-income background. As a refugee, I have to learn everything on my own, so I want to make sure that I'm doing this right and know what I'm putting myself into. I'd greatly appreciate your wisdom and advice, especially from physicians and/or people who are in medicine.",finance

personalfinance,"Somehow I owe over $4K in state taxes? From a foreclosure, maybe?","I’m in some sort of pickle here. 

TLDR: haven’t filed taxes since 2013. Foreclosed on a house in 2014, and worked part time in retail for 9 months. Now my DL is suspended bc I owe over $4K in taxes, interest, and fees from 2014? Question: does foreclosing on a house impact tax income? 

The setup for this isn’t really important, but for context’s sake, I’ll include all data that might be relevant. I was married in 2011, and my then wife and I bought a house in 2012, but because my wife had exactly 0 credit (paid her student loans in cash...she had a very wealthy family), the loan for the house was in my name. I got legally separated in 2013, and...fell into quite a bit of depression. I was asked to leave my job, and ended up foreclosing on the house (2014).

In March 2014, a friend of mine let me move in w him, and got me a job at Sears in the warehouse. The store closed in October of that year, but I was able to be transferred to another Sears (which also has closed). 

I hadn’t filed taxes since 2013, for...reasons, but at the time I never had to actually pay when I filed, as I’ve always gotten a return, so I figured that I was just me missing out on the return. 

My stepfather is a CPA, and when I said that I hadn’t filed taxes since 2013, he said that he’d help me out. About two week after I filed 2019, and 2018, I got a letter saying that from 2014, I owed over $4K in state taxes, interest, and collection fees from some place in CA (I live in Louisiana). Figuring it was a scam (how could I possibly owe $2K in taxes when I was paying taxes through my payroll checks?) I disregarded it. I was supposed to get around $300 in state returns from ‘19 and ‘18, but about 2 weeks ago I got a letter saying those funds were applied to the $4K balance that I owe. 

Now my license is suspended. 

See question above. When I called the State Revenue Dept, the lady said “apparently you filed Federal returns in 2014, but didn’t file state, so we took the amount you apparently earned on your federal return, and figured how much you should have paid in state taxes, and then charged you that amount”

I know I didn’t file federal in 2014, and even if I did, how the heck could I have UNDERPAID almost $2K in state taxes, when I was already paying state taxes through my payroll, and also working part time in retail?!

personalfinance,Stock Loss to Offset Taxes?,"Hi all, I have a taxation question regarding stock sales. Filing single in the US. 

Currently have a major telecommunications stock that has left me with an unrealized ~25% loss long-term. Let’s call this stock A. Thankfully it’s a very small amount of my allocation, so for conversations sake, let’s say a $500 loss.

On the other hand, I’ve had success with another long-term holding that I felt it was right to close that position this year at +~140% for a realized gain of about $4,000. Let’s call this stock B.

In terms of taxes for 2020, how do these unrelated stocks interact with one another? My core question is: I’m trying to understand if I sell stock A at a loss, will that loss of $500 apply to the capital gains from stock B, effectively reducing my taxable capital gains amount to $3,500 -or- does the $500 loss apply to my taxes in a way that if I were to owe the Federal government $500 due to my tax withholding/income it would net to zero and I would pay capital gains on the $4,000? Conversely if I owed $0, would I gain $500 as a reimbursement and pay capital gains on the $4,000?

As a caveat, stock A has a generous dividend and I have been reinvesting and *slowly* DCAing out of my loss. Would it be smarter to continue with this approach with the upside being if the investment in A were to increase, I would effectively “double down” and realize a significant capital gain?

personalfinance,Withdrawal from 401k to pay debt,"So, a friend of mine alerted me to this reddit, so I figured I would take a shot at asking for some advice. 

I, like many of the folks that seem to ask for advice, have made my share of financial mistakes. Really, just about every financial mistake that can be made looking back. I took out a lot of loans for school, bought a car I realistically couldn't afford when I got a sales job I thought I would kill it in, and racked up a good amount of credit card debt.

Currently I work a factory job, namely because it was the only place I could find with the OT available to allow me to make what I needed to make. My first year I worked 70+ a week, every week. I do slightly less now because of availability, but I also spend some time doing freelance copyediting on the side (trying to use that Master's in English for something, another mistake). My monthly expenses between my vehicle, home, utilities, and student loan payments are around 2700. I bring home about $3000 a month with that overtime, less if it's not available.

One thing I did to try to consolidate and lower the interest on my credit card debt, was take out a loan on my 401k. The problem with this, is that the way the factory has handled the pandemic has been, at least in my opinion, abysmal. 

I am trying to get out of this job, as with the current state of the pandemic, combined with the fact that I have given up almost all aspects of a social life, and a lot of time with my wife (I work 2nd shift, so with overtime I don't see her at all during the week and barely on the weekends). My mental health, as well as my physical healthy has deteriorated fairly serverely. Obviously, finding a job with the pay I require will be tough, but I can take the time to do it since I at least have my current job, but I just can't see myself staying here much longer than I have to.

So, getting to the point of my question before I end up writing a book on this. The remaining balance of the loan is about 13k. If I leave the company, this will become a withdrawal. The only option I see to allow me to leave the company anytime soon would be to make a withdrawal on my 401k, to then pay back the loan out against it, as well as the taxes and fees associated. I am 31, with 50k in the 401k, and my yearly gross is around 50k, 90k with my wife's income.

I live in NY, so by my estimate, and playing it safe, I would need to withhold about 25% for federal taxes, 10% for state, and then I would lose 10% on the early withdrawal fee. If anyone here can help me verify these numbers, that would be great. I figure I will lose about $10,000 when everything is said and done. I planned on talking to the lady that does our taxes as well, but I know this whole situation will probably make her head explode, namely at my foolishness, as I am sure some of yours are.

At the end of the day, I know taking this hit on my 401k is another shitty idea. I just need some kind of relief from my situation, because if I have to keep working the way I am now, a 401k isn't going to do me much good anyway.

I appreciate any advice on the matter though.",finance

I knew about Income Based Rates, so I felt confident I’d find myself in a situation that’d work with my means of living. Then I found out that only applies to federal loans, and the majority of my loans are private. I’m about 119k in private debt. I received no assistance in college, and was told to apply there. I didn’t think anything of it, everyone uses loans! 
I borrowed through Sallie Mae, and they don’t consolidate or refinance loans. I have 6 loans through them, so without consolidation I’d have 6 different interest rates.

Now, does this mean that this is the interest rate at which today's government bonds were issued? Or is this the average yield on outstanding government bonds based on their market value? 

The way I usually think about rates and yields is that governments issue new bonds at a certain rate, and this affects the supply and demand of previously issued bonds due to favourable or unfavourable interest rate on them. This change in supply and demand causes a change in the market price paid for those bonds, effectively changing the yield on them. I'm not sure if I'm thinking of the entire concept the right way though. 

Using the example of 10yr Canadian govt bonds, today the rate is 0.82, and yesterday it was 0.64.

personalfinance,"25 years old, closing on my first house. Decent financial foundation, what should I do going forward?","Not single but not married. No medical issues and good health insurance. I make roughly $55-62k a year depending on overtime. State public employee retirement plan and I am going to be contributing to deferred comp soon. I have about $45,000 in savings, net worth of $51,000. No car payments and about five grand in student loans. I do intend on completing my bachelors degree once I get settled into the house, and depending on how things with U.S. politics developes I think it may be good to hold off on paying that as long as I can in case the new administration whips up some economic policies. My job will cover half of my tuition expenses. Cost of living is cheap here (Ohio). I close on the house worth $129k within the next week and I have a conventional home mortgage with an interest rate of 2.75%. My mortgage will be about $750/month including escrow (taxes and home insurance). I'm going to have to spend a grand or two on furniture, hopefully much less. My credit score is 760 and the bulk of my money is sitting in an Ally Savings account. Used to yield higher, but you know how it is with COVID and the federal reserve. The rest of my money is in a small savings and checking account at a local credit union. I have a credit card through them which I rarely use. I have a Citi Double Cash credit card which I basically use as my debit card, I pay it in full every month.  

Monthly payments will be pretty standard: utilities, cell, internet, Netflix, gas, groceries, etc. I am pretty frugal but once a year or so I drop some cash to treat myself, whether it be vacation or for hobbies. I do need to eat out less. Within the next five years I should budget for a new roof and ideally a new car, although I'm going to suck every mile out of that engine that I can. I plan on spending a few thousand dollars on a wedding ring within the next couple of months. She won't be living with me just yet, but she's an independent contractor and makes about $45k/year.

personalfinance,(CAN) Continue universal life insurance policy for father with Alzheimer's?,"Hi /r/personalfinance, newcomer here.

I am a 24 M graduate student with essentially net-zero income for the next 5 years, after which I'll hopefully get a decent-paying job in computer science. 

My family took out a universal life insurance policy on my father in 2000 with a payout of $1.5M (all figures in CAD). The premiums follow a pre-determined schedule (see below), and are generally increasing superlinearly. There is no cash value. As I understand it, this sort of policy was intended for individuals/families with relatively high net worth, but unfortunately due to a variety of factors, including my father's early-onset Alzheimer's diagnosis and near-comical mismanagement of family finances, this definitely no longer applies to us.

The question I face is: should my family continue paying the premiums for this policy, or forgo it and invest those premiums elsewhere?

I've known about my father's disease since before I became a teenager, so I've honestly become a little blasé about his mortality. It seems that the single largest factor in this decision is when he will die. I suppose I should talk to some Alzheimer's specialists to get a better sense of when this is expected to occur.

Over these last 20 years, the sum of the premiums has come to around $250K. But as I understand it, in making this decision, I'm supposed to disregard that (sunk cost). My father brings in no income, so we're not mitigating any loss of income with this policy. Hence, I don't know how else to think of this but as a (potential) investment.

The following table shows the growth of a fund that has yearly injections that follow the insurance premium schedule, using (what I understand to be, correct me if I'm wrong) a relatively conservative interest rate of 5% compounded annually.

You will notice that a break-even point (comparing to the insurance payout) happens around 2040, but even before then, the payments get... high. If I use a 10% interest rate, the break-even happens around 2037. (And just for fun, if we assume that the $250K we've paid is magically available to us now to invest, the break-evens are at 2036 for 5% interest and 2032 for 10%, respectively.)

personalfinance,Medical bill sent to collections despite payment plan,"I had a medical procedure last May that came with a MUCH larger than anticipated price tag - yay American health care!  I have a pre-tax HSA, but didn't save nearly enough to cover this.  When I got the bill, I contacted the hospital.  I inquired about deferring the payments until my new HSA funds  would be available (Jan 1).  The representative told me they could do that, but I would need to call again in October before the bill was sent to collections.  

October rolls around and I contact them again - this time in writing because 1) work got crazy and I couldn't make personal calls during business hours and 2) I thought it best to have a paper trail.  I reiterated my plan, included the details I had worked out with the representative and thought everything was fine.  I upped my HSA amount during October benefits enrollment and prepared to pay the bill on Jan 1.  

Today, I got a letter from a collection agency demanding the entire sum immediately!  So not only did the hospital disregard the payment plan I had set up, but now my credit is going to take a hit.

I'm particularly worried because I had planned to purchase a car in the next month or so, and was hoping my  credit rating (which is usually excellent) would get me the best possible interest rate.  

What is the best way to handle this?  Can I dispute with the collection agency long enough to keep the hit from impacting my credit long enough for my HSA to kick in?  Do I raid my savings to just make it go away?  But if I do that, I will be stuck with a fat HSA balance that I would then have to find a way to spend.  I'm stumped!

personalfinance,Buying a House vs 401k,"Hello everyone! I'm currently a  25 year old making \~120k a year(during COVID for the past like 8 months) and am living with my parents in a high cost of living area(westchester, NY). I really want to move out of my house but my take home pay is 57% after taxes(NYC taxes, city i live in taxes, federal taxes etc) meaning I take home about $68,000/year($5700/month). $1000 goes to my parents to pay off a 0% interest loan for school. I put 1650 in my 401k to max it out.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it okay to stop contributing to my 401k as i REALLY want to move out to save up for a rather high down payment on a house or should I just stick it out and continue contributing to the Roth 401k while saving for a downpayment? I do not have a match of my Roth at work. I also contribute the max to my backdoor roth IRA.

\~29% of my take home pay goes to my Roth 401k which I think is rather high given goals right now. I'm rather frugal and save \~80% of the rest of my money I take home. Currently have $44,000 between my retirement accounts and \~29k in a high yield savings.

personalfinance,"Employee Stock Program - sell immediately and pay off debts, or hold for the long term?","For our employee stock purchase plan, I maxed out my contribution at 15% of my gross income. My company's stock has done pretty well (up ~50% from six months ago). I've put in about 6k in paycheck contributions, and if I cash out immediately at the end of the window next week I'd get about $10k. For some additional background, I make 85k/year and have about 2k in savings, total monthly expenses are about 2.5k.

Should I sell immediately or hold, given my company's strong performance this quarter? I owe ~6k on my car (3.14% APR) and another 6k on my credit card (7.50% APR). It's very tempting to take the big check now and pay off all my debt. But my interest rates are so much lower than the ROI I've gotten on the stocks so far. I'm wondering if it's wise to hang on to the stocks (making the bet that my company continues to do well, which I think they will) and just pay off the credit card aggressively, and the car payment as scheduled (given the low interest rate). Or is it not worth the risk? I could probably pay off the credit card in 2-3 months max, my monthly expenditures are *usually* fairly low but I got into a new hobby recently (mountain biking...), hence the high CC balance at the moment. The high balance is very recent and I generally always pay my entire balance each month.

Also, do I pay capital gains tax if I sell the stocks immediately after the purchase (scheduled for 11/19) and only own it for &lt;1 day? What are the tax implications for selling it after a year or so, vs right after purchase?",finance

personalfinance,How to start refinancing process? Bought car in Jan for me [25] and baby to commute safely.,"Hi everyone! 

I bought a car early January 2020 because I really needed a reliable car last minute. I had an old Chrysler Pacifica 2010 that kept breaking down on me and I didn’t want to risk it breaking down with my baby [8 months] in it. We live in Florida so it’s either raining or too hot outside and I didn’t want to risk it anymore after breaking down on the side of the road twice in one month. Thank God it only broke down on my way to work and not with my infant son in the car with me. I wasn’t willing to risk it anymore and went to CarMax. I only bought my cars in cash (spent $3k on the Pacifica) and never had to borrow money from the bank to finance so I didn’t really know how it worked. I did some research and read CarMax cars were great quality so I went ahead and found a car that suited my budget at the time. My credit was at about 660-680 and I put $1,000 down (from selling my Pacifica). I needed a car asap and would accept any bank offer that was around the monthly payments I could afford ($250). I was accepted by Exeter Financial at 20% interest and stayed within my budget so I foolishly accepted. I knew the interest rate was high but that was the best offer I was receiving and I needed a reliable car for me and my son. 

A few months later after always making payments on time, I found out only $90 of the $250 monthly payment was going towards paying off my car and the rest ($160) was going towards a “daily fee” of $5 to the loan company. I wasn’t aware of this daily fee and it’s made it really hard to pay off my car. 

My father said I could refinance since I’ve been making my payments on time (even after being laid off in March). I want to find another loan company, hopefully with a lower interest rate but don’t know how to start the process. Can anyone explain to me how I could go about refinancing my car, maybe in layman’s terms since I’ve never really done this before.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read my post. I hope you have a great day!

personalfinance,Buying &amp; Selling Home (at the same time),"I have a somewhat unique situation. I have made the decision to purchase a family member's home and they are going to purchase ours. Swapping lake life for more property. Some questions...

1) Is it worth hiring a real estate agent to help with the paperwork and getting to close? What do real estate agents do in a situation like ours when the buyers are already lined up and they don't have to fuss with marketing/showings/all the extras? I respect the profession and am not well-versed in buy/sell transactions so I would like a professional on my side and a buffer in between my family member and me so we don't have issues. If we did end up using a real estate agent, do you think an agent might be receptive to do a flat fee to help us value our property and do the paperwork, or potentially a lower commission (if so do you think 1% is reasonable based off $500k worth of transactions)? 

2) This is my first time buying and selling a home at the same time. We have equity in our current home that we want to use as our down payment for the new home (would put is in a range of about 15% down payment). We also want to buy and sell at the same time (or as close as possible) How will that work from a timing and financing perspective? I know one option would be to cash flow a down payment on the new home, it would be a lower amount, and then once my current home closes take the equity and put it down on the new mortgage and have them recast. I'm trying to think through the cost benefit of that, because if I were only able to put 5% down up front wouldn't it be likely that my interest rate would be higher than if I could put the full 15% down? I know other options could be to do some sort of bridge loan or home equity line.

I'll talk to my lender about the details of this but would love to come in as informed as possible before speaking with them. THANK YOU!",finance

Eventually, I think people will see through this and refuse to use the service. But it got me thinking about how third parties will play into the ecosystem in the future. I can see a future where transactions on the blockchain are sponsored by large companies. ""This transaction is brought to you by State Farm"", ""This transaction is brought to you by FedEx"". Etc. It would be similar to how Google ads work. Developers would build wallets that allow sponsors to sign up and pay for transaction in exchange for watching a 5 second ad, or with a Netflix subscription or something. Stake Pools could even sponsor transactions. I think it's a beautiful option that people may utilize. As opposed to locking up their funds forever with a third party.

personalfinance,"Feeling severely behind/disadvantaged, could use some perspective","Hi, PF. First time poster here.

TL;DR: was stupid, oblivious kid in my 20's, made almost zero financial preparations. Now feeling defeated and like I have to catch up on a decade of wealth growth.  :(

I hit a wall a few days ago of just feeling overwhelmed and like I have missed out on a huge, vital chunk of time where most people are building their wealth. I am 32 years old now, but I spent pretty much all of my 20's just messing around, being pretty flippant and honestly rather wasteful with my money. Adding to this is a high likelihood that I have had undiagnosed ADD since I was a small child, so focusing on and dedicating the proper time to budgeting and overall financial management and structure are also a hurdle. Severe depression and anxiety are also additional daily factors, although I am seeking help for those so I can better manage them, and hopefully mitigate their negative effects.

Now, I am realising that where I am at in my 30's is not where I wanted to be. I don't have a degree as I was unable to focus in college and thus didn't do very well. I have been told I am intelligent, but that's also a huge insecurity, often feeling like I'm just being patronized. Managing mental health is exhausting and time consuming. I also haven't held any financially significant jobs, usually making just above minimum wage. Although the place I am at now is a great, fulfilling place to work, it's a *very* small business that I will likely never see six figures from. We will sometimes get quarterly bonuses depending on company performance and it's the *only* employer I have worked at that gives consistent raises.

Lately I have been feeling that some of these things are ""misses"" that have compounded over time. It leaves me feeling pretty ""behind"" when comparing to some of the posts I read here. I was hoping to post my current situation and just get some input and perspective from some other people. I spent about 3 hours last night reading through relevant sections of the PF Wiki, but I think if I can get some real-world experiences or alternative opinions, it could help calm down a bit and set me on a good path. Just feeling like I screwed up or ""missed the boat"" in my twenties and a little uneasy about where that puts me now. Below are some things that I think may be relevant:

My situation:

* no college degree, spent 2 years @ Purdue, failed out; (I think?) I'm an intelligent person, but being susceptible to constant loss of focus and disinterest makes learning and doing things very difficult if I don't already have a vested interest in it. I have loads of retail experience from high school thru college. Finally got a ""real job"" in 2018 with an amazing company who nurtures their employees and are not averse to on-the-job training and paying for Lynda courses if it can help an employee do a better job at the company. However, it's small (about 15 people) and the structure doesn't indicate to me that I will be able to make six figures, no matter how much I climb their ladder. I have never made six figures and have set this as a goal for myself, just haven't set a timeline (5 year, 10 year, etc.)
* undiagnosed ADD (focusing is extremely difficult. I know I can make the changes I need to to put myself in a better financial position, but continuing to do so is usually more exhausting for me than for other people.)
* work @ small business for \~$32k per year, monthly gross \~$2,500; potential for quarterly bonuses averaging \~$1,000.
* employer subsidizes most of my healthcare premium cost. They cover 100% of a base healthcare plan premium. I am generally kind of paranoid about medical expenses, so I opted for a better plan and have an additional \~$60 per month taken to cover the difference; my wife is enrolled in the same health plan, but 100% of that cost is taken from my pay, it is not subsidized, \~$550 monthly just for her.)
* SIMPLE IRA at Vanguard, employer matches 3% pre-tax amount. I am only contributing as much as my employer matches at this time. I have only been eligible for a year, so the current balance is only \~$1,200 right now; Funds are VEIPX and VTWAX, 80/20.
* In 2017 my wife and I bought a home in Portland that was in foreclosure. Don't remember what bank owned it, but they required owner-occupied, which I am convinced is what allowed us to beat out any investors, as Portland has been a hot-spot for real estate investment the past several years. We made instant equity just by purchasing it, before we even started some renovations. The property + structures is now valued $120k higher than the balance on our current mortgage, and will likely only increase, as the neighborhood we bought in hasn't been completely gentrified yet. We are going to be refinancing with a local CU in the next few days to drop PMI, our interest rate, and monthly payment.

Something I am not proud of: loads of debt, mostly CC. Distribution is about 30% from reckless spending, 70% from spending for needs (paycheck didn't last until end of month, home repairs, etc.) I know that's not a good thing to do but I didn't have any other options at the time. Unfortunately, some things happened and I ended up taking a pretty big hit to my credit score, at the worst hitting \~570. I am now back to 640, but I've been stuck between there and 680 for the past three or four years now.

Currently, I have the following debts:

* \~$13,000 in CC debt between three cards. Only one card is maxed out (I know, I know), the other two balances are about 60-70% of the total CL. The total minimum payments for these cards is $350/mo. All three cards are at \~26% interest. Eventually, I am going to probably look at consolidating at least two of these into a personal loan, HELOC, or 0% balance transfer (if available.)
* \~$1,900 left on a personal loan from BestEgg which I used for *even more* CC debt consolidation. This was a $10k loan beginning 11/2017 with a 3 year term @ 9.2% interest. Monthly minimum is \~$325. I had to ""skip"" a few payments so the term is going to end up at like 39 months or something instead of 36.
* \~$5,000 in student loans, typically at 6% interest. Currently paused at 0% interest with no obligation to make monthly payments due to COVID. I have not made a payment on these since they started this program, as the higher interest debt is, to me, more important to pay down sooner. Typical monthly minimum payment is $70.
* \~$225,000 in 30 fixed rate mortgage, 4.5% interest. Wife and I are about to refinance in the next few days to lower our payment, interest, and hopefully kick PMI as well. Current monthly minimum is $1,680. This includes payments to escrow for prop taxes, ins, PMI, etc. I have additional questions about refinancing our house and what to do there, but I think I'll save that for another thread.
* \~$3,000 left on a car loan from a family member (YEAH, I KNOW.) We worked out an agreement and the interest rate established was I think like 2.5% over 36 or 42 months. I have not made any payments towards this balance due to not having the available cash. The family member has been informed every time I cannot make a payment and is very understanding and knows that I will finish out the agreement when I am able. I hate owing money to friends and/or family, so despite the low interest and low balance, I want to get this repaid asap. Unfortunately, other expenses and the higher interest cards are taking priority.

**To be clear,** **I do not pay the mortgage, so this is not an expense for me.** My wife makes more than I do, so we've worked out, for now, that she pays the mortgage, and I pay all utilities (since they equal less than the mortgage costs.) I also pay for our Netflix, Amazon Prime, and other misc expenses that still total less than the mortgage payment. My cost for utilities and other bills totals roughly $550 per month.

Speaking of my wife, she owns her own business and pretty much works exclusively from home at the moment. She will have site measures and client meetings away from home occasionally since COVID, but for the most part uses our 2nd bedroom as her office, as I have been since about March 2020. Her credit score is much better than mine comparatively, being in the low- to mid-700s, and her only debts are: $6,000 on a CC, only because one of our dogs got cancer and we did not have pet insurance to use. Otherwise, her CC balance is typically closer to $500/mo; she also has a car loan that began last year which now has \~$14k balance left to pay. Those two are her only debts.

So, there we go, I guess. I need some advice or just some perspective on this. I feel so defeated when I look at all of this and don't really know where to start. Obviously I will need to make a change in my employment eventually, but it's not as simple as just ""getting another job"". I already plan to aggressively (as much as I can) pay the higher interest debt. I am also looking to evaluate my spending, because I'm positive that I can make cuts of arbitrary expenses here and there. We also do not have kids and do not have any plans to have kids, and have taken appropriate measures to ensure we don't. We have two dogs and those are our children, so I won't need to also eventually start any higher education funds, or other child-related expenses.

All of this said, despite the feelings of defeat and hopelessness, I am extremely motivated to first get debt free, and then explore even more avenues of wealth growth and retention. I am sure everyone wants ""fuck you"" money, but I feel ready to aggressively get my ""slice of the pie"". Thanks in advance for any answers or perspectives. Sorry this is so long, but if you made it that far, I really appreciate you taking your time to read it all.

deeplearning,Input of Generator in a GAN or Conditional GAN,"Hello everyone,

I come from a fluid mechanics background - more specifically Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and I am very curious about the research undergoing on the interface between CFD and Deep Learning. Currently I'm working on a deep convolutional model to generate pictures of velocity profies such as these:

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:**

* The mesh file represents a microscopic perspective of a rock (scientifically a microscopic porous medium). The black pixels are the free regions of which fluid can flow.
* The velocity profile file is taken as: deep blue means flow is slow; red means flow is fast. In this example I'm not taking into consideration the multidimensional nature of the velocity profile, the direction of the flow nor the pressure-velocity coupling. This is still a learning task for me.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fgvcg1u6ipy51.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1a39cb7d543ef1a17f4ad49986840db45ad9d2b

Now I want to train a GAN model to predict a velocity profile regarding a mesh file (which represents the geometry). Most of the tutorials I've found about GANs feed a vector from the latent space into the generator to train it to output a fake image, which is then fed into the discriminator to evaluate if the two images are distinguishable. However I would like to train a GAN model as such:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Inputs mesh data into generator, so it outputs a fake velocity profile;
2. Input fake and real velocity profile images into discriminator, so it outputs a scalar probability that the input is from the real data distribution (cant distinguish between the images).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm using PyTorch to implement the code (link to non-functional notebook [here](https://github.com/heitorvitorc/DL_Project/blob/main/flow_field_cGAN.ipynb)), as it is way simpler to understand than TensorFlow. Everytime i run the model, the generator does not generate anything. Maybe this is due to some error in my code, but I'm also not sure if I got the real concept of GANs. Can I provide an input such as mine for a Generator?

**Can someone share some thoughts on how to approach this situation?**

After a while I started to realize that my goal is to implement a Conditional GAN, as the velocity profile is conditioned by the mesh data (the black pixels in the mesh file represent free paths for the fluid to flow). But I'm 92% sure that I'm moving faster than I can go. Any help is extremely appreciated.

personalfinance,"Deciding about paying off debt or adding to savings? If debt, then which one?","Hey everyone, thanks for taking the time to read this and help me out.

I'm a mid 20s person working towards paying off debts and saving money, too. Currently, I've made my 3 month savings emergency fund. So, after doing that I'm having a hard time deciding where to put my money next.

Take home pay ~$1600 monthly, dependent on how much overtime I can get.

Bills, including my mother's bills as I'm financially covering her, $950-$1000. This includes debt payments listed below.

Debts include: 

Student loans $22000, no monthly payment on IDR plan currently

Credit account 1 - $1100, 16.7% interest rate, monthly suggested payment $82, paying $110.

Credit account 2 - $0 

Mothers car balance - $3600, 5.6% interest rate, monthly payment $200

I'm not sure where to put my money next in terms of saving more or paying off debts. I definitely prioritized a 3 months savings account for emergencies for my or my mother's health or car trouble as mine is older. But now that I've made it I'm lost!

I'm expecting a raise at my job in mid December which will take away my overtime and honestly keep my take home pay around the same as I'm getting now, maybe $100 more, if anything. I'm also not willing to sell the mother's car for one without a payment as it's the only 100% reliable car in the family and she would be unwilling to sell it as well.

I'd prefer to pay off the first credit account as it's so close to being paid off and has the highest interest rate. Then, I'm torn between the car note or the student loans. Paying $400 a month on student loans will take me almost five years to pay down and I want to get started on that asap. But the car debt is a higher interest rate so technically I should jump to that one next. I would also just feel most comfortable with my savings closer to $5000 and don't know if I should just keep working towards that goal for now.

personalfinance,Buying DC Condo,"Hello,

I’m considering buying a condo in the Navy Yard neighborhood of DC, and am wondering if it’s a good financial decision. I already believe it’s a good lifestyle decision, but would like both things to line up.

* 29M, Single, Engineer @ Big Tech
* Income: Low 200s with combo of base salary, bonuses, and RSUs. If career goes as expected over next \~5 years, this will be income floor, with average/ceiling being much higher.
* Assets: $160k investments (primarily retirement accounts), $35k savings account.
* Timeline: I like this area, and am committed to my role/team/company. I have great reasons to believe that my job is stable with a great outlook. Intend to stay for \~5 years.
* Current: Rent 625 sq ft studio with parking/utilities for $2300/month in Arlington.
* Condo: 560k for \~700 sq ft, 1 bed + den unit w/ balcony. Also adding 50k parking. Total of $610k purchase price. New luxury construction.
* Closing Costs: In process of negotiating to $0 with combo of preferred lender and developer credits.
* Loan: $610k purchase price with 5% down for 580k loan amount. Minimum down payment will be 5%, but could stretch that to 10-15% depending on how long construction takes and if it makes financial sense. Preferred lender offering 3.00% interest rate, have not shopped around yet.

Payment Breakdown:

* Principal and Interest: 2443
* PMI: 140
* Tax: 432
* Homeowners Insurance: 33
* Condo Fee: 375
* **Total Monthly: 3425 (21% gross monthly income)**

While I am increasing my housing costs by a significant factor compared to renting, it’s still lower than the recommended 28% of monthly gross income. My only other debt is 750/month for a car loan that has 1.5 years remaining, and I have no upcoming anticipated debt (education, etc). Even with that, I’ll still be able to max out all retirement accounts (pre-tax 401k, after-tax 401k, back door Roth IRA) as well as start increasing contributions to taxable brokerage accounts (goal in medium term is to significantly increase this).

Main Concerns:

* Am I buying before a pandemic-induced housing market crash - aka at inflated prices?
* While I expect to stay here for up to 5 years, my life circumstances could change. Buy vs Rent calculators are giving me lots of varying advice, anywhere from 2 years breakeven (no closing costs, regular appreciation) to 4-5 average. Have no idea how to factor in above concern of housing market dip and how long that could take to recover from, as well as potential future rental market if I decided to rent instead of sell.

Felt like my post was disjointed, but figured I’d post and add detail later. Would appreciate any feedback especially those familiar with the DMV area!",finance

Indeed, [macronleaks](https://wikileaks.org/macron-emails/) make it possible to follow very regular exchanges between the Chartered Accountants of the EM party (Vincent Reynier and Olivier Salustro) and the Statutory Auditors, in particular Jean-Luc Flabeau and his Group: Fideliance (described on his site: Present in Paris and Ile-de-France, with 300 professionals including 26 partners and achieving a turnover of nearly € 33 million, our group is positioned as one of the top 40 French firms).

Also, while ECF has always wanted the merger of the Order of Chartered Accountants (CSOEC) and Commissioners (CAC), that under the last ECF mandate at CSOEC, the financial audit of Small Entities was emerging (NP 2910) how to be surprised that the PACTE Law puts an end so abruptly to the Statutory Auditor. What were the real intentions of the counsel and auditors of En Marche, in contact with now ministers Cédric O and Julien Denormandie.

The auditors on the ground are struck violently by the decisions of President Macron. ECF has a nice game of typing constantly but it is clear that only the interest of its leaders predominates ...

Does Olivier Salustro not mention on [his site](http://www.salustro.fr/olivier-salustro-2/) a course in the service of market operations carried out for:

* international groups engaged in acquisitions, mergers, demergers, ...;
* groups or companies with specific needs during transactions

... far removed from the day-to-day considerations of legal audit professionals serving the economy. The fight waged against Article 9bis, now Article 21 of the PACTE Law, is rather better understood from this angle! All the auditors are not dedicated to “market operations”… Instead of fighting over thresholds and the retention of mandates, most of the action of the Paris CRCC has been focused on the missions of the article 21… forgetting the 20!

investing,Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&amp;P Target. Here's why,"The news that the COVID-19 vaccine from drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) and its partner  BioNTech  (BNTX) is 90% effective, according to  Bernstein Research  strategist  Inigo Fraser Jenkins , has sent stocks scurrying like ""tracks left in a cloud chamber from particles scattering in an accelerator.""

Goldman Sachs strategists, led by  David Kostin , say the vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a Biden presidency. ""The divisive  U.S.  presidential campaign was actually a backdrop to the main event: a public health crisis that has tragically claimed 240,000 lives in the  U.S.  since it began. However, within less than a year, a vaccine has been discovered,"" they say.

The Goldman team boosted its year-end price target on the S&amp;P 500 to 3700 from 3600, which isn't so far away from Tuesday's closing level of 3545.53. Goldman is also targeting 4300 by the end of 2021 and 4600 by the end of 2022.

The strategists expect the Pfizer vaccine, and possibly others, will receive emergency use authorization by the end of January, and sufficient doses will be available for the  U.S.  population during the first half of 2021. They increased earnings estimates, mostly reflecting the better-than-expected results for the third quarter. They also are expecting better growth in the  U.S.  next year than the market does, at 5.3% versus the consensus forecast of 3.8%. A weakening  U.S.  dollar and slack in the labor market should support S&amp;P 500 sales and margins, they add.

They are not too worried about the weight of the technology giants -- Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and  Google  owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The S&amp;P 500 would rise 9% if the FAAMG stocks trade sideways and the remaining 495 stocks rise by the historical median 12-month rise of 12%. And the S&amp;P 500 would rise 16% if the FAAMG stocks rise 5% and the remaining 495 climb 20%, which would represent an 80th percentile move based on historical distribution since 1990.

As for the debate about value or growth, the Goldman team likes both. For value stocks, the team noted that Monday was the largest single-day increase in the factor's history since 1980, while they say growth stocks should continue to benefit from weak trend economic growth and low interest rates.

""When thinking about the potential resolution of today's record valuation dispersion, investors often recall the unwind of the tech bubble, which was characterized by a two-year bear market and large negative absolute returns of the previous market leaders. More often than not, however, value rallies tend to occur in rising markets during which high valuation stocks also rise but are outpaced by the lowest valuation firms. This 'catch up' dynamic is what we expect will take place in coming months as a vaccine is approved and distributed,"" the strategists say.",finance

btc,"As Bitcoin Price Keeps Making Many People Happy, Here's A Good Read About Bitcoin Price for Newbees","**How Does Bitcoin Price Fall and Rise?**  


The price of Bitcoin rises and falls based on supply and demand. It is like publicly sold stocks on the major stock exchanges and reported on the S&amp;P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Averages.  


[Koinal.io](https://www.koinal.io/) offers Bitcoin in ways like buying stocks and bonds. We provide convenient accounts for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and simplify the process through bank debit and credit card purchases.

## Many Price Factors

The stock market as a whole rises and falls on investors’ demand. Just as with stocks, demand directly affects the price of Bitcoin. Demand is the dominant factor, and the widely-accepted influences on demand include news, events, information, political changes, social issues, and overall economic conditions.

### Limited Supply

The amount of Bitcoin that can be mined or produced is limited to an overall cap. The supply of Bitcoin in the marketplace at any time also influences the price. For example, typically, a massive sell-off will depress prices as there may be more items than buyers.

### News and Events

Like traditional markets, Bitcoin prices can respond to news and events. Buyers may be motivated or more guarded by sudden event and impactful news. For example, the emergence of increased regulation can affect the willingness to buy Bitcoin. One should note, there might be a similar impact by the emergence of regulation on the high tech sector; buyers may be more guarded when considering these stocks.

### Market Factors

* Adoption- Major retailers and institutional investors can raise Bitcoin’s price when they agree to participate or accept it. It includes stocks and other stock market type securities like ETFs.
* Supply- Bitcoin has a maximum cap of 21 Million coins. When reached, there will be no more new coins. The fixed supply makes Bitcoin more reliable than currencies that expand rapidly to achieve government goals.
* Small Volume- Bitcoin has a small volume relative to national currencies. Events can have a magnified effect because they impact a smaller volume than stocks, bonds, or other currencies.

## Impact of Coronavirus Pandemic

News and events related to the coronavirus offer good examples of the impact on Bitcoin prices. The pandemic caused severe economic dislocations as economies shut down the gradually reopened. Governments made monetary policy moves to reduce the financial injuries to their business owners and citizens. The result may be the widespread use of economic policies to increase the money supply. The increase in the money supply may weaken the values of fiat currency relative to Bitcoin. The pandemic response may spur buyers to buy and hold Bitcoin rather than cash.

At [u/Koinal](https://www.reddit.com/u/Koinal/), we offer an efficient and convenient method for purchasing Bitcoin and other currencies. Our secure portal uses bank-issued debit cards and credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies. Open an account today and begin or expand your crypto holdings.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Fighting back against the downvoters! Your sub needs YOU,"As I think we are all aware, there are certain individuals and groups who are taking advantage of the fact that we now receive Moons for karma by strategically downvoting other users' posts and comments. A lot of people are fed up with this, but I haven't made this post to complain about the problem. I'm writing this to suggest some solutions and also for you to share yours. But first,

**Why do moon farmers downvote:**

There are a set amount of Moons distributed each month. The number of Moons are divided by the total amount of karma awarded, so moon farmers downvote others because they believe they will get a greater share of the Moons by doing so. The less overall karma given out each month, the more Moons they will get for their upvotes. It's a strategy which is all about **taking** as much as they can from the community, and **not giving anything back**. They are happy to receive upvotes for their comments and posts, but do not upvote anyone else's comments and posts. Worse than that, they downvote helpful posts and comments that people have spent a lot of time and effort making. They will downvote comments in posts so that *their* comment will be seen higher up. They will downvote a post so that it drops to the bottom of the sub and doesn't become visible on the front page. This discourages some users from creating quality content. Here is an example of a [high quality post which was downvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jruqk2/i_bought_1k_of_the_top_10_cryptos_on_january_1st/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) made by u/Joe-M-4, which ended up not being seen as a result of the downvoters getting to it before most people got a chance to see it.

**Fighting back**

So we know what the problem is. But what about the solutions? It may not fix everything, but I'd like to share a couple of things that I've started doing to counteract the downvoters, and I'd like to encourage each one of you to do the same, because together we will make a difference:

**1. Sort posts by 'New' instead of 'Best' or 'Top'.**

Why do this? Well, the reason some posts are being downvoted is to make them not visible to the rest of the sub who sort posts by the most popular. When you sort by new, you will see a more accurate reflection of what is being posted here and by **upvoting posts which you like** other people will be more likely to see them too. Don't be passive. Hit the upvote if you like a post.

**2. For every unjustly downvoted comment I see, I make a conscious effort to upvote at least 5 worthy comments.**

If every time they downvote, we all make a conscious effort to upvote worthy comments and posts (and there are plenty of them to be found) the downvoters' actions will actually have an *opposite* effect to what they intended. For every downvote they give, we will give 5 upvotes. Now **I'm not talking about giving out upvotes randomly**. Randomly upvoting every post is not much more helpful than randomly downvoting every post. Just use your upvote for what it's intended for: **a vote, giving you the power to reward the type of content you want to see more of.** The only way of counteracting downvoters is by taking positive action. That means not being passive and allowing good posts and comments go unnoticed. Use your votes to encourage the kind of content you want to see.

Personally, I upvote any helpful, informative comments, any post or comment I comment on, and anyone who engages in one of my posts or comments (unless they're being really rude, lol). 

Anyway, I'm not trying to tell people what to do, just trying to encourage every user to contribute to making this sub as valuable as it can possibly be. Thanks to Moons your upvote might buy someone a coffee, or even dinner! Hitting someone with an upvote might help to bring a smile to their face after a hard day. Love conquers hate. Positivity and generosity are contagious. Together we can beat the downvoters. Your votes matter. Make them count.

**Update:** Joe's post went from 0 karma when I posted this, to +40 in just 2 hours. This is an example of the kind of positive difference we can make when we come together.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"Cashless society is coming, here is why explained by the IMF (International Monetary Fund)","Cashing In: How to Make Negative Interest Rates Work


Many central banks reduced policy interest rates to zero during the global financial crisis to boost growth. Ten years later, interest rates remain low in most countries. While the global economy has been recovering, future downturns are inevitable. Severe recessions have historically required 3–6 percentage points cut in policy rates. If another crisis happens, few countries would have that kind of room for monetary policy to respond.

To get around this problem, a recent IMF staff study shows how central banks can set up a system that would make deeply negative interest rates a feasible option.


How low can you go?

In a cashless world, there would be no lower bound on interest rates. A central bank could reduce the policy rate from, say, 2 percent to minus 4 percent to counter a severe recession. The interest rate cut would transmit to bank deposits, loans, and bonds. Without cash, depositors would have to pay the negative interest rate to keep their money with the bank, making consumption and investment more attractive. This would jolt lending, boost demand, and stimulate the economy.

When cash is available, however, cutting rates significantly into negative territory becomes impossible. Cash has the same purchasing power as bank deposits, but at zero nominal interest. Moreover, it can be obtained in unlimited quantities in exchange for bank money. Therefore, instead of paying negative interest, one can simply hold cash at zero interest. Cash is a free option on zero interest, and acts as an interest rate floor.

Because of this floor, central banks have resorted to unconventional monetary policy measures. The euro area, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, and other economies have allowed interest rates to go slightly below zero, which has been possible because taking out cash in large quantities is inconvenient and costly (for example, storage and insurance fees). These policies have helped boost demand, but they cannot fully make up for lost policy space when interest rates are very low.

Breaking through zero

One option to break through the zero lower bound would be to phase out cash. But that is not straightforward. Cash continues to play a significant role in payments in many countries. To get around this problem, in a recent IMF staff study and previous research, we examine a proposal for central banks to make cash as costly as bank deposits with negative interest rates, thereby making deeply negative interest rates feasible while preserving the role of cash.


The proposal is for a central bank to divide the monetary base into two separate local currencies—cash and electronic money (e-money). E-money would be issued only electronically and would pay the policy rate of interest, and cash would have an exchange rate—the conversion rate—against e-money. This conversion rate is key to the proposal. When setting a negative interest rate on e-money, the central bank would let the conversion rate of cash in terms of e-money depreciate at the same rate as the negative interest rate on e-money. The value of cash would thereby fall in terms of e-money.

To illustrate, suppose your bank announced a negative 3 percent interest rate on your bank deposit of 100 dollars today. Suppose also that the central bank announced that cash-dollars would now become a separate currency that would depreciate against e-dollars by 3 percent per year. The conversion rate of cash-dollars into e-dollars would hence change from 1 to 0.97 over the year. After a year, there would be 97 e-dollars left in your bank account. If you instead took out 100 cash-dollars today and kept it safe at home for a year, exchanging it into e-money after that year would also yield 97 e-dollars.

At the same time, shops would start advertising prices in e-money and cash separately, just as shops in some small open economies already advertise prices both in domestic and in bordering foreign currencies. Cash would thereby be losing value both in terms of goods and in terms of e-money, and there would be no benefit to holding cash relative to bank deposits.

This dual local currency system would allow the central bank to implement as negative an interest rate as necessary for countering a recession, without triggering any large-scale substitutions into cash.

Pros and cons

While a dual currency system challenges our preconceptions about money, countries could implement the idea with relatively small changes to central bank operating frameworks. In comparison to alternative proposals, it would have the advantage of completely freeing monetary policy from the zero lower bound. Its introduction would reconfirm the central bank’s commitment to the inflation target, rather than raise doubts about it.

Still, implementing such a system is not without challenges. It would require important modifications of the financial and legal system. In particular, fundamental questions pertaining to monetary law would have to be addressed and consistency with the IMF’s legal framework would need to be ensured. Also, it would require an enormous communication effort.

The pros and cons of the system are country specific and should be carefully compared to other proposals, such as higher inflation targets, for increasing monetary policy space in a low-interest environment. We consider these issues, and more, in our research.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Dealing with conventional banking makes me extremely bullish on cryptocurrency.,"I am currently in the process of selling some stock on Vanguard to try to take advantage of the current bull run. Here is the timeline and effort involved in that process.

- Sell stock, wait 2-3 business days for funds to settle into federal money market account.
- Add new bank account details, wait 2-3 business days for microtransactions to go through to verify account.
- After confirming microtransactions Vanguard requires an additional 7 days to ""verify bank info"". I'm completely clueless as to why, considering they were just able to successfully deposit money into my account for the microtransactions.

- Buy crypto on exchange INSTANT (arguably it does take a bit to transact on the blockchain)

CryptoCurrency,The Actual Letter Politicians Sent OCC Brooks,"I've now seen three articles posted with lines about ""blasting Brooks!!!!!""

The devil is in the details and we should want to know all about the laws and regulations being put into place)

So I'd love to hear thoughts on the below questions. 


Dear Acting-Comptroller Brooks,

We write to raise concerns regarding the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (“OCC”) recent unilateral actions in the digital activities space. In just the past few months, the OCC has released interpretive letters on cryptocurrency custody and stablecoins and announced plans to start offering special purpose ‘payments’ charters. Given the limited statutory authority of the 1OCC, we urge the Comptroller to seriously reconsider the implications of a unilateral approach and instead invite the OCC to collaborate with other regulators and Congress on these issues.

The OCC’s recent Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on digital activities highlighted that up to 8% of Americans currently use crypto-related financial services and that this is a growing trend for millennials. While responding to this growth is important, it’s also important to understand the context in which this is taking place. According to the most recent FDIC survey conducted in 2017, 6.5% of Americans are unbanked and 18.7% of Americans are underbanked.[1] Further, during and after the height of the financial crisis between 2008 and 2018, 18 African American-owned banks, 18 Hispanic American-owned banks, 26 Asian American-owned banks, 3 Native American-owned banks and one multi-cultural bank have closed or merged with other banks. These 66 minority bank closures represent 30% of all minority banks[2].

We believe there is an imminent danger that, while seeking to serve those ‘already-banked’ with better payments options, we may be overlooking opportunities for assisting the unbanked and underbanked to participate in the economy and the banking system.Small and minority-owned financial institutions continue to face a deposit crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic has only exacerbated this problem. For some of these banks, the ability to hold crypto-asset deposits could create beneficial outcomes. Further, the movement toward digital banking activities has the potential to increase access to banking services. However, these 
potential gains stand to be lost, and significant consumer harm to be caused, if these new activities aren’t properly regulated. It is in the best interest of both banks and consumers for our regulators to collaborate and move forward responsibly.

We also question whether this is an appropriate priority for the OCC in the midst of this pandemic. Arguably, the immediate needs of millions of at-risk individuals who have not yet received an economic stimulus check and/or cannot deposit their funds in a bank, deserve greater attention than an effort to increase access to financial services to the “banked community” via mobile phones. Our concern regarding the OCC’s excessive focus on crypto assets and crypto-related financial services is shared by the American Bankers Association and other trade groups who have expressed similar reservations that such services move too far away from the core business of banking.

The OCC plays an important role in providing stable forms of currency. However, the decisions of your agency have the potential to adversely affect banking and financial activities well beyond your jurisdiction. In particular, decisions regarding the classification and regulation of “crypto 
assets” and crypto-related payments services may have secondary effects on the entire hierarchy of financial assets denominated in U.S. dollars, as well as the more traditional means by which retail and wholesale payments are made in the United States and abroad.

Whether issuing a charter or interpreting guidance, the decisions you are making will have broad implications for the future of banking. As such, these decisions are best made in collaboration with your fellow regulators and with Congress to ensure we avoid potential harms to institutional safety and soundness and equity and inclusion. To better understand OCC’s continuing efforts on this issue, we respectfully request that you provide answers to the following questions by December 10th, 2020:

• With the permission granted to banks to now use bank deposits as reserves against stablecoins, will these reserves be segregated from calculating the capital requirements of 
banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo or will they be able to lend against these deposits?

• What consumer protections will the OCC impose on the stablecoin providers themselves?

• Considering a stablecoin issuer will likely be willing to move large amounts of reserves between different banks, will stablecoin reserves be treated as brokered deposits, subject to applicable restrictions on banks accepting them?

• Considering mass redemptions of a stablecoin backed by reserve accounts would result in a mass withdraw of those reserves, what measures will banks and FSAs have to take to ensure that a “run” on a stablecoin does not result, in effect, in a run on deposits.

• If stablecoins are increased as a result of your interpretive letter, will this increase the Digital Divide or negatively impact your Project Reach? Do other agencies and 
considerations factor into your decision in terms of internet access to stablecoins?

• How do you plan to protect the notion of the dollar itself, in that this will be private money used for payments digitally, and therefore subject to potential losses should the 
stablecoin provider go out of business? Is it the bank’s, the stablecoin provider’s, or the OCC’s responsibility to ensure that enough deposits are held at these institutions to 
protect the consumer?

• To what extent have you collaborated with your fellow regulators on your decisions? What implications for regulation outside of your sole-jurisdiction do you anticipate as a result of your interpretive letter?

• Since the Federal Reserve Bank has strategically used its control of the money supply in times of stress to address inflation, what is the OCC’s assessment of the likely impact of diluting the FRB’s authority and effectively transferring the control of our money supply to stablecoin providers?

Bitcoin,New World Crypto Order,"Hello, I would like to share with you my idea about the future World and it's also a reaction to a recent article about taxes for people working from home office ([https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54876526](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54876526)).

We are living in a digital age, it's unquestionable... A lot of things around us is connected with the internet, and more and more things will be connected to the internet in the future. People who understand how the internet works (I mean things like interconnection among ISPs, companies, data centers... BGP and so) and also computers/servers, OSes running on them, etc., are often also cryptocurrency-aware, and therefore they often hold some.

Now we are living also in the age where banks, large corporations, lawyers, politics, etc., are ""holding our balls"" and they rule us, letting us, ordinary people, almost nothing to change. But what if (we) IT people can change it now or in the near future? What can happen when more and more people will buy cryptocurrencies and it will quickly turn to a mass madness and all banks will go bankrupt terribly due to rapid money withdrawals? Then the value of cryptocurrencies will rocket much much higher and fiat currencies will fall so it will be nearly priceless... Then people from IT (and of course not only them) will get rich and guess what... They will start quitting their jobs at corporations, federal services, and so on. Then the World will have a lack of IT people, the internet and all the dependant services will start failing more and more, until the new IT generation won't rise, which will take some years. Therefore also the price of all the IT services will increase and it will shuffle the cards.

Of course, for many people, this is the worst scenario and they will have to stop it. But cryptocurrencies seem to be unstoppable and people, as I believe, need them for their overall progress. Also, I don't think that all the people from the financial or (large) corporate sphere will want to miss their train, and they will buy cryptocurrencies as well or they will try to destroy it somehow... but only If they will hurry up.

In any case, we will see who holds whose balls, and it will probably happen during our lives.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Palantir Reports Revenue Growth of 52% in the Third Quarter, Raises Full-Year 2020 Guidance","*New Contracts with U.S. Army and National Institutes of Health;*

*$300 Million Renewal with Aerospace Customer Announced*

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) reported its financial results today for the third quarter of 2020.

**Summary**

* $289.4 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 52% year-over-year
* Full-year 2020 revenue guidance raised to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, up 44% year-over-year
* New contracts in third quarter include U.S. Army ($91 million), National Institutes of Health ($36 million), and $300 million renewal with aerospace customer

Here are the financial statements: [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/HYCzVWZ)

**Management Commentary**

*Overview*

Our growth and momentum across the business have continued.

We generated $289.4 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2020, representing an increase of 52% from the third quarter of 2019, when we generated $190.5 million in revenue.

The demand for our software has increased steadily over the past year in the face of significant economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the United States and abroad.

We are increasing our guidance for our full-year revenue in 2020 to a range of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion, which would represent a growth rate of 44% over the prior year, when we generated $743 million in revenue.

*Financial Results*

Our operating results have continued to show significant improvement.

In the third quarter of 2020, we generated revenue of $289.4 million, up 52% year-over-year, which is approximately $9 million above the high end of our prior guidance range.

We incurred a loss from operations of $847.8 million, which includes $847.0 million in stock-based compensation following our recent direct listing.

Our income from operations was $73.1 million when adjusting for $847.0 million in stock-based compensation, $20.2 million in related employer payroll taxes, and $53.7 million in expenses related to the listing.

The demand for our software from customers in both the commercial and government sectors has continued to increase this year.

In the three months ended September 30, 2020, we closed fifteen deals with new and existing customers, each worth $5 million or more in total contract value, including contracts with the U.S. Army and National Institutes of Health, as well as a contract renewal with one of the world’s largest aerospace companies worth $300 million in total contract value over five years.

The average revenue generated per customer through the first nine months of 2020 was $5.8 million, up from $4.2 million per customer, or 38%, from the same period the year before.

Our customer concentration is decreasing. In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, revenue from our top twenty customers constituted 61% of our total revenue for the period, down from 68% in the first nine months of 2019.

We continue to have significant cash reserves. As of September 30, 2020, we had a total of cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion.

*Government*

The U.S. government sector remains a primary area of focus for our business.

Our work with healthcare organizations across the federal government has accelerated this year, and we continue to expand our reach with the nation’s defense and intelligence agencies, including the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.

In September 2020, we were selected among 999 bids for a two-year, $91 million contract with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory to provide artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities for military planning and defense operations.

Our work with partners across the U.S. federal government in responding to the coronavirus pandemic has increased significantly in recent months.

We were selected in September 2020 by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), a federal research organization based in Bethesda, Maryland, and operating under the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), for a $36 million contract to provide our software to the agency for cancer and coronavirus research.

Our software is now being used for coronavirus response and research efforts by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a program run under the NIH that maintains the largest clinical data asset in the world regarding the development of the coronavirus. As part of the research effort, our software was used to integrate clinical data from more than one million patients in the United States in a matter of weeks.

The company’s efforts to assist foreign governments in their response to the coronavirus continues in countries around the world.

In the United Kingdom, for example, our software has been used by the National Health Service to allocate and distribute more than 2.7 billion items of personal protective equipment across the country.

*Commercial*

We are continuing to see significant momentum in our business across the commercial sector this year, both in the United States and abroad.

In September 2020, we closed a five-year contract renewal with a customer in the aerospace industry that is worth $300 million in total contract value, representing our largest ever contract in the commercial sector.

The lead time for customers to begin using our software has fallen sharply this year, and organizations continue to expand access to our platforms to users across their operations.

An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks of starting to use our platform.

The energy company identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities using our software, and the company’s management is currently targeting $1 billion in total savings in the coming year through the use of our platform.

Our software has also been used widely by customers across industries, including the automotive, manufacturing, aviation, healthcare, and banking sectors, to adjust their operations in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

A major consumer goods company in the United States recently turned to Palantir after an investment of more than one hundred million dollars in another enterprise software platform failed to produce results.

The customer began using our software within days to help address disruptions to its supply chain as a result of the pandemic. The company has since expanded its use of the platform to identify cost savings in raw material purchases across its business.

*International Expansion*

Our expansion in a number of markets abroad continues, including in Japan.

In June 2020, we selected Sompo Holdings, Inc., the Tokyo-based insurance company and Japan’s leading nursing care provider, as our strategic partner. The company is currently one of our most significant shareholders, following its approximately $500 million investment in Palantir this year.

“Sompo’s work is vital to Japan’s welfare and security, and Kengo Sakurada, the company’s group chief executive officer, has been a critical and trusted partner as we work with Sompo to expand our reach in Asia,” said Alexander C. Karp, co-founder and chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies Inc.

We believe that our market opportunity in Japan and the broader region will be significant over the long term.

Our expansion in Asia builds on our already significant presence outside North America, including in Europe, the Middle East, and increasingly South America.

*Financial Outlook*

We are increasing our revenue guidance for this year and now expect the business to generate a total of $1.070 billion to $1.072 billion in annual revenue in 2020, up 44% year-over-year.

Our annual adjusted operating income in 2020 is expected to be $130 million to $136 million, which excludes stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to our direct listing.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect revenue of $299 million to $301 million, up 30% to 31% from last year, when we generated $229 million in revenue.

Our adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2020 is expected to be $44 million to $50 million, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes.

We continue to expect that year-over-year revenue growth in 2021 will be greater than 30%.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

This press release and the accompanying tables contain the non-GAAP financial measure income (loss) from operations, excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to the direct listing.

We believe this non-GAAP financial measure helps us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting Palantir’s business, formulate business plans and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, from this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe that excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. Additionally, we exclude expenses primarily related to the direct listing, as they are a one-time nonrecurring charge and employer payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of the control of the Company. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish this or similar metrics. Further, this metric has certain limitations, as it does not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measure income (loss) from operations, excluding stock-based compensation, related employer payroll taxes, and expenses primarily related to the direct listing should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

A reconciliation table of the most comparable GAAP financial measure to the non-GAAP financial measure used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release. A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items that may be incurred in the future such as stock-based compensation, and related employer payroll taxes, the effect of which may be significant.",finance

personalfinance,Buying a house/condo to diversify investment portfolio?,"Hi Reddit - first thank you for your time reading this.

I'm a single 30 year old guy living in a HCOL city thinking about buying a 2-3br condo in the $800K - $900K range, but not sure if it makes sense?

For context on my situation: I make $200K / year gross salary, have no debts, \~$100K in pre-tax retirement savings, and $450K in cash / post-tax brokerage accounts. I have a very high credit score and should theoretically qualify for the lowest mortgage interest rates. I currently rent my 1br apartment for $2200/month. My non-rent monthly expenses are around \~$2000, so I save about $5-6K/month, most of it going to index funds.

Part of this decision is to diversify some of my savings/investments. Nearly all of my savings/investments are in index funds right now and I think it could make sense to diversify some it into real estate (but I would live in it as oppose to renting it out). I live in an area where housing prices have been appreciating 10-15% YoY, so there is potential upside in this investment that is diversified from stock market movements.

The all-in monthly payments for an $800-$900K condo would be \~$4200/month - so substantially higher than my current $2200/month apartment; however since I'm building equity, I see it as similar to just allocating some of my savings to real estate vs. stocks/bonds. It would be an added benefit that I would also be able to live in a larger place while investing in it. Due to where my career is at, it's very likely I'll be able to live in the condo for the next 5-10 years (possibly even longer).

Some of you reading this may wonder why I don't just aim for a lower priced condo - it's actually difficult to find a decent property &lt;$800K where I live. They do exist, but they are usually in a condition or area that will make it difficult to resell later down the road. Most 1br apartments are rentals; condos that you buy are usually 2-3 br.

I don't have any life-events driving a house/condo purchase. I can be just as happy renting my 1br apartment and squirreling all my savings into index funds for the foreseeable future; however, I'm just not sure if I'm too heavily weighted on stock market investments and should look to do something else with my money?",finance
personalfinance,Why does FedLoan say that my student loan amount is less than the actual amount I borrowed?,"Alright, so I know this is a bit of an odd question, but bear with me for a moment.

I took out a subsidized federal loan for the 2019-2020 school year that was worth $5,500.

I graduated in Spring 2020 and immediately enrolled in grad school for Summer 2020, meaning the loan has not accrued any interest and I’ve never had to make a payment.

For some reason, the loan is now showing up online as $4,691, or $809 less than the original amount. Even Credit Karma lists $4,691 as the “Highest Amount” that this loan has never been. But that’s not accurate! My school’s portal says I took a loan out for $5,500, and I use YNAB religiously, so I’m positive that the money that was leftover from paying tuition went straight into my checking account.

Is there anything that could cause this? I’m seriously at a loss here. I realize this is not a bad problem to have, because the loan is less than the original amount I borrowed, but I’m still utterly perplexed.

If anyone can point out something obvious I’m missing, I’d greatly appreciate it.",finance

personalfinance,"Should I Pay Off $14,000 Debt with Savings?","Hi Everyone--

I hear a lot of different advice about the best way to pay off debt. I currently have $10,000 left on my car loan with a 3.65% interest rate. Payments are $270 a month for the next 4 years, I have been paying $500/month in the last few months.

I also owe money to a family member ($8000, no interest, I have currently paid off half). I have been making $1000 payments each month.

I have also been saving $1,000 each month in a savings account, and my emergency fund is currently $14,500. I have $2000 in a RothIRA and about $3500 in my checking account.

I'm moving out so I will probably have around $1000 (maybe an extra $500 if my tutoring jobs continue) to save each month or to throw at the debt. I hate having this debt over me, even if it can be paid off relatively fast (within the year). Is it a bad idea to throw my emergency fund at the debt? I would have $3500 in checking and $4500 in my RothIRA that I could access in a huge emergency. I don't imagine there being one because I have a pretty stable job.

I hate putting all my money towards payments, and think I would have a lot more satisfaction putting that money into savings",finance

Origination/appraisal/attorney fees etc. are comparable when summed up fairly (not including estimates, etc).

Ironically, getting multiple mortgage quotes dropped my credit score below 760, so my best PMI quote went from $30/mo to $50/mo.

I was planning on getting a couple roommates; cheapest rooms on AirBNB in my area are $750/mo, so I was going to aim renting out the other two bedrooms for that. 

I’m not planning on paying extra off until I can lump sum to the 20% threshold without using the 50k out of my 70k currently growing in a brokerage account.

personalfinance,Quick question on a 401K loan for high interest debt consolidation.,"Hello. Really quick question. An old friend of mine works as a financial...something, I don’t know his title. Today I brought up the idea of taking out a short, 2-3 year 401K loan to pay off some high interest credit cards I have closed that I am paying down and save myself money in interest possibly. I asked his general thoughts, and perhaps in contrast to the group here, he said that it’s a risk/reward based on expected market growth/loss versus the interest rate on the credit cards. TLDR: His off the cuff advice is that if my expected growth per year is less than the APR on the cards, that I should consider doing it. However, I do run the risk of losing out long term if the market performs better.  

That said, I’m just confused on one thing (and I apologize, this isn’t my strong suit). Using hypothetical numbers, let’s say the credit cards are at 15% APR. If I take out a 401k, the interest rate is 5.25, which I hnderstand I am ‘paying to myself’ since it’s not invested in the market. Where does this 5.25% factor into the equation? Should I subtract 5.25 from the credit card APR, subtract it from expected market growth? Do nothing with it?  

I’m not good at all when it comes to this stuff. =X  

Quick edit: I’m fairly sure this is not something I’m going to do, as if I did my math right earlier, I would save myself a couple hundred each month, but unless the market runs low for 2.5 years, long term I will be better off if I just stay the course as I am.

stocks,Why are short term gains taxes looked down upon so heavily relative to long term?,"I would think that the vast majority of those investing in stocks are below the 20% long terms capital gains tax bracket (over $434k/yr single)and above the 0% threshold and I'd also argue that the vast majority are below the 32% federal income tax bracket (over $163k/yr single). 

So why are so many so opposed to what is essentially a maximum difference of 9% between the long-term and short term capital gains tax? Why is there an insistence to hold onto positions for longer periods, putting yourself at risk for loss, just to save 9% in taxes, which in some  cases can be recovered with gains in a single day?

Can someone clear this up for me, as currently the numbers for me just don't make a ton of sense.

My wife and I are in two very strong careers (Software Dev and NP) and are considering paying off her student loans over the next year OR investing the money. I've been able to refinance her loans twice (both times pulling down a substantial bonus to the tune of $800 or so) AND gotten her student loans down to about 1/3rd of what she started at within a 5 year span.

Her interest rate is at 4.5% right now. After doing more research I found a 3.55% interest rate for the remaining 3rd over 5 years. I *think* my preference is to get to a point where I'm maxing out 401k and IRA contributions over the next few years instead of paying it off as soon as possible.

energy,Why Renewable Energy Cannot Stop Climate Change,"**4 billion people now live at least one month per year with severe water shortages.**

Yanks pump up fresh drinking water, poison it, pump it back underground to frack gas to burn for electricity, to charge their EV batteries... in a mega drought; and because of this Yanks cut emissions more switching to gas than Europe did switching to renewables, if you ignore all the leaky wells.

66% of people will live in water stressed areas by 2025.

50% of thermal and hydro electric power will be threatened with water stress,

40% of coal mines are water stressed and so are 30% of planned hydro dams

Out of 1.2 billion vehicles, under 6 million are electric

Electricity is 20% of energy, renewable electricity is 4%, solar &amp; wind are 2% of energy

**2% of energy is solar and wind + 4% of energy is renewable**

Planetary heating went up 46% in 50 years from 0.47 watts/m² to 0.87 watts/m²

350 ppm CO2 will not stop planetary heating

We must stop burning 50% of fossil fuel in 10 years to stay below 1.5 C

Our attempts to not cross 1.5 C are ineffectual and will kill everything off, here's why

Battery and bio-energy extraction will destroy tribal water and wildlife

40% of insect species are at risk of extinction by 2050

Real climate racial justice = monthly private carbon dividends ( see below )

Greenhouse gases went up 45% in 30 years + 15% of energy will be renewable by 2040

Renewable energy cannot reduce heating in time to avoid 1.5 C

**4% of energy is renewable + 4% of mammals are wild**

We kill trees 2X faster than we plant them

Trees grow faster but die younger in fires floods &amp; droughts

It takes one ton of coal to make 12 solar panels

Most solar panels will become unrecyclable toxic waste by 2050 at 6 million tons / yr

**Vaclav Smil says:**

* North Euro offshore wind turbines work 33% of the time
* North Euro onshore turbines work 22% of the time
* North Euro solar panels work 11% of the time
* Over 60 yrs jets 68% more efficient and fly 60X more passengers

**Green Energy in Europe is Fraud**

Europe burns 80% of the globe's wood pellets for renewable electricity

Europe burns 80% of its curbside recycled plastic &amp; paper for recycled electricity

Europe burns 50% of its palm oil cargo in diesel engines for green bio-energy

Dams destroy 80% of river wildlife and habitat up and down the rivers

Europe's global carbon fund is rife with corruption

Support James Hansen's monthly private carbon dividends

**100% to you + 0% to governments &amp; corporations**

26 Nobel Prize winning economists support James Hansen’s monthly dividends, including: 3,589 U.S. Economists, 4 Former Chairs of the Federal Reserve and ALL 15 Former Chairs of the Council of Economic Adviser

The reason you never hear of monthly private carbon dividends is because governments and corporations want that money. There is no magic bullet for climate change. We musst change everything globally at once. The reason I repeat the same message over and over is because that's what the other side does, but I'm just one old man. If you want to help, spread the word. It may very well be too late to save our home, but it's never too late to do the right thing.

personalfinance,Debt Pay off Strategy,"\*Disclaimer: I will not respond to any inquiries other than comments due to fear of scam. I am not looking to pay for professional financial management, just looking for any advice, thanks!\*

So I am a fan of Dave Ramsey and have worked on snowballing some of my debt recently, but would like advice on how to best handle my remaining debts. Recently married and my husband and I together have about $75K in federal student loan debt with an average interest rate of 5.5%. Our combined income is about $97K, and my husband gets incremental increases of 2-3K every year. Up until recently, I was paying out of pocket to put myself through grad school and am now graduating in December. By no longer paying tuition, I was able to quickly knock out my car loan and private loan that was used for school. My husband is a medical resident that will likely need to do a fellowship, so a doctor's salary is still 5-6 years away. We do not own a home, and have no plans to in the near future as we will likely be moving around a lot in the coming years depending on where he matches. We are planning to start a family in the next year, and will likely need to replace one or both of our cars in the next 3-5 years as they are both getting to be high mileage (but no plans to do so until absolutely necessary).

So here is where my question comes in. We have a modest savings of about $13K which definitely needs major padding before we decide to get pregnant. My husband and I have both been paying the minimum on our student loans while we attended to our other debts. He is happy to continue to pay minimum on his until he is out of fellowship and then plans to aggressively pay it off in a few years/enroll in a debt relief program that pays a portion based on public service. I am tempted to throw more money at mine now ($31K) that I have more expendable income without paying tuition or other debts. My question is, should I aggressively attack mine, or focus more on padding our savings account, or more of an even split between the two? To be clear, we both pay our minimums out of our shared account, but I occasionally throw extra money from my checking account towards my loans.",finance

stocks,Disney stock| Palantir stock| Stock market news [11-13-2020],"Disney lost money for the first time this year, will this continue? Palantir missed on expectations but does it have a bright future? Let’s talk about it and some other stock market news

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with a recap of yesterday as we saw the hole stock market down with the Nasdaq dropping 0,6% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/1G8yCVK) , while the SP500 finished 1% down for the day but it’s still up for the week [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/r2C3qmb) as well as the Dow Jones which was also down more than 1% but its still up for the week [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/NykFwFg). The volatility index did see a small raise yesterday, but it’s still almost at the lowest point since the pandemic has started so I see this finally going down to pre-pandemic levels mid-late next year [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/rH0kWxc). Pretty much all of the stock market was down yesterday as you can see in both the SP500 heat map [CHART](https://ibb.co/fYwprWZ) as well as the world heat map  [CHART](https://ibb.co/GVbPz88) with only small gains among a few companies, maybe the market has finally came around after the recent positive events like the Pfizer vaccine news and the positive US election results for the stock market and looked more closely to see that there is still a long period probably 3-6months at least of this pandemic affecting the economy as the US has seen a huge spike in cases in the last period with new daily cases and the 7-day average going almost parabolic [DAILY CASES](https://ibb.co/Z89p5KC), while the deaths have not seen a spike yet do to the better treatments available, this is expected to go up in the next weeks and months as the health care system will likely be to overcrowded. One other bad thing is that the positivity rate has also gone up from 4 to 5%in October to over 10% in the last days [POSITIVTY RATE](https://ibb.co/8rvLbsq). This is not just a US problem but a whole world problem as this has been going on around the world. [WORLD CASES](https://ibb.co/7j5TMqb)

So going back to the stock market yesterday we saw almost 3 quarters of companies declining as most of them are trading above the moving averages for 50 and 200 days  [CHART](https://ibb.co/y6099vP) while almost all sectors were dropping with the energy sector being the most punished with 2 thirds of the companies losing more than 2% [CHART](https://ibb.co/mN0My8g). The only companies with a little traction yesterday were growth and momentum stocks with large caps holding tight to hold the market as steady as possible.[CHART](https://ibb.co/Rg1yZfH)

Today we will see some economic data as producer prices for October are due as well as a preliminary consumer sentiment for November while the G-20 will also have a virtual meeting to discuss the debt burdens of the pandemic. Also, we will see some FED news coming in the early morning. Some good news would be welcomed as recent restrictions in Chicago and other places have seen the stock markets cool down. [FRIDAY EVENTS](https://ibb.co/k9tCTQJ)

Yesterday we saw the jobless claims number as it was way better than expected with just above 700 thousand claims almost 30 thousand better then expected and almost 50 thousand less than the previous number as well as a drop in continuing claims to under 7 million which was also better than expected. [JOBLESS NUMBERS](https://ibb.co/0Bp2Qyf)

Guys some IPO’s that have been delayed will probably finally launch as Companies like DoorDash and Airbnb are expected to finally arrive to the stock market [IPO's](https://ibb.co/HPH4M7V). I really like Airbnb an we could have it up for grabs at a discounted rate in this pandemic context. While InstaCart has seen a rise in valuation after the positive California vote for independent contractors. [INSTACART](https://ibb.co/58gNjQQ)

Also, one interesting earnings report for me today will be DraftKings as the are expected to lose around 63cents per share, if they improve on this the company will see a boost probably as the legalization of gambling in the US is evolving continually. [DRAFTKINGS](https://ibb.co/72Y5YnP)

While writing this post the earnings have already comed out [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/yfT14wR)

So, Disney released earnings yesterday and they beat expectations as the overall revenue declined 23% better than more than 26% that the analysts were estimating. They also beat expectations for earnings as the EPS was way better then expected [DISNEY EPS](https://ibb.co/QdMBP06). While the companies free cash flow more than doubled to over 900million$ [FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/zNRcCXd) . Disney+ also has over 73 million subscribers far better than then 65million that the analysts expected while also ESPN+ subscribers outperformed by 1 million the expectations. This were very good numbers for the company but they do have to maintain this as the one-year trial for millions of Verizon customers for Disney+ expired Thursday. We will have to see what the retention rate is. [DISNEY+](https://ibb.co/W2TqF4W)

The other company that I was interested to see what they announce was Palantir as they missed EPS expectations by 77 cents but beat on revenue while also increasing guidance for the fiscal year [PALANTIR EPS](https://ibb.co/v448sMy) . The company added new contracts with the US army and the National Institutes of Health as well as renewing contract with an aerospace customer worth over 400 million combined. Though after excluding stock-based compensations and other IPO costs they had an adjusted operating income of over 70million$ which is great for the company as those were one-time costs that hugely impacted the earnings result.

MachineLearning,[P] Chasing intruding cats from your home with machine leraning,"*So I got this friend who built a machine to chase away intruding cats from his home. He's not on Reddit but I suggested to post it for him to see what people who know this stuff had to say about it.*

*Here's his story:*

When I got home from work my house was a mess. A plant from the windowsill was on the floor, the cats' drinking bowl was upside down, it reeked of cat pee, and our own two cats seemed very stressed. We found out why next Sunday morning when we were rudely awakened by screeching noises and I found a huge red cat in the hallway: A neighborhood cat came into our house.

It did not take long after placing a webcam in the kitchen until I caught it on tape: Here you can see how the red cat enters our house, eats our food, drives our cat Zoey out of the door and knocks over the water bowl.

https://i.redd.it/kt349ql321z51.gif

I decided to drive this cat out of my house using data science.

There are cat doors that selectively allow cats into the house based on their chip. These are quite expensive and also take a few seconds to register the chip and open. My fear was that our cats, while waiting for the hatch to let them in, would still be molested by that big red cat. For that reason (and because I am a bit of a geek) I decided to try to scare this red cat out of my house with data science.

**I approached this like a real project, with the following phases:**

**1. Functional requirements**

**2. Design**

**3. Data gathering**

**4. Modelling**

**5. Implementation**

**1. Functional requirements**

My requirements were simple: The red cat had to be chased out of my house, without my own cats being bothered and without disturbing us in our daily life. In addition, the costs had to be low: less than the 90 euros that an electric cat door costs.

**2. Design**

Even when you do not know exactly how everything is going to turn out, it helps to male a preliminary design. I wanted to train a so-called convolutional neural network that had to recognize the red cat. After the intruder was identified, a sound had to be played. So I needed: a camera, a computer and a speaker. See part a) of the schematic at the bottom.

**3. Data gathering**

To build a neural network that recognizes a specific cat, I had to teach my ""artificial intelligence"" what this cat looks like. For that I needed images, lots of images. Data collection was therefore by far the most work. In short, I took the following steps:

**Collecting images:** The Linux package *Motion* turned my laptop with webcam into a security camera that collected images when motion was detected.

**Region of interest cropping:** By identifying which pixels in the photo had changed, I could automatically crop the parts from the photos where the movement had occurred. The following image shows how that works.

https://i.redd.it/5ngfrr5821z51.gif

**Categorizing:** I sorted the images into different classes by hand; our cats, the red intruder, the robot vacuum cleaner, empty pictures and people.

**Multiplying:** To get a large and robust dataset I increased the number of images by shifting, mirroring and disturbing them. As a result, I had about 40 times as much data at my disposal. The following image shows an example.

**Splitting and combining** I split the the dataset into a train, validation and test dataset for each category. Then I created a combined dataset with about the same number of images for each class.

https://preview.redd.it/2j5bv3ea21z51.png?width=843&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f80a4495b247293cac9b4ca9490a481e1a5b6ce

**4. Modelling**

*Convolutional neural networks* are deep learning models that are able to classify images into groups based on characteristics. In order to do this, the model must be trained. During training you show the network images of which the label is known, the weights in the model are continuously adjusted. After one round of training, the validation data is checked to see how well the model works and overarching model settings are adjusted based on the result. This process is repeated until the model no longer improves. Finally, the test set, with images that the model has never seen before, is used to measure the quality of the model.

**Technicalities:** For the data scientists among us; I wrote my code in Python and built my models using Keras (with the TensorFlow backend). I trained multiple networks with different architectures, settings and datasets. Usually I used about 30,000-35,000 images, about 80% (25,000) for the training set, 20% (5,000) for the validation set, and I kept about 1,000 images as a validation set. The training time per model was approximately 8 hours on the CPU, but was reduced to 30-60min when I let Keras use my NVIDIA GPU. The global model architecture can be seen in part c) of the image at the bottom of this article.

**Quality:** All successful models were more than 95% accurate in classifying images. However, at first I struggled with *bias* : my AI was a racist! In addition, the accuracy for the red cat was not high enough. It is great to have a model that can distinguish the three cats, but it is much more important that it recognizes the red cat and that it does not unjustifiably scare my own cats away. I wanted to minimize the *false positives* regarding the red cat as much as possible.

The bias and the false positives were solved by using three neural networks in succession; The first checked if there was a cat in the picture, the second and third checked if this cat was the red cat. Using three different neural networks, that had to agree, not one of my own cats was confused with the red intruder in my test set (0% false positives). The accuracy for the red cat did go down to 85%, but this was more than enough for my goal.

***A biased artificial intelligence***

*A machine learning model is trained for a specific task using a selection of training data. If a certain type of information is missing during training, the model will not handle this well in practice. It has bias. If a football player is never passed a ball on his left leg during practise, he will also struggle when this happens during a match.*

*My first model didn't just have a bias, it was a racist! It had been trained with the images of three cats and was very capable of distinguishing them. If it was presented with an empty image, an image of a robot vacuum cleaner or a human, these were also classified into one of these three cat categories. People and robot vacuum cleaners were therefore often incorrectly labeled as a red cat!*

*An unbiased data set (filled with all types of realistic practical situations) is essential for a properly functioning machine learning application.*

**5. Implementation**

When we left the house in the morning I turned on the setup. In my kitchen there was a laptop (later replaced with a Raspberry Pi) with a webcam and sound. The motion library turned my webcam into a security camera. A script was running that fed the images from the security camera to my model when motion had occurred.

**Real-world testing:** The image of the moving object was classified by the neural networks. Only when all three models were in agreement, I deemed the identification sufficient. Since my webcam took 6 frames per second, I didn't mind that the red cat was only recognized in 85% of the cases. I thought it was more important not to scare my own cats away. After a week of testing, the red cat was identified within 2 seconds every time he entered the house. Not once was one of my own cats wrongly classified as the red cat. Test passed!

**Expel mechanism:** One thing was missing: A method to expel the cat from my kitchen. That's why I made a number of sound recordings together with my girlfriend in which we screamed and clapped our hands. When the red intruder was identified, the script randomly triggered some of these sound recordings. They were then played as loud as possible. See item b) of the following figure.

https://preview.redd.it/4jcjtpmo21z51.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0fbe70f0233713474f35630f187d46928451b9

**Result**

For less than € 70 in investment in new materials (webcam, raspberry PI, housings and cables) I built a system that was able to distinguish one specific cat from my own cats and robot vacuum cleaner in real time. Once the intruder was identified, a chase mechanism was activated. For this I trained a neural network that classified the images from the webcam with deep learning techniques: An ""artificial intelligence"" that was able to recognize the red cat under varying circumstances. I did this on my own laptop and completely with open source software.

Two days after the go-live of this setup, the red cat entered my kitchen. The following animation shows the scene and the actions taken by the automated script. First the model does not recognize the intruder as a cat (false negative). Then the 'AI' identifies the red cat and the furious screams of me and my girlfriend are played through the speakers. The red cat looks straight into the camera for a moment, looking for the source of this noise. Then it flees from the kitchen.

https://i.redd.it/1mkzmijq21z51.gif

Mission accomplished!

This process was repeated the following days. The cat came in and was chased by my neural network setup. Unfortunately, in all fairness I must admit, the success did not last. It took many evenings of work and thousands of images to teach this artifical intelligence to recognize the cat, but it only took this smart cat a week to learn that this setup did nothing more than make noise. I had learned using deep learning in order to train specialized neural networks to classify images and autonomously activate a cat-scaring mechanism. The cat had learned to ignore the result.

After a week, my 'artificial intelligence' was beaten by a cat... maybe this is for the best.",technology

personalfinance,How do we start budgeting for a house?,"My husband and I want to start vaguely looking at houses but I don't even know how to start budgeting for this because I don't know what extra expenses we'll have. 

We live in New Jersey, which I know is crazy expensive compared to many other states especially with property taxes. I make about $70k pre tax and he makes around $50k pre tax. I think both our credit scores are around 715 or 720. We have about $27k saved up right now, but that's without a cushion. Between rent, utilities, and cable, we probably pay about $2k a month, and then other expenses (car, car insurance, student loans, credit cards) probably totaling another $1k a month. My credit cards WERE all paid off but then our cat had to get a very expensive surgery because she's an idiot🙃 Hopefully they'll be paid off again with my Christmas bonus though.

But I just have so many questions.

How much should we anticipate spending per month for a house, outside of the mortgage itself?

How much will utilities go up from a 675 sqft apartment to a 2 or 3 bedroom house? We currently have gas heat, which I'm sure makes a difference. 

How much of a cushion should we have going into the process (like, we have $27k saved, so how much of that would go towards a down payment vs how much should we keep?)

Would it be better to pay off something like my car or student loans (car has about $10.5k left, interest rate of 3.99%, loans have about $13.5k, unsure of interest rate since it's 0% for another month or two) with what we have now, and then start saving again with less debt?

Please help! And thanks in advance!

personalfinance,"Can I get an FHA Title 1 loan to fix my ceiling, roof, and kitchen?","Hello,

I live at home with my folks in Miami. We have a very strong relationship but they worry about money a lot. 

It's been raining so much and so hard lately especially because of the hurricane, and in one bedroom, the ceiling fell down because of termite damage, and in another, the ceiling fell down because the rainwater was getting into the ceiling drywall due to an old roof that needs repairs.

Even though my city requires roof permits, my parents want to go the cheap route, and go into their savings and pay a contractor they've known for years, without a permit and do work on the weekends when people aren't inspecting, and then pay for this and a kitchen renovation which a contractor priced at 8,000$, without appliances. 

I don't want them to use their retirement savings - I am concerned about this and them using credit cards to pay for this. I also want us to do this the legal way.

I discovered the FHA title 1 loan, and I read that it does not require a credit score or income reporting and allows up to 25,000$. Is this correct? I couldn't find any information on how much the interest rates are currently. Is it 0, 5, 10, 15, 20%? The land of my house is worth 250,000$ if the loan needs to be secured. Is this loan through the government, or a bank, or both? It seems to be a government program but who finances the loan?

They are afraid of doing anything with the government including this loan, because they owe taxes and they've defaulted on an SBA loan. I don't know the details of this.

I want us to do this the legal way and the way that doesn't require my parents using their retirement savings. Can I take out the FHA loan in my name, even though I don't own the house and my parents do?",finance
IOT,Cell networks for remote IOT?,"Hello,

So I am trying to figure out how I can use the cell network for my IOT project.

I am starting a new project which will involve installing maybe 10 sensors over a 2500 acre property. The data needs to be fed back to the Azure Cloud so my web app can display it as it comes in.

Luckily, this site has great cell access and I can get web access over most of the property from my iPhone on verizon.

My question is really about cost effectiveness. If I need to add 10 devices to a monthly plan it'll make the project infeasible. Since the data is very small, and not time sensitive, it is ok if the data slowly trickles in over 3G or less speeds.

Are there any providers that let you bring many devices but charge for data transfer? The flat $10/line on the major providers will kill me here.

I thought about installing some sort of transmission tech to wirelessly send all the data back to a hub and only have 1 line, but the hardware is costly, and the programming becomes more complicated.

Anyone have experience here or good ideas?",technology

personalfinance,1099 vs S corp? “Live” in Nevada but work in Cali?,"Im about to start a new job that’s 1099 for 6 months (temp gig). The pay is $110/hr. I dont know if Ill continue with 1099 or go back to w2 after this temp gig. I would like to continue with 1099 cause it pays more but it depends if the right job is available. 

1. Is it worth starting an S corp? Ive read that you need a pretty high income for an S corp to be worth it. 

2. My parents lives in Nevada and my 1099 job will be in California. Can I put on tax documents that my home/residence is my parent’s house in Nevada and then write off all the lodging/meals/gas expenses when Im in california (would be at least $2000/month in write offs if legal)

3. The HR lady told me that I would get taxed more for being a Nevada resident and working in California. Is this true? Wouldnt I just pay fed tax, employment tax, and state tax? Is there a non resident tax or something? 

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Best Option for Grad School,"Hi, please let me know if this belongs on a different sub. 
I am planning on going to graduate school and I need at least 20k saved up for my first year and a little over 60k for the entire duration of grad school. I have about 3 years to save for my first year. 
I want to put this money away but I'm not too sure which way would be the best. I want to put it in a savings account but a con is that it won't be accumulating much value and I’ve been told interest rates could go negative thus decreasing the value of my investment (but sounds unlikely). My second option is to put it in stock market and invest in normal stock and maybe some index funds but there also is a lot of risk and I could end up with no money for graduate school. I can also just keep it in my bank account but those are the 3 ways I am aware of. Does anyone have any other suggetings in what I should look into or other pros/cons I haven't thought of. Thank you guys in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Getting ahead on loans versus putting money in Roth IRA,"I have \~40k in loans with interest rates around 4%.  I have a bit of extra money on top of the monthly payments that I can put toward either the loans or into a Roth IRA.  I have a 401k but have never opened a Roth before.  Google says annual return of a typical Roth IRA is \~7-10%, which sounds like a better move than going above and beyond on my loan payments.

Technically it's a retirement account but I'd more likely be using what money I save to fund a down payment on a home in the next 5 years or so, and whatever earnings I make would sit in the account until they meet that 5 year requirement... probably just to fund other expenses, while I keep the 401k as my primary retirement account.

What do you think is a better move?  Why?",finance
personalfinance,Seeking Advice: Mom (54F) is 27k in debt and considering American Consumer Credit Counseling,"I (22F) moved back in with my parents for a gap year before grad school. I am currently unemployed and my parents are allowing me to live at home rent-free. I have two other siblings, one who is also unemployed and living at home rent-free during grad school and the other who has recently moved out. My parents pay for our phone bill. We take care of the rest on our own (food, health insurance, gas, etc.).

My mom (54F) and dad (75M) own and operate a small business in the service industry so their monthly income fluctuates between $2700-3100. With COVID, it has been on the lower end for most of this year. Their business closed due to COVID in late March. They were allowed to reopen in July. They make a few hundred dollars in tips each week, all of which goes toward paying down my mom’s debt. Any profit from the business covers the rest of our expenses. They work six days a week, ten hours per day, so a second job is not possible. Nor is it likely they could be hired anywhere else, because neither of them have the English proficiency, education, nor skillset (outside this specific industry) required of most entry-level jobs.

My mom has about 27k in debt across 19 credit cards, which she has kept hidden from my dad and the rest of the family. She has been diagnosed with depression but also has (undiagnosed) borderline personality disorder (BPD). She has been in denial about the severity of her situation and her impulsive spending habits up until this point. She has handed over all of her credit cards and expressed genuine desire to pay down her debt. My dad is non-confrontational and refuses to confront her for fear it might trigger an episode. He takes care of all the finances, so my mom is only responsible for her CC debt.

She revealed the extent of her credit card debt when my parents’ small business was required to shut down due to COVID in March, and she could no longer make the minimum payments. The due dates on her cards are staggered throughout the month so that she has a due date every couple days. She tried to make the minimum payment on her cards, but she would often make late payments or miss payments altogether because she could not keep track of the due dates or did not have enough money at the time to make the minimum payment when it became due—resulting in late fees and penalties.

After I learned of this, I immediately compiled a list of all her open accounts so she could better keep track of what she owes and when the minimum payments were due. I was able to put her on a payment plan for 5 accounts, and closed/locked nearly half of her open accounts so she could no longer make purchases on them. I then made an appointment and spoke with a representative at American Consumer Credit Counseling who told me that they could put her on a Debt Management Plan and reduce her APR and minimum payment to $500/month so she would be able to pay down her debt in 45 months for the 14 open accounts. This would not include the 5 additional credit card accounts she is already on a payment plan for (the average monthly minimum payment for these cards would be \~ $400). ACCC will be charging a one-time enrollment fee of $39 and a monthly fee of $5/account that caps at 10 accounts, totaling $50.

My dad is hesitant to enroll into a Debt Management Plan with ACCC as he doesn’t completely trust them. Is there anyone who has experience with the program or ACCC? Would this be the best course of action for someone who cannot afford even the monthly minimum payments?

personalfinance,Pay off question regarding two Car loans.,"Trying to figure out the best pay off plan regarding two car loans. Currently my wife and I own two vehicles. Both are about $55k left on both, car A with ~9% APR and car B with 3.5%. Car A minimum payment of $975 and Car B $900. 

My wife and I will have an extra $4000 per month after minimum payments are made. My wife wants to pay $2000 extra per vehicle but I’m trying to push to pay off Car A first due to interest rate as well as paying one vehicle off quicker will free up an extra $975 per month to put towards the other vehicle.

stocks,What about Brazil?,"I’ve recently looked at geographic markets that had not recovered substantially since the march crash. One such area is Brazil, where valutations are still like 25% down if you look at a broad index. They seem to have few tech companies, but have large mining companies, some oil, agriculture and quite a lot of traditional industry. In essence a shift towards cyclical industries.

In addition, the average Brazilian would just keep money in the bank for savings as their interest rate have been quite high. It is now at a record level at 2.5%. That should shift more money into the stock markets.

Dowside is that Brazil has had a low growth for a decade or so, if you invested 10 years ago you are likely to be at a net loss today. Not the best long-term strategy if that keeps up. They have however fixed their pension system recently.

personalfinance,Sacrificing a higher interest rate (5.625%) for getting into a home 2 years sooner,"Hello!  My wife and I are in an interesting financial situation and would appreciate some input from the PF community. We are both in high earning jobs (Ph.D. in sales field + Practicing physician) and earn roughly $300k/year, but right now we are both relatively fresh out of school/residency so we have less than 2 years work experience ( I have about 1.5 years, my wife \~3 months).

We started looking for homes but quickly found out that since my wife is an independent contractor she cannot qualify for a conventional mortgage which firmly requires any independent contractor have a full 2 years of work history. My wife has a contract with her practice that provides a full 40 hours of work, but this doesn't make any difference - the rules of Freddie and Fannie are firm. While I can apply for a conventional loan on my own income alone, this isn't enough to realistically provide a loan that can cover a home where we live (Los Angeles CA).

We were initially dismayed to hear we would need to wait another 21 months to qualify for any loan, but we started looking into non conventional options like physician loans. We have gotten approval with one non-conventional mortgage lender that has quoted us a 5.625% interest rate with 10% down on a 850k home (we could in reality put 15% down currently). Are we crazy to consider this? In our minds, if interest rates are lower in 21 months we can always refinance to a much better rate, or if they aren't, then we come out ahead (i.e if we instead waited 21 months for a conventional loan, we'd be in the same situation if interest rates went up). Are we wrong?

personalfinance,Second guessing my mortgage refinance,"TLDR: is this mortgage rate at 15 years better than what I currently have, or am I better off keeping my current loans and just paying extra principal of $184 a month? I’ve tried using online calculators, but I’m getting conflicting data regarding the break even point.

New term: $170k 15 year cash out refi loan at 2.5 with 3% APR (8758 in closing costs, including $1500 in origination fees and $3600 in points. All but $1755 will be rolled into the loan balance). Use cash out to combine into one monthly payment of $1133.

Old term: Four properties with mortgages totaling $163k with average 24 years left at 4.4%. Total monthly payment of $949.

-————————-

Hello, all. I’m currently in the process of refinancing, and looking for some perspective. I tend to overthink things and psyche myself out, so I’d love to hear any ideas or insights. My situation is a little unique, so please bear with me...

I have four investment properties, with a combined balance of 163k, and an averaged interest rate of 4.4% and about 24 years left on original 30 year mortgages. Specific numbers follow, with some slight rounding of balances:

Property 1: 90k balance at 4.3 with 22 years left.
Property 2: 29.5k at 4.5 with 24 years left.
Property 3: 23k at 4.5 with 26 years left.
Property 4: 21.5k at 4.875 with 26 years left.

My original plan was to carry these to term, but with mortgage rates so low, I decided to explore some options. My new plan is to do a cash out on the first property, and use the equity to pay off the other three loans. I know this presents complications for deducting interest etc, but my math shows it’s a pretty negligible effect. 

I’m also looking to switch to a 15 year rate. This goes against my usual principle of not paying tomorrow’s debt with today’s dollars, but the interest rate difference is significant enough (over 1%) and the new payment is only $184 more per month, which I’m not majorly concerned with being able to come up with over the next fifteen years. This will also mean they are paid off when I’m 50, and (hopefully) very close to retirement which is alluring I must admit. 

This is costing me points, but it seems that this is not necessarily a bad thing, since it is being rolled into the balance. Yes?

I’m locked in with a lender and things are going smoothly.  I guess I’m just a little spooky about pulling the trigger, and would like to know if the math makes sense given the rate, closing costs etc. I’ve tried calculating the break even point, and it looks to be around 5 years, which I think is a safe bet.

I know there’s a bent towards 30 year rates, which I share, but because these are investment properties the break even point given rate difference between my current loan rates and a new one didn’t make much sense to me given closing costs. If anybody has a lead on a good 30 year rate for cash out refi on investment , I’d certainly look into it (my credit is above 790).

Sorry if this is too much information, but I know it’s hard to compare numbers without full data. I appreciate anyone taking the time to glance this over for me and tell me if I’m missing something obvious. I’d be happy to return the favor if somebody needs some advice on anything related to rentals etc. Thanks :)",finance

I did some research, applied for a refinancing with the lowest rates I could find online, and I was approved for 2.5% with 0.123% points, really solid.

The thing is, my current mortgage is with a solid, reputable credit union, and the refinancing estimate I got is with a private company (Amerisave), which looks like they frequently sell mortgages to other lenders (who might be a hassle to work with). I already asked my credit union if they would match the loan estimate, and they wouldn't budge. Closing costs are ~$2k (not including escrow), and this would reduce our monthly payment by nearly $400. I'm in an extremely secure financial position right now, and there's about 0% chance of having money troubles in the future.

personalfinance,Company said they would match income I would get from being a Teaching Assistant at University but declined to earmark corresponding proportion of payment as 'For Tuition Reimbursement',"Hi all.

The company I interned at this summer offered to match what my University would pay me if I was a Teaching Assistant there this Fall 2020. I accepted as a contract employee for the Fall and am working there now while attending school full-time. If it matters, the company is in a different state than me and I am a remote employee.

Now, here is my dilemma. I asked my company to earmark the corresponding proportion of their payment to me for this Fall as tuition reimbursement. They declined. All payments from them have been regular income.

Is there a way that I can still declare the corresponding proportion of their payment as tuition reimbursement and get the the taxes I already paid back? Do they need to fill out a 1098-T for me or can I handle this on my own?

CryptoCurrency,"The Perfect Coin hasn't been created yet, and may take many years before it is","Like many in the crypto community, I'd rather discuss how politics and fiscal policy is broken than get into a headed debate, pushing for one side or the other. In the US, ""conservative"" and ""liberal"" ideologies have evolved into something much different than what they were 30 years ago, almost to the point where if an intelligent alien were to study us today, it'd be difficult to see from the two political parties that the original difference comes down to ""less government"" vs ""more government"". 

To me, if society replaced the time and effort spent on political arguments with rethinking underlying system, there would be a paradigm shift that would change the world for the better.  Satoshi did this while economists were busy discussing the pros/cons for and against various monetary policy &amp; fiscal stimulus during the great financial crisis. 

I believe every decision, innovation, and policy in the world comes down to incentives and the cause &amp; effect outcomes that are a result.  That's at the core of capitalism. But one of biggest challenges of capitalism is how power and influence alone leads to more wealth. The information age has exacerbated this. And while the quality of life for even the lowest income classes has increase over time (thanks to the incentives in place to motivate Jobs, Zuck, Gates, Musk, etc), the value of power and influence has pushed the wealth gap to an unhealthy economic level. 

To that, I could join a political party and start debating/campaigning for what I think is the best/fairest way to shrink the wealth gap (trying to find the optimal point between pure capitalism and pure socialism that leads to the largest overall impact on the world's overall quality of life). But Satoshi didn't do that, so I won't either. I'd like to instead start a discussion on what the ideal ""new system"" could look like, that our founding fathers (for Americans) could never have considered pre-internet and pre-blockchain:

* Completely start over, and ""air drop"" an equivalent amount of wealth to every person on earth, defined somehow by something in the field of biology/genetics that resembles a unique and provably living human public key, with a private key that can't be stolen (or can be revoked if stolen). No more global debt crisis.
* A fixed amount of coin would also be created upon birth someone's birth, with smart contracts set by parents to determine how/when that person can use that wealth until they reach a certain age. Similarly, ""smart wills"" would dictate how the currency is distributed upon someone's death.
* While I see Dapps having a long term impact on capitalism, there will always be a need for some form of government and policy makers. But because this biologically human blockchain would always reflect the wealth of each person over time, a ""wealth gap index"" would always be known. Policy makers could be evaluated and compensated based on their ability to increase the standard of living while minimizing the wealth gap and poverty levels. 

Thoughts welcome, especially from those with a deep knowledge of biology/genetics. Thank you for taking the time to read my futuristic utopian rant - my wife would have been lost at ""public key"".",cryptocurrency

Because it was a cash out refi and my credit was in the low 700’s at the time I got a 4.875% rate on a 30 year. The house and 10 acres appraised at $330K and the mortgage was for $260K with a monthly payment of $1375 P&amp;I.

In the spring of 2020 in the midst of the pandemic I took advantage of the CARES act forbearance program and halted my payments for a few months. This was due to both my girlfriend and ex-wife/mother of my child were laid off at the same time and I was the only one of us with an income I figured I should hoard some cash until I knew how this was going to play out.

By September I was ready to resume payments, so I ended the forbearance and have made the Oct and Nov payments.

So now that interest rates have gone down since the onset of the pandemic, I would like to refi out of my ridiculous 4.875% loan and get something in the high 2% range.

My credit is currently 767 (FICO 2) and no other debt. My income is right at $100K and I feel like I could get a pretty good rate TODAY.

The problem is that pesky ‘you must make 3 consecutive payments after forbearance to be eligible for refinancing’ rule (which isn’t that bad considering it is usually a full year of payments required).

So, in a little over 2 weeks (Dec. 1) I will make my third consecutive post-forbearance payment and will be eligible to do a rate and term refi. 

I am afraid that rates are so low right now and they are far more likely to be higher on Dec 1 when I am eligible.

The only real obvious value that these houses had over mine is more recently remodeled kitchens and nicer basements.

With that, I'm considering a refinance to take advantage of better rates and lower my monthly payment. But I am also thinking about cashing out $15k of my equity to renovate the kitchen and basement.

personalfinance,Successfully negotiated a $50 rental decrease today - thought I’d share my method,"Hi folks,

We were rebuffed earlier this year when we went to our landlord asking for a permanent rent reduction - they offered $10 off our existing rent of $530 p/w IF we signed on for 12 months.

Needless to say that was a hard pass from us. We decided to wait until late in the year for the market to get worse. In a spot of luck, one of the exact same units came on the market around the corner and has sat empty, originally at $550, and now at $500 with no takers.

Pre-work: I assessed places in the neighbourhood, right across the suburb and the one next door. Thanks to KoalaData extension on Domain I was able to keep a close eye on time on market and price drops.

Last week I called around agents asking about places within the block. I confirmed availability and whether the owner was open to offers, and how low they might go. All the properties were open to offers, with a 3 bed willing to drop to $550 the biggest deal - and only a few doors down.

The email: we had aimed for the heart strings but this time we went for the purse strings. I made sure our case was clear and calculated the loss they’d face with us moving. I made it clear there was a high chance of us moving and by adding the vacancy lengths for other properties I was able to support the likelihood they’d be out of pocket more than the cost of reducing the rent. I didn’t offer to sign on for another year, I just paid out the reality of the situation.

Here’s the email, with addresses removed:

Dear [property manager],

Thank you for speaking with me last week. As discussed, I'm writing to request an ongoing reduction to the rent for [our property]. We previously requested a reduction in May, and were offered a $10 reduction with a 12-month contract, which we declined as this offered us little relief.

The rental market has changed considerably since our last request, and [info about our situation]. In light of our need to reduce costs, and the new realities of the rental market, we now believe a new rental rate is appropriate for this property.

We believe a new rate of $480 p/week is reasonable - based on the following properties:

[Property 1]. This is exactly the same unit as this one in the same complex, more modern, with some appliances supplied. Rent: $500 P/W Day on market: On market 26 days at $500 P/W, 103 days at $550 P/W. Owners are open to a lower offer.

[Property 2]. Two bedroom house with modern bathrooms and air conditioning. Rent: $480 P/W Days on market: one year.

[Property 3]. A three bedroom house, older but partially refurbished. Rent: $590 P/W advertised. Days on market: on market 19 days at $590 P/W, 189 days in total. aowners are happy to accept $550 P/W

[Property 4, slightly further away]: Modern, light-filled two bedroom house with two bathrooms. Rent: $525 P/W advertised. Happy to accept lower offers Days on market: on market 60 days at $525 P/W, 144 days at $550 P/W

These are just a few examples that demonstrate the market has shifted, including one that is the same unit as this one. We have also discussed with fellow residents within [our suburb] to confirm the current market - the vast majority have negotiated reductions this year.

A rental rate of $480 P/W is significantly less than the costs involved should we vacate this property. If this property stays empty for 4 weeks it would cost our landlords $2,120 + leasing fee at the current rent at least. It is likely the property would be empty for more than four weeks, so this is a best-case scenario. A reduction of $50 P/W would cost $2,600 annually by comparison.

If we cannot secure a reasonable reduction in rent to bring the property in line with the current rental market, we may need to look at other options at today's market rate.

Kind regards,

[my name]

A week later we received confirmation that the landlord was accepting our proposal, and we’re asked if we want to sign on for 12 months - but that’s optional.

To be honest I expected to get $500 back as a counter and would have been ok with that, so we could have pushed a little lower in hindsight. This is, however, an outstanding result and will benefit us immensely. We didn’t want to move, so this was a great result in that sense too.

My advice is to know your market well and present the facts in a straightforward manner - the market has changed and if that’s the case in your area, similar research may help.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk. I might just buy a flat white today to celebrate. Happy to answer any other questions - this is just my experience, YMMV.",finance

personalfinance,Use cash reserves vs using cash loan to consolidate debt,"Hey Reddit!

Long story short: got married last year and I helped my wife consolidate her extremely high credit card balances.  We also froze her cards.  I gave her my Amex to use because who doesn’t love the points and we put policies in place for her to follow so it “doesn’t” happen again.

Well, the inevitable happened.  We got a puppy and then I got even more distracted with job interviews (good news, it resulted in a new job).  The distraction, however, resulted in her racking up my Amex balance to a concerning number. 

Obviously the card has been taken away and I’m going to micromanage her spending now.  I have the cash reserves to pay it off, how ever, I’m not sure if it’s the best way.  If the interest rate is right for me to apply for a loan to consolidate, is it a good idea? Or is it better just to use the reserves and force better savings until it’s replenished?

Any input will help, thanks!",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 16th, 2020.

# **Tug of war between value and growth stocks may drive the market again in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/tug-of-war-between-value-and-growth-stocks-may-drive-the-market-again-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market is caught between the rapidly spreading virus and the promise of a vaccine.
*****
&gt; That is likely to drive trading in the week ahead, as it did in the past week. Investors have been weighing cyclical plays that will do better when the economy reopens fully, against the big tech and growth names that weathered the virus shutdowns in the spring and benefit from the stay-at-home trend.
*****
&gt; In the past week, that trade resulted in a mixed performance with the Dow up 4% but the Nasdaq down about 0.5%, as investors sold off technology and communications services stocks. The S&amp;P 500 finished up 2.2% at a record close of 3,585, its first since Sept. 2. The renewed spread of the virus by mid-week had tamped down the exuberance over news from Pfizer Monday that its vaccine has proven highly effective and could be broadly distributed next year.
*****
&gt; The election is still uncertain though the market has responded well to the idea that a Democratic president and a mixed Congress will likely result in gridlock. President Donald Trump refuses to concede while his campaign challenges election results. Former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the presumptive president-elect last Saturday and has been moving to organize a cabinet.
*****
&gt; # Next hurdle for market
&gt; “We largely put the election in the rear view mirror. The next hurdle for this market to contend with will be the path of the virus, and that will be the chief focus. It means a less strident rotation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “Growth has actually outperformed value for the last 17 years. That’s a lot of inertia to break...If this is a pivot point, it’s a long-term pivot point.”
*****
&gt; The surging virus is raising renewed concerns about the economy as some cities are likely to put new limits on activities to slow the spread. In the U.S. there were a record 153,400 new cases Thursday.
*****
&gt; Besides the virus headlines, investors will be watching economic data, particularly retail sales Tuesday and existing home sales Thursday. There are a flurry of Fed speakers, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida Monday.
*****
&gt; Retailers report earnings in the week ahead with reports from Walmart and Home Depot Tuesday and Target Wednesday. NVIDIA also reports on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The Pfizer news and the election outcome combined to unleash a new wave of bullishness early in the past week. Goldman Sachs, for instance, put a target of 4,200 on the S&amp;P 500 for 2021, and JPMorgan said the benchmark could rise to as high as 4,500 next year.
*****
&gt; # Value vs growth
&gt; Hogan said the value play trend had actually been underway before the Pfizer news and is what helped take the Russell 2000 to close at a new high for the first time Friday since August, 2018.
*****
&gt; Small caps in the Russell 2000 have been outperforming for the past three months. Since Oct. 1, the Russell is up 15.5%, compared to just under 6.6% gain for the S&amp;P 500. In the past week, the Russell was the best performer, up 6% for the week on Friday, compared to the 2.2% gain in the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; In the past week, energy stocks surged 16.5%,and airlines were up 10.5%, The S&amp;P financial sector was up 8.2%, with commercial banks gaining 11.2%. At the same time, information technology declined 0.4% and consumer discretionary stocks were down 1.1%. Communications services was among the weak performers, up just 0.8%
*****
&gt; “I think it’s just a constant tug of war...based on what we see with the virus headlines and such. I think that’s driving a lot,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “When you get the bad headlines, you start seeing the growth stocks do well. When you get the good headlines, you start seeing the value stocks doing better.”
*****
&gt; Hickey expects to continue seeing vaccine developments from other manufacturers. “Some of these high-flying Covid stocks are going to get hit as the headlines get better. We’ve been rotating out of the large cap tech stocks, but we don’t think they’re necessarily going to go down, so to speak,” he said. “We just think there’s better opportunity in some of the more cyclical parts of the market. It’s more a function of underperformance than decline.”

&gt; # A Very Good Ten

&gt; With nearly ten trading days under its belt for November, the S&amp;P 500 is putting together quite a month. Through early morning Friday, the S&amp;P 500 was up just over 9% which ranks as the best first ten trading days for a month since January 1987. In the entire history of the S&amp;P, there have only been 17 other months where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 9% in the first ten trading days of the month, and in the post-WWII period, there have only been five.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111320-First-Ten-Days-Copy.png))**

&gt; So, when a month starts off strong, does it usually finish that way? Or is there some sort of reversion to the mean? Unfortunately, prior experience isn't particularly consistent in one direction of the other. The table below shows each month since 1928 where the S&amp;P 500 was up at least 7.5% in the first ten trading days of a month. Overall, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance has been a gain of 0.96%. That sounds good, but on a median basis, the rest of the month typically sees a decline of 0.2% with positive returns less than half of the time.

&gt; In looking at the chart above and the table below, you'll notice that most of the strong starts for the S&amp;P came during the Depression in the pre-WWII period. In 1932 and 1933, for example, there were five occurrences each year! Looking at the post-WWII period where the frequency of occurrences wasn't nearly as common, strong starts to a month typically saw a more positive but still not a very consistent trend. In the ten prior months since the end of WWII, the S&amp;P 500's average rest of month performance was a gain of 1.27% (median: 1.69%) with gains 60% of the time.

&gt; # November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Stronger

&gt; DJIA has been up 11 of the last 16 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 14 of the last 18 years with an average gain of 0.56%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, it’s different.

&gt; S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 17 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 16 and 14 times respectively over the past 26 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Friday’s solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the historically bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

&gt; # Week before Thanksgiving DJIA Up 19 of 27, But…

&gt; DJIA has a solid track record over the last 27 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.46%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks are not as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 17 years with a median gain of 0.10%.

&gt; S&amp;P is up 16 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.35% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.13% median loss. NASDAQ is up 15 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.33% and down 9 of the last 17, –0.004% median loss. Russell 200 is up 14 of the last 27 years with a median gain of 0.36% and down 10 of the last 17, –0.27% median loss.

&gt; This sets up well for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

&gt; # New High in New 52 Week Highs

&gt; As equities and other risk assets surge, a massive number of S&amp;P 500 stocks are hitting new 52 week highs today. As shown in the chart below, as of midday 27.92% of S&amp;P 500 stocks have reached new 52 week highs today and just one stock, Biogen (BIIB), is reaching a new 52 week low. The net reading of 27.72% is the highest reading for net new highs since January of 2018. Prior to that, you would need to go all the way back to May 22nd of 2013 to find the last time there was such a high reading.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Net-New-Highs-2.png))**

&gt; Looking at the best-performing stocks in the index today, the list is mostly comprised of the stocks that have been extremely beaten down in the COVID economy like energy, travel, and retail/retail real estate names. Despite this, some still find themselves as some of those furthest below their 52-week highs. Take for example Carnival Cruiselines (CCL). The stock is seeing a phenomenal 35% gain just in today's session, but even at today's highs it was still well over 60% below its high for the year. It is a similar story for CCL's peer, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) which is up 27.78% but was 61.4% from its highs at its best price today. On the other hand, there are 28 stocks that have come within 1% of their 52-week highs at their high prices today. Another 80 stocks have come within 5% of their 52-week highs at their intraday highs today.

&gt; # Big Milestone For Small Stocks

&gt; No US equity index has reacted more strongly since Election Day than the Russell 2000 small-cap index. As shown in the chart below, the index finally broke out above its highs from earlier in the year following Monday's positive vaccine news. After that move on Monday, the Russell 2000 was up over 10% in just the last six trading days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/1110-RTY.png))**

&gt; In just about any other year besides 2020, a 10%+ move in the Russell 2000 would be an extraordinary move, but this year the most recent move is actually the sixth one of at least that much. In fact, coming out of the March lows, the Russell saw three six-day moves of 19.1%, 16.3%, and 14.8%, respectively. The frequency with which we've seen these 10%+ moves in the Russell 2000 over a six-day period has been unlike any other year in the Russell's history. Behind 2020, the year with the next highest total of 10%+ moves was 2011 (4) and then 2008 (3), and the most there has been in any twelve-month rolling basis is five spanning late 2008 through the first half of 2009.

&gt; # 3 Election Charts That Caught Our Attention

&gt; Stocks just had their best week since April, with the S&amp;P 500 Index incredibly a chip shot away from new all-time highs. Joe Biden will be the next President of the United States, but markets are confident Republicans will maintain the Senate, and this means gridlock in Washington. Remember, gridlock is good, as it pulls policy towards compromise and avoids extremes. Also, any legislative changes to taxes, regulation, and capital gains will have meaningful input from both parties.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a split Congress tends to mean stronger stock returns, almost ignoring whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House. The most likely outcome from the election at this point is a Democratic president with a divided Congress—a scenario that historically has produced solid S&amp;P 500 returns of 15.9% a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Assuming President-elect Joe Biden takes over in January 2021, it is important to note that historically stocks haven’t done as well the first and second years of a new president compared with an incumbent winning. This makes sense though, as historically voters may have chosen new leadership in part because of economic weakness, and the uncertainty of a new president’s policies could also hold things back some. If things are good, the president tends to win reelection. Things turn around significantly by the third year in office, though, if there’s new leadership. Of course, it’s worth noting that the first year of a new president has seen the S&amp;P 500 higher recently, with stocks up nearly 20% the first year under President Donald Trump (2017) and 23% under President Barack Obama (2009).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.9.20-Blog-Chart-2-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, the strength from stocks around the election has been rather historic. “The S&amp;P 500 added 1% on four consecutive days, which hasn’t happened since late 1982,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Although there are only three other times this rare blast of strength happened since WWII, it is worth noting that strong returns going out a year took place after each instance.” The bottom line: Extreme buying pressure has a funny way of resolving higher, and we don’t anticipate this time being any different.

&gt; # 3 The Biggest Winners Are Still Big Losers

&gt; With household names like Carnival (CCL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Simon Property (SPG), and Royal Caribbean (RCL) all up over 20% today, more than a few people out there are probably kicking themselves for not owning any of them. But before you start ripping your hair out, keep in mind that just about all of these stocks are down (and in a big way) on the year. Of the 33 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that are up over 20% following today’s vaccine news, all but one of them are still down year to date. The only exception is Expedia (EXPE), which even after a 20%+ gain is still up just 18% on the year.

&gt; In terms of sector representation, Energy tops the list with more than a third of the names (12) on the list. Behind Energy, Real Estate (8), Consumer Discretionary (6), and Financials (6) are the only other sectors with multiple stocks listed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110920-Best-Stocks-1109.png))**

&gt; Just as the best-performing stocks are all still underperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, the biggest losers today are among the year’s biggest winners. There are 25 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that were down on the day as of the middle of the afternoon, but the only one that is down on the year is Biogen (BIIB), a stock whose decline has nothing to do with the vaccine news. Including BIIB, the 25 biggest losers are still up an average of 41% YTD (median: 31%). Behind BIIB, the two worst-performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 today are Pool (POOL) and Etsy (ETSY). Both stocks are down over 10% on the day, but for the year are still holding onto gains of 56.4% and 190.5%, respectively.

&gt; # Policy Uncertainty Spiked Into the Election

&gt; For the month of October, the NFIB's reading on small business sentiment was unchanged at the headline levels but many of the sub-indices broadly pointed to further improvements in business conditions. That is not to say small businesses do not have their share of concerns. As shown in the chart below, the NFIB's index on Economic Policy Uncertainty rose another 4 points in October to 98 which is the second-highest reading on record behind November of 2016; around the time of the last presidential election.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111020-NFIB-Uncert2.png))**

&gt; The election played a role in the uncertainty as 31% of small businesses surveyed reported government-related concerns as their biggest problem in October (lower chart). That was up for the second month in a row and is around the high end of the past couple of year's range. Additionally, as discussed earlier, labor also dominates the minds of small businesses as small businesses report struggles in filling roles. 30% reported cost or quality of labor as the single most important problem (top chart). That is unchanged since August.

&gt; # Big Tech Fades and Small Caps Soar

&gt; Pfizer’s announcement that its vaccine for covid-19 appears to be 90% effective on Monday morning also gave new life to small-cap stocks, many of which have struggled throughout the pandemic. The announcement has also triggered an exodus from mega-cap tech stocks that had been the “go-to” positions throughout most of the pandemic.

&gt; The chart above is based upon a similar chart from page 112 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020. It shows the typical one-year seasonal pattern of the ratio of the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 from July through June (scale on right). Overlaid on top of this pattern is the performance of this ratio in 2020 so far through today’s close (left scale). When the ratio is declining, large-cap stocks are outperforming small cap stocks. When the ratio is climbing, small caps are outperforming. In a typical year, small-caps will lag until around late-September or early October and then take off right around mid-December.

&gt; Covid-19 related shutdowns and unemployment had kept small caps essentially sidelined this year. There were bouts of strength in late-July to mid-August and a brief surge in mid-September and again in early October. The recent surge higher could be an early start to the major move higher that typically begins around mid-December.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Why bitcoin is pumping, explained:","My basic understanding of what's going on:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The crypto community has shrunk since January 2018 significantly. There are plenty of metrics that support this thesis.
2. All of the diehards in this community who remain already accumulated at or below 10k and have no interest in  buying any higher, but also have little interest selling below 20k.
3. The extreme volatility in Bitcoin during March 2019-March 2020 was almost entirely caused by it's unusually large leverage trading ecosystem, not by organic demand.
4. The current rally after the March crash in 2020 is being caused by a liquidity flood by a small number of high net worth individuals. There are lots of metrics that support this idea.

March 2020 was a pivotal and critical moment for the survival of this asset. Bitcoin would have likely faded into obscurity and continued making lower lows and lower highs indefinitely for all eternity if a small number of high networth people didn't come in and buy retail's bags. 

What caused this demand with a small amount of wealthy investors?

1. The aggressive monetary policy the US Federal Reserve other central banks have taken worldwide in reaction to lockdowns have caused hedgefund managers to investigate inflation hedges
2. The coronavirus outbreak has caused the trend of digitalization in the world culture to speed up exponentially.
3. Central banks have been inspired by bitcoin, and want to create a similar product pegged to their currency. If a digital dollar exists, then a digital gold like bitcoin makes sense.
4. Paul Tudor Jones, Anthony Pompliano, Square, Paypal, Microstrategies, Grayscale and many others have played a strong reinforcing role in legitimizing bitcoin as a legitimate investment.

So what is Bitcoin's future? Here are 3 scenarios:

1. Bitcoin fails to become currency, but it continues its trend of becoming accepted as a legitimate investment. Bitcoin IRAs and ETFs will become the largest source of liquidity causing one final mulityear exponential bullrun before just tapering off and stagnating/rising nominally like gold.
2. Bitcoin becomes currency. Countries might peg bitcoin to their own currency or bitcoin might just be the currency ""of the internet"" as Jack Dorsey puts it. If bitcoin becomes currency, then it's price in USD becomes irrelevant. 
3. Bitcoin fails at both 1 and 2, and just is some obscure pump and dump asset that has no purpose or utility.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Have college#aged kids take out student loans instead of us paying for college?,"Looking for any flaws in this logic. We’re fortunate that we can pay college tuition for our one kid, soon to be two, in college. I’m thinking for next year and the subsequent years, we should have them take out student loans (max out federal, then private if needed) in their names with us as co-signers if necessary. We’d then gift them money (under $15k/yr) to go towards paying off the loans after they graduate. 

The idea is to help them build their credit profiles over the next several years, and we’d get to invest that money and realize several years of growth. If we invest aggressively, we should be able to at least offset the loan interest.

personalfinance,When should I negotiate salary or counter-offer when switching jobs?,"I have been working at Job A for about 5 years. I like what I do and I wouldn't mind continuing to do so. They've been good to me and I've received raises every year and I just received one a few months ago.  
  
A recruiter reached out to me and I entertained the idea and had a couple interviews with Job B. I have all but received a written offer from Job B to do something similar as my current job. It will be through a contract company with the plan to be full time at the actual company in about 6 months.  
  
The verbal offer I've gotten is about 25% more than I currently make, but it is more demanding and will require 15-25% more hours. Job A is hourly while Job B is salary. I'm allowed to work overtime at Job A and I get paid for it so I could potentially make just as much if I wanted to. Job B has a slight advantage with the other benefits, but in my mind there is not much of a financial benefit to switch jobs as I won't see those benefits for at least a year.  
  
I wouldn't mind switching, but I think I need a higher offer to make it worth the switch. I have a good relationship with Job A and it is very likely they need to keep me around as we are already short staffed. Should I ask the recruiter for a higher offer and get a written offer before discussing with Job A? After I negotiate for a higher offer, would it still be reasonable to talk to Job A about a counter-offer? Should I take my boss aside and tell them the situation before getting a written offer and see what they can do to keep me?",finance
personalfinance,Trying To Figure Out If It's Worth Refinancing,"House is worth $250,000. Took out a mortgage for $150,000 5 years ago when we purchased it.

 I have 25 years left on the mortgage which is at 3.75% interest rate. I have really good credit.

If I do end up refinancing, I would prefer to keep it a 25 year mortgage and not go back up to 30 years. 

So, do you guys think it's worth refinancing to get lower interest rate?

I know I could get an even lower rate if I went with a 15 year mortgage. But, I prefer to just pay a little extra on the mortgage each month and know that the monthly amount I HAVE to pay each month is less.

CryptoCurrency,This firm wants to help the US feds in selling $1 billion of seized Bitcoin,,cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Why is Bitcoin worth anything?,"Let’s start by comparing Bitcoin to United States Dollar and Gold.

Bitcoin, US Dollars and Gold all have value because other people believe that they do. They have no objective value and are all social constructs.

Bitcoin, USD, and Gold. Why are they worth something? For three mains reasons.

1. **Store of value** is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved
2. **Medium of Exchange**A *medium of exchange* is an intermediary instrument or system used to facilitate the sale, purchase, or trade of goods between parties.
3. **Unit of Account**The value of something is measured in a specific currency. This allows different things to be compared against each other; for example, goods, services, assets, liabilities, labor, income, expenses

We do all need some currency to store value, unit of account, and as a medium of exchange, unless we want to go back to bartering!

[Bartering](https://preview.redd.it/nm43b119fbz51.png?width=211&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07a212a8a6f981c803b61f2fbda7136a250da875)

Although bartering might be a lot of fun for a day, it would surely make everything a lot less efficient!

[USD, Gold and Bitcoin - Store of Value, Unit of Account and Medium of Exchange](https://preview.redd.it/vfohpvcpubz51.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64d13a857aef4afec44a0d41a943b6779b95ba94)

**- United States Dollar.** The US Dollar is used as a medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account.

The united states dollar does not have a limited supply. More money can be printed and created by the federal reserve and also by banks when they create loans.

[Creating Money](https://preview.redd.it/969yfeptgbz51.png?width=532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75608df064dfcc4d5177ee2cc31e7597c90eb3d7)

As more is created it might mean that the value goes down (inflation) and this might mean that over the long term it might not be a great store of value, compared to gold, or bitcoin, and there is usually a relationship between inflation, uncertainty and the rising value of alternatives as a store of value.

**Gold** \- Gold has previously been used as a medium of exchange in the form of gold coins but it is no longer used as a medium of exchange or unit of account. The primary purpose of gold is as a store of value. With a limited supply, gold can act as a store of value and can protect against inflation.

Additional gold can only be found by mining (and there is a limit to how much gold can be mined from this planet). It can also be created from other elements but the process requires a nuclear reaction and it’s currently not profitable to do that.

While gold is limited on earth, it is possible that it can be found abundantly in space. Nasa is targeting a golden asteroid in 2022 that can have enough gold everyone on earth can a billionaire (or more likely to turn the gold industry into chaos) [NASA and SpaceX explore asteroid for gold and other metals](https://www.kidsnews.com.au/space/striking-gold-in-space-in-2022/news-story/951ffaefc679bbcc02eb7bb4bc592c62).

It might be some time before space mining is realised but the prospect of finding abundant gold outside this planet in the future is a very real possibility

**BITCOIN** Bitcoin can be used as a medium of exchange and a store of value

As a medium of exchange, Bitcoin - can be exchanged digitally, internationally, and anonymously and securely. One challenge to bitcoins as a medium of exchange is the volatility and setting up the infrastructure - I don’t come across many places where I can use bitcoin in my life or know of anyone who is buying or selling things with bitcoin every day.

I also read that there are some technical challenges to using bitcoin as a medium of exchange exchange. It isn’t that efficient, is slow and costly.

The volatility of Bitcoin is also why it is challenging as a unit of account and as an effective store of value.

Bitcoin does have a limited supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. However, cryptocurrencies don’t have a limited supply. It is possible to create an infinite number of cryptocurrencies just like Bitcoin. Just like copying and pasting the code - For example, Bitcoin 2, 3 could be made etc.,. As of today there are 6,955 different cryptocurrencies.

What Bitcoin has that other cryptocurrencies doesn’t, as the first mover, is a certain infrastructure and *community.* But how valuable is that? Every dead currency has also had infrastructure and a community. Myspace had a pretty thriving community before Facebook existed. It is possible another, or many other superior cryptocurrencies could be created and replace bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin Vs Gold Vs USD**

**Gold - Store of Value** (with advantages)

Gold, has advantages compared to United States Dollar and Bitcoin as a store of value, gold has by far the longest history of the three and was recognised as far back as the ancient Egyptians as an object of beauty - representing a sungod but it was first used as a currency in 700 B.C.

Gold is deeply embedded into our cultural psychology and we can say that it does have some value of beauty that has survived throughout different cultures in our history and exists to this day which shouldn’t be underestimated.

Another advantage of gold is that it also has limited supply unlike the USD.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin - Store of Value &amp; Medium of Exchange (with advantages)**

Compared to the US Dollar it has advantages as a medium of exchange that also has a store of value (that has a limited supply unlike the United States Dollar).

Bitcoin serves a purpose as a store of value just like gold. The advantage compared to gold is that it can be used as ***both*** a store of value and a a medium of exchange (international, fast, anonymous money transfers). However it is quite new and it is remains to be seen how important this is as it is mostly used as a store of value now.

There are many similarities between people buying Bitcoin and Gold as a store of value but also differences.

One difference is that people are buying Bitcoin because they think it will increase in price in the future, and so it might be a better store of value compared to gold because it will increase in value and become more valuable (10x or 20x).

Traditionally, gold has been a ""safer"" store of value, with a lower risk and more stable outcome.

Bitcoin might also be seen as a more secure or easier way to store value than gold. It can be anonymous and electronic.

Bitcoin also has disadvantages as a store of value. It doesn't have as reliable a history as gold. It therefore might be safer to invest in gold.

&amp;#x200B;

**United States Dollar** (medium of exchange with advantages and disadvantages, unit of account, and store of value) (with disadvantages)

The united states dollar main advantage is as a medium of exchange and unit of account. Bitcoin is not great as a medium of exchange and it is still easier in many circumstances to use US Dollar compared to bitcoin.

But Bitcoin does have some advantages as a medium of exchange (international, fast, anonymous money transfers), but it doesn't seem possible that it will ever replace the USD as a medium of exchange.

For USD, as a store of value, with no limit on the supply, it is almost certain that as more is created USD becomes less valuable over time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why bitcoin is worth anything is the same reason that gold and united states dollars are worth anything - because we believe it is.**

Fiat currencies **do** have disadvantages as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Gold can only serve as a store of value, while bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) can serve as a store of value and medium of exchange.

Personally I think we don’t fully have one currency that fully works globally as both a medium of exchange AND store of value AND unit of account. So there is space for something new and better that may or may not be based off blockchain technology.

Currencies have come and gone in the past, and it’s totally possible that a new superior digital currency could be created in the future to replace them all.

However, exactly how much they’re worth and if they’re worth anything depends entirely on how we use them and on what we all think they’re worth.

gaming,I somehow accidentally ordered three PS5 consoles from Gamestop,"9/16 - The night Sony surprise dropped the PS5 pre-orders I was locked in, frantically trying to get a system, just like the rest of America. As I am sure many of you experienced, there were several times I made it as far as adding a system or bundle to my cart at Gamestop, only to get timed out, or have an error and not make it all the way through checkout.

About 30 minutes into trying to score any system I could get my hands on, it looked like I was finally going to be successful. I had a digital edition in the cart and my card was processing, or so I thought. Once the page refreshed there was no order confirmation and I had an error that something went wrong. Disheartened, but still determined, I forged on. The single systems available had all been snapped up, and all that remained were several overpriced bundles.

I did the best I could, adding different combinations of systems based on their included components, trying feverishly to get an order to go through. After close to an hour with no luck, and the availability of bundles dwindling, I took a deep breath, sighed, and added the most expensive (and least attractive for what was included) bundle to the cart and gave it one last shot. Success! The order went through, I had a confirmation number that I quickly took a screen shot of, and exchanged a spirited high five with my wife!

I thought okay cool, GS will send me a confirmation email and we'll cruise until the release date. Crickets. Nothing. No emails from GS. Luckily, I had the order number saved, and the website confirmed the order was in process. I decided not to worry about the missed email and went on with life. 10/26- the first email comes from GS saying my order was ""delayed"" by the manufacturer, which turned out to be a delay for one of the bundle games Destruction All-stars.

10/29 I receive an email that my order ""is dropping soon"". Niiiiice. 10/30 I receive another email saying my order ""is dropping soon"" and think ""cool, thanks for the hype.""

11/8 I receive two emails stating the order will be shipped soon, with an arrival date of 11/15. I have honestly been so busy at work that the release date kind of snuck up on me, and I start to get excited.

11/10 another email that my order is shipping soon. I figure its just Gamestop and their shit marketing team spamming my email for clicks.

11/12 I receive a text from Fedex that my package is on the way, and an email from Gamestop that my order is arriving today. I recall thinking ""oh cool, the order came early"". The bundle showed up, it appeared to be everything I remember ordering, and it was pretty great! PS5 is pretty dang cool.

11/13 Saturday morning I receive another text from Fedex saying a delivery is on the way. We've been ordering a lot of things for the holidays and have had a ton of deliveries in general with COVID-19, so I didn't think anything of it. Fast forward to the same delivery guy from the day before with a smirk on his face, and my wife saying ""that looks like the same box they sent the PS5 in"". Well lo-and-behold here comes a PS5 digital edition non-bundled. LOL! I begin checking my credit card for additional charges. There are several Gamestop charges showing for varied amounts. One amount matches the bundle that was delivered, but 2 other charges for amounts less than the $399.99 digital edition. Weird.

11/14 I receive another charge from Gamestop for over $600, and at this point nothing makes sense. I pull up the tracking info from the original email for Fedex, and it says I have another shipment on the way tomorrow. Pretty sure its another full bundle.

TLDR: Tried pre-ordering a PS5 from Gamestop, thought I only got 1 system, it looks like I actually got 3",technology
personalfinance,Maxing out multiple retirement accounts VS Paying debts.,"Be gentle, please, lol . 

My wife and I have yearly combined gross income of $171k. We have been just maxing out both of our Roth IRAs and my Roth TSP (hello government job). We weren't doing anything with her work's 401k program because it didn't match, the fees were horrendous, etc. We thought nothing of it until her clinic got acquired by a larger company that actually has matching. Aside: She's a physical therapist and until COVID-19 we thought her career field was stable. Her story is like a lot of others: furloughed for a few months (eventually hired back) and had to collect unemployment. We were totally fine and were lucky enough to have savings that we never had to touch. 

Now we feel like we can consider maxing her 401k as an option and can't artificially pat ourselves on the back because we ""are doing everything we can for retirement."" 

Here's our layout... 

Debts:

Car loan: \~$13.5k @ 3.49% ($40k financed 5 yrs, payment $766/monthly - Bought new in 2018; it was nearly totaled by a deer a month after purchasing it and selling it would be a big loss due to accident on the CARFAX - ouch/regret)

Student loan: \~$25k @ 3.25% ($60k financed 5 yrs, $856/monthly)

Floor Loan: \~$3.5k @ 0% ($4k financed 1 yr; taking advantage of 0% because it makes no sense not to; will pay off before the promotion ends)

Mortgage: $345k @ 2.75% (30 year note, $1700/month; Not interested in paying this down too fast b/c low interest and we wont own for more than 5 yrs)

Assets:

Emergency HYSA: $11k (took a hit after buying a house and reno, trying to build back up to $20k)

Retirement Accts: $71k (2xRoth IRA/1xRoth TSP)

Our take home pay is about $13k/month. Our mortgage is covered by a housing stipend from my job and we donate 10% of monthly income to church/charities. We typically double our loan payments. When we got married we went the Dave Ramsay route and paid loans down as fast as we could. After more research and realizing that we are fiscally responsible enough to not live out of envelopes, we started maxing out retirement accounts and paid less on loans because our interest rates are low. We are planning starting a family in the next two years and will most likely have to upgrade a vehicle (used and not so freaking expensive). This will obviously mean a shift in budgeting again so that adds another dynamic to the story.  

The big question is this: Do we continue our path of maxing out 3 Retirement accts and paying down debts OR do we pay mins on loans and max out my wife's 401k along with the rest that we are already maxing. It fits in our budget sheet and we can make it work without feeling like we are changing lifestyle/cutting back.   I know there are multiple ways to look at this and it seems like each quarter we both change our minds on how to do it. This is my first time doing this so please let me know if y'all need more info. TIA, y'all!",finance
personalfinance,Did I buy a house that’s too expensive?,"I bought a house, and am starting to have some anxiety that we went too high vs our income.

House price: just about $1.5M (with 20% down, 30 yr loan).
Interest rate: 2.5%.
Income: $450k reliably, but 600 in 2020 and a bit more expected in 2021
No student loan debt, no car payment, no cc debt (we pay our balance off in full every month).
$250k in emergency funds (about 40% is in index funds so it fluctuates) not including retirement accounts.

Very high cost of living city (either first or second in the US). 

Depending on which rule of thumb that I use, I get that we are well within the safe range, to stretched. A second opinion would be great to quell my fears or not.

Thank you for any thoughts.

Edit: changed income from 482 to 450 to exclude a 32k amount that may not recur every year.

Edit 2: I’m not Dave Ramsey, we can’t afford to be that risk averse with house prices here (as much as I’d love to). I also don’t want to be on the risky side of the spectrum.",finance

investing,"Commodity investing, the next great bull market and what 5 commodities can profit from it most","TLDR: I believe precious metals and industrial materials markets will provide a better return on invested capital compared other market sectors and will be the main drivers of the next bull market. These industries have been cyclical for decades and this trend won’t change now.

As you all may or may not have noticed, the stock market and especially the tech giants have been on an incredible run as of late. Even though many people expect a general market downturn in the near future, myself included, it cannot be denied that these companies have presented an incredible return on invested capital in the past few months and years. These shares have not been the only ones on a tear in the last few months however, with precious metal miners going up in multiples since the lows seen in march. Because of the way monetary policy is implemented at the moment, with an aggressive targeting of inflation by the FED and the printing of trillions of dollars, I have shifted my attention to what I think will be the next great bull market. Remember, just because something has been going up or going down for a long time, does not mean it will keep being this way, especially not when looking at investing in commodities.

After the decade long bull market we have seen, what do I think will be the next bull market after all this is set and done? Commodities, specifically precious metals followed by industrial materials. We all know that when a currency is being devalued by printing trillions of it, investors tend to take their money and put it into 'safer' investments. These investments have historically been gold and silver, who last experienced great bull markets in the 1980's and after the 2000 dot-com bubble. Now it looks like everything is in place for another massive bull run, where investors will move a part of their portfolio into these assets both as a safety net and an chance to take part in the precious metals bull market. The three decade average holding of precious metals and precious metals related assets in the US has been around 2%, but today it is somewhere between 0.5 and 1%. Especially considering bonds now yield an almost negative return, I have no doubts that the average of 2% will be revisited and overshot, as the biggest competitor of precious metals is providing a negative inflation adjusted return on investment. I am a firm believer that we will see higher gold and silver prices the more the dollar (and other currencies around the world) lose value. How high? Nobody knows, but predictions of $5,000 gold and $100 silver have not been uncommon. What do you invest in? That will be discussed further below.

But am I only going to invest in precious metals? Absolutely not, because while I feel like this bull market is inevitable, I also believe that after the coming economic slowdown that will paint the next two to three years, countries are going to try their hardest to improve their own economies again. This has historically been done with heavy investments in things like infrastructure of all kinds. Regular industrial materials like copper, oil, platinum, lithium, uranium and steel have not been the best investments over the past few years, but an industrial material bull market will change all that. With an economic rebuild comes the need for these materials and because the respective prices for these materials have been relatively low over the past few years, I expect a major turnaround to incentivize the new production the world is going to need to properly get back on its feet. Prices of things like oil, lithium, copper and especially uranium will shoot up and the companies that produce these materials will go right up there with it. I am especially bullish on uranium, of which I wrote about many times of which I believe will reward patient and strong handed investors who can handle it's volatility on the way up.

To truly see how undervalued commodities are compared to regular equities in the S&amp;P 500, I would recommend looking at the chart mentioned here: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodities-watch-2020-170025867.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commodities-watch-2020-170025867.html)

When something is so underinvested in and has all the catalysts in place to rally upwards, a subsequent bull market will be all the more violent on the upside. According to Rick Rule, one of the best commodity investors of the past few decades and CEO of Sprott Global, this will be the investment of choice for him and all his clients and after looking at the numbers, I can't say anything except I fully agree with him. This investment idea is gaining traction and while it is good to always be diversified, it would almost be foolish not to allocate at least a part of your portfolio into commodities. It is what I will be doing and I expect it to outperform the broad equities market in the coming decade. In a cyclical industry, you are either a contrarian or you are going to be too late.

Now I will share with you what I believe will be the 5 commodities that will benefit the most from a precious metals and industrial materials bull market. These markets are inherently cyclical and after a decade long slowing down of these industries, it is time the cycle fully turns.

1. Uranium

A commodity I have talked about on here at length (if you want to know the details, check my post history) and a commodity that I feel like offers the most asymmetrical risk/reward investment one can make in the current market. In short, uranium is used to fuel nuclear power plants, which are in turn responsible for around 15% of all the power generation in the US and 10% globally. The amount of power plants is growing, mostly in Asia, but the supply has dwindled because of low prices. The price of the commodity has to at the very least double from here to incentivize the new production needed to keep the lights on. There are only a few miners left in this sector and it has a total market cap of around 12 billion dollars, which is ridiculously low for something that provides so much value to power generation. When the general investment community and institutional investors decide to invest in uranium, it will be like moving the contents of the Hoover Dam through a straw.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Cameco (CCJ), Energy Fuels (UUUU) and Denison Mines (DNN)

2. Silver

Often seen as the little brother to gold, I am more bullish on silver than gold for the simple reason that silver is used widely for industrial materials. From solar panels to phones and from medicine to photography, silver is a metal that has many uses and is thus not easily replicable. It is also the case the silver is often not produced as a separate product, but mostly as a side product when mining for things like gold and copper. Add to that the fact that silver can often not be recycled and mostly ends up on the waste dump with the electronics it is in, makes this commodity scarce. The scarcity of this commodity means that if supply is not ramped up significantly, the price will go up because of the enormous demand for this metal. Lastly, silver is also often seen as a hedge against inflation just like gold, which can be another good reason to invest in it seeing how much money is being printed.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Pan American Silver (PAAS), First Majestic Silver (AG) and SSR Mining (SSRM)

3. Copper

Probably the most commonly used commodity on this list, copper is used in almost every single electrical device or contraption you can think of. Copper is used because it conducts electricity and heat extremely well, making it a core component in and ever more electrified world. The more we as a society focus on electricity to meet our everyday needs, from electric vehicles to the devices we used to read this very post, the more we will rely on copper. It is the same story as with most other commodities, the price has to go up or there will be a shortage of the commodity. When something is so key to our everyday life, it is quite easy to see where this will go. There are also nearly no new tier 1 copper deposits in the world, so bringing new supply online is not nearly as easy as it might be with other commodities.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Freeport McMoran (FCX), Rio Tinto (RIO) and Lundin Mining (LUNMF)

4. Gold

The thing a lot of people see as ‘real money’. Gold, for thousands of years, has been used as something to trade goods for or to back a different type of ‘money’. Even after the abolishment of the gold standard, this view of gold has not changed and it has been on quite the run recently. Gold has increased from roughly 1200 dollars per ounce at the end of 2018 to almost breaching the 2,000 dollar threshold in 2020. Many analysts believe it will not stop here, with figures ranging from 3,000 all the way to 15,000 dollar gold all being quoted. As mentioned before, with the seemingly endless printing of new money and further debasement of fiat currencies all around the world, gold is both a store of value as well as an investment vehicle. The only reason it is fourth on this list, is because uranium, silver and copper all have major industrial uses, instead of just being a store of value. However, that definitely does not mean one should pass on gold, for something that is considered as ‘the only true form of currency’ can prove to be a great investment in an ever more turbulent world.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Barrick Gold (GOLD), Agnico-Eagle Mines (AEM) and B2Gold (BTG)

5. Lithium

The world is being electrified more and more and just like that benefits copper, silver and uranium, it also benefits lithium. Lithium is silver colored chemical metal that has many uses, but the wide use in battery technology is the reason I am bullish on the material itself. As more electricity is being generated and more renewable energy sources are being connected to the grid, there has to be a way to store part of that energy to make use of it later or in a different way. Advanced battery technology is what makes renewable energy viable on a broader scale, it is what makes all these electric cars able to get on the road and it is a relatively rare metal in high demand. I expect this high demand to increase further as we come to depend more on battery technology.

The companies I would look at within this commodity are: Albemarle (ALB), SQM (SQM) and Livent (LTHM)",finance

personalfinance,Using government incentives to drive an electric car for almost free? (with a catch),"Hello everybody!

Im not sure if this the right subreddit for this and I apologize if its not, but I have this idea and basically want to know if anyone knows if i'm missing anything. So - here's my general idea:

This is only really applicable in Germany, but the general idea is:

Step 1: Get a Loan for the price of a Tesla Model 3 (\~42k Euro) with a low Interest Rate (\~2% is achievable), and the option to pay back the full price any time and sell the vehicle.

Step 2: Buy the Car

Step 3: Claim the 3k Euro incentive by Tesla and the 6k Euro incentive by the German Government for Electric Cars (I think the 3k is already included in the list price so we'll just go with 6k)

Step 4: Pay the monthly payments for a year (If you got an absurdly long running Loan of say 96 Months, thats 480 a month). Over a year that totals to 5760 Euros (you see where this is going)

Step 5: Once the year is over, sell the car for almost no loss (I don't know why they keep their value that much), let's say 39k, and pay off the outstanding balance of your Loan with that money.

Step 6: Repeat.

Of course you'd have to pay for insurance and taxes and would loose a little bit to depreciation, but I'm failing to see why this concept wouldn't work. I checked the rules for the Government Incentives for electric cars in Germany and couldn't find anything that hinted at a maximum number of claims in a specific time frame.

Bitcoin,Threats to Bitcoin's Scarcity *Discussion*,"First off, I would say that moving to anything resembling the following practices will result in the decline of scarcity in bitcoin and ruin the market value after this impending bull run:

&amp;#x200B;

1. USDT:

USD Tether (a stable coin in crypto world) is supposed to be pegged to $1 at all times. In theory, it's a great way to avoid huge swings in volatility. The issue is a time ago, they changed their statement from all USDT was back by $1 of real world currency at any time. To its new statement which basically reads that it is now backed by less than a dollar. This sparking a huge controversy about over printing the supply or straight up printing more than you have to control markets for short/long periods of time. Basically anything involving manipulating the markets to better themselves and their ""cartel."" 

UPDATE:  We are waiting for the law to pass a decision on USDT. If they are deemed unlawful or a scam. We could see the markets plummet indefinitely due to the fact that tether props up A VERY HUGE PERCENTAGE of the markets in the first place. Also on a coin flip, letting them continue printing whenever they feel like it is just as bad in the long as well.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  Fractional Reserve and Bitcoin:

If bitcoin was to be fractional reserved and lent accordingly, we could end up with a total supply so bogus that it will actually put an end to scarcity entirely. This could allow the government(s) full control over the whole crypto ecosystem. All the alt coins would be at Bitcoins demise if they could choose to add more or take away at any time. This would cause alts to crash and lose massive value that they gain while bitcoin is ""forever"" growing (Satoshi's plan to help stop financial tyranny.)

Add that in with future markets (looking at you oil) and you could see bitcoin being tamed but only let loose with volatility when the government felt like it.  Then they can claim its just crypto and it's volatile. Not a fun road to go down because. . . THIS IS HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ALL ARE TODAY! Look up fractional reserve lending online and once you understand how it works you will realize why we are trillions upon trillions in debt.  Basically the FED made USA take out a proverbial ""credit card,"" that we can't pay the interest off. The reason why is because our government (this is a HIGHLY debated topic,) has 3 big issues.

&amp;#x200B;

FRAC. SUB Statement 

1.  It doesn't have a balanced budget.

&amp;#x200B;

FRAC. SUB Statement 

2. Military spending, ""black budget"" or not, is ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

FRAC. SUB Statement 

3. DUMPING TRILLIONS into failed companies and businesses to keep them afloat.  While led by bad practices and poor financial choices that should cause them to fail and go bankrupt like everyone else. ESPECIALLY LARGE CORPORATION AND BANKS!!! Meaning they know when they give them the bail out they will just go bankrupt again indefinitely. 

I also have to add in that this is the exact REASON WHY BITCOIN WAS INVENTED! To fight this exact issue. Over printing the monetary supply / hence the term is called ""fractional reserve lending."" Which brings us to our last point. . .

&amp;#x200B;

3. PAYPAL has began printing paper bitcoin which is basically the same as number two. They are artificially increasing the supply which if left unchallenged will become the norm of many fortune 500 companies who will set up shop in this fashion. Please I urge everyone to see that the ELITE (whoever you call them...) has started its attack on bitcoin and I believe this will be the plan: 

&amp;#x200B;

(THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE)

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Elite and Wall street are frantically buying up as much bitcoin as they can. The next part would be suppress people from entering or learning about the space because they probably can't prevent this bull run because of one reason. .  . They have to much skin in the game at the moment, however once we peak at our new all time high ($100,000 - $300,000 only guessing.) Youtube is a great example of the suppression going on by shadow banning people or straight up banning someone in the first place with little to no reason. This is so people don't have main stream access to this life changing asset class.

 They already removed some of the biggest exchanges so they don't have to worry about them selling or manipulating the price and messing with their affairs. During the time, after all time high, i feel they will sell or will have sold after the alt run. I can't say if the alt run will have happen or not, because soon after all time high and it looks questionable I predict they will announce USD tether is unlawful or a scam and send bitcoin and alts in a very big death spiral indefinitely. 

&amp;#x200B;

HOW I FEEL:  The reason why I am so passionate about bitcoin and the space is because I have been in it for almost 10 years. It has changed my life for the better. I bought my first house with most of the proceeds and live a comfortable life (not rich, but good.) I just want everyone to have the same experience I had and realized this was made for us, by a man whom wanted us to decouple from a flawed monetary system that just drains people money, and their soul.

The dollar can barely buy anything and the lower class all but struggles to live, while the 1% (now smaller percentage) owns 99% of all the money supply. How did we let this happen??? That's another story for another time. The real question is. . .

&amp;#x200B;

Will you let this continue to happen with Bitcoin???

1. Learns the basics

Personal finance and investing is an awesome thing to get into because you can dig as deep into it as you want or stay at the surface level. There is a reason why some of the smartest investing minds in the world (Warren Buffett) read for hours on end. The finance world evolves, markets change, and the way people behave with money moves around. With that being said, you need to learn the basics. What are the basics?

“Spend less than you make, invest the difference”

Spend – Create a budget. Fixed expenses and then fun money. 

Make – Get a job that allows you to save a little bit of cash

Invest – Dollar Cost Average, 401k, Roth IRA, brokerage account, withdrawal rates. 

It will be easy to go down a rabbit hole when reading about personal finance to the point where it might even intimidate you. Learn the basics and get started. There are plenty of free online resources that will help you understand best practices like which % of your budget towards certain items and how to invest. You have some time to iron out the details. The worst thing you can do is not start. 

2. Keep it simple: Index Funds

Index funds. Index Funds. Index Funds. 

I don’t know how else to say this but I would recommend you start off with index funds. I know it isn’t what /r/stocks or /r/wallstreetbets is going to tell you but index funds will allow you to get a piece of the pie without the risk of individual stocks. The worst thing that could happen to you is you throw a grand in a stock based on a tip on Reddit and you get wiped out to the point where you don’t even want to invest in the market anymore. 

Hey competitiveduck, that is great but how do I avoid the FOMO of all these tech gains?

Understand that cycles happen. “Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered”. Look into the top 10 companies by market cap for each decade. Companies come and go. I am not anti-stock at all. I recommend that people play around with stocks to avoid FOMO but only once they have enough in index funds to where compound interest takes over. I didn’t buy a single share of stock until I had &gt;100k invested in index funds and even now it is a small % of my larger portfolio.

3. Get the money

Get the money. You have to be selfish in your career at this point when your expenses are fairly low and you don’t have the responsibilities of a family. Change cities, change jobs, change companies. Get money. If you are all about starting a low-level job in a company with the idea that in 30 years you might be the CEO great, but there is only 1 CEO job for a reason. Maximize earnings in your 20s as much as you can, invest, and wait. If you don’t believe me, look up videos or pictures of what happens at 65 based on when you start investing. The difference in net worth is staggering. Get money. 

4. It easiest to compare yourself to others post-college

I’m not sure there will ever be a time in your life where it is easiest to feel bad about yourself than right after college. You go from everybody playing the same game in college to now everybody is in separate leagues and playing a different sport. You have a friend in law school in debt up to their ass, you have a friend crushing it at Google, you have a friend struggling to figure things out and there might be you just hoping to get enough money for guac at Chipotle. Understand that you don’t need to be anywhere else than where YOU think you need to be. Life tends to even itself out. 

“Comparison is the thief of joy”

5. Keep in touch with friends and take care of your body 

To echo on the last point, good friends are hard to come by the older you get. Try and keep in touch with them as much as possible and plan trips to see them. Some of my best friends still are my college friends. Use them as a base but don’t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and explore new people. 

In regard to staying in shape, there is no sense in retiring early if your body isn’t able to do things you want to do. Plain and simple. 

6. Do what works for you, not what works in a spreadsheet

You are going to hear about all the ways you can tinker with your investments or take on debt and theoretically it works in a spreadsheet, but spreadsheets aren’t rooted in reality. Some of these include how it is easier to put less than 20% down on a house because interest rates are so low and invest the difference, or how you should invest 80% of your paycheck to tap into investing. Morgan Housel has a way of investing and I think it is great in that you should invest in a way that “helps you sleep at night” and in a way that you can do it consistently for decades. Do what works for you. 

7. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme

Understand the game that you are playing. Investing Twitter and TV networks react to daily moves in the market. You aren’t in it for the short term, you are in it for the long term. If you are in your early 20’s you probably have a 30-40-year time horizon. Think of all the crazy world events that have happened in the last 30-40 years alone. COVID, 08 Financial Crisis, Iraq War, 9/11, Dot Com Crash, and then the 1987 Market Crash. All of those “world is ending” type events have led to a 9.42% average return before inflation. To tap into the power of compound interest you need to stay in the market for a long period of time.

“Interrupting a favorable power law is the worst mistake you can make as an investor.” – Naval

8. Read the top posts on this subreddit but be aware of survivorship bias 

The fact that you are in this subreddit is a great start. Use the resources in the wiki to learn about investment options and what works for other people. Learn about people who have achieved FIRE and how they got there. Most of the time it is a bumpy road with kids, large one-off expenses, buying a house, changing careers, etc. Like the stock market, it is rarely a smooth ride. However, there is a lot of survivorship bias in here about people who have achieved FIRE. For every person who has achieved it, there are probably 10 who have given up, ruined a relationship, or became miserable due to extreme saving. Please understand that this is a grind and if you aren’t happy now with the hopes of being happy 30 years ago, I’d advise you to take a step back and read the below post. It is essential reading.

personalfinance,"New job, how to maximize net worth &amp; rent vs. buy?","I'm just about to finish grad school and very excited that I just accepted a new job! Since I have a completely blank slate, I'd love to get advice on some things to maximize my earnings/savings/net worth since I know planning is key. Specifically, I'm interested in your thoughts on whether I should rent or buy when I move out.

Details:
23 years old, no debt
Columbia, MD (halfway between DC and Baltimore)
$110k salary (+10% employer retirement match)
$60k savings/liquid investments
$20k 401k/IRA savings
Parents more than willing to loan me money if I need to make a big purchase.

I'm not 100% sure where I'll end up living, but I'm looking at areas within about 30 minutes drive of Columbia, which includes a lot of suburbs or some areas closer to DC proper or Baltimore.

I'm looking to move in with my girlfriend, probably a 1-bd. or 2-bd. apartment, and it seems like most of these end up somewhere in the $1,200-2,000/month range. Right now my girlfriend makes significantly less than I do, so I will likely end up covering 60-90% of the rent cost at least for a while.

Aside from general advice on how to manage money in a new city/first job (I expect to continue being a huge saver so I'm not too worried), my main question is whether it might make sense to consider buying a townhouse or house. There seem to be a fair amount of decent listings in the $200-300k range and with interest rates near an all-time low, combined with my 760+ credit, it seems like mortgage payments could end up being the same or even cheaper per month than renting. Plus, my payments would be going towards equity in the house rather than to someone else. (Although I have no idea whether the housing market is at a high/low right now and whether the property value might go up or down in the future).

Is it a bad idea to buy a house right out of college? Or does it potentially make some sense in my situation to take advantage of the low interest rates? I'm expecting to stay in this job for at least 3 years, and in all likelihood probably 5+ years. I'm also open to renting extra rooms if there are any to potentially generate additional income towards the mortgage.

I really appreciate any advice!",finance

We have about 9k on a credit card that we just can't put a dent in (we have a baby now), its been there for 3 years. I have about $6500 in stock/mutual funds from my grandpa that is earning the average 8-11% annually. Credit card is at like, 22% current purchase apr. We are trying to move within the next year. Just about every financial website would say that it makes sense to use the cash from stocks to pay down the credit card if the credit card has a higher interest rate than the stocks gain. Figured I'd ask the audience as well. Does this make sense for us to do, in order to make our debt to income ratio more attractive? 

*edit* We both contribute to a 401K through our employers so in my mind the stocks have always existed as an island, not really doing anything.

*edit x2* I guess I'll give some more context. We have a budget that allows us to pay our bills and contribute to savings, as well as a small amount of discretionary.

personalfinance,From June to July my Experian FICO credit rating inexplicably dropped 38 points. Should I be concerned?,"Over the past number of years I've steadily built up my credit from the high 600s to the 830s- not really an intentional effort, just the result of practicing good habits. From late 2019 to June of this year my monthly report would show my rating fluctuating by a few points positive or negative, but it stayed in that 830ish range. 

This year, from June to July, my rating mysteriously dropped 38 points to 793 and in the reports since then it has occasionally increased or decreased by a point or two. 

Nothing in my credit history has changed significantly- I haven't opened any new accounts and I've consistently maintained a usage rate of about 2% on all of my accounts while paying my balance in full on every CC account each month. My payment history is listed as exceptional and I have no collections on file. 

The only thing that happened between June and July is I finished paying off my car loan. I imagine that since that account is now closed and because it was one of my older accounts that could have an impact, but the average age of my accounts is 7.5 years (mainly weighted from student loans) and my credit cards range from 2-4 years old. 

Is it normal for a credit score to drop like this when a loan is paid off (or for any other reason)? Should I be concerned at all or just keep plugging along? I'm not planning on buying a home or making any other huge investment that would required applying for an interest rate in the near future so I'm not overly concerned, just a bit surprised to see such a large drop that has not since corrected itself when my credit habits haven't really changed at all.",finance

personalfinance,self-employed first time homebuyer (a cautionary tale about lending) (Long),"Long.... TLDR at bottom....

As the title says, I am a self-employed first time homebuyer.  I want to share my experience so that others in similar positions won't make the same mistake I did!  I have owned my business (a sole proprietorship) for several years, and although it brings in about $75k per year which is more than enough for me to pay bills and live alone in a rather expensive city,  I have been deducting a lot of expenses so my taxable income is not that high.  Surprisingly I was still able to get preapproved for a mortgage.  However my budget was low for my area and I was priced out of most homes.  My options were limited to condos and manufactured homes, and my realtor quickly talked me out of a MH because they don't appreciate in value.  I ended up getting an accepted offer on a condo that needs some work, but was well within my budget and has a lot of potential.  I had 20% down so was able to avoid PMI, and my monthly payments, even with the HOA fees, will be just $100 more per month than rent so I will be able to build equity and be in a better position in a few years to possibly upgrade to a larger home.  I also have almost zero debt and a credit score of 800.  (student loans and car paid off, just a couple of smaller credit card balances to go). 

That all sounds good so here is where the trouble starts...Being new to the home buying game, I began to make some rookie mistakes.  I tried to learn as much as I could about the process by reading articles and watching videos, and talking to homeowner friends.  However, I missed some crucial information about lending.  I found a lender through Zillow, where they ask for your information and have a lender get in touch with you who matches your needs.  For some reason I was matched with an out of state lender, and I actually didn't think much of it and didn't realize that might be a problem.  

The lender got me preapproved rather quickly and was initially fairly helpful.  I didn't really vibe with the personality of this lender but also didn't realize how much time I would be spending interacting with him over the next few weeks.  (mistake #1- I should have switched at this point).  My realtor asked me if I had a lender and I said yes, I have one who preapproved me so I guess I will work with them.  She was not pushy at all about it but said if I need it, she would recommend someone that she likes.  (I should have taken her up on this offer and strongly regret that I didn't, although I got quite the education from this process).  I submitted all documents to the lender as he asked, but the process was not smooth.  He kept sending my documents over to underwriting, and then coming back a day or two later asking for more info.  This went on for weeks and was maddening and stressful.  He would not give me a straight answer about where my loan was in the process and would just continuously say ""we have to wait.  I am working as fast as I can.""  My realtor started to get frustrated with him and would call frequently to check on the process.  He would not cooperate with her and started to actually get really rude and mean.  I called the branch manager to try and get more information about what was going on, and he did not call me back.  

We were several weeks in and I felt stuck.  At this point we were worried that if I decided to switch lenders, it would significantly delay the process and the seller would back out.  So I chose to just suck it up and deal with this asshole of a lender and hope that he would finish up my loan quickly and be out of my life.  Of course this is not what happened.  Because I'm self-employed, the lender needed so many more documents and pieces of information than they would for a W-2 employee buyer.  This was especially true due to the pandemic- they required me to explain how my business would survive the pandemic and were going over my business finances with a fine-toothed comb.  This was just making the process take forever, and I also realized I was dealing with a big bureaucratic organization that did not actually care about getting me into this house.  

So, I finally get closing disclosures at 45 days in, and I start to think it's over and I am actually about to be a homeowner!  Not so fast- at this point it turns into a disaster. The final approval stage comes, and underwriting wants an audit of my business finances. They won't approve the loan without it.   In a panic, I call my accountant (who is not my bookkeeper) who explains what a big deal doing an audit is, and he recommends that I switch lenders because auditing is expensive and time consuming, and could lead to me needing to re-file my tax returns for the previous year (!). So my loan is denied at the last minute and I feel like a fool for choosing this lender, not knowing enough about the lending process, and not shopping around, and also wondering if I need to hire a bookkeeper because apparently I am terrible at it.   

My realtor comes up with a plan and surprisingly convinces the seller to extend for another month, while we switch lenders to someone she knows well who actually has experience with buyers in my situation.  This new lender is amazing!  He calls me on a Saturday and looks over my application, saying he can't see why I would be denied even after I explained the problem that led to me being initially denied,  and that he thinks he can get me a loan in a couple of weeks, and with a better interest rate!  And he's actually nice on the phone!  So this is where I currently stand, 6 weeks after an accepted offer, starting over with a new lender, hoping it will work out the second time.  He also promised that if there is something that looks ""off"" with my business finances, which could lead to a denied loan, that he will tell me right away so I don't have to go through this again.  The most frustrating thing about this is that if the initial lender had told me 2 weeks in, that it wasn't going to work because of a problem with my bookkeeping, it would have been plenty of time for me to clean it up or find a new lender without all the drama and grief of being denied at the 11th hour.   I'm not sure if it's ok to call out the name of the company but if it is I will mention in the comments.  They suck because they denied my loan at the last minute and weren't up front with me about the process.  I blame myself for choosing them mostly, but am also mad at how they treated me.  

TLDR:  choosing the right lender is extremely important.  Please shop around and ask them how experienced they are working with self-employed borrowers if that is applicable to you.  Go with a local company and not a big national bank.  You can switch if the lender sucks, even if you are a few weeks into the process.  Also, now I know 100% more about getting a mortgage than I did a few months ago so at least this process has been educational if not extremely frustrating.",finance
personalfinance,"Retirement, college debt, and lifestyle","I went to a top 4 computer science school that was extremely expensive for me and my parents. Due to this, I had to graduate in 2 years, but that still equates to around 130K that I owe my parents. I also have around 20K in federal student loans. I am currently working making around 210K, but in the Bay Area, housing is quite expensive so I have roommates. Fortunately, I don't need to spend on food and stuff since we're given that at work.

I'm currently saving up to the company matching max for retirement in a 401K, which is 9K matched at 50% (so I put in 18K, company matches 9K, a total of 27K per year). I'm only putting 8% of my annual pre-tax income into retirement, which I heard is a very low percentage. I have heard people talk about putting money into IRAs, but I don't really see the benefit of doing that since they are post-tax dollars anyway, in which I can simply put into stocks that I can freely withdraw? What other benefits are there to opening up IRAs? 

Regarding my debt to my parents, I obviously want to pay it off extremely quickly. My parents insists on not rushing, but I want to clear it out the way. Is it worth paying the ""gift tax"" on repayment over 10K each year? Is there a way around paying the gift tax?

My federal student loans are at a pretty low interest rate and my company matches my payments up until a certain amount. After some calculation, if I spread out my payments up to that match amount, I can pay it off in around 5 years. Is this a good decision? Or will it be in my best interest to pay it off as soon as possible and not taking full advantage of the company match?

Finally, I expect to get promoted within year. This leads to about a 60K hike in salary to around 280K. I know lifestyle creep is a thing, but I would really like to invest and save as much as possible. I'm thinking of real estate, but I virtually cannot afford even the cheapest down payment in the Bay Area. A couple of my friends are buying properties on the East coast and midwest, so I'm thinking that might be a better idea, but I have no idea if the logistical nightmare of investing so far away is worth. Would you all recommend investing in REIT funds or otherwise in the stock market over real estate? Are ROI roughly the same?

Thanks for your help and time! I'm extremely young (20) and didn't really get finance lessons like this. I feel really immature going into the real world, and I want to really watch out for common traps that people like me fall in. On that note, it'll be wonderful if there are any general tips and things to keep in mind as I start my career?",finance

I grew up in a single parent household, I was never hungry, but the situation certainly wasn’t the picture financial stability.  In 2018 I became a nurse practitioner. I work in a federal position where l receive an annual salary of $104,000. I have a fiancé, we have no dependents. Our finances are completely independent from one another at this moment.

I personally have no student loan debt, she has nearly $200,000 in student loan debt, but her earning potential is much higher than my own. I mention this because I believe it affects our ability to contribute to an IRA. We live in a home where utilities/mortgage/car payment  are $1,700. We have no other expenses. The outstanding amount for the vehicle is $15,000 for a 2018 Subaru Impreza. 

Currently I am contributing 7% (5% employer match) to my TSP account. I do have an Emergency fund of $4,000 (still contributing to it). As I mentioned before, I don’t believe I will be eligible for an IRA when we get married in a year or so.

investing,"Bitcoin Digital Gold Of 21st Century, Says CitiBank Report. Predicts a BTC price over 300K USD by end of 2021.","https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoins-price-action-rhymes-with-1970-gold-markets-says-citibank-200544659

CitiBank MD, and former FX technician, Tom Fitzpatrick, points out distinct analogies between the 1970 gold market and Bitcoin in his latest report, “Bitcoin: 21st Century Gold.”

History of Money and Gold
The seeds of the 1970 bull market in gold were sown back in 1944. After World War II, forty-four countries signed the Bretton Wood Agreement, which shaped the global currency market until 1973.

The agreement pegged the U.S. dollar to gold and all the other currencies against the dollar. It attempted to build a regime where the U.S. dollar was equivalent to gold as a reserve currency.

And, the U.S. became quite successful in achieving this vision.

However, with global industrialization and inflation in the dollar, the preference for gold and other currencies began growing. This caused a gold rush by 1970, as people rushed to swap their bills for the precious metal. Hence, in 1971 US president Richard Nixon broke the ties between greenbacks and gold, giving birth to the fiat regime that we now know.

With a relatively free currency market, gold’s price grew enormously for the next 50 years.

The monetary inflation and devaluation of the greenback are the basis of Fitzpatricks’ comparison of Bitcoin with gold. The report reads:

“Bitcoin move happened in the aftermath of the Great Financial crisis (of 2008) which saw a new change in the monetary regime as we went to ZERO percent interest rates.”

Fitzpatrick pointed out that the first bull cycle in Bitcoin from 2011 to 2013 when it increased by 555 times resulted from this.

Currently, the COVID-19 crisis and the government’s associated monetary and fiscal response are creating a similar market environment as gold in the 1970s. Governments have made it clear that they will not shy away from unprecedented money printing until the GDP and employment numbers are back up.

The above analysis is music to the ears of any Bitcoin enthusiast. What has been oft-preached across crypto forums is finally going mainstream.

Hyberbullish Bitcoin Targets
Fitzpatrick did not stop there; his price prediction chart sees Bitcoin price at $318,000 by December 2021.

Bitcoin Price Prediction ChartBitcoin Price Prediction Chart
The four-year bull and bear cycles post 2011 and the ascending parallel channel since 2013 projects growth of 102 times from the low of $3,200 in 2018 by December 2021. It reads:

“You look at price action being much more symmetrical or so over the past seven years forming what looks like a very well defined channel giving us an up move of similar timeframe to the last rally (in 2017).”

Fitzpatrick also pegs gold at $4,000-$8,000 based on an imminent economic crisis in another report.

Therefore, in all likelihood, the targets for BTC might seem exaggerated to traditional investors. Nevertheless, the principle theory of a paradigm shift in the global currency market is not new. Economist Ray Dalio has hinted at the debasement of the dollar and a paradigm shift as well.

Bitcoin might be the missing link in the new paradigm.

Moreover, the exposure of such a target to America’s largest bank’s institutional clients is alone bullish for the market sentiments.",finance
personalfinance,Fedex says that i did not drop off the iphone,"I'm not sure if this is the right community for this one, i've seen these type of posts in the past so posting it for guidance. 

I bought iphone 12 recently and thought iphone 11 is sufficient, so, i wanted to return 12. I used a fedex drop off box located near my place. It was a raining day, i got down the car, placed the return item and closed the lid and verified that the item is deposited fine. This was on Tuesday, it has been 5 days already and the fed ex site says that the label is created and no other activity. I have contacted the fedex and they have no clue so far, they created a ticket for the request and are still investigating. 

It is very much possible that the fedex person might have stolen it Or the return label has water drops on it causing barcode to be spoiled. I'm hoping that the item is misplaced and they will find it eventually. But, let's say some how it is stolen, i'm looking for options for the worst case. 

What are my options now? I placed the order using my chase freedom through 'paypal'. My CC has lost protection on it and i can claim 500$s by filing a police report etc., Not sure if the police report can be filed for the situation i'm in. What are my options to recover the money i paid? 

Any advice is appreciated. I've never been in this situation, i trusted the fedex drop box and did not anticipate this issue even in my dreams.

Update: Apple received the package after 10 days. I still don’t see any activity in FedEx site. So i guess it is a tracking issue at fedex. I’m pretty glad that i don’t have to deal with police complaint and claims now.",finance

personalfinance,"Does it make more sense to stay in our house or sell the house, use the profits for paying off debts and down payment on a new house with a higher mortgage?","Husband and I are currently in a 20 year mortgage on a $408k loan. We recently secured a $20k home equity line of credit to pay for fixing a crumbling retaining wall (note to potential future buyers - only buy a house with a retaining wall if you can afford to fix it. It's not cheap). We also have other debts. Our tentative plan (and hope) is to get the wall fixed, redo either one or both remaining bathrooms, and sell to get a house with a usable yard since we're stuck at home with two young kids. Houses in our neighborhood have gone way up in value so and are selling like hotcakes so if all goes as planned we'd get enough profit to pay things off and have enough for a 20% down payment. 

Selling this house, which we've put A LOT of money into already and buying a move in ready house with a flat yard would be really nice since then we could spend our weekends doing fun things instead of remodeling, at least as much as possible with things being how they are. 

I guess my question is, does it make more sense to sell even though we're on a 20 year mortgage with a pretty low interest rate (line of credit has a higher rate), and pay off debts, and get a new 30 year mortgage on a house that's at a current price where it potentially wouldn't go up as much in value? If we stayed in this house we'd have it paid off when we're 57 as opposed to the other house which we'd have paid off when we're 67. I know that we could sell it before that with a profit, but obviously we'd get the most back if we paid it off first. 

Of course this is all assuming that the housing market doesn't completely collapse by next summer. Also that all the projects are done by then.",finance
financialindependence,At the request of a couple commenters.. Opportunity Zones explained,"Two posters asked that I explain opportunity zones today and said I should post on it, so here goes... TL/DR investing in opportunity zones defers and offsets capital gains taxes

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the** **Opportunity** **Zone** **Program?**  


As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA""), Congress created the Qualified Opportunity Zones (""QOZ"") program to encourage development in economically distressed communities across the country designated as Opportunity Zones by the various state and federal authorities.    
**What is an** **Opportunity** **Zone?**  
Opportunity Zones are census tracts designated by state and federal governments targeted for economic development.

**How Does the Program Work?**To encourage private investment, the Treasury, acting through the IRS, provides potentially massive tax benefits for investors who invest in Opportunity Zones through a Qualified Opportunity Fund (""Opportunity Fund"").    


A Qualified Opportunity Fund is a private partnership or corporation organized for the purpose of investing in a Qualified Opportunity Zone business or real estate development.    
**What are the Tax Benefits?**  
The biggest draw offered to investors is the chance to defer taxes on recent or potential capital gains from appreciated assets such as real estate or stocks until December 31, 2026.  
By investing in an Opportunity Fund, an investor can:  


* Defer taxes on the original capital gain until the end of 2026.
* Reduce up to 15% of the tax bill on the original capital gains if remain invested in the Fund for at least 7 years.
* Completely eliminate the tax on any appreciation (new capital gains) on the original investment after the 10-year mark in the Opportunity Fund.

The QOZ program is designed to encourage long-term investments.  The longer an investor leaves their capital gains in an Opportunity Fund, the greater the tax savings.  
Here is a summary of the long-term benefits:

The Qualified Opportunity Zones program is a tremendous [opportunity sitting on capital gains to re-invest those gains in an Opportunity Fund to reap massive tax benefits and potential profits.    


At the same time, they would be helping economic development in the neediest neighborhoods across the country by developing businesses and real estate in those communities and, in turn, providing valuable jobs for eager residents. It's a true win-win for everyone involved.",finance
fintech,Where are neobanks going?,"Before that customer experience was built on incumbent models, people still need to visit offices most of the time to get services and banks were comfortable with it.

However, neobanks set the new rules, customers flocked to them and traditional banks found themselves scrambling to keep up.

Now, a few years on from what seemed like an unstoppable rise, things aren’t quite so rosy. With the news of Monzo Bank and Revolut’s increasing annual losses, alongside N26’s withdrawal from key markets and Starling Bank’s introduction of negative interest rates, the question mark of when (if ever) the existing challengers will reach profitability remains.

Rory Stirling, partner at Connect Ventures asks where does the future of consumer finance lie?

He says the hype around challenger banks may have waned, but the fintech revolution is far from over.

This statement is quite true if you analyze the current market. Most of the neobanks focused mainly on changing the banking experience converting most of the operations into digital.

But is it enough to have only a digital version of the bank when with technology we can do many more?

personalfinance,Is it better to pay off my student loans or car loan?,I have one consolidated student loan and new car loan that I pick up back in June. Both are at a little less then 30k currently. Thanks to some saving up and a nice signing bonus for a new job I should have enough to pay off one of them in full by the middle of next year. The car loan is about 422 per month with 0% interest for 6 years ending in 2026. The student loan is 356 for 10 years at 4.93% ending in 2029. My first instinct was to do the student loan because it has an interest rate and the car I bought is a hot hatch so it's practical for single guy but may not be in 4-5 year so paying it off may not mean much if I gotta get another car anyway. But I'm open to any other suggestions and input. Thanks.,finance
personalfinance,Using a Cash Out Refinance to Pay Back Parent for Giving Money to Buy House,"My wife and I bought a foreclosed home back in January 2020. We were going to do a traditional mortgage from a bank to buy the house but were told by our realtor that it was likely only a cash offer would be accepted. So, instead what we did was had my mom put the funds needed to buy the house ($100,000) into a joint bank account (we aren't rich but my dad died recently and had a good life insurance policy). So my wife and I purchased the home with cash from that bank account, and the home is in my name and my wife's name so we legally own it. We had about $50,000 saved up that we then used to remodel and renovate the home. Now we want to get a loan from the bank to pay back my mom what we owe here ($100,000), and I was told we would need to do a cash-out refinance which had higher interest rates and that I couldn't do a traditional mortgage since we already owned the house. So I'm guessing that's my best option unless someone knows otherwise. But here is where the situation gets extra complicated...

The home last appraised for about $170,000 and after our remodeling we believe it could now be worth around $230,000. We know we want to pay back my mom but we were thinking of taking out some additional money in the loan to accomplish a few other goals as we know we can borrow up to 80% of the value of the house without a down payment to cover PMI. So we thought it would be a good opportunity to get a loan at a low-interest rate (around 2.5% to 3% - though we were told rates were lower if we borrowed only 65% of the home's value). So we were thinking about getting enough funds to do a deck remodel, a new roof, and potentially pay off my wife's student loans; she has $70,000 in student loan debt and some of the loans have an interest rate of 6%.

So my question is should I just borrow the money to pay back my mom ($100,000) or should I  potentially borrow the 80% of the home's appraised value (which is possibly around $185,000) so I can have that money set aside to pay the student loans off if need be and also cover final home renovations. We know the interest rate would be about half of what my wife's loan debt is. Or is this a bad plan that unnecessarily puts my house at risk?

The central tenant of MMT is that as a Monetary Sovereign currency issuer, the US government can print as much money as it wants so we shouldn’t worry about running up large national debts/deficits. 

We’ve seen this play out recently with the multi-trillion dollar stimulus plans and the proposed multi-trillion dollar climate plans - there’s no plan for paying back any of that money or any conversations about lowering the national debt/deficit. 

This likely means low interest rates (nearly zero in the US and negative interest rates in Europe) for quite a while.

This means that to effectively retire people cannot rely on traditional safe financial instruments like bonds / savings accounts. Instead needing to become proficient asset allocators (or needing hire someone to manage asset allocation for them). Adding this complexity to the system will be a problem for low information investors. 

That’s where Bitcoin comes in. As a store of value Bitcoin can replace the traditional savings account that yielded between 5 and 20(!!) percent during most of the late 1900s (when interest rates were higher spending was more controlled). 

TL;DR - MMT is a reality and has destroyed USD as store of value, Bitcoin fixes this

personalfinance,HELOC to get better rate on investment?,"Hi all, 

Thanks for everything I'm learning on this sub. 

My wife and I own an investment property with 50k remaining on the loan at 4.125% over 25 years. 

The house we live in now, which we bought foreclosed and got for 110k, would likely appraise pretty high—the Zestimate, which I know can be faulty, is at 165k. We've made it into a really nice house, including putting a new roof on it. 

Is it worth getting our home appraised and looking into a HELOC to buy out the rental at a better rate? Just a glance at Third Federal looks like we could get the rate down in the range 2.24% which is very significant over so many years. The loan amount on this rental is too low to get a good rate on a straight refinance.

Or perhaps would a cash out refinance be the right option? The home we live in is a private 110k loan at 3%.  

Pretty new to thinking about all this so I won't be surprised if I'm way off or this is way oversimplified. 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Debt Consolidation/Baby Coming,"I currently have 14k in credit card debt on five cards, with APRs ranging from 25-30%. I actually started the year with about 22k and have paid it down significantly using the snowball method. I haven’t touched any card since 2018, when I moved in with family to fix my finances. Covid did cause the process to move slower than I had anticipated, but I am definitely in a better spot than I was previously. 

However, I have my first child on the way in February. This was a surprise. I will be taking six months paternity leave, with three months paid at 50% income and three months unpaid. Because of this, I have stopped paying as aggressively on my debt and have started saving to fund my paternity leave/baby fund. 

By the time the baby comes in February, I anticipate having 8k in savings and 12k in CC debt. 

I have improved my credit score to 650 and can currently qualify for a debt consolidation loan with a 15% APR. The monthly payment will be the same as the total minimum payments I am currently paying, so I can guarantee that I can afford at least the minimum if not more. Is this a good idea? 

I am confident that I will not fall into the hole of running up my credit cards again as I will continue living with family until at least the end of 2021. Also because credit cards make me sick after my previous mistakes. Additionally, I feel that I will want to keep as much money in my savings as possible to fund unforeseen baby expenses until I am back to work full time in August and will not be able to begin paying credit cards aggressively until that time. Therefore, it sounds like a good plan to take a pay off loan at 15%. This way, I know I will have this paid off in three years at minimum and at least the outrageous interest will not continue to balloon. Maybe I can refinance this loan at the end of next year for a better interest rate, as well. 

I appreciate all suggestions and insight.",finance

personalfinance,Is My Paycheck Correct?,"Hi,

New-ish job with a slight pay bump, but something seemed off with my take home pay. I contribute slightly more into 401k now, but I still want to make sure my paycheck is accurate of course. 

Pertinent details: 

* Salary: $85k per year paid bi-weekly
* Texas so no state income tax
* 10% pre-tax 401k
* HSA $200 per paycheck to catch up for the end of the year
* Insurance is less than $5 per paycheck
* In the end, I take home ~$1900. 

Using [this online tool](https://smartasset.com/taxes/paycheck-calculator#uSyNawcKjK), my estimated bi-weekly take home pay should be about [$2100](https://imgur.com/a/bGvEZok). However, my [tax withholdings](https://imgur.com/a/NN1bGV9) on my pay stub says otherwise. The only difference is the Federal Income Tax, which is $614 on my pay stub versus $413 according to the online calculator. That's nearly $200 off! Moreover, I recently submitted a W-4 form since I got married and now that federal income tax is up from $614 to $699. 

Is the online calculator simply an estimate and not accurate (though it's $200 off...)? Am I missing something on my end? Or is something up? Should I check with my HR/Payroll department? Will this be reflected later on via tax return? 

I am a bit lost so any insight is much appreciated. Thanks in advance as always.",finance
personalfinance,Is My House Budget Reasonable?,"Spouse and I are in our late 20s and in the stable earning portions of our careers. We bought a small home 4 years ago and as we look to start a family, we have been considering a larger long term home purchase. Here is a little bit about our financial background.

Gross yearly income: 400k; this number is a little conservative since I generally work more and earn more, but I think if my spouse scales back working in the next couple years as we start to raise a family, then this number is still what we would likely earn.

Debts/Assets: No debts, ~60k in retirement savings, ~50k in cash. In the next 4-6 months both of these numbers will likely double. 70-80k in equity on our current home, depending on the exact sell price we get for it and subtracting out closing costs. 

I know our retirement savings is behind where we should be for our current income, but we earned much less until recently. 

So two questions here for the hive mind. First, would you be considering homes up to ~1mil in this financial situation? And second, if I were to have access to mortgage financing that would allow me to put 0-5% down instead of a traditional 20% down, at the cost of an additional 0.25% on the mortgage interest rate (no PMI), would you keep your cash on hand instead of putting down the full 20%?",finance
personalfinance,Best way to go about buying a used car (first-time car buyer)?,"My wife has started a new side-hustle that's very lucrative (buying, restoring, staging, and flipping vintage chairs on Facebook Marketplace), but requires a larger car than what we have. She's made a thousand dollars in the last week from about 8 hours of work, and has done some chair buying over the last two weekends, but every time she wants to pick one up, she's borrowing the car of a family friend that lives quite out of the way, and which makes the time commitment substantially more than it would be if we had our own large car.

&amp;#x200B;

We both have mid-sized sedans (a Camry and a Kia Forte), but what we really need is a mini-van or SUV. Neither of us have ever bought cars before, both of them being gifts from our parents in high school/college. My car has some dents in it from her hitting it 2 years ago in her own driveway (long story), which makes her car the best candidate to sell. KBB value seems to be about $3,500-$5,000, so I'm going to call it $4,000. Used Toyota Siennas or Honda Odysseys with non-terrible mileage seem to be selling for around $15,000 in our area, which is definitely more than we can pay up front. 

What's the best way to go about this? 

Can you get a loan to buy a car privately (Craigslist, etc.), or is it our best bet to go through a dealership?

personalfinance,Buying a house or paying off loans?,"Did some financial planning over the weekend and want some perspective. 

Husband and I currently live in Seattle, WA (moved here in the last 3 months). We’ve had a few huge costs come up and loss of income due to COVID which have impacted our savings somewhat.

Husband is a physician, salary is around ~400K. Take home after all deductions (maxing out 401K, HSA/medical, life insurance etc) is 14K/ month. I am currently not working, but looking for a job. He has ~120K  in student loans. No other debt (own the car and CC paid off in full every month). 

We have about ~8500/month in expenses.

Rent + Utilities: $3300
Student Loan payment: $2000
MIL health insurance: $1100 (she’s turning 65 so we will be putting her on medicare) 
Groceries: $600 
Dining out: $200
Phone: $330 (paying for 4 people) 
Internet: $45
Subscriptions:  $90 
Life/Various insurances: $395
Miscellaneous Expenses: ~$400-500

We’re on track to save about ~$5500/month. Currently have 18k in savings and 4k in HSA account. 401K is maxed out contributions. 

We are hoping to buy a townhome in the Seattle area in the next year or two. Looking at between 600-800K. A number of banks offer a physician loan that has a small interest rate and no PMI with a down payment of less than 20%.

Wondering what the best strategy is moving forward. We are thinking of building up our nest egg savings to around 40-50k then saving for a down payment of at least 40k. Would saving for a larger down payment be better and waiting to buy? Or should we prioritize paying down the ~120K in student loans first before worrying about a house? We’re spending a ton of money on rent currently and would rather put it into an asset for us.

CryptoCurrency,Case Study #EP1,"Dear Redditors,

I’m starting a Case Study Series in order to share the studies/research I frequently do with you and to obtain not only your opinions on them, but also suggestions for new studies and such.

I’ll present coins without saying if I’m invested in them or not. All I can say is that my main investments are BTC and ETH and I won’t study those coins obviously, since I believe everyone knows that, at the moment, those are the most valuable assets in the crypto space. I hope in the future people get inspired to do the same to this subreddit, because if our content is good, most likely we will achieve success! Obviously I’m expecting downvotes, from what I’ve seen sometimes it’s really hard to give our own opinion here, but if we try to gain from an experience, we will surely learn cool stuff and that applies not only here, but in real life.

Continuing, the study will consist of talking about 2 different coins, what they offer, the main reasons why I think they’ll be more valuable in the future and I’ll toss my technical analysis into it as well. I don’t want people to fully agree with me, I just want to share my opinion, my knowledge and of course, I want you to do the same, so I can learn and all this subreddit can learn too. Discussion is important and I believe this subreddit has a lot to offer in that matter.

I should tell you that I’m a trader, some projects make me hold their coins ""until the moon"" while others I just look at as an opportunity to trade, profit and leave. I don’t always “win”, but I win more than I lose, especially when I decide to hold.

Also, I’ll start with only 2 coin “reviews” so to speak, as I intend to offer a nice view over the project and I believe the posts will be long most of the time. Whenever I feel they’re not so long, I might add one more coin to the list. My view won’t be complete, that’s for sure, so like I said before, I also want to receive feedback, not only to learn but to promote healthy discussions between us.

**Cardano (ADA):**

Top 10 coin since I’m into crypto. I’ve been paying attention to this project ever since and I believe despite having a low to null marketing at the moment, it has a solid ground to be one of the best projects ever made.

Smart contract platform, similar to ETH, with a focus on security through a layered architecture. The self-described “third generation blockchain” is the first of its kind to be created from scientific philosophy and built on peer-reviewed academic research.

The team behind Cardano is creating it with both the end-user and regulators in mind.

Their goal isn’t to overhaul the entire financial system, but to use blockchain technology to bring banking systems to places where they’ve previously been too expensive to implement – specifically the developing world.

Developed in two layers that separate the ledger of account values from the reason why values are moved from one account to the other. This separation enables the smart contracts on the platform to be more flexible. It also provides businesses the opportunity to tailor the design, privacy, and execution of each contract to more perfectly fit their specific use-cases.

Proof of Stake and a maximum of 45 billion ADA coins that will ever be created.

It also has Daedalus Wallet, created by the team that It’s a multi-currency wallet in which you can freely exchange between the supported currencies.

Roadmap:

1. Byron – Initial development of the main net and complementary functionality such as the Daedalus wallet. Everything scheduled for this phase is built.
2. Shelley – In this phase, the network becomes fully decentralized. Features here include delegation and stake pool test nets.
3. Goguen – The team is in process of releasing this phase. Goguen will see its main net around March 2021, completing the Shelley focus, which is a fully decentralized network. At the moment, d = 0.5, so ADA is halfway to be fully decentralized. The platform will also have a universal language framework for future blockchain technology.
4. Basho – The team plans to improve scalability, security, and performance in this phase.
5. Voltaire – In the final phase, Cardano will implement the Treasury model, providing a self-sustaining ecosystem for the network.

You can check Cardano’s roadmap and frequently updates easily on their website.

From a TA point of view, I believe this price will continue to go up. Last week, after a weekly strong bullish candle, we’ve seen the price struggling to go up, but I guess it was just a retracement because of the big move that happened the previous week. BTC dominance % gives me even more confidence, the king will feast and the alts will get fed as well. Also, Cardano’s Goguen main net launch in March 2021 will make the price go up, for sure.

**VeChain (VET):**

VeChain is a leading enterprise-focused dApp/ICO platform for products, services, and data. It aims to connect blockchain technology to real use cases by providing a robust infrastructure for data management and IoT solutions, removing issues with counterfeiting, data fraud, data manipulation, assurance practices, and business barriers such as financial services and 3rd party trust. VeChain is designed from the ground up to secure data entry methods and remove the borders between businesses, financial services, and data security. This is being achieved through partnerships and collaborations with innovative brands and industries throughout the world.

VeChain enables every aspect of a product, service, or business cycle to be captured, recorded, and transmitted through a blockchain. An example of this can be seen in the situation of buying a car.

As a car owner buying a car verified through VeChainThor, the information related to your car will go through various cycles. All aspects of the creation of your car can be tracked from raw materials, labor, logistics, for you to view as you purchase the car. All aspects of the payment (from raw materials, logistics, and car dealership fees) will be recorded to the chain and materials move from raw, to production, to sale, the ownership of the materials and data is transferred with it. So when you buy the car you now are the data owner of the vehicle from the raw materials that make it to the maintenance controlled on it until you sell those data rights alongside the car in resale.

Another business ecosystem example is VeChainThor tracking products through the supply chain. Each product can be tracked and have important business data recorded at each step of the way. As the product is passed from one company or service provider to another they can all have complete visibility into the products progress. Additional sensor data can be recorded as well. For example, food or medicine that needs to be kept cold during shipping and storage can have their integrity observed and verified by any third party.

The VeChainThor blockchain is the core technology that many companies are already using to build innovative new business solutions. By leveraging trust in data and information sharing, businesses can collaborate to build solutions that were previously not possible.

VeChainThor is the blockchain solution of VeChain, it is their product that is managed and governed by the VeChain Foundation. VeThor is the energy that powers the VeChainThor network. A capture, transfer, nor smart contract can be executed without the use of VeThor. This enables the blockchain to protect itself from bad actors spamming the network rendering it ineffective.

VeChain also has good partnerships, some of them strategic and I believe they will continue to prosper.

You should check VeChain reddit, their wiki has a lot of good information and the content I placed here is mostly from there.

Strong Points:

* Adoption will come first on the enterprise-level rather than consumer-level.
* DNV GL and PWC each own a stake in VeChain and promote it to their thousands of enterprise clients;
* Walmart China is currently using the network to track food products;
* Other large enterprises partnered or building solutions on the network include: BMW, Avery Dennison, BYD, Bayer, Haier, Bright Foods, People’s Insurance Company of China, and China Tobacco;
* Excellent two-token model to regulate transaction costs. Holding VET generates VTHO overtime, which is the gas of the network and also provides some small passive income for holders;
* Excellent Proof of Authority governance model which combines several of the benefits of a decentralized model with some aspects of centralization that provide enterprises with the transaction stability and oversight that they need to adopt blockchain;
* Excellent Leadership team which came from executive positions at companies like Louis Vuitton, PWC, and Deloitte;
* 100k-200k+ transactions per day.

From a TA point of view, we can see that VET has finished last week with a so-called doji, IMO confirming the support at \~0.009 once again. I estimate the price will go up, at least reaching his previous ATH.

The continuous adoption from enterprises makes me confident about VET and it recently won the Prestigious ‘Innovative Green Technology’ Award at the China Green Technology Summit 2020.

personalfinance,Buying a Car and Refinancing my Home - Whats the smartest way to do this?,"I am currently looking to buy a truck (business and personal) and refinance my home. How should I go about doing this?  
If I applied for both in a short period of time, would it still count as 2 hits to my credit? I have spent years getting my credit score over 800 and feel like if I do both a refi and a new car, i'd really hurt my score.  
Am I overthinking this?  


Current situation:  
I have 20 years left on my mortgage, currently at a 3.69% interest rate and have the opportunity to get below a 2.59% interest refied to a 15yr mortgage. This would bring my payments up to around my current payment + the overpayment I include every month now.  


I also am running a growing business and need a pick up truck. I am not much of a car guy and would really rather just have 1 vehicle for both business and personal. The used truck market is pretty insane these days with very limited stock and insane asking prices even on trucks 5+ years old with 100k miles.  
I'm currently considering buying a new/newer Toyota Tacoma as a personal vehicle and splitting the vehicle between business and personal. This would be about a 50/50 commitment and I believe I can split a vehicle between business and personal based on use percentage. Is this correct? 50% personal, 50% business... Business can depreciate 50% of the vehicle over 5 years as well as pay for 50% of repairs and such.

To get the best of both worlds, I thought it made sense to get the truck as a personal vehicle and then work it into the business. I have tried talking to people at the dealership about this and they are not helpful at all.

  


I know this includes some business aspect, so I hope this isn't against he rules, but it is something I think bleeds into personal equally.

personalfinance,(Seemingly) Abnormally difficult 401k rollover process. Should I cut my losses and get a distribution check?,"tl;dr: My old job is being an ass about my 401k, and I don't want to deal with it anymore.

I (28M) changed jobs in July of this year, and was not eligible for my new employer's 401k until September. When I received my end of employment information from my previous employer in July, HR there informed me that I would not be able to do anything with the 401k funds there until I was eligible for the 401k at my new job.

Fast forward to my period of eligibility in my new job. I email HR at my old job that I would like to roll over the 401k funds from that plan to my current employer. Previous employer sends over a form to fill out and fax back to the retirement services company. Cue 2 months of back and forth over misspelled names by previous HR and sections that the previous job's HR didn't tell me to fill out in the first place. Note: The previous HR 401k custodian does not contact me for any of these missed sections or errors, but solely relies on my previous job's HR department to communicate with me.

I finally get fed up and beg my (much nicer) current HR department for help with the rollover form. They direct me to our 401k custodian, who states that the only way I would be able to roll over the funds from that account would be for the previous plan custodian to make out a check to the current HR plan's custodian, send the check to my home address, and for me to fill out their form, then send everything in one package to the new retirement services plan address.

I tell this to a rep on the previous 401k custodian's help line. They tell me that I would have to contact my previous job's HR department to have them issue the check. I do so, explaining the situation - even including an official email from one of my current 401k custodian's reps. In response, I receive a ""Well, I don't know what you sent to our custodian. So, I can't help you."" Again, I explain that I have spoken to both their custodian and my custodian, and told them the circumstances by which my funds must be rolled over. In response:

""\[Prev Custodian\] is not issuing you a check. \[Prev. Custodian\] can mail \[Current Custodian\] a check directly.""

At this point, I'm so upset and angry that I just want to apply for a distribution check and be done with the whole thing. The reason I left the previous job is because of a build up of pettiness, disrespect, and refusal to listen as I've tried my best to explain in this situation. I've already spoken with my mother on the matter who has said that I have a choice to just leave the funds at the old job's 401k and let the funds accrue without any contributions. However, I don't know if I truly feel comfortable leaving it there for something to potentially happen to the funds or block me from getting the funds upon retirement because of the previous company's incompetence (which was also an issue).

The form from the old 401k for distribution states that the distribution would be issued ""less the mandatory 20% federal holding tax. I'm not sure if there's another penalty for withdrawl in my state (GA) I've looked on Google, where I've seen that the penalty when taxes are due is only 10%. The account itself doesn't even have $3,000 in it yet.

I am a complete newbie baby to this whole retirement planning thing, and I was trying to be smart by starting to save at a young age. So, if I've left out any details, let me know, and I will try to clarify as best I can.

My questions:

personalfinance,Should I take out a personal loan to purchase a car or go through a dealership and buy it through there.,"At 19 I've been using a credit card for a little bit and accumulated a 688 credit score on credit karma. I'm in dire need of a car but don't have the cash for it now (at least in arizona because here $1,000 won't get you even a shit box civic unfortunately), however I do have money in my savings (the $1,000) for a down payment on a car, and just as recently accumulated my credit score. 

Dealership Route:

I'm obviously not sure about how much the fees and everything will cost after wanting to purchase the car I'm looking at, however they are asking for $11,500 (and I think I can talk then down to $8,000 - $9,000). I plan to have it paid off in 48 months which would bring my payments to about anywhere from $250 - $300 a month. However its a 2011 car so its fairly newer and cleaner, and its from a chevy dealer so quality might be better then usual, the car would also come with a new set of tires as well, I'm meeting with her tomorrow. 

Person Loan Route: 

Recently I've seen an offer for the car I want on offer up, same model but a lot older (2005). However he has receipts of the engine being replaced about 4000 miles ago, and it looks fairly clean. He is asking for $4500 so I'd probably only need to take out about $3,500 or $4,000 or so (taking a little extra money out to pay for first month of insurance, fees, topping the oil off, etc, etc). My monthly payments through this route would (obviously) be a lot lower estimating at around $100 a month and the loan period would be shorter, but my interest rates would be at about 29%.

Whats the best options between these two, I need a car direly like I said, and I can't buy a shit box because 1) my parents will harass me to sell it like the last one I had and 2) I just need a car and don't have the cash to buy one out right. 

Anything helps!


EDIT: 

My financial situation is I live with my parents, work about 30 hours a week (so technically in arizona full time), and I go to school (community college so tuition is dirt cheap).",finance

personalfinance,Should I take out the maximum on a Cash Out Refinance,"We are doing a cash out refinance. My wife and I have discussed the pros and cons of taking out either $25K or $50K. We are doing some updates on the house that will cost between $10-15K, and have also discussed the possibilities of having extra liquid cash, i.e. starting a business, buying a second house (and renting out this house) and more. The price difference in closing costs is around $2000. Does it make sense to take out the extra $25K which we'd essentially be paying 8% of that in closing costs?

personalfinance,Roth IRA or Student loans?,"I am 23 and a recent graduate with a B.S. in Geography. I'm planning on getting my Masters in education Fall 2021 and will get a classified job with my school to save 70% on tuition which would bring the 19k program cost down significantly. I will be able to do monthly payments for the Masters so that I do not have to take out more loans for this program, but am curious what to do about other aspects of my financial situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Student debt: $39,000 this is my only debt and it is all in various federal student loans

Bills: about $950 total. $700 in rent, $150 in groceries, $15 phone, and $50 gas

Savings: $11,300 in a HYSA with Ally and I always keep around $1,000 in my checking account

Credit score is 711. I've been trying to get it up, and it  hasn't gotten any higher than this, even though I pay off my balance weekly. I'm assuming this is because all of my debt, but am not sure. It also will probably drop a few points soon as I just opened a second credit card.

Income: $2,720. I work for an ebike company making $17/hr. I can pick up as much overtime as I'd like for 1.5x pay.

 When I spend 'fun' money on restaurants/coffee/whatever, I do the amount of overtime it'd take to pay off x2. So last week my girlfriend and I got breakfast and the total was $25 and I worked until I made $50 in overtime. I do the same for big but needed purchases such as plane tickets or a new laptop. I feel like I have my spending fairly under control, but am happy to hear feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

My employer doesn't have a 401k match so I'm passing on that for now, but my question is should I prioritize student loans to the max, or pay the minimum on loans, max out my Roth IRA and then put the remaining money toward the loans? 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to pay off these loans by the time I have kids, but I also want to be comfortable in retirement and am starry-eyed over that compound interest from a young age. I'm also not too worried about the debt, even though it's quite a bit, as they are government loans and not Sallie Mae or a different company with absurdly high interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I'm leaning toward the option of minimum loan payments, 6k to the Roth IRA (Or 401k if I get a job that matches), and then the rest of what I have leftover to the loans again. Once I pay off/down the loans, I'd be interested in a mutual fund or something of that sort, but I don't think I have enough income to think about that seriously right now.

personalfinance,Piggyback Loan - 80/10/10,"Hi All, 

Looking to get some insight into the finer details of a piggyback loan. 

Scenario: Buying a house for $400k, putting down 20%. However, we are putting down 10% and my parents are helping with a 10% piggyback loan. 

We had originally gotten a quote for an interest rate not including the piggyback scenario. However, after discussing some we decided to go with the above scenario. 

My question is, will the interest rate on the 80% loan increase considering the 10% piggyback loan? Or should we expect it to be same as a scenario without a piggyback loan?",finance
personalfinance,"Before returning a leased car, check Vroom or Carvana","Just sold my 2017 Toyota Sienna to Vroom and pocketed $3,300.  My lease residual or buy-out price was $21,659. Carvana offered $443 more than Vroom's $24,959 but I needed to have at least 60 days left on the lease. I had 58 days left. I didn't see this anywhere up front when I searched the FAQ. That meant a lease extension, which apparently with Toyota was surprisingly easy but I would also have to spend $330 to renew the registration too.  When I called Vroom, they said they only needed 14 days to purchase the car from Toyota. 

For comparison, CarMax only offered $21,000. It would just be better for me to pay the return fee of $350 to Toyota at that price. 

After signing online, physically signing a transfer form and sending it back via Fedex, pick-up was scheduled in 2 days. The driver just noted two of the largest scratches on the bill of lading and gave me a copy. Two hours after they took the car, I received Fedex tracking numbers for the check to me and to Toyota via email. I was super anxious about some sort of ""gotcha"" like they might find the condition of the car was not described accurately and take it out of my check. Initially I wanted to go with Carvana because apparently they hand you the check as they pick up the car. I got the full $3,300 based on the price Vroom agreed to pay.

stocks,Buy Tesla stock? | Moderna vaccine news |Stock market news [11-17-2020],"**Tesla has just been added to the SP, is this the time to buy the stock? Moderna just announced a new vaccine, what does this mean for the stock market? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news** [BANNER](https://ibb.co/GMCv9B1)

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indices in the green with a late push to end the day. The dow was the biggest gainer up 1,6% and also posted a new record close just shy of the 30k mark [CHART](https://ibb.co/NrF0HWc) ,while the broader SP500 trailed a little the whole day and finished up 1,17%  [CHART](https://ibb.co/xhkQWnk) while even the tech heavy Nasdaq finished in the green after a slow start to the day on the Moderna vaccine news with a late push to end up 0,8% [CHART](https://ibb.co/tcGnChD). The VIX continued to decline to it lowest levels since august as it continues to slowly trend to it’s pre-shutdown levels [CHART](https://ibb.co/Wfy5Kg6). Almost all sectors [CHART](https://ibb.co/hLY6Fzx) were in the green yesterday as a repeat of last Monday happened with Energy, Industrials and Financials having a good boost from the Moderna news with over 3 quarters of the companies advancing and 141 of them making new highs [CHART](https://ibb.co/qMjmtwf), the average volume return to normal, as there was not such a big transition in portfolios like a week ago. The rally was mostly pushed by small cap and value plays as even the Russel 2000 made new highs after this news. [CHART](https://ibb.co/PQb0kJw)

This is the HEAT map from yesterday and as you can see, most of the companies gained, except the ones from Health Care, where all of the money rushed to Moderna [CHART](https://ibb.co/3YkLfw8), but I believe this is a great misjudgment for investors, as there is not a lot of money to be made on this vaccine, and this is the only product they offer at the moment, so I don’t think it really deserves the 100$ price range in which it has traded yesterday. I don’t like this stock at all at this point, if you do want to play the vaccine news and profits you should look at other companies that will help distribute it like CVS, Walgreens, McKesson, Costco, Walmart and others. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ByMvyxs)

Before the open today we will here from Walmart and Home depot which release earnings reports, this is also followed by economic reports like retail sales, business inventories and some other interesting events that are due later. [EVENTS](https://ibb.co/WfzJdMk) [BEFORE OPEN](https://ibb.co/WvKW8hn)

So, let’s talk about what the vaccine news were yesterday as Moderna  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/52fSmF4) announced a vaccine that has an even better efficiency than Pfizer’s at over 94% and also doesn’t require such extreme temperatures to be stored and transported, Pfizer required under -80 degrees Celsius while Moderna is stable up to 6 months at only -20 degrees Celsius or even at 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to 30days. So, there is expectation that both Moderna and Pfizer will file for the FDA emergency use authorization very soon. Both will require 2 shots for the vaccine to be effective almost a month apart. This will also be followed in the next few months with results from AstraZeneca and JNJ so the more vaccines that are available the faster the pandemic will end, but I wouldn’t rush out of the tech names that have brought the market here, they are here to stay even after this all ends. The world didn’t just run into tech companies because of the pandemic, the world was already going there but this was only accelerated by this, and I don’t see companies that don’t need to going back to the way it was, because this has brought better margin profits for many companies as there are fewer expenses with the work from home environment.

So in my opinion The markets are likely going to keep it up, as I don’t see a crash or a pullback soon as there are a lot more positives then negatives for the stock market. The only negative is that the reopening is not happening yet, but that will come next year, while there are a lot of positives like better treatments, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and probably more to come, a probably divided congress which is good news for not many changes that affect the stock market [MARKET GAIN](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy), the ultra-low interest rates that are here to stay for a while as the Fed will keep the economy going and a probable stimulus that will come eventually.  [LIQUIDITY](https://ibb.co/6wx3gBz)

There are a lot of things that drives stocks higher like very good earnings [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/hXCwZGD) from most of the companies that I really think will continue to be very good and even get better in the next years as more money will be put into the economy by the fed and eventually by the consumers also the companies are starting to pay dividends again and there is a lot of money still on the sidelines that can come back in the stock market. [https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy)

This year is the second time that ETF’s have had a more than 400 billion dollars of inflow and that will likely keep going up, as investors are leaving low rate bonds and taking on more risk with equities as the US total assets under management are up over 5 Trillion $.  [INTEREST RATES](https://ibb.co/8KCWtqr)

Meanwhile after the close yesterday, it was announced that Tesla will finally be included in the SP500 on the 21st of December this year. This is after the company has had a longer path of profitability with 5 straight quarters of profit even with the pandemic ranging on. This will probably lead to a higher demand for the stock as index funds will need to buy the stock. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ZL7wJC)

As you can see people have turned around opinions on the company as the short interest has plummeted from over 200 million shares to below 50 million shores in less than 2 years. That is a decrease of over 70% in just 12 months. [CHART](https://ibb.co/frL3ZGT)

Tesla has become the largest ever company to be added to the SP500, and will likely replace one of the bottom companies from the oil industry in the index. The company will have a 1% weight in the SP as the committee estimates the funding for the trade will need over 50 billion dollars, one of the largest in the SP History. The stock traded as much as 525 intra-day before dropping to below 400 after they were not included in the SP500 last go around [CHART](https://ibb.co/m5NxHGB). Even more actively managed funds that try to beat the SP will be forced to decide if they buy Tesla shares or not, as the company may give them a downside risk due to its high potential of growth, such funds manage trillions of dollars that could also pour into the stock. 

And With factories ramping up like Shanghai which will produce 1million vehicles, Freemont as well, and with Austin and Berlin factories expected to produce at least 500k, they will likely be able to produce over 2 million cars in 2022 or 2023, which is a great increase from around 600thousand/year capacity at the moment. [FACTORIES](https://ibb.co/DWWXWQK)

The stock has surged after hours more than 13% to around 460$ but I really like the company, and I believe the stock can go higher in the long term especially, I have a price target of just over 600$ for tesla, but we can see a re-test of the 500$ level very soon in the stock, with the EV push that is expected to come in the next years.  [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/yXGxzFb) [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/Qdt07QR)

One other big thing to follow today after the close is what NIO reports as the company has been targeted by short sellers recently and saw the stock drop from its highs over 50$ to barely 40$ in the span of a couple of days but has since recovered as a lot of people are very optimistic of the earnings report. The company is expected to lose around 17 cents per shares and have a revenue of over 600 million dollars, double the revenue that the company had a year ago. The stock has not beaten the estimates of earnings yet in the last 2 years, so this will be very good if the company finally manages to do that. [NIO](https://ibb.co/1R0bSXm)

Also, after the close, COSTCO announced a special dividend for shareholders of 10$ as they continue to be one of the greatest companies to own, as management has constantly taken care of shareholders with great dividends and great growth for the company. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hKbnFpQ)

One other interesting news came from Nvidia which release a huge product, as the company release a new GPU with more than 80 gigabytes of memory, doubling the old model, this are huge performance numbers that are required in the new world of cloud computing. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/bX60cqv)

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"I have been given the opportunity to refinance my mortgage for a 2nd time in almost 2 year. This time lowering my interest rate from 3.75% to 3.0%. Eliminating my FHA Loan and putting me into a standard loan. I will no longer pay mortgage insurance after this point. And I will be paying $200 less a month on my mortgage. Plus I would be skipping 2 months of payments and getting my escrow back from my old mortgage company. Now that all sounds great and all not paying as much for your mortgage a month and having a lower interest rate. But here’s the thing. I would be switching to a new mortgage company and current owe $169K on my house. When I switch over I’d pay a $219 fee upfront and all other fees get put into the mortgage again. Leaving me with a grand total of 181K on a 30 fixed rate. I’m told that if I would do this deal and continue to pay my normal mortgage payment that I’d pay off my house in 21 year rather than 30 years. Now I do not plan to stay in the house forever probably not even the life of the mortgage. Although I don’t have plans in the near future to sell the house. I have owned the house since 2015. I bought at 189K and got it down to 170K before I refinanced and lowered my interest rate a first time from 4.25% to 3.75% and added 6K worth of debt to the loan bringing it to 176K and that was only last August 2019. Now would that be added 11K to my loan and making it 181K at 30 years. Below are the terms out lines by the mortgage company also keep in mind I’d be going from NewRez to Federal Savings Bank of that makes a difference.

Term = 30 years Fixed Rate (Conventional Loan)
 
Payment = $1,172.18 /mth (Includes Property Taxes &amp; Home Insurance) (Fixed Payment)
 
Debt to be paid off from the loan proceeds =  New-Rez / Shellpoint (Mtg)
 
Monthly Savings = $202.00/mth
 
Total Upfront Out of Pocket Cost = $219.00 (This covers the cost for the initial commitment fee) ***Please note that is as long as we receive the Property Inspection Waiver / Appraisal Waiver
  
Total Closing Costs rolled into the above total loan amount = $6,350.00 (This covers ALL closing costs for title fees, lender fee, etc)
 
 
 
The loan process will be completed within (50 days), You will be skipping your (January &amp; February) mortgage payments which means you will keep $2,750.00 in your pocket + $1,300.00 Escrow Refund (You will receive this within 3 weeks after we payoff your mtg with New-Rez) for a grand total of $4,050.00 of total cash availability that you will be able to use towards whatever you wish.

MMT economists deal with the idea that **more inflation reduces unemployment**, this is what Phillips curve explain.

Nowadays Phillips curve version include the possibility of negative inflation (deflation) when high unemployment, but the purpose is the same.

As Powell said, FED is going to maintain inflation slightly above 2% seeking inflation that averages 2% over time to reduce unemployment. To achieve it, monetary policies like zero interest rates and no bank reserve requirement has been implemented. But as far as I know inflation is not reaching the streets yet, provably because to reach the main street the FED needs commercial banks or states intervention to ease direct cash. 

Conclusion: This leads to the CBDC (central bank digital currency) as medium of citizens direct control of broad money. 

In any case, credit expansion to corporations doesn't equals solid growth as bail outs aren't necessarily helping a prosperous business, but sustaining a project with no demand and perpetual debt. Looks like inflation just reached financial markets making them volatile, unpredictable and a signal to wrongly invest capital as the continuous bail outs distorts the fundamentals.

Conclusion: Inflation just looks like a fake demand that distorts reality, reducing unemployment does not mean a trust full economic growth as bail outs comes in the economy, instead looks like a downward spiral of debt that keeps non profitable companies alive.

Looking for some advice. The wife and I are saving for a house, thankfully we live in a market where an average decent house is \~$150k.

I have a pretty reasonable risk tolerance since the amounts are low and I am putting a bunch of money in each month, so I am thinking about transferring much of it to my brokerage account and investing it in say a corporate bond fund or ETF, or maybe something growth and income related.

What would you do if you were in my position? Keep it in the savings? invest in a mutual fund or ETF? Invest it in a bond fund, growth and income, or an index fund?

personalfinance,"Need some advice about buying a new home and renting out my old one, in CA","I need some help, either in the form of advice, literature to read, or a type of professional who deals with this type of transaction.

Here' s the scoop. I'm looking to buy a second home in Southern California and rent out my first one. (or at least determine if it's possible). 

My LTV for my current house is only 85% based on the original purchase price, but more like 75% based on current estimated price. (We only out 10% down initially) The interest rate on that mortgage is 4.0%. 

I have enough cash to put down 20% on the next house and that will be my primary residence once purchased. 

I would also like to refinance the first home ASAP since rates are so low.

My initial thinking is that I (wife and I) would buy the second home first, move into that and then get a property manager to rent out the first place. Then once our credit is back to 'normal' we could ReFi the first place. (Rent in my neighborhood wont cover the mortgage at the current interest rate). Does this sound reasonable so far?

Going deeper down the rabbit hole, I've been reading that maybe I should transfer my first home to a LLC that I create. To do that I might have to close out the mortgage and get a new one. Is it possible to ReFi that house then transfer it to my LLC? Is the LLC really that important?

I'm pretty new to owning a home and even more so to any real estate transactions. How does one learn the specifics about this stuff?",finance
personalfinance,Balance transfers on credit card balances,"Hello! I am trying to get my finances under control after covid threw wrenches in my plans. I have been paying my credit cards down as much as I can. They have mostly been used for school lunches, continuing my daughter's music lessons, and groceries. My capital one card also has my $1k wedding dress on it which I got in February and was supposed to be paid off quickly, but losing my other job and my fiance being laid off and not receiving child support because my ex lost his job obviously got in the way of paying that down quickly. Anyway, I have 4 credit cards, two of which carry a balance. I am now battling interest rates. I am not using my credit cards currently.

If it matters here, I make $2,705 monthly after taxes and my expenses (not including credit card payments and pop-up expenses) leaves me with about $774 a month

I have one Discover card with an APR of 24.99. The balance on this card is  $1,846.57 with a limit of $3,000

I have one Capital one card with an APR of 22.99. The balance on this card is  $3,150 with a limit of $4,500.

Discover offers balance transfers that I was thinking about doing. I could pay the minimum on the capital one card and throw the $700 I was hoping to pay between the two cards to my Discover card and have a higher amount available to transfer over some of my balance from Capital one. The offers are as follows

 0% Promo APR for 12 months and 5% transfer fee   
 6.99% Promo APR for 15 months and 0% transfer fee 

I have never done a balance transfer before and I need help. Which one should I do if any and why?

personalfinance,I'm thinking about refinancing my house. I've been trying to look into the pros and cons of this but I'm still unsure of what could go wrong.,"I've lived in my house for 2 years now. I've been paying around 200 a month extra every month on my house and I was just thinking about refinancing the house to try and get a lower monthly bill.

My question is what could be a downside to refinancing? I only plan on living here for about another 3 or 4 years, then want to sell the house. My current interest rate is 4.75% so I'm hoping to get a better rate and be able to lower my monthly payments as well.

Another question is would the whole rocket mortgage route be a bad idea? I've heard some bad stuff in the past but I was looking on my credit karma app and it showed rocket mortgage as an option to refinance and the rate looked great. Just worried about the catch, if there is one.

Any tips or insight would be greatly appreciated, this is my first house and if I'm being honest, I feel like I still don't know what I'm doing. I just know that my bill is X amount monthly, and I pay it plus some. This stuff gets all too confusing for me unfortunately.",finance
personalfinance,"10-Year-Old Credit, Can I Negotiate Instead of Shutting it Down?","I have a capital one card that is over ten years old, it's my oldest piece of credit by over four years.

I called a couple of years back to negotiate the interest rate down and they weren't very receptive even though literally my credit score has increased by 300+ plus points since I got it and I can obtain credit 10x over what I originally got approved for. They also said it wasn't possible to switch to another card without closing my account.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Fees,"Hello Everyone, 

I apologize before hand if this is a longer post. 

I was really into bitcoin back in 2017-2018. I never really owned alot of it, right before the crash I owned maybe 600$ dollars of it. Which in context would be about the same value today if I had not sold it off, so no regrests there. I sold it to buy Calculus and Physics textbooks. I cashed in on my gains and called it a day. Then it crashed, life took over and for some reason I never really thought to much about bitcoin until the pandemic hit. I was using coinbase to purchase my bitcoin and I still have my ledger (physical wallet). 

I believe in bitcoin for many of the same reasons that all of you do. Decentralized, set number of supply, no printing like the fed, and well to some degree anonymity, and of course the block chain. But what gets me everytime are the bitcoin fees. I know that with a fixed supply, if enough people want some, it will drive the price. But making bitcoin a feesable method of everyday purchase is impossible with the bitcoin fees. 

For all of you that know alot more than I do, how do we solve the fees? what is the solution, and the way around that? Serious Question.",cryptocurrency

&gt;Robinhood Markets, the trading platform that’s proved popular with novice investors, has asked banks to pitch for roles in an initial public offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

&gt;The company is aiming to go public as soon as the first quarter of 2021, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.

&gt;The company’s plans could change and it might decide not to pursue an IPO, the people said.

&gt;A representative for Robinhood declined to comment.

&gt;Robinhood raised an additional $460 million in a series G funding round, lifting its valuation to $11.7 billion, the company said in September. Robinhood’s investors include Sequoia, DST Global, Ribbit Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures. and D1 Capital Partners.

&gt;An IPO would follow a huge boom in volume on the platform, with stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus pandemic driving up retail trading. Robinhood has also tapped into a new demographic -- millennial and Gen-Z traders. Robinhood has 13 million accounts on its platform, which allows for trading in options, gold and cryptocurrencies as well as equities and funds.

&gt;Larry Tabb, head of market structure research for Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note that Robinhood’s targeting of millennials and its business model will increasingly draw the attention of other brokers.

&gt;“Yet competing versus Robinhood will be difficult,” Tabb said.

&gt;Founded by two Stanford University graduates, Robinhood declares on its website that it is “on a mission to democratize finance for all.” The company has experienced some growing pains.

&gt;In the first half of this year, U.S. consumer protection agencies received more than 400 complaints about Robinhood -- roughly four times more than competitors such as the brokerage units of Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Investments. The grievances, obtained via a public records request to the Federal Trade Commission, depict novice investors in over their heads, struggling to understand why they’ve lost money on stock options or had shares liquidated to pay off margin loans.

&gt;Almost 2,000 accounts on its platform were compromised in a hacking spree last month and 10,000 accounts were held hostage.

personalfinance,Old checking account,"Because our credit union closed their local branch (COVID), my wife and I finally decided to move our primary joint checking + savings accounts to a new credit union.

Onto my question: we've got about $7,400 in our old checking account from I-don't-know-where. It could be math errors. It could be checks that were never cashed. I really just don't know. 

How long should I let the money sit in there before I reclaim it? Ideally, I'd close it out, use it for a home project, or pay off my wife's vehicle. Obviously, it's been in there a long time, earning paltry interest rates - so letting it sit for another 6 mo (or even a year) isn't killing us.

A. Refinance at a 30 year fixed interest rate, which lowers the monthly mortgage quite a bit and use the cash savings towards next house down payment. 

B. Refinance at a 30 year fixed, throw the money saved each month back at the principal. 

C. Refinance at a 15 year fixed, pay the same amount per month. 

D. None of the above, something I’m not thinking of?

stocks,IPO activity surges to new highs amidst economic depression,"Despite what many analysts term to be an economic crisis, IPO activity has been buzzing in the US stock market. Since 2019, IPO activity has been on the increase, rising on the heels of a stable and advancing global stock market activity. However, it appears that the pandemic did little to dampen the risk appetite of investors and businesses likewise.

Q3 2020 saw a spike in the number of companies going public, with 165 companies listed on US stock exchanges. This is a continuum in the spike of public listings that have been on the rise since summer. Prior to June this year, companies which were going public never exceeded 40 in number. However, for four consecutive months since then, monthly IPOs have well exceeded that boundary.

This surge in IPO activity contrasts historical trends in election years, which tend to be concentrated in the first half of the year, away from the uncertainty of elections. In the months of August and September, we had a total of a 110 Initial Public Offers.

Health care companies, perhaps bolstered by rising demand for health care during the pandemic, accounted for most public offerings (41%) in the quarter. In terms of value, technology companies led the way, raising $16.4b, a figure which accounts for 50% of the total proceeds in Q3 2020. The financial sector had the largest volume of the biggest share of IPOs thanks to SPACs.

Despite the United States’ divisive stance on global trade which has pitted it against trader partners such as China and the EU, the country continues to remain a choice destination for investors. US stock markets attracted 22 cross-border IPOs in Q3 2020. 36% of these cross-border IPOs were from Chinese, which accounted for 78% of proceeds in that category.

One reason for the IPO drive is due to offerings from SPACs. As private companies increasingly opted to bypass the traditional IPO route for more innovative and cash-effective ways to bring their shares to public markets. SPACs have been an obvious and viable route to explore. Special Purpose Acquisition Companies accounted for 47% of public listings in the third quarter when they helped 77 companies go public. This is an increase of 185% from the second quarter, and surpasses last year’s total of 57.

Snowflake is credited to having the biggest IPO in the US stock market this year after it returned $3.9bn in proceeds. Other notable IPOs this year are Warner Media Group, Palantir, Royal Pharma PLC and Rocket Companies Inc. Investors await the public listing of Airbnb scheduled to take place in December, in what many analysts believe to be the icing on the cake for IPOs this year. The online rental company is seeking $30bn when its debut on Nasdaq.

The rise in IPOs may also be used as a parameter for growing risk appetite and by extension greed. Since march, the market has been in an upswing, though with some blips. Macroeconomic conditions such as low interest rates from the Fed, stimulus checks and the purchase of some asset class from the Fed has meant that money has found its way to the stock market.

Stocks such as Tesla, Amazon and Netflix have immensely benefit from the surge in trading activity in the market which has seen the market value of these companies increase significantly. Companies enticed with the liquidity in the market want to take a bite. On the other hand, investors are on the look out for the next Tesla or Apple and would readily snap up anything that as much as replicates the business model as seen from Salesforce and Snowflake.

This implies that a lot of caution is being thrown to the wind as investors may be mislead by the upward momentum in the broader market and grab any company that goes public without conducting due diligence. As such, this is a period where investors have to be particularly careful and double-check their fundamental and technical metrics before taking the plunge.",finance

stocks,"Amazon jumps into the pharmacy business with online prescription fulfillment, free delivery for Prime members","* **Amazon is making its biggest move yet into the pharmacy space.**
* **Amazon Pharmacy is designed to make it easy and convenient to order prescription medicines online.**
* **There’s also a savings program and free two-day shipping for Prime Members.**

[Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AMZN) is entering the pharmacy business with a new offering called Amazon Pharmacy, allowing customers in the United States to order prescription medications for home delivery, including free delivery for Amazon Prime members.

Amazon has been quietly building out its pharmacy offering for several years [after ramping](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/16/amazon-selling-drugs-pharamaceuticals.html) up internal discussions in 2017 and [acquiring PillPack](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/10/why-amazon-bought-pillpack-for-753-million-and-what-happens-next.html) in 2018. The pharmacy space is notoriously complex and competitive in the U.S., and Amazon Pharmacy is built in part on PillPack’s infrastructure, including its pharmacy software, fulfillment centers and relationships with health plans.

Amazon Pharmacy, announced Tuesday, is the company’s biggest push yet into $300 billion market, and threatens the dominance of traditional pharmacies like [CVS](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CVS) and [Walgreens](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WBA), as well as other large retailers that offer pharmacy services, including [Walmart](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT).

Pharmacy stocks [tumbled](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/walgreens-drops-11percent-to-lead-drug-store-stocks-lower-after-amazon-launches-pharmacy-business.html) following the launch of Amazon Pharmacy. [CVS](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CVS) shares fell 7.5% in morning trading Tuesday. [Walgreens Boots Alliance](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WBA) dropped more than 8%. Shares of [Rite Aid](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=RAD) slid more than 16%. [GoodRx](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GDRX), which helps consumers find discounts on prescription drugs, [fell](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/shares-of-goodrx-plunge-after-amazon-announces-push-into-pharmacy.html) more than 18%. Amazon shares jumped more than 1%.

For Amazon, the announcement is well timed. Americans are increasingly relying on getting their medicines via mail to avoid possible exposure to the coronavirus. That shift could be permanent, as more people than ever before are learning about new ways of receiving medication.

“We wanted to make it easy for people to get their medication, understand the cost and get it delivered to the home,” said TJ Parker, Amazon’s vice president of pharmacy, who previously co-founded PillPack. “The hard work is to make it easy ... there were a number of complications behind the scenes.”

“We think this new benefit will add tremendous value to our members,” added Jamil Ghani, vice president of Amazon Prime. “It’s relevant as folks try to do more from the comfort and safety of their homes.”

## How it works

Customers over the age of 18 will have access to the pharmacy service this week in 45 states, not including Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana and Minnesota. Amazon expects to serve those states over time.

Amazon Pharmacy will accept most forms of insurance, but could offer savings for people without insurance as well. Customers can also use flexible spending accounts or health savings accounts to buy prescriptions on the service.

Before customers order medication for the first time, the site might ask them questions such as whether they’re pregnant, their date of birth and their gender as it was assigned at birth. That information is required by law to provide pharmacy care, and it helps pharmacists to do things like confirm prescriptions.

Doctors can send prescriptions directly to Amazon Pharmacy, or patients can request a transfer from an existing retailer, like CVS or Walgreens. Amazon says it has tools to verify that a physician legitimately ordered each prescription, and to tamp down on potential fraud.

Amazon Prime customers get free two-day delivery, although shipping might take up to five days the first time a customer orders, as it takes time to transfer a medication. Customers who don’t have Prime can get free delivery within five days, or they can pay $5.99 to upgrade to two-day delivery.

The medicines on offer include a mix of generic and brand-name drugs. Customers can get access to birth control, as well as commonly prescribed drugs like insulin, triamcinolone steroid creams, metformin for controlling blood sugar and sumatriptan for migraines.

Amazon will not deliver Schedule II controlled medications, including most opioids, and it won’t be replacing the Health &amp; Personal Care store by offering vitamins and supplements.

Customers who have questions about their medications can reach a pharmacist or pharmacy technician at any time through online self-service or phone. Amazon will also screen for potentially problematic drug interactions for customers who are taking multiple medications at once.

Amazon’s Parker said that the storage and collection of customer health information is in compliance with federal HIPAA rules, and the company won’t share pharmacy data with advertisers or marketers without permission.

Amazon has leveraged its rich troves of customer data to build advertising into a key pillar of its overall business, and shows customers personalized ads and offers discounts based on what they have bought in the past. But consumers are likely to have a different set of expectations when they’re placing a prescription order versus browsing for a new pair of pants.

“The information and experience you have inside the pharmacy is separate and distinct from the experience that you have on Amazon.com,” Parker said.

PillPack will continue to serve customers even after Amazon Pharmacy launches. That’s because PillPack is designed for a different use-case: It delivers medicines on a 30-day schedule to a population of patients that tend to be sicker and older than average, and often require multiple prescriptions.

## For Prime users: A prescription savings benefit

Amazon Prime members have access to an additional pharmacy perk called the “prescription savings benefit,” which offers a discount of up to 80% on generic medications and up to 40% on brand-name prescriptions.

Amazon negotiated those discounts through a relationship with the Inside Rx savings program, which is part of Evernorth, a company that grew out of a merger between Express Scripts and insurance giant [Cigna](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=CI) in 2018. Insurers use pharmacy benefits managers like Evernorth to negotiate drug rebates from drug manufacturers in exchange for better coverage.

Even for people who have health coverage, the Prime price might still end up being more affordable than the copay -- Amazon’s Parker said it happens “more frequently than people think” (although it won’t count toward a deductible).

Prime customers can also get a prescription savings benefit card to use at up to 50,000 pharmacies, including CVS, Walmart, Rite Aid and Walgreens. This might be preferable for customers who have an urgent need for medication and can’t wait two days for delivery.

Amazon’s Parker said the company does not currently have any brick-and-mortar pharmacies, and declined to speculate on its plans. But in future, the company could add pharmacies to Whole Foods and its chain of Amazon Fresh stores.

Economics,Fed’s Powell Says Rising Coronavirus Cases Pose Threat to Economy,,finance
personalfinance,"My mother is losing control and making impulsive, reckless purchases left and right. I can't watch her become destitute. I feel powerless to help.","My mother has lately become out of control with reckless financial decisions. Saving and being intelligent about finances is not in her vocabulary. After a lifetime living with her, all signs and symptoms point to my mother being a hoarder/compulsive buyer.

The reason this concerns me is that for all intents and purposes I am her accountant. I manage her finances, bills and everything. At one point I didn't, and she lost control of her bills, had subscriptions she was unaware of, and was bleeding thousands of dollars. I started out doing damage control and now I'm actively managing her because she is reckless.

If she sees something in the store she remotely likes, she buys it. Amazon is one of the worst things for this reason. She is burning through her hard earned money and not SAVING anything at a time when saving is more important than ANYTHING she could buy.

Our household has everything we need and more. We have appliances, TVs, computers, phones, plenty of gadgets, furniture and and random items. She has several closets and dressers full of clothes (hoarder). She's constantly buying. Amazon box almost every day. Target box every other day. Walmart box every other day. It never ends. I almost pity the UPS and FedEx delivery drivers.

Part of this is that I see myself as a minimalist. I love having what I need, a few extras, but mostly just what I need to be comfortable. Not feeling cramped by mountains of boxes and other random items that aren't necessary. I almost see myself as waged in a war against her hoarding.

I live with her right now due to life circumstances. I've never tried to tell her what she can and can't buy. All I've ever done for years now is do my best to advise her on how to make informed purchases. For example, when she wanted to buy a new appliance or TV, I took control and made her understand the importance of researching first and finding the best value and reliable options.

For my own finances, I've always practiced this and because of this, despite being younger than my mother obviously, I have comfortable savings and a plan/safety net for the future. I've always been cautious about purchases and just minimalistic or frugal, but not cheap.

When it comes to purchases with real value, like a new computer, or good shoes, or a car, I am diligent and try to make the best decision while factoring everything in. My mother is the polar opposite. She does zero research and buys the first thing the algorithm shows her on Google if it has a few good reviews on the surface.

I am stressed out beyond my limits with my mother. She is out of control. If I give up and stop managing her bills, she will be crushed and helpless. She isn't really literate with technology beyond basic email and navigating pages. She doesn't understand how to talk to customer support, how to manage everything logically.

What should I do here? Should I start with an Excel spreadsheet and just list everything down? How do I stop her impulsive purchases that are causing serious harm? Every part of me wants to teach her a lesson and stop helping her (she doesn't show any gratitude or appreciation for the difficulties I go through for her finances) but if I do that, she's in serious trouble.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"A completely crypto normie here, need help to understand how crypto works, because I'd like to join in.","Hey, I am 19y student from EU and I have been in this sub for maybe over a year, but only now considering to actually learn how crypto works and how to invest in stuff. I'd really appreciate to get any help from veterans as a crypto newbie.

I don't have that much to invest, but I think it would be still better compared to just keeping it as cold cash or in a bank with scam interest rates.

So far what I got from this sub is that I should just hold top 2 cryptos (Bitcoin and Ethereum), not trade and that this is not get rich quick thing, but investing so that I'd have enough money when I retire (or something like that). What I want to know is how would I go about predicting the future market so that I wouldn't lose everything, because I joined late, accidentally bought high, and then it crashed down?

What platforms should I use to invest? What are the pros/cons for using them.

datascience,Hour One ARM Mac Thoughts,"I just got an ARM MacBook Air and the other day, u/sackafackaboomboom posted about if ARM Macs make sense for Data Science work.

## Wait what?
So quick summary, Apple released new M1 chips for their entry level computers this month, which takes the iPhone/iPad A-series chips and optimizes them to run Mac. I've seen very few people talk about M1 for Data Science tasks... so here I am.


## Yes Anaconda Runs. But that's not what you think it means.
[Edit since original post... and since previous edit] Yes, there is an ARM based version of Miniconda which doesn't come with all the packages, but comes with a slick speed up bonus. I posted a little more about this on my notes: https://github.com/mwidjaja1/DSOnMacARM/blob/main/README.md

---

## Before you Judge Me...
1.	Yes, this is an incredibly quick, un-scientific, hot takes on Benchmarks on the new ARM Macs versus two other Macs. I get that. This is just a quick hot take for those who just want a feel on where these new M1 Macs are.
2.	Yes, I know there are far smarter &amp; efficient ways to do data science than on a Mac without a NVIDIA GPU. A Mac is not the right tool for many jobs, but may be your only tool that you have available. This post is more of “If you only had an M1 Mac, could you get away with it?” as opposed to “Should I do all my work on a Mac from now on and pretend nothing else exists?”

## What are you gonna test?
The three computers I tested these benchmarks on are a:

-	2017 $2,000+ iMac: 3.8 GHz 4 Core i5, 16 GBs RAM. Geekbench 1095 Single &amp; 3336 Multi Core.
-	2020 $3,000+ 16” MacBook Pro: 2.3 GHz 8-Core i9, 64 GBs RAM. 1088 Single &amp; 6883 Multi Core.
-	2020 $1,400 MacBook Air: 8-Core m1, 8 GBs RAM. Geekbench 1296 Single &amp; 4601 Multi Core.
-	[Added after the original post] 2018 $1,400 MacBook Air. GeekBbnch 761 Single &amp; 1560 Multi Core.

I’m going to try a (1) Machine Learning Model and (2) Neural Network on these three Macs. Note that none of these tests will exceed the RAM available on any of these machines —thought that would be a fun test one day.

## Sklearn: Interesting
[Edit since original post] I originally ran this using the Intel Sklearn on my ARM Macbook because I goofed. These results are using the ARM Sklearn on my ARM Macbook now.

So then I thought, how about just a normal Sklearn Random Forest Classifier? I spun up Homebrew* and Anaconda and wrote this quick test script:

```python
iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris[‘‘ata’’, iris[‘‘arget’’)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = model.predict(X_test)
digits = load_digits()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits[‘‘ata’’, digits[‘‘arget’’)
model = GradientBoostingClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = model.predict(X_test)
```

I ran this script three times on each machine and the averaged times were:

-	2017 iMac: 4.87 + 5.35 + 5.11 =&gt; 5.11 Avg Secs
-	2020 MacBook Pro: 4.70 + 4.71 + 4.72 =&gt; 4.71 Avg Secs
-	2020 MacBook Air: 3.87 + 3.92 + 4.11 =&gt; 3.95 Avg Secs

## TensorFlow: YESSS!
[Edit since original post] Since I made this post, Apple has released TensorFlow for m1. I ran into lots of installation issues trying to incorporate this with my Conda environment, so if you're in my boat, check out my notes at: https://github.com/mwidjaja1/DSOnMacARM/blob/main/README.md

Here are the benchmarks with Apple's Tensorflow.

- iMac: 629 Seconds
  - 3.8 GHz 4 Core i5, 16 GBs RAM. Geekbench 1095 Single &amp; 3336 Multi Core.
- Macbook Air: 398 Seconds
  - 8-Core m1, 8 GBs RAM. Geekbench 1296 Single &amp; 4601 Multi Core

## Docker, eGPU, Windows: No
Docker posted about how they won’t have optimized versions for M1 until around 2021 so if you MUST have Docker, don’t jump ship for now. Ditto for Windows support (beyond virtualization... though please accept my sympathies if you must data science with Windows). And don’t think about using an eGPU, they do not work with the M1 Macs.

## Pytorch
Fortunately a simple `pip install pytorch torchvision` worked unlike TensorFlow, so I used this for my Deep Learning benchmarks.

I used the MNIST Example Code from https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/mnist/main.py. It’s worth emphasizing these are not ARM optimized versions of PyTorch, this is a brutally unfair comparison of a PyTorch optimized for Intel on an $1.3k MacBook Air for entry level users versus honking Laptops &amp; Desktops designed for ML/DL that are many thousands more.

I ran this script twice, excluding the downloading portion (since it seems unfair to benchmark on download speeds), which led to these averaged times: 

-	2017 iMac: 1513.83 + 1483.67 =&gt; 1498.75 Avg Secs
-	2020 MacBook Pro: 1441.37 + 1452.16 =&gt; 1446.77 Avg Secs
-	2020 MacBook Air: 2180.46 + 2177.52 =&gt; 2178.99 Avg Secs
-	2018 MacBook Air: 1973 Avg Secs (Yes, the old Intel Macbook with pathetic GeekBench scores beat the m1 Mac)

Ouch, these numbers look bad. But, let’s also consider these three things:

-	PyTorch is optimized for Intel, and if there’s an ARM version of PyTorch (I think there probably is), I didn’t get a chance to run it tonight. So the MacBook Air has two hands tied behind its back running PyTorch in emulation mode.
-	The MacBook Air does not have a fan and PyTorch made the Mac reach its thermal maximum. In these situations, the Mac ties a third hand behind its back, and throttles itself. It would be cool to try this on a MacBook Pro or Mac mini with a Fan &amp; M1.
-	The MacBook Air is designed for YouTube Users, not PyTorch Users.

And in that light, no, the MacBook Air is not the machine for Deep Learning. But it’s terrifyingly scary how it can hold its own and the whole time, the Mac didn’t crap out.

# Summary [Revised since original post]
I revised this summary since my original post because TensorFlow is now available on Arm and Miniconda is on ARM.

TensorFlow, optimized for ARM, eats Intel. 

But there are many things not optimized for Intel, that you'd really think should, such as Docker, Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-Learn, and 'normal' Anaconda as opposed to the ARM optimized Miniconda I'm using. In those cases, most of the time, you can use Rosetta to get back up and running with an emulated version, but that's not always going to work.... or work well, as in the case with PyTorch.

But remember, the fact that Macbook Air M1, with no fan, using a brand new architecture, is anywhere this fast to some of the fastest Intel iMacs is terrifyingly amazing. In due time with good development, it'll probably do everything we want and then some.

In the meanwhile, if you're gonna get an ARM Mac for Data Science, you'd probably want a Mac Mini or Macbook Pro just so you get the fan... and get 16 GBs of RAM please. But if you're stuck on a desert island with a Macbook Air and need to run a model, chances are, you can make do with an Air. 

—

* Important to note though, at first, the MacBook Air took WAY longer. Turns out Rosetta has to compile all x86 programs first to the new ARM architecture. So I got these benchmarks by importing all the packages I wanted first in Python and then I can run any of my scripts using those packages to get that 0.07 seconds. To force something in the terminal to run on Rosetta, you must start the command with `arch -x86_64`",technology

Reuters reported last week that Krebs, who worked on protecting the election from hackers but drew the ire of the Trump White House over efforts to debunk disinformation, had told associates he expected to be fired.

Krebs headed up the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

CISA Deputy Secretary Matthew Travis has now resigned, according to Reuters. Sources at the time of this edit have not fully confirmed if the resignation was voluntary or forced.

personalfinance,Father's Medicare subsidies at risk due to maturing HH bonds. Advice needed!,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to help my father navigate a complicated financial situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR**, dad stands to lose several thousands of dollars in Medicare 'Extra Help - Low Income Subsidy' program benefits in 2021 due to insignificant one-time income from deferred interest on inherited HH bonds maturing this year. Is there any legal circumnavigation that would ensure he maintains his full Extra Help benefits?

&amp;#x200B;

**The details:** Dad is in Oregon, 70 years old. He has over $20k in credit card debt, makes minimum payments and on average *adds* about $200/month to his debt. He owns his home outright. His gross income in 2020 was expected to be $15,456 relying solely on Social Security benefits—no pension, retirement accounts—earns \~$90 in interest per year on the bonds described below. At that income level he is at about 121% federal poverty level and is eligible for full [Medicare 'extra help - low income subsidy'](https://www.medicarerights.org/fliers/Help-With-Drug-Costs/Extra-Help-Chart.pdf?nrd=1) program benefits which amount to covered costs of more than **$12,000** worth of prescription drugs annually. The drugs treat his COPD and heart failure and keep him alive.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where things get complicated. My dad inherited some HH bonds a few years ago when his mom passed away. In total the bonds have a face value of $3,000. The face value includes $2,550 in deferred interest from exchanged EE bonds. We learned recently that the bonds are maturing this year. We understand that upon maturity he will be required to report the deferred interest to the IRS (1099-INT) and we expect that means that the bonds will be redeemed automatically—he'd receive the $3,000 in 2020 and owe income tax on the deferred interest. In that event I believe his gross income in 2020 would be $17,706 (SS income + deferred interest).  That income level makes him ineligible for full extra help program benefits—The threshold for full benefit in 2020 is $17,472. That means that his one-time income of $2,550 in deferred interest from the HH bonds will put him $234 over the threshold for eligibility and cause him to be out of pocket more than $12,000 for prescription drugs in 2021. There may be deeper implications to his overall Medicare benefit that I am currently unaware of.

&amp;#x200B;

This will have profound impact on his finances, at the very least causing him to go further in to debt on credit cards (if his limits even allow) unless us kids can scrape together the funds to support him.

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping to find a solution for him. One thought is that he could gift the bonds to his kids. We redeem the bonds and take on the tax burden. In that scenario he never realizes the cash and maintains Medicare Subsidy eligibility. He's happy to gift the bonds to us. We did find however that if he were to have the bonds reissued to me, removing his name than he might still be required to report the deferred interest... from [tresurydirect.gov:  Must I pay taxes when Treasury reissues a bond?](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/hhbonds/res_hhbonds_hhreplace.htm)  ""If the name of the living first-named owner is removed from the registration, then that individual is responsible for reporting on his or her federal income tax return any deferred interest shown on the face of the bond.""

&amp;#x200B;

It also crossed my mind that he could simply choose NOT to redeem the bonds. He could report and pay the tax on the deferred interest, *never* redeem the bonds and *never* receive the $2,550 in deferred interest. In this case could he avoid reporting the deferred interest as income and maintain eligibility for his subsidies?

personalfinance,Question about withdrawing money from Vanguard and closing account,"I’m new to investing so I’m not really sure about the whole process. I opened a Roth IRA with Vanguard with $100 dollars last month but I found a different company that I chose to invest in. I wanted to transfer the $100 out of Vanguard to the other company I’m now invested in, but I keep getting an error email from Vanguard despite going through the process with them on the phone. The wait times to contact Vanguard are always so long, so I’m wondering if I can just withdraw the money from Vanguard, which is currently in the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund, to my bank account on their website. Also, would I be charged any fees or taxes for doing so? The money has been sitting in the Federal Money Market Fund for over a month and hasn’t been invested at all. On top of that, is it also possible to close my Vanguard account online?",finance
personalfinance,Home Loan Refinance Scenarios,"I recently sold my rental property and netted a nice lump sum that I am debating what to do with.  One thought I have is using part of it to do a buy down on my primary residence refinance.  My current mortgage has a 3.5% interest rate, I owe about $488,000 on the house which appraised for $533,000 earlier this year.  I have great credit and after shopping around I can currently get about 2.5% on a 20 year loan or 2.625% on a 30 year loan with very minimal to no points.  

This is where my decision starts to get complicated... when I got my original loan I bought out the PMI.  I'm not willing to do that again so one thought I had is put about $60,000 - $70,000 down on the refinance to avoid PMI and also lower my monthly payment.  Doing the math this would allow me to go with the 20 year loan yet have a similar payment as my current 30 year loan.  I could also go with the 30 year loan with or without making the extra down payment and throw extra at the principal each month.   Without putting anything down on the 30 year scenario, my payment would still be lower even with the PMI so I'm not dead set on getting rid of it, just factoring it into my decision.  

Obviously another big factor is how long I plan on staying at this home, I would say bare minimum 5 years and potentially much longer than that.  I'm not sure how much financial sense it makes to put such a large sum into my home when I don't have to, I have the means to do it but I could also use that money for other investments.  It would make sense in terms of eliminated PMI and allowing me to more easily afford a shorter term loan, but I could also potentially make higher payments without putting it down and have that money as an extra cushion if needed.

Anyway this is what I'm struggling with now, I realize not a bad problem at all to have.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks!",finance

business,Companies Tiptoeing Back to the Office Encounter Legal Minefield,"Companies are wary of reopening offices due to the risk of exposing employees to Covid-19. They are also worried about their own legal exposure should staff get sick.
As Covid-19 cases surge in nearly every state, offices around the country have stayed largely closed or only partially reopened, and not just because of health concerns. For white-collar workplaces, the pandemic has required compliance with the kind of complex workplace-safety regulations that, until recently, applied more to industrial settings than to offices.

Office spaces that fail to comply with the requirements face a liability threat few had to think about before the pandemic, employment lawyers say.
“A white-collar company is not used to having this much burden from a workplace-safety standpoint,” said Travis Vance, an attorney at employment firm Fisher Phillips LLP who estimates he has advised 600 companies on Covid-19-related questions. Of those looking to reopen, he said, about one-quarter have decided the legal requirements are too challenging.


The list of rules and guidelines employers must consult when reopening offices is varied, including guidance from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also includes regulations at the local and state levels, where many new Covid-19-specific workplace safety requirements have been created to try to protect employees amid a pandemic that has killed more than 245,000 Americans.



Such regulations range from the general—including the need to wear masks and ensure social distancing—to the more granular. New York state’s guidance for office reopenings, for example, spans more than 100 bullet points and covers everything from the kinds of amenities that should be installed, such as touch-free water fountains, to the kinds of health records that can be maintained.



Further weighing on companies is how much coverage their workers’ compensation policies will provide if employees say they became ill at work. At least 17 states now have laws that assume an employee who contracts Covid-19 was infected in the office, which triggers workers’ compensation. Employment lawyers say asking employees to sign a waiver before returning to work is unlikely to offer protection in most states.
Beyond concern about possible illness, reopening offices presents a host of privacy concerns and related challenges, including how to store biometric information collected from employee temperature and symptom checks.
Some companies say it is worth the risk. After months of having its 40 employees working from home, workforce-training company 1Huddle Inc. opened a new headquarters in Newark, N.J., in September. The company first consulted with lawyers, and following their advice, isn’t requiring anyone to come in, says CEO Sam Caucci.



To enable social distancing, the company capped attendance at eight people. It mandated masks and installed an extra HVAC unit to improve ventilation. The company is also paying extra in liability insurance, Mr. Caucci said.


“We’re not a Walmart or a Jet, or a well-established tech company where you already have a brand built up,” Mr. Caucci said. As a small company, he said, he felt the company needed an office to help its culture stay strong.



Many others have been slow to return. Offices in 10 major metropolitan areas including New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco have an average occupancy rate of 25% compared with more than 97% before the pandemic, according to data released this month from Kastle Systems, which provides managed office-security services.
A study published this month by the CDC found that employed adults who tested positive for Covid-19 were almost twice as likely to report regularly going to an office or school setting than those who tested negative, and concluded that employers should permit work-from-home where possible.
Neil Murray, chief executive of corporate solutions for commercial real-estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., said he generally wasn’t seeing employers force people back. “I don’t think it’s driven by liability. I think it’s driven by genuine concern for people,” Mr. Murray said, adding that apart from health concerns, disrupted school and child-care schedules also make it difficult for many workers to resume regular office life. The company, known as JLL, said it has opened 131 out of its 135 U.S. offices with capacity restrictions, and with attendance on a voluntary basis.


Some employers have been sued with Covid-19-related claims, though most have stemmed from industrial settings rather than offices. A federal judge in New York recently dismissed a lawsuit brought by Amazon.com Inc. warehouse workers alleging the company created a public nuisance by failing to maintain a safe workspace. The judge said the complaint should be handled by OSHA. “Court-imposed workplace policies could subject the industry to vastly different, costly regulatory schemes in a time of economic crisis,” the judge wrote.



While the bar for proving employer negligence in safety issues has traditionally been high in the U.S., legal experts say given the fast-changing landscape for such regulations, the coronavirus has presented new compliance challenges. Many workplace lawsuits related to the coronavirus targeting employers in retail, logistics and health-care settings have focused on whether employers adhered to state and federal guidelines for reducing the spread of the virus.

Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada and several other states passed laws that shield employers in some instances from Covid-19-related lawsuits if the companies have taken the steps required by law to keep employees safe. Senate Republicans have pushed for a federal law that would shield employers from Covid-19-related liabilities as part of the now-stalled coronavirus stimulus negotiations in Congress. The measure has met resistance by Democrats in the House, who argue it would put workers at risk.

personalfinance,Time to convert some of my Traditional IRA to Roth?,"Hey PF, I am looking for advice on a strategy of converting my Traditional IRA into a Roth. I feel like I should convert some, but not sure how much.

Last year, my employer went under. In the beginning of 2020, I started doing consulting for an old boss, but covid put an end to that. Since then, I have been on unemployment. I live with my S.O. who is immunocompromised and in a high risk group, so working on-site is out of the question. But as of the last couple of weeks, companies in my field/area are starting to post WFH jobs.

Some Info:
-
- 2020 projected income $42k: unemployment + coronavirus federal/state aid + consulting (1099)
 - 12% fed tax bracket with standard deduction.
- File as single
- IRA (currently): $123,000
- Retirement in 30 years (target)
- California resident (if that matters)
- Already contributed $6000 to Roth IRA, so if I convert more than ~$94k, I will have to withdraw (if I calculated my AGI correctly)
- Have no other unusual tax situations.

Assumptions:
- 
- This will be my lowest income year of my working career.
- I will have a job/salary by the end of the year/early next year (I can start replenishing savings used to pay taxes)
- *Tax rates will continue going up, I guess*

Concerns/Questions:
-
- What is the general strategy around this?
- Anything glaring that I am missing?
- Will converting will require me to pay penalties for having Medi-Cal?
 - I was on an open market health care plan Jan - Jul, did not take forward tax deductions.
 - I am currently on Medi-Cal (California's free health insurance/Medicare). 
- I have savings, but rolling over 100% will wipe out about 30% of my savings + brokerage account.
 - Was saving for a house, but plans changed and staying here for at least a few years. Nothing affordable here.",finance

solar,US solar corporate market hits 8 GW,"The fact that some of the major companies in the U.S. are also now some of the largest users of renewable energy in the world is not necessarily breaking news. Google and Walmart, Google by 2030 and Walmart by 2035, are among the latest to make headlines with ambitious pledges to carbon-free operations and the list continues to grow.

But the figures from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)’s latest study underscore the crucial role these corporate renewable energy commitments now play in continuing market development, especially in the absence of federal policy.

U.S. companies added 1,286 MW of PV projects to the grid last year, accounting for just under 10 per cent of all new solar projects in the United States, according to the Solar Means Business 2019 survey. The estimates for this year reflect a modest raise from the 1,144 MW deployed in 2018, while the total corporate solar count now stands at more than 8 GW across 38,000 projects.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nzvprhafpzz51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c4c0797d380d7fe9803919de6da45ea4e70d96b

Best SEIA factoid: 7.2 million Americans, 2.2 per cent of the country, shop at a Walmart with a solar panel every week. Last year, with 122.3 MW, the supermarket chain led the list for fresh solar, but was only No. 3 in the combined overall rankings, falling behind chart leaders Apple and Amazon.

What pushes the private sector, said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA, is a mix of low prices and renewable energy goals. Businesses are ‘walking the walk’ on climate promises, she added, while installation of commercial PV costs continue to plummet, 12% from 2018 to 2019 and 30% over the past five years.

Any smaller commercial projects have been postponed by Covid-19, but ultimately, the major players in the industry are going forward with their expected installs. Other key developments cited in the study include the increased investment by companies in off-site solar plants, which now account for nearly one-third of all corporate energy. It is expected that off-site ventures exceeding 5 GW will go live by 2022.

More corporate companies and larger ventures are also being drawn into the solar sector by the rapid growth of storage.

The study highlights projects such as the Nevada Rob Roy Gigawatt plant, which is being built by Switch, a data centre provider, and is planned to be one of the world’s largest behind-the-meter solar and storage projects.

This January (2021) is two years since I got a car (2019).  However my credit was so bad at the time (below 500) that no one would approve me, even if my friend was a cosigner.

So to get approved, the dealership recommended that I don't sign for it at all, and just have my friend apply and they car would only be in his name.  He applied and got approved.

I've been making steady and on-time payments for the last two years (not one late payment), and for a few months I was even a month ahead in payments.

When I first got the car, the dealership stated that after some payment history was built up (6 months to a year), I could get the loan moved into my name.  How do I go about doing this? What are things I should be aware of, look into, or avoid?

I don't really have a grasp on how refinancing works, if that would apply, or if we would have to redo the loan where I'm the primary and my friend is the co-signer before refinancing again to have him removed completely.  What are the steps here to get this car loan fully in my name so once its paid off the title is just transferred to me?

EDIT: It appears that attempting to refinance the loan only into my name with a different lender is the best option.  If not, then it's possible to refinance the loan into my name with my friend as a cosigner for some time to build credit and payment history before refinancing it again into just my name.

btc,Payment Codes vs Reusable Addresses conversation,"I have run against the [message][1] from u/emergent_reasons describing the future plans of integrating the currently being designed [BCH Reusable Address Proposal][2] into Electron Cash.

While I believe that every such protocol that increases the privacy and usability of Bitcoin Cash is important, I would like to address several points mentioned in the spec regarding the flaws of BIP47 Reusable Payment Codes, as I believe those are not quite serious. In my opinion, while bip47 in it's current form lack several features (eg multisig) it's much more simple solution based on the same idea. We should not discard a clever protocol based on misunderstandings of its promises.

##### BIP47 criticism from Reusable Address Proposal specification

&gt; When weighed against real life usecases and wallets, BIP47 does, however, present several challenges:
&gt; 
&gt; One has to choose either degraded privacy or degraded recoverability. In the case of public notifications, privacy is degraded for a majority of transactions. Most bitcoin transactions are between parties who interact for the first time; recurring transactions are rare, and may remain so for a long time until worldwide adoption - a public notification allows for trivial timing correlation of transactions, narrowing down possible transactions for any given recipient to a trivially small subset. If one opts for offchain notification, and if the recipient loses their backup of any public key notifications - typically harder to store and keep secure than seed words - then funds for the wallet may not be recoverable.
&gt; 
&gt; Implementation is complicated: If notification is onchain, a given wallet has to send two transactions to a first time recipient, and possibly obfuscate timing if one wants to have any semblance of privacy. This greatly complicates implementation difficulty, and creates additional problems in optimizing user experience, not to mention creating a disincentive to use such a system due to additional transaction fees. Offchain notifications lessen the burden, but then raise other questions in terms of recoverability (see above) as well as spam control.

I would like to express my opinion regarding these statements.

&gt; One has to choose either degraded privacy or degraded recoverability.

No. Notification transaction is non-optional. Degraded recoverability is a consequence of not following the spec, and cannot be listed as a flaw of said spec. And with big blocks there are no reasons not to follow the spec. We are speaking about 160bytes for a two-way contact. We are somehow okey with on-chain social network, yet 80 bytes once every so often is a problem?

&gt; In the case of public notifications, privacy is degraded for a majority of transactions.

This is a bold claim. This depends on proper implementation. Payment codes + CashFusion (to spend utxo independently) = great increase in privacy. Even in most basic implementations the privacy is better than plain addresses, and the degraded privacy comes only during first payment (and only in very rare cases, as discussed below). 

&gt; Most bitcoin transactions are between parties who interact for the first time;

While most fiat payments today are between parties who interact often. People tend to favor fewer different chains because of loyalty bonuses, and rest of the transactions are between business partners, friends and family members. Occasional transactions to unknown third parties will always be done towards simple addresses.
 
&gt; recurring transactions are rare, and may remain so for a long time until worldwide adoption.

I don't get it. Are we building for mass adoption or not?

This whole sentence above evaluates payment codes in terms of existing practices, while payment codes allow for a plethora of new, better practices to do on-chain payments. I will try to cover several of them below.

##### 1. b2c interactions.
- Imagine that during user registration both parties publish notification transactions. That way, follow-up purchases may be proceeded fully asynchronously. Customer orders coffee from a smartphone app while on the go, pays from the wallet to cafe's code, cafe sees the payment from a **particular** customer and makes sure the drink is ready on time. Same goes to exchanges, mining pools, other shops etc.
- User makes an order in an offline or online shop but decides to make a refund. The shop refunds a payment to a newly generated address without any additional interaction from any party.
- There can be additional layers of functionality implemented on top of payment codes, like loyalty programs as all payments are automatically associated with each particular customer and guaranteed to be authentic.

##### 2.  Asynchronous non-federated messaging system can be implemented on top of payment codes.

Once two users exchanged codes they have access to two independent ephemeral-address spaces. All they need to send a message is to post it to a simplest web server using such address as identifier of the message file. Recipient checks the server for updates from time to time using the same url. Users can use different servers, and change servers from time to time. Encryption and authentication is backed by the same ecdh scheme payment codes built upon. To subsidize servers, each server has a payment code and sends notification transactions to every user willing to use its service. User pays tiny amounts to store messages and can top-up the server without any interaction, while server automatically associates payments and extends the token lifetime.
To work smoothly, this requires that users publish their preferred initial server's url in some kind of naming system (CashAccounts, Namecoin, ?bchDNS?) alongside Payment Code. Also, users can include payment during notification transaction so that recipient has an incentive to check the message:

&gt; If someone famous is getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and give out the IP address on their website. “Send X bitcoins to my priority hotline at this IP and I’ll read the message personally. [source][satoshi-quote]

##### 3. (Pseudo) recurring payments.

This is a huge problem that payment codes nicely solve. Want to support an artist or developer? Get a payment code and setup you wallet to generate payments once in a month with predefined amount. You then just receive a local notification and hit send. Smooth donation process with better privacy.

You can pay for services the same way. Say you want to top-up your cell data plan through a service that supports payment codes (you exchanged notification transactions during registration). As you know from above, payments made with payment codes are automatically associated with particular user of the service. That said, to top-up a cell you open a wallet, choose the service provider, hit send and boom, everything else is done automatically. Thats the user experience bitcoin cash needs and that's possible with payment codes.

##### 4. Salaries

Employee provides a payment code during placement. Company creates notification transaction. Once every so often according to a contract employee receives a payment, knowing it's a salary. No other interactions required, ever. Same for freelance work – notification transaction is broadcasted early in the process and does not reduce privacy.

The main idea I try to convey above is that while payment codes are often advertised (and were mainly designed) as privacy improving solution, they bring huge **usability improving side-effects**. The thing we had failed to deliver because to this day every wallet out there is a usability nightmare, with a fancy ui **at best**.

&gt; a public notification allows for trivial timing correlation of transactions, narrowing down possible transactions for any given recipient to a trivially small subset

While most use cases I described do not require immediate payment, even if that's absolutely necessary that does not necessarily allow for a trivial timing correlation of transactions.

1. The wallet publishes notification transactions and marks resulting UTXOs as 'locked' for the next payment it generates (the good practice of working with payment codes is to use dust-like utxo for notifications)
2. The wallet generates actual payment and puts it in queue to broadcast it in 3-5 minutes, notifying user that the payment will be proceeded with a little delay
3. Both timing and utxo analysis are eliminated **to some degree** but that is the best we can do now with fully transparent blockchain. Integration with CashFusion makes the whole system much more private.

&gt; This greatly complicates implementation difficulty

A simple **queue** and **timer** greatly complicates the implementation? 

&gt; and creates additional problems in optimizing user experience

From a user's point of view, this whole two-transaction-dance is almost fully transparent (besides simple notification).

And again, this only has something to do with complication if immediate payment is necessary, while most other use cases and real world scenarios do not require notification and payment to occur at the same time. While the vast majority of further payment codes payments does not require notifications at all. Let's not forget we speak about a one-time burden.

&gt; not to mention creating a disincentive to use such a system due to additional transaction fees

We are talking about pennies, aren't we? And only once per recipient with whom you will transact often.


And finally, the huge point in favor of payment codes is that there are **several** implementations, and even a working bitcoin cash app (CrescentCash) already. By introducing another incompatible protocol we will further lose focus on delivering good usability and privacy to end users. 

The proposal in question is about a whole new system, we will wait ages until it takes-off, if ever. We don't have that time.

With payment codes there are implementations for [Java (etc)][samourai] [Kotlin (bch)][crescentcash], [C++ (ZCoin)][cpp] and even [Swift][swift].

I would say we have the foundation to move forward. BIP47 will bring us to a better usability and privacy much faster than some fancy new and not less complicated protocol.


&gt;Relaying: Infrastructure needed
&gt;There are two methods of receiving: Offchain communications, which saves on bandwidth but entrusts privacy to &gt;relay and retention servers, and onchain direct sending, which is trustless on privacy but requires more &gt;bandwidth. **We describe a single type of server required for both types**, as well as two additional types &gt;required to make use of the offchain communications method:

I may completely misunderstand the Reusable Address Proposal proposal, but if it requires some kind of external infrastructure it does not stand up to a completely autonomous client-side solution which is bip47.

investing,Does it make sense to leverage your portfolio with rates so low?,"With interest rates so low, am I a sucker for not leveraging my portfolio?

#The math:

(Using Canadian values)

Cost of borrowing = 1.5% + benchmark -- gets lower over $100K

CAD benchmark rate = -0.0037% [0] -- fluctuates daily

Margin requirement = 30% to 50% [1]

Max S&amp;P drawdown in a given recession: 56% (2007) [2]

**So, with expected gains at 7%, and borrowing costs at ~1.5%, isn't this a no brainer?**

Leverage your portfolio to 1.5-2x, and enjoy 78% (7%/(7%-1.5%)) higher returns as long as you can hold onto the position.

---

#Risk:

Having margin requirement raised. Happened during the recent US election. Could push you into a margin call. Only about 1 week notice.

IB will just liquidate you without warning.

A recession could wipe you out if your leverage is at or over 2x if it's as bad as 2008.

---

#Other things:

Potential to earn income for lending out hard to borrow shares (not much)

Monthly fee of $10 and transaction fees

Will be earning money through work to reduce leverage, even in the event of recession (assuming no job loss) so may be able to hold onto position for longer.

We have pre-approval letters from a couple of lenders and we are getting about 2.75% from all the ones we've talked to so far (nothing locked in yet). We have not yet made an offer on a house but will as soon as we find something suitable. Our max purchase price is 250k (but looking for lower also) and we have 20k set aside for a down payment plus 8-10k for closing costs. We would have PMI but looks like not much, about $50 per month. With our credit scores, down payment, etc we are looking at a monthly payment of about $1400.

My concern is that I'd like the payment to be lower so we can put more money into our retirement (we are in our early 40's and behind on this), BUT, we don't know if we will be in the house long term. Right now we are thinking about 5-7 years, but depending on what happens with my career it could be longer, or possibly less (but that's doubtful).

To get the monthly payments lower, would it be better to increase the down payment? Buy more points to decrease the interest rate? We actually had one lender recommend only putting 5% in down (instead of the 20k which would be about 8%) and we were still getting approx $1400 per month payment. Or should we do none of those things and stick with the original plan of 20k down and whatever points needed to stay around 2.75%?

I currently make $73/hr, taking home around 3500 biweekly on average (now 2600 biweekly since I'm on maternity leave). My husband was out of a job for the previous 10 months due to COVID, but has just started a job making $53/hr for a minimum of 32 hrs a week. I'm not sure what his take home pay will be because I'm waiting for his benefits to kick in, in which we plan to max out his 401k and go from there. I use Mint to track our spending and will be going mostly from those numbers

Credit scores: 782 for me, 779 for SO

Avg income: 12k/month  (after contribution to my 401k and our HSA)

Avg monthly spending: 4k (will break down further below)

Cash avail: $88k ( 30k are for our 6 months emergency fund)

Bills per month: 

\- Rent: $1550 (utilities included, living with in laws)

\- Car payment : $453 (only $2770 left in loan, 0% interest, projected to be paid off by June 2021, paying extra $50/month)

\- Cell phone: $150 ( for 5 lines; we are covering for my family)

\- Student loans: $ 969 ($43000 left in loan, refi in January 2020 and got 2.2% interest, plan to snowball car payment into student loans once car is paid, paying extra $100/month to principle)

\- Car insurance: $130

\- Gas: $100 (will increase to approx 250 once I return to work)

\- Groceries: $400

\- Take outs: $300 (hoping to reduce but it's hard to cook with a newborn)

The rest go to various savings: continue to contribute to emergency fund, dog fund, and now daughter fund, as well as ""fun money"" for my spouse and I (in our own accounts). The bulk just sit in our checking however, which is included in the cash availability section. We put everything on our Chase Sapphire or Costco cc and pay them off in full each month.

personalfinance,Get a loan or use savings?,"For any purchase from a car to a business startup to a holiday, providing the APR is reasonably manageable (~10%), would you get a loan, use credit cards, your savings or a mixture to cover the cost?

I'm considering a business purchase of £13,500 and I've had experience with credit cards (6.4% and 18%) and loans (29.8%!!) before and everything has been paid off comfortably, however I am fully aware I must have paid about £3-4000 in interest over three years for about £20,000 of total borrowing. I naively spent over a year only making minimum payments on two credit cards so I was essentially paying about £80 interest per month whilst only actually paying £40 off the overall debt per month.

I have savings and as they continue to grow I'm reluctant to use them for further purchases, however to save as much in interest as possible, would you say I'd be better using my savings to limit the overall debt? That would ultimately put a short term burden on quality of life and disposable income, but would bring me back to square one much quicker.

Is there a point in which the overall cost of borrowing is irrelevant if the debt can be paid off efficiently, thus paying less interest?

My credit rating is only just getting back up into the 800's (Experian /999 max score) so my available borrowing isn't very favourable in terms of interest rates.

If I used my savings the debt should be recouped within 6 months. If I borrowed the full amount I could pay it back within 12-18months, the former putting a bit of a stranglehold on my quality of life (disposable income etc). The latter would ease my finances, but overall I would be paying back more. A little bit like a 30 year mortgage where I can pay more as and when I can, reducing the debt faster but without the obligation of doing so regularly, and giving myself breathing space if things go tits-up.

Can I afford it? Yes. I spent 8 months paying 40% of my income towards a previous investment which was difficult but it gave me an invaluable experience into debt and finance management.

Is it sensible? I'm skeptical. I may be able to borrow privately but i usually feel better to keep family and friends out of my finances.",finance

Bitcoin,Analyzing bitcoin from a macro perspective. Socio-economic factors and bitcoin in late 2020.,"As it stands today, bitcoin represents roughly few basis points of all assets, and roughly 10 basis points of total tradeable assets. Bitcoin is still a niche thing.

In the next decade  $230 trilion dollar worth investment will need to find new investment. Assuming a small percent of this will huge base will flow to bitcoin we can see double or even triple digit rate of return per year.

It's a hedge against bad governance like gold, but it is harder (Bitcoin is the hardest asset in the world and the stock-to-flow ratio will be infinite), with much bigger upside because it's in an early life stage. (You can go to zero, but the upside is indefinite, it has a huge asymmetry, a powerful investment concept).

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see what is happening these days in the world, seperate the signal from noise and see clearly.

Most important trends today, in the beginning of the new decade:

&amp;#x200B;

Monetary/Economic:

\- Central banks policy: Decreasing interest rates and rapidly increasing monetary base. (Throughout  the history we can positive correlation in the price of gold and monetary base, that will be true for bitcoin as well.)

\- Fiscal dominance in the Western world's policy. (Goverments will spend a lot of money, debt will increase)

\- Questionable future of dollar as a reserve currency as US share of world GDP declines. (This is a longer term (15-20 years+) trend, we are nowhere close to the end of dollars reserve currency status, but it's imortant to consider as well.)

\- Huge inflation of financial assets (Bond, equity prices are already record high, future yields are somewhat limited, which is great for bitcoin)

\- Disinflation in CPI terms and slowing velocity of money. (Bad for economic growth)

\- Deflation of wages (We can expect more aid and ""stimulus checks"" )

\- Debt-liquidity spiral, solvency issues of corporations. (There are a lot of indebted, zombie companies in the US and the rest of the world, policy makers won't let them go bankrupt, because the dominoes would start falling, so that's another factor with points to more expected liquidity)

Also governments can't confiscate bitcoin, it's totally decentralized, they would have to kill the internet to stop it)

\- Ageing society in the western world and the incoming pension fund crisis. (The average public pension plan is assuming a 7.22% annualized return going forward. I seriously doubt this target will be met. Older people will increasingly look for store of value options.)

All in all i think in the year of 2020 every trend helpful for bitcoin. Lots of politicians/CEO/coproration and institutions buying it up, and they have a huge sway on policy makers, The smart money/macro investors are buying it up right now which is also a good indicator that buying bitcoin is a great opportunity and it also has a huge network effect so other cryptos will have an impossible task go dethrone it.

This is a rare event in history, we are in crossroads and in the middle of it, there is only one thing: bitcoin.  I've never seen an investment opportunity like this, i have to agree with Raoul Pal, he said ""bitcoin is the world's most pristine asset"", don't miss this once in a lifetime opportunity.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,chances of personal loan for small debt consolidation?,"Over the last few months I got myself into a bit of credit card debt and owe about $700 to a local hardware store for home renovations. All of this adds up to roughly $4500. Im wondering if there’s any chance of me taking out a small personal loan from my credit union to pay these off, consolidating them into one monthly payment with a lower interest rate..

It’s crazy to think a few short months ago I could’ve easily payed this off in full. I recently came into a free house from my grandmother which needed about $10k worth of renovations. This saved me around $700 in rent so even though it’s put me in a tight spot I believed it’s worth it. Also, earlier this year I wrecked my car, so when I inherited my mother’s vehicle upon her passing I realized this was a blessing in disguise and decided to drive her car instead of financing another new vehicle. So fast forward to now my cost of living is basically just utilities, food, gas, WiFi, phone.

I’m currently only 20, but until the past couple months my credit score had been 720-750 since I was around 19. I was told I had top tier credit and was offered an interest rate of 4% on my previous auto loan without a co-signer. I’ve had a few credit cards as well to build credit which I usually paid in full every month until recently. I’m fairly confident I could get a small loan of around 5k to cover these small debts. 

The only issue is moving to this house meant relocating, switching jobs, and switching banks. I used to bring in around 2800-3500/month serving, however other than a tip log I don’t have much proof of that as we didn’t claim all our tips. I recently got a new serving job here and don’t have a very good idea of my new expected income, but my credit is pretty decent and I don’t have many bills or any loans so I’m hoping my credit union will loan me the money! 

How do I approach this as I’ve had so many big financial changes recently and haven’t had this job or an account with this credit union for long?

EDIT: I do have a detailed tip log from my old job including my biweekly payroll checks and the paystubs to prove it which is how I was approved. Today is my last training shift at my new job so within a couple weeks I should have direct deposited checks, and cash tip deposits to prove my new income.",finance

personalfinance,Federal withholdings against severance,"I was recently laid off (not COVID related).  I'll be getting a severance payout in January (2021).  Let's pretend that amount is 45k.

I'm told that severance is also taxed at 22%.

This payment will be made separately from a regular paycheck.

With all that in mind, I'm trying to understand what any additional withholdings will look like.  

Will the state withhold income taxes against this?  If so, this is easy enough to calculate as my state has a flat rate.

stocks,"Facebook, Apple and Other Big Tech Stocks Aren’t Too Expensive. Here’s Why.","Tech stocks have soared this year as the pandemic rapidly shifted people to remote work and school. Still, according to strategists at Goldman Sachs, the five largest U.S. tech companies actually aren’t overvalued.

First off, these stocks—Facebook ￼ (ticker: FB), Apple ￼ (AAPL), Amazon ￼ (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOGL), and Microsoft ￼ (MSFT)—are up about 49% year-to-date on average. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 is up just under 12% for the year. Before Sept. 2, these five stocks had an average multiple on the next two years of earnings of roughly 35 times, against 12 times for the other 495 stocks on the S&amp;P 500, according to Goldman Sachs data. That was the widest valuation gap between the group and the broader market since 2000—before the tech bubble burst.

Lately, investors have taken note of the drastic surge in the five stocks’ valuations. Since September 2, the group is down about 3% on average. Meanwhile, large-cap value stocks, judging by the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (VOOV), have climbed 5.2%. Now, the so-called FAAMG group is trading at roughly 31 times earnings, compared with 20 times for the other 495 stocks.

Many on Wall Street are wary of big tech as these multiples would seem bound to continue falling after their meteoric rise this year, and as interest rates rise when the economy starts to see a more solid recovery. Tech stocks, after all, would see less of a benefit from a firming economy. Mostly, growth stocks such as these five tend to have idiosyncratic revenue drivers that aren’t affected by changes in the economy—while the revenues of value stocks like consumer discretionary are very much tied to consumer spending trends and economic growth.

Evercore strategists recently said they only see S&amp;P 500 gains of roughly 5% in the next year or so because they don’t expect big tech to outperform the way it has in recent history.

But David Kostin, Goldman Sachs’ chief US equity strategist, argues in a note that “fundamentals support higher valuation for FAAMG.”

Kostin noted that the near-term earnings outlook for FAAMG stocks supports the current valuations. Goldman is looking for S&amp;P 500 companies to post a median annual earnings per share growth of 8% for the next few years. The tech group is expected to see EPS growth of about 17%.

Comparing these companies’ earnings multiples to their near-term earnings growth rates—which many analysts do to determine how fair a valuation is—further justifies Kostin’s point. Facebook’s PEG ratio—calculated by taking the stock’s forward price-to-earnings ratio and dividing by its projected earnings growth rate—is 1.2 times, roughly in line with in its five-year average of 1.1, according to data from FactSet. Amazon’s PEG ratio is 1.6 times, notably lower than its five-year average of 2.4. Alphabet’s PEG is at 1.9 against an average of 1.5, although its five-year high is above 2. Microsoft’s PEG is 2, in line with its average. Apple is the most overvalued by the metric, with a PEG of 2.6 against an average of 1.5.

With the exception of Apple, these companies are expected to see EPS compound an annual rate between the midteens in percentage terms to above 30%. If investors are willing to pay top dollar for these stocks, earnings growth could continue to take them higher.

All five have dominant platforms that create seemingly endless synergies. Amazon’s new online drug business, for example, offers perks to their roughly 70 million Prime members. This can drive adoption of the new offering, but can also drive new prime customers.

The point is tech stocks are pricey for good reason—don’t count them out.

personalfinance,When and how to utilize the backdoor Roth technique if you are young and in the higher tax brackets.,"Primary Financials as of late 2020

* Married Filing Jointly
* We both work with a gross income of $120,000 each ($240,000) total.
* We both maxed out (and plan to continue) the $19,500 pre-tax contributions to our respective 401(k)s.
* We both maxed out (and plan to continue) the $6,000 after-tax contributions to our respective traditional IRAs.  

Other Financials

* Our pre-tax IRAs currently have about $14,000 total ($6,000 each in non-deductible after-tax contributions and $1,000 each in earnings)
* One of our jobs has an after-tax non-Roth 401(k) option we could pursue if we wanted to increase out contributions.
* We have about $30,000 in a normal taxable brokerage
* We have about $60,000 in a standard bank account
* Only existing debt is $20,000 in student loans at a 3% interest rate
* We rent and do not plan to buy a house.  

We are looking for advice and discussion on two main questions.

* When does it make sense to convert your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA (utilizing the backdoor Roth technique) rather than just keep your money in the traditional IRA? We are beginning to think the answer is basically always if you are high income.
* If you have one and only one traditional IRA in your name which has been around for some time (assuming all of it was non-deductible after-tax contributions), can you rollover the after-tax contributions to a Roth IRA and the earnings to a pre-tax 401(k)? The IRS comments on [Rollovers to Multiple Destinations](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/rollovers-of-after-tax-contributions-in-retirement-plans#:~:text=This%20means%20you%20can%20roll,such%20as%20a%20Roth%20IRA.&amp;text=A%20distribution%20of%20%2410%2C000%20in%20after%2Dtax%20amounts%20to%20yourself.) saying that ""you can roll over all your pretax amounts to a traditional IRA or retirement plan and all your after-tax amounts to a different destination, such as a Roth IRA.""  

Personal context:

We are about 30 presently and are planning to be entirely financially independent (i.e. any additional work income would be truly optional) as soon as our last kid goes to college (around age 50 - 55). We both have graduate degrees so we are still very early in our careers. For the purposes of being financially independent we are aiming to live on $100,000 per year in todays dollars. We want to max pre-tax accounts for long-term growth, but also don't want to get stuck with a fat retirement account subject to RMD causing us to withdraw way more than we need. We have recently learned about utilizing HSAs as retirement accounts and have recently started pursuing this as well. The part where we seem to be struggling the most is how to plan the way our future taxes pan out and the ideal way to fund the first 5-10 years (72(t), Roth conversion ladder, just pay the penalty, etc.) before we hit the formal retirement age.

personalfinance,Should i look other places for Refi,"so ""wife"" and I just started refi'ing the house

former interest rate was 4.375. and we have done  around 6 years of payments on it ( so around 24years left). house value is around 220k and we are 172k remaining in our current mortgage loan. Current payments including insurance is  1669.

Current lender came back with a new 30 years term at 2.875%. Monthly payments would be around 1200. If we keep the same payments it will lower the time from 24 years remaing to around 16 years cutting of around 8 years of payments new

Chase (our main bank) came back with 2.99 but monthly payments around the same 1200ish

so im thinking current lender is just adding a bigger refi cost into the loan which is what is making up for the lower interest rate..

personalfinance,Worth opening new Checking/Savings accounts to receive $500 Chase bonus?,"I have been banking with Wells Fargo for over 10 years. Have Checking and Savings accounts with them. I used to have a mortgage with WF as well, but recently refinanced and moved elsewhere. Also recently moved most of my savings to Ally. WF Checking is my only active checking account where I receive my paycheck, and where all my automatic payments are tied to. Apart from force of habit, I don't have many reasons to stick with WF except, they have a branch 5 min from my home.

I received an offer from Chase that promises $500 sign on bonus for opening a Checking and a Savings account with them after meeting certain criteria (qualifying direct deposits for Checking and $15000 deposit to Savings). I normally don't consider these offers, because I don't want to deal with the hassle, but since interest rates have been really low and my Ally isn't returning as much as it used to, I am thinking it might make sense to take this opportunity to bank the extra $500. 

Here is my question - are there any downsides to closing checking/savings accounts with banks the way there are downsides to closing credit cards? I would potentially consider closing out my WF accounts completely since I don't want fragmented accounts scattered across multiple banks. I will still keep my Ally account, because after Chase's 90 day threshold to get the $500 I plan to move most of my money back to Ally for the much higher interest rate. The money in my savings is purely for emergencies so they need to remain liquid. 

Is there anything I am missing that could be detrimental in the long run? Chase and WF are pretty comparable in service from what I am reading, anybody have any experiences to the contrary and which one would you recommend?

 - When interest rates rise, bond prices fall (and vice-versa), with long-maturity bonds most sensitive to rate changes.

This is because longer-term bonds have a greater duration that near-term bonds that are closer to maturity and have less coupon payments remaining.

 - Long-term bonds are also exposed to a greater probability that interest rates will change over its remaining duration.

 - Investors can hedge interest rate risk through diversification or the use of interest rate derogates.

From my research, I can purchase a dual lock property for around $550-600k with a rental yield of 6.5% ($600k = $750 a week, roughly $700 clear) or buy an existing home for $450k and build a granny flat on it for $100-150k with similar rental yields.

This will mean that each property lets say purchased for 600k will require a weekly repayment of roughly $600 a week (P &amp; I based in 3.2%). Therefore, an extra $100 a week is paid off the mortgage. 

So, I have three rentals with mortgages of $270k and 2 x $600k. I’ve used mortgage repayment calculators and worked out I can pay an additional $6700 a month off minimum repayments I’ll finish paying this $270k mortgage in 3 years. From here the plan is to go all out aggressive on one of the $600k mortgages. By year 3 both of the $600k mortgages should be down to $546k based on the calculator with $100 a week being paid off the mortgage from the surplus rent. To remain conservative, I am not including rental increases etc in my year to year calculations. As the mortgage is now $546k, the minimum repayments per week will now be $546. $700-$546 = $154 surplus. With the added $154, $480 (rent from paid off property) and $5800 it will mean we’re paying $8500 extra a month.

Based on the calculator at this rate for 2 years it will bring the mortgage down to $312k. The other mortgage I have in 5 years of being surplus $100 a week according to the calculator will be $535k. Yes, I haven’t included rent increases which would mean lower mortgage after 5 years as I want to remain conservative as I feel there may be things I’ve missed so hopefully this covers them. I therefore have a total mortgage of $847k. I am going to use in my opinion a very conservative 4% capital growth in order to work out what my properties will be worth in 5 years. $610k = $742k &amp; 2 x $600k = 729k TOTAL: $2.2m

Banks allow you to borrow up to 80% of what your property is worth before LMI etc. so based on property worth $2.2m and mortgage of $847, the LVR is ($847k/$2.2m) 38.5%. 80%-38.5% = 41.5%. 41.5% of $2.2m = $913k that I could borrow up to.

To sum all this up if I was to pay the minimum (P &amp; I) on my mortgages $847k it will be $847 a week. Yes, I am aware things can change with interest rates and if they rise it will change everything, but I am going to assume they remain steady in this scenario. Do tell me otherwise and justify.

I am now going to work out what my rentals will be paying in 5 years time which I’ll use 2% as yearly increase (encourage feedback if you think its too much). $480 = $530, 2 x 700 = $773. Total rent per week = $2,076 minus minimum mortgage repayment of $847 equals a surplus of $1,229.

I am hoping that after five years of hard work building what I call a lower risk property portfolio that I can make my forever home purchase. Hoping to borrow between around the $1.5m mark to purchase our forever home which will mean a weekly repayment of roughly $1500. As I am already cash flow positive $1229, it will mean I only need to come up with $271 a week to meet minimum repayments. 

Plan is my three investments do their own thing; one paid out, other two I’ll eventually own outright. They pay for over 80% of the mortgage on my forever home and my family and I live and enjoy our money as we’ll own everything one day as repayments are all P &amp; I. If we wish to pay it down faster we can, but we want to enjoy life after committing 5 years. 

I am well aware there are many other ways to build wealth, passive income etc. I am no expert and have no financial background. This is all my opinion only and I am sure there are other routes to achieve similar or better results. I am after opinions of experienced people such as yourselves to tell me 1. Will my plan work based on my numbers, 2. What numbers in my plan are out, 3. What is a lower risk, similar or higher result 5 year plan you can offer and do go into detail. Yes, maintenance and rates etc. haven’t been included I know.

Sorry for the long story but I just wanted to give enough details so you can understand my plan. Do remember, this is my five year plan to setup my family for the future.",finance

vet,My cat is randomly being sick,"My cat, Robin, is about 4 years old and has been generally healthy throughout his life. Recently, as in this year, he has been able to go outside with his brother Dexter, not blood but hey, and our dog Ollie, all are around the same age. We have a little enclosure for them, think like prison walls stopping inmates climbing the fence because they won't get past the top? Yeah, that's basically what we have.

He has all his vaccinations for going outside and is actually due for them now or thereabouts. However, he has all of a sudden started being sick, earlier tonight it was like he had eaten grass or something cause it was wet, soggy and full, but we have artificial grass so he hasn't eaten that or it would be identifiable, and he hasn't gotten out of the garden because it literally is impossible for a cat, and even more impossible to get back in. Like you'd eaten shreddies and spewed them up. He spewed that up, ran away for a few minutes then came back and I fed them which he jumped at the opportunity to eat which isn't really like him. So he is eating which is a good sign. However only about 10 minutes ago, he was being sick again in front of me this time and it was pretty much just like bile with a hairball in it. I wouldn't be phased by the hairball typically but neither cat usually spews up hairballs. He then got quite timid and stood still for a minute as I clapped him and continued to stay still when I stopped. He then sat on my lap for about 5 minutes, not like him again, and sauntered off to the rest of the house. They don't go outside at night so he will be somewhere.

Should I be worried? They've been sick before but not with the produced spew like this like complete contrasting spew, one like it's purely food and the other like it's purely water or whatever. I'm gonna phone the vet in the morning for sure to get him in for vaccination boosters but don't want him to die during the night for something I haven't noticed",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Refinancing on home and HELOC. Is this a good plan?,"So our home is worth about $253k. We have $129k left on a 30yr mortgage (19years left) at 4.85%, and about $15k on a HELOC that I can’t remember the current rate of at this second. HELOC was just refinanced a year ago, to $45k cap but the appraisal was a bit of a fail and was extremely low. We have added an entire finished pole building now that we hope will boost the value a bit more.  We also added a few more acres to the property. 

We have some major renovations planned for the house next year, estimating it’ll be around $100k to complete in full. This is our forever home and worth it to us to make these renovations. This cost estimate is also higher to accommodate if there is unforeseen circumstances. 

Our plan is to refinance the house, and we have been told the rate would be around 2.875 for 15 years. That really doesn’t change our payment much(minus the closing costs) so I think it’s worth doing. Then we are going to try to refinance the HELOC. We are hoping to get it extended to $100k or closer to it than what we have. 

Based on this.... is this a good plan, or is there a better course of action? Cash out refinances seemed to give us a much higher interest rate that didn’t seem worth following through on. Obviously we are still in the number crunch area. We do not qualify for a VA loan either.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Loan Modification - Interest rate dropped?,"Need help figuring out if we need to reach back out, to get paperwork fixed, if someone has made an error etc etc. 

- Sept 2013, we bought a house. VA loan, no downpayment, 160k all said and done. 
- April 2020, up till then we had been on time, up to date with our mortgage. But like everyone else, covid screwed us over. School was not in session and dogsitting relies on people going traveling. Our income went to nothing. We take the mortgage break, sign up with our mortgage holder and get it deferred for 3 months. 
- June 2020, husband has a lead on a job, but it's dragging it's feet. So we extend it another 3 months. 

- August 2020, heck yeah! We can start paying again because who the hell gets a job in a pandemic... after 5 years underemployed and hustling? My husband. 

- September 2020, mortgage holder reaches out and by now we've been two months back to paying our mortgage. Drones on phone are idiots. We have 3 months to pay the balloon payment. Wait, what balloon payment? 

- Get with the person who actually works our loan and not a drone. Because we lived in a state where there was a natural disaster (Derecho, god. Still dealing with that), someone had tripped us over into forebearance, vs the deferment. No wonder his security clearance was looking at us funny. 

- We get things cleared up, mortgage holder is doing loan modification, working with us, we're fine. They have to do a title search (Why? I have no clue, but they do) and a month later (today) we got the loan modification paperwork. There's issues. 

- Borrower is not me. But they have slapped my name all over it. We have to take these papers to a notary (they'll supply the notary), but he was the original borrower. It says on all the paperwork except one, that I am on there as witness and the debt has nothing to do with me. I currently have no ID. We are in the process of replacing it. We will not have any valid (Do have old expired) ID, and so literally cannot witness it, because notary's will want ID (And I understand, it's their license on the line). Do we call them up and get new paperwork with my name removed? Do we bring a different witness with us? We can find a witness. (No, I am not on the original loan, I am only on the title of the house, Not looking for any information/help re: that). 

- Our original loan (VA), was 160k at 4.7%. Go go shit credit score. The paperwork states repeatedly that this is not a refinancing. We are not looking for a refinancing, just to punt the payments to the back end. Cool. But it lists the interest as 3.1% and loan at 140k. Is this... right? They've dropped our interest rate 1.6%. Do we need to be calling them to say ""hey, interest rate is wrong, you might want to re-send it with the right information?"" I mean, hey, we'll take 3.1 for sure, that knocks our payment down 100 bucks a month. But... this was a modification of the time, not a refinancing. 

Am I overthinking? I have about a week to call them and get things fixed. Are we fine? Are there issues?",finance

personalfinance,Home Buying Decision,"Not sure if this is the correct sub, but hopefully someone may have an answer.

I (31) am looking at buying a home with my significant other (26) in the near future. First time owners, no kids, two dogs, not married. Combined income is ~195,000, with probable future earnings potential. Credit score is 780+ for both.

Currently renting at $1895 per month. This is market price, or a little below. We enjoy the home, location, etc.

With savings, we could afford to put about $30k-35k toward a down payment. We are actively browsing homes in the $330k-$400k range. Based on traditional mortgage calculators, this would equate to monthly payments roughly between $1800 to upwards of $2200 depending on interest rate and other factors. 

Significant other would prefer to buy immediately, with the goal of building equity as opposed to “wasting” monthly rent payments. No to mention the idea of owning is rewarding in itself. 

I believe it would be better financially to continue saving for a more substantial down payment in order to lower mortgage payments. My rationalization being - assuming the mortgage would be greater than the rent, we’d net the cost savings per month, plus interest on it invested, along with current savings plan. The larger down payment would allow for a smaller monthly mortgage, in which net savings from significant others plan could be accumulated and invested/saved. Over a multi-year time period, this would result in a greater accumulation of wealth and prove to be a smarter long term strategy than the immediate equity gained but purchasing now. 

Am I being excessively conservative and/or overthinking this decision, or is savings and waiting the better route to go? Curious what input others have.",finance

Above is a picture explaining how the account works. But tbh I'm confused on how this ""primary savings"" account works exactly. The way I think it works is like so. If I had 10,000$ in this account, only 1000$ of it will receive the 6% interest while the remaining 9,000$ receives an interest rate of .25%. Is that correct? 

If that is indeed the way it works, I would technically be better off moving my money into other accounts that yield higher interest rates, correct? I was thinking the DCU's equivalent to CD ladders. 

Side note, I'm also confused on what the difference between dividend rate and APY is... could anyone explain please?

Robert Jones, 32, waited for a brief pause in conversation between whoever he happened to be standing next to at the time, before saying, in a nonchalant manner, ""Soooo, what do you guys think about Bitcoin?"" This was then followed by a fifteen minute monologue about how the FED is printing money and devaluing the dollar, and a confident assertion that ""Bitcoin will be $200k within 12 months, you mark my words.""

Speaking after the party, Robert's work colleague Joe, told The CryptOnion, ""Rob's always going on and on about Bitcoin. I warned my wife about it before we came to the party, but she still ended up stuck in a one way conversation with him about it. It wasn't until she caught my eye from the other side of the room and mouthed the words, *'Help me,'* that I was able to rush over there and rescue her. The worst part is that in the car on the way home she started asking me if I knew what something called Doge coin is.""

Another of Robert's colleagues backed up Joe's claims: ""Oh man, if I hear Rob mention Bitcoin one more time I swear I'm going to tear my hair out. A few of us were in the middle of a conversation about our plans for the Christmas holidays, when Rob got his phone out, let out an exaggerated gasp, and informed everyone that the Bitcoin price was up 5% in the past hour. Nobody said anything and a few people rolled their eyes, before Rob proceeded to tell us all that if we'd had invested in Bitcoin when he told us to, we'd have doubled our money. The guy only bought $100 for crying out loud, now he thinks he's the Wolf of f**ing Wall Street!""

We found Robert alone in the car park after the party, looking at his phone. Ater asking us if we had heard of Bitcoin, we then asked him about his plans for Christmas: ""We'll be having a pretty low key one this year. The wife and kids get pretty excited by it all, but to be honest I don't really want to throw away money buying an expensive turkey, Christmas tree, and presents for them all. My son said he wants a new bicycle, and I know my wife is hopeful of getting a bottle of her favourite perfume, but I've decided to buy them both a little bit of Bitcoin each instead.

So I’m a little nervous to pull the trigger on paying off the debt.

What I’m thinking I might do is just pay off a good portion of the debt now, focus on paying off the rest in 2021 as early as possible, and hang on to a month’s worth of emergency savings as a cushion. What do you think? Or are there other ways that I should consider using the windfall that could be more advantageous?

Here’s some additional info:
-I have confidence in job security with my current employer
-Other debts: $12,900 (car loan)
-Salary: $65.5k
-Retirement savings: $52k
-Currently renting, no mortgage

cybersecurity,Healthcare Cibersecurity,"Guys, I hope this post isn't too tagential.

To keep it short, I am medical doctor quite disenchanted/fed up with the medical field. 
I have been working for 6 years in a EU country, gaining deep experience in radiology, but also in a few other fields.
I have been entertaining the idea of developing my long standing interest in IT. I have seen first hand the destruction security breaches can bring onto a medical system and this has poked my interest towards cybersecurity.
I am willing to spend a few years developing new technical skills, wether that is through a master degree or whatever. So my questions here are the following:

- do you see anyway someone with industry experience such as myself can play a role in cybersecurity?
- do you know any masters/degree that can help me gather the right and ge a foot into the field? Ideally something online as I can keep some of my work part time.
-do you know any companies that focus on healthcare? Ideally in Europe?

personalfinance,401(k) to ROTH IRA Tax Implications,"Hello all, 

I'm looking for some advice on a 401(k) to ROTH IRA rollover. 

I have $250 in a 401(k) sponsored by an employer I am no longer with and I would like to roll it over into my ROTH IRA. My plan it to do a direct rollover. I'm an here to ask about the tax implications, especially considering the CARES Act which suspends the 20% income tax withholding for rollover distributions in 2020. 

Does this mean I will not need to choose to withhold any percentage for state and federal taxes when I go to execute the rollover? If I choose this option, will I owe any taxes on the rollover amount?",finance

personalfinance,Second home mortgage strategy,"We are thinking seriously about buying a new house in the $400 - $500k range, and then selling our current home (this was our first house).  Comps indicate it's worth $380 to $390k, which would be about $200k in equity.  We will likely be approved for the new mortgage with as little as 10% down.  We have approximately $145k in investments, with another $20k in cash.

I'm struggling with the best way to structure our new mortgage.  Putting 20% ($100k) down would spend down cash below my comfort level.  I don't have a rigorous approach for how I've determined that other than by feel.  Putting 10% down makes me feel like we would be paying too much in PMI.  Our mortgage broker has indicated we can look for a mortgage with a recast option, which would allow us to use proceeds from our house sale to hopefully buy down our mortgage to eliminate PMI.  However, I also know not all mortgage companies allow this, so this is limited from a market standpoint.

My gut tells me a 15% downpayment is probably the best option, but looking for other advice.  Has anyone heard that lendors will offer a slightly better interest rate for a 15-19% downpayment loan, knowing there is PMI involved (which somewhat benefits the lendor)?

Stocks get expensive when, relative to bonds, they are outside some return threshold. Seems to be around 1% or at most 2%, which is the difference between AAA-rated bonds and T-bill values.


I am almost certain that if you extend this back 100 years, you'll see the same concept: 

Stocks are expensive when they pass below a certain threshold here, say 1%, and cheap when they pass above 2% difference between stocks and bonds. 

As we look to 2021, earnings for many companies that had low covid earnings will rebound, while those that were beneficiaries may either benefit long term (in many tech cases) or compress to normal. 

I expect earnings to grow overall, giving more room to stocks to run, while interest rates stay low. SPY at $410-420 in the next 6 months or so seems fairly reasonable barring anything totally out of left field.",finance

Age: 52 y/o

* Income: $134,386 per year

* Student loan debt: $178,429 at 8.25% interest. This loan is a FFEL loan.

* Minimum monthly payment: $1440

* Maximum monthly payment she thinks she could make by following a budget: $3000

* Roth IRA: $60,124

    * (This money came straight out of her paycheck and went into a core position. She never selected specific investments, so it's just sitting in a money market fund. $59,840 of it is her contributions.)

* Rollover IRA (traditional): $29,178

    * (This money is also sitting in the core position/money market fund.)

* Expected income raise per year: 2%

**The following options I can think of are below:**
1.	Just pay off her current loan.  
2.	Refinance for a lower interest rate, then pay off the loan.  
3.	Put her Roth IRA contributions toward her loan, then pay off the remainder. (From my understanding, theres should not be any fees to withdrawal contributions).  
4.	Refinance for a lower interest rate, then put her Roth IRA contributions toward her loan, then pay off the remainder.  
5.	Consolidate her FFEL loan into a direct loan so that she qualifies for PSLF after 10 years of working at her current non-profit position.

Considerations:

* Her loan is an FFEL loan which does not apply toward PSLF, she will have to consolidate it into a direct loan. I’m assuming ’his will not be an issue.
* I’m asssuming’she will qualify for a REPAYE Plan.
* She would be out of debt faster if she chose a non-PLSF route.
* I didn’t include f’rther IRA contributions in any of the calculations beyond what she already has in her Roth IRA. I don’t know if t’is would effect things. I began to calculate this and got lost in the numbers.


Questions:

* Is it incredibly clear that PLSF is the way to go? Is it possible that PLSF will go away within the next 10 years, making her shit out of luck if she chose that path?
* Would it be worth it for her to consolidate her FFEL loan into a direct loan even if she weren’t to go the’PSLF route? I wonder if FFEL loans would qualify for forgiveness/stimulus packages, it’s unclear i’ they are treated as federal loans. I’m assuming not since her student loans are not paused as part of the COVID relief. 
* Are my calculations correct? Am I missing something? Is there really any reason to consider option #2 over PLSF?

personalfinance,Need guidance on refinancing unsecured debt,"Can anyone give some guidance on the best unsecured personal loans out there right now?

I got myself into some credit card debt for unavoidable reasons that I’d rather not get into. The amount ended up affecting my score pretty good for a while.

Ended up consolidating it all into a fairly high interest unsecured loan through FreedomPlus. It 26.5%, it is breathtakingly awful. It is a 4 year loan for 40k.

I took that out three months ago and in that time my credit score has jumped from between 100-150 points depending on where you look. It is about 730-770 right now. Outside of this major lapse my credit history is very good. I have an 11 year old mortgage I’ve never been late on and until recently paid extra on. I have multiple cars and student loans paid off, my credit usage is like 10% now. Just a little bit lying around at 0%. My credit looks good now as a result of this loan...but the payment is so damn oppressive.

Now that my score has jumped so much can anyone offer me some suggestions on the best way to refinance this debt. With my score improving some of my credit cards are offering me 0% again, my largest line is 32k so I could move most that way if I have no other choice...but that will tank my score again and then I’ll have to pray a new offer from another card becomes available a year from now and I don’t know  if I wanna roll those dice....but if I have too it feels like the right move. This current interest rate is crazy.

I also have 31k in a CMA...I was thinking of getting a loan through my brokerage secured against that portfolio. Seems like I should get a low rate but I probably won’t be able to take out more than like 18k or so from the terms I’ve read so it doesn’t get me the whole way there...but maybe a good idea? Anyone have experience with these types of loans? Guess I wouldn’t be able to write covered calls anymore probably if I did this...

Anyway, any and all suggestions are welcome. Appreciate all responses very much.",finance

personalfinance,Question about discretionary income with U.S. federal student loan repayment programs,"Hello all,

I have looked through the wiki, and done a ton of googling, and have not been able to find the answer to this question. Thanks in advance to anyone who knows the answer.

I am graduating grad school soon and looking at options.

I understand that under REPAYE and PAYE plans, discretionary income is calculated by taking your salary, subtracting 1.5x the federal poverty level in your area, and dividing that by 10 (or 10%). Then, divide by 12 to get your monthly payment.

My question is -- do you then adjust for your tax rate?

Example: to make the math easy, say you make $139k per year. Subtract $19k to adjust for 1.5x the poverty level. That leaves you with $120k, divide by 10 equals $12k, divide by 12 gives you a monthly payment of $1000.

In this scenario, will your monthly payment be $1000, or will it be the post tax amount of approximately $700 (depending on your tax rate of course)?

personalfinance,The Importance of Checking Numbers Yourself (Especially with Big Purchases),"I'm writing this after getting sent a video on mortgages from a friend that I later noticed some discrepancies in, and having a discussion with my cousin about some issues/lack of knowledge he encountered with a banker when figuring out the mortgage plan for his house. As the title states, it's a lesson on checking numbers yourself, to the best of your abilities, especially when the numbers are large, and the decision(s) carry significant positive/negative consequences for your financial future. I will be focusing on the numbers from the video for the rest of the post. This is not meant to say anything about the video creator, it is simply an example of why you should do your own research and number crunching when possible, and to not rely solely on others to do your financial math for you.

VIDEO:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ3xhjqk52A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ3xhjqk52A)

TL/DW: A video advocating for a 30 year mortgage over a 15 year mortgage, when paired with investing. He cites many reasons, including tax deductions, real-estate investor benefits, more flexibility with payments, etc. However, the bulk of the video (3:43 - 11:20) is spent giving a real world example showing how the 30 year loan allows you to end up with $200k more than the 15 year loan, after 30 years has passed.

SUMMARY OF EXAMPLE:

Loan amount: $300k

30 year interest rate: 5%

15 year interest rate: 4.375%

Annual market return: 7%

15 year investment strategy: pay loan for 15 years, for next 15 years invest monthlythe amount you were paying for the loan

30 year investment strategy: invest monthly the difference between the 15 year monthly cost andthe 30 year monthly cost for 30 years

RESULTS IN VIDEO OF EXAMPLE:

30 year mortgage investment portfolio: $941k

15 year mortgage investment portfolio: $732k

&amp;#x200B;

The first issue found comes early in the video, when laying out the numbers for the example. When talking initially about monthly costs (3:55), 5% interest is used for the 15 year loan, instead of the mentioned 4.375%. This lead to a $2,372.38 monthly cost being cited rather than the $2,275.86 it would cost, as shown in the table below.

[https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/](https://www.mortgagecalculator.org/)  (website he used)

||*15 Year (4.375%)*|*15 Year (5%)*|*30 Year (5%)*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Total Interest**|$109,654.98|$127,028.56|$279,767.35|
|**Monthly**|$2,275.86|$2,372.38|$1,610.46|
|**Difference (30 - 15)**|$665.40|$761.92|N/A|

Assuming this error propagated through the rest of the calculations, I made a table for the investment portfolios with the 15 year mortgage at both 4.375% and 5%, shown below.

[https://financialmentor.com/calculator/compound-interest-calculator](https://financialmentor.com/calculator/compound-interest-calculator) (website he used)

||*15 Year (4.375%)*|*15 Year (5%)*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**15 Year Investment Total**|$732,053.56|$763,100.20|
|**30 Year Investment Total**|$821,904.74|$941,126.62|
|**Difference (30 - 15)**|$89,851.18|$178,026.42|

The numbers cited in the video for the 15-year-mortgage portfolio were with the 15 year at 4.375% interest (10:18, $2,275 invested per month), and the 30-year-mortgage portfolio used the 15 year at 5% interest (10:56, $762 invested per month). Looking at the table, that would take the final figure from $200k to $178k if the initial mistake of 5% interest for the 15 year mortgage was carried throughout. And the actual numbers take the scenario from the quoted $200k down to $90k.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: as pointed out by u/vettewiz, this section is invalid. The cost of the loan is already factored in when finding the amount contributed to the portfolio, so I was double subtracting because the original way I was thinking about it in my head was incorrect. Just goes to show that you can't even trust the people telling you not to trust people :)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~~Beyond this, the actual cost of the loan was never subtracted from this portfolio number. Doing that, and taking into account inflation during loan repayment as mentioned in the video(the 30 year loan benefits from a fair amount of interest still being paid at the end of the loan, when interest has had time to chop off some of the cost), I arrived at the below table.~~

[~~https://ostermiller.org/calc/mortgage.html~~](https://ostermiller.org/calc/mortgage.html) ~~(2% inflation)~~

||*~~Total Paid (No Inflation, in Today Dollars)~~*|*~~Total Paid (Inflation, in Today Dollars)~~*|*~~Portfolio - Total Paid (Net Money, Inflation)~~*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**~~15 Year (4.375%)~~**|~~$409,654.99~~|~~$353,579.90~~|~~$378,473.66~~|
|**~~30 Year (5%)~~**|~~$579,769.20~~|~~$435,513.84~~|~~$386,390.90~~|
|**~~Difference (30 - 15)~~**|~~$170,114.21~~|~~$81,933.94~~|~~$7,917.24~~|

~~After these calculations, it turns out that with the given scenario, you end up $7.9k ahead by choosing the 30 year loan over the 15 year, compared to the $200k figure quoted in the video. Many of the other reasons for a 30 year loan laid out in the video have their merit, and with every situation being different some of those reasons may play a bigger role in deciding the duration of the loan than just net monetary outcome. They are important to be aware of and should be considered, but are not the point of this analysis.~~

This post is not meant to be advice on a mortgage, either, nor should my numbers be used to justify a decision for your situation. I did not account for tax deductions, ~~inflation on investments~~ (inflation is already subtracted in order to get 7% returns), I'm sure I missed other things in order to stay true to the scenario given, and only focused on one scenario. Running the numbers for other 15 &amp; 30 year interest rate combinations with everything previous being equal, the lower the interest rates are, and the closer they are, the better the 30 year loan becomes when using the above method. ~~With a 15 year 2% mortgage, and a 30 year 3% mortgage, the 30 year ends with $159k more than the 15. With a 15 year 4% mortgage, and a 30 year 5% mortgage, the 30 year ends with $53k less than the 15.~~

TL/DR:

The quoted figure in the video of $200k extra from a 30 year mortgage compared to a 15 year mortgage turned out to be ~~$8k~~ $90k for the scenario described. When making a big financial decision, try to run the numbers yourself with the tools available to you, to make sure you're getting the full picture, and can make the best decision for your situation. Even if you can't fully replicate or formulate what you need, looking deeper will help you understand more of your financial decisions, help you make better ones, and put you more in control of your financial life.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance now or not?,"Hi,

Wife owns a 1 bedroom apartment condo in the DMV area, located just 2 minutes walking from the metro station, in Arlington, VA. She got a 30-year mortgage four years ago (330k approx) with an interest rate higher than 4%, and she is thinking of refinancing because she can probably get even less than a 3% rate right now. Her credit score is high, in the 800, and stable job over 100k.

The point is that we'll have to move to a bigger house for sure maybe in 2 years from now, but she is thinking of keeping the apartment because it is easy to rent it in this area.

Do you think she should try to refinance? Would it be worth it? What happens if she finally decides to sell the house because the apartment is getting more valuable, which is the actual case?

Forex,"EURUSD - To Rise, or Not To Rise, That is the Question... (EURUSD Top-Down Analysis)","EURUSD is definitely at a very interesting and extremely critical point right now that many may not realize and for that reason I wanted to make a dedicated post showing off why EURUSD may make a turn in the markets so let's go full top down analysis into this thing.

&amp;#x200B;

[Monthly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ystag25fah061.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a52c63a23c195211032be1e320f216ea1cc8c12b)

Looking at the monthly chart you can see that EURUSD has been following this uptrend line for almost the past 20 years and we still seem to be respecting since we took a bounce from it this May. This means that we could continue to see a EURUSD bull run for a long long long time.

&amp;#x200B;

[Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/jy6vfi44ch061.png?width=1299&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d68fb441d0fdef5aaafa6c805c0671432987e897)

EURUSD has been following that weekly channel for the past 12 years and we're currently at the top of the channel. The issue right now is that we took a bounce from the blue trend line which may have taken precedence over this channel so there's a chance that this channel could break to the upside but we'll have to wait a couple months to be sure about it. However, if price wants to respect the channel we could see some bearish action until we maybe hit that blue trend line again.

&amp;#x200B;

[Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/x2gy8xyzfh061.png?width=1299&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16f7ae12e3036579162b8533b1f64c8d4b3877ae)

Looking at the daily chart we can see that we're currently sitting at a trendline that we've been respecting since the beginning of 2018. It looks like price really wants to reject it but price is unable to give a solid push off of it.

&amp;#x200B;

[4 Hour Chart](https://preview.redd.it/97lkkmknlh061.png?width=1285&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7baba338393e0c753f08a92366f87c7a60a232d1)

Looking at the 4 Hour chart you can see that we're still in a channel that's pushing up but the question is will it give out or will it push past that trend line and continue to go up.

&amp;#x200B;

[1 Hour Chart](https://preview.redd.it/iq4j0k69mh061.png?width=1285&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc7196e006cf2be6c1eac03b21643507fc245e6d)

Looking at the short term chart it looks like we're also channeling upwards here as well so we could really continue to see EURUSD go up. We probably don't have enough time to make another yearly high but I can see us definitely breaking this year's high in 2021.

Although there's a lot of evidence to short the USD on the higher timeframes I'm quite wary of it due to the way the short term time frames are viewing it. Earlier this week I was ready to take a bearish stance on EURUSD but after looking at EURUSD's inability to make a push I think sticking to a bullish stance would be the play at this point in time.

With the way things are looking from a technical standpoint it looks like the Dollar could be primed to gain some strength throughout 2021 especially by looking at the weekly chart however that doesn't really seem like something that will happen especially with a vaccine being not too far from the horizon. With the arrival of the vaccine it would be viewed as our ticket out from the COVID crisis. That should allow us to seriously start a rapid recovery on the economy which should provide the markets to take a risk-on sentiment and we could see the safe haven USD continue to edge far lower. With the Feds signaling to have low interest rates for the next couple of years combined with strong global GDP growth it's looking like we're going to see a lift in the currencies of commodity exporters, emerging markets, and the economies most geared to global trade. This indicates that AUD and CAD might have an amazing year next year with the way things are currently looking. With all the optimistic views for 2021 it's hard to believe that we could see a strong dollar hence why it may not be a smart idea to take a bearish stance on EURUSD despite everybody and their mom wanting to short it right now. With that said I'm going to continue to have a bullish bias on AUD, NZD, and CAD as we progress throughout 2021.",finance

personalfinance,Question about federal student loans (subsidized loans),[deleted],finance
personalfinance,"Embarrassed, in over my head- failing my family","Hi everyone, first let me say thank you for your time and potential advice. 

This year I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and cancer. I haven't been able to work all year and so a lot of expenses have been put on credit (co-pays, medical bills, utility bills, groceries, etc) and I'm having to contend with that now. I have four kids, and buying presents this year is out of the question, unfortunately, but I have wonderful children that understand.

So! This is what I'm looking at-

Credit card #1 2350 ($70/month payment plan until Feb)

Credit card #2 2150 $75/mo

Credit card #3 2050 (no payments until Feb) $75/mo

Credit card #4 1100 $35/mo

Credit card #5 1050 $40/mo

Credit card #6 670 $30/mo

Credit card #7 610 $30/mo

Credit card #8 520 $25/mo

Credit card #9 400 $25/mo

Credit card #10 300 $25/mo

Credit card #11 250 $25/mo

Credit card #12 160 $25/mo

Credit card #13 65 (will pay off this month)

Outstanding medical Debt- $720 $50/mo

Outstanding medical debt in collections $2150 (no payments arranged)


General monthly payments:

Student Debt- $13K/$0 month (no payments due this year)

Car- $13K owed/$360 month ***EDIT: trying to see about getting this refinanced (currently have 39 months remaining and trying to push that out to 60, no word on if it worked yet***

Home- $170K owed/ $1100 a month (including taxes and insurance) ***EDIT: Going to call and see about getting MPI removed***

Car insurance- $260 a month ***EDIT: I just checked a few other companies and we can get it down to $130/mo***

Groceries- paid through the end of the year, normally $400 a month

Pet food/care- $80/month

Internet- $70/month

HOA- $410/month

Health care- $800/month (including dental/vision/FSA- and we don't qualify for state insurance because they count gross income and it's too much in our state) ***EDIT: Got this lowered to $700***

Subscriptions/IRS payment plan- $75/month ***EDIT: Checked IRS website, I made my final payment last month, and I cancelled most of my subscriptions so this will be $6 going forward***

Laundry/household- $100/month (no washer at home) ***EDIT: talked to kids and we are going to go through our massive amount of clothes and see what we can get rid of, hoping to lower this to $50/mo***

Electric bill- $250/month

Phone bill- $200/month

Storage- $45/month ***EDIT: going to go through storage this weekend and empty it, so this will be $0 after December***

Transportation (only gas, not including maintenance)- $200/month


We were doing fine when I was working, however with my diagnosis and so much having gone on credit this year, I feel like I'm in a hole I can't dig out of and I'm worried every day.


Income: net $3900/month right now and for the foreseeable future (that's after healthcare premiums/FSA payment/taxes/we don't contribute to our 401K anymore)


All credit cards are roughly the same interest rate (23% on average- terrible, I know)


I would be so grateful for any advice. I feel like I'm failing my family.

***EDIT: I will also be getting a tax return of about 3K, if anyone has any advice on how I should use it the most advantageously***",finance
CryptoCurrency,Markets are easy (later),"No one understands the market they were in until afterwards. 

I could list here 100 reasons why the crypto market is going to moon. And I really could. Paypal is buying 70% of bitcoin mined already, with unexpected early release and not including venmo. Bitcoin is being moved off exchanges at greater rates. Various cryptos are finding their use cases (huzzah civic, fantastic idea). The global macroeconomic forecast is darkening. Investors seek safe haven. Safe haven with returns. 

As the stock market stalls (currently based totally on the hopes of a dozen or so companies) and monetary policy makes a muck of things worldwide, crypto will be seen by every eye with a cellphone as the one thing that keeps going up.

If only because of the Bitcoin supply shortage mixed with increasing institutional interest raising the tide.

With bitcoin will come more risky investments. I'm up 12.5% on XRP today. Took half the original investment. Expect to take the next half within a few weeks. And still hold a significant amount. I think XRP/ripple are carving a space for themselves so I see a profitable future. See moneygram stock prices.

&amp;#x200B;

But no matter how you are looking at the cryptospace, you should see no way forward but with massive growth. What is the competitor? There are no other new markets to speak of. How long will investors endure negative rates before catching on? Institutions are just grabbing on. And hard. How much does Grayscale alone have now? Retail to an unprecedented degree is to follow as they leave a declining stock market.

personalfinance,How do I handle paying off a 20k high interest loan while also needing to save for my first car?,"A little backstory into my current financial outlook. Going into college, I was all bought into the ""experience"" and while I definitely enjoyed it, I knew we couldn't really afford it. My mother convinced me that the finances will all work itself out, and that everyone always leaves college with some debt. But once I realized that her solution was to take out a 20k parent plus loan (7% interest rate!), on top of the 5k in Stafford loans, I knew that this wasn't very smart. Luckily this year, with dorms being closed, we will be able to pay everything off after only taking out the 5k Stafford loan, although we haven't been able to start chipping off the debt of my first year.

Now I was super lucky to score a teaching/research assistant position at my university that's been paying me $500 bi-weekly and I've been saving it all up for a car so I can become a commuter student. I've saved up $5500 so far and I'll be holding the position through next semester as well, so I think it'll come out to around $12,000 after the spring semester. I'm not sure if I'll get to keep the position my junior year since the contract is only for a year as of now.

We will be remote again next semester so I won't need to have a car just yet, but if I want to commute, then I'll need to have something by next fall. My question is, how should I handle the money until then? Should I keep saving it in my bank until I know what car I'm getting and then put the rest towards the debt at once(while also letting the debt pile up more)? Or should I start putting money towards the debt but risk putting too much in and not having as much as I might need for the car and expenses? Also, what cars should I be looking at for a daily 30 minute commute?

I feel like my family has never really been too responsible with money, so I'm trying to buck the trend and any advice would really help, thanks!

gaming,*Every 3 weeks* Call of Duty planning a nerf to your favorite guns later this week.,"Also there will be buffs to a couple of weapons we noticed no one’s buying skins for (available for purchase with your cod points check them out immediately).

idk but at some point the same way the fans bullied Call of Duty into going back to boots on the ground I think it needs to become a big deal that the devs are either purposely releasing broken guns or releasing unfinished (unbalanced) Cod games. There was a time when you devs couldn’t just go in and change the entire way a gun does dmg, recoils, range drop off, or ect. Guns that the whole community already put hours of grinding and mastering into. It was one thing when say the Model-1887 in MW2 could snipe from the other end of a hallway or just Cods never ending battle of balancing shotguns with reality and hyper reality in general. 

Just make you wonder if it’s intentionally to add a big draw during buffs (/new op added weapons) that will be nerfed in a couple months or if it’s not intentional and the devs are really releasing unbalanced games for us to test for them now. Idk, but if so it kind of makes sense that before the power of monthly and sometimes bi weekly updates we got games that have legendary status like Bo2. It’s not just Cod either, cause let’s be honest there’s fighting games now too that you put the game down for a month and come back and there’s nerfs and buffs across the board. 

Just think there needs to be an official stance on this exact thing. Should nerfs and buffs be reserved for only the most desperate of broken situations or should it be an on-going thing that always changes the skill gap and forces you to re grind and re learn. Feel like it was better when you knew exactly what to expect when you went back and picked a certain character or when you went to use that certain gun again imo",technology

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 23rd, 2020.

# **Stocks may continue to struggle Thanksgiving week amid Covid-19 outbreaks  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/stocks-may-continue-to-struggle-thanksgiving-week-amid-covid-19-outbreaks.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could continue to struggle with the twin themes of the spreading virus and a potentially robust recovery, once a vaccine is deployed next year.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, the restrictions the spreading virus is imposing on the economy will be clear, when many Americans choose to stay at home over the Thanksgiving Day holiday and partake in much smaller celebrations.
*****
&gt; “On the Covid side, there will be more lockdowns, but I think the message is loud and clear. ‘People: Don’t be cavalier around Thanksgiving,’” said Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat. Thanksgiving traditionally kicks off the holiday shopping season, an important time of the year for the economy which could be hobbled by Covid. The U.S. reported 182,000 new cases Thursday.
*****
&gt; Lee said the market will continue to feel the push pull of the drag from the pandemic against the promise of recovery, seen in the rebound of cyclical stocks. Cyclical sectors industrials and materials were both up about 1% for the week, and financials were up a half percent. But tech and communications, both big tech and growth sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home trade, were lower.
*****
&gt; “I think stocks are kind of consolidating and maybe it’s going to go on for a couple of days,” Lee said. He added that stocks could start to perk up late in the week, and investors are expecting stocks to head higher into year end. “The cyclicals have held up like champs, and the small caps, and value have been really holding up,” Lee said.
*****
&gt; Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 slightly lower, and the Nasdaq up 0.2%. The Russell 2000 was the star performer, with a gain of 2.4% for the week. The Russell is up 16% since the beginning of October.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P shot up sharply on Nov. 9 when Pfizer announced its vaccine as 95% effective, but it never regained that intraday high of 3,645 and has since traded in a sideways pattern. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,557 Friday, down 0.8% for the week.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan economists warned Friday that the “winter will be grim” and they forecast that the restrictions due to the virus will drag on the economy, resulting in a negative first quarter. They expect a strong rebound in the second and third quarter, once the vaccine is distributed and an anticipated fiscal stimulus program takes hold.
*****
&gt; “It’s hard for some investors to look over that period and see the recovery. I think this is where we are now,” said Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO. She said the concern is how much damage the restrictions will do as the virus spreads at a record rate. “This is happening and with exponential force right now. It’s just shocking to see the numbers and how state and local authorities are trying to deal with it in a variety of ways.”
*****
&gt; But Nixon said she’s very positive on the market longer term, and the economy will heal once the vaccine becomes available. She said fiscal stimulus from Washington would help.
*****
&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled he would again discuss a package with Democrats, and that funds that were being used for Fed programs could be diverted to a fiscal package.
*****
&gt; The Treasury Thursday indicated it would not continue five of the Fed’s emergency program from when they expire at year end, surprising some in the markets. The Fed objected, but the markets took the development in stride, as traders expect the programs to be reinstated if financial conditions warrant it.
*****
&gt; The Fed releases the minutes of its last meeting Wednesday afternoon, and that could be important as traders are watching to see if the central bank reveals any detail of discussions on potential changes to its asset buying program. There is widespread speculation the Fed could tweak its $80 billion Treasury buying program at the December meeting to include more longer duration notes and bonds, a move that should hold down already low long-term rates.
*****
&gt; Also in the week ahead, there is some key data including personal income and spending and durable goods on Wednesday. Consumer confidence is Tuesday and consumer sentiment is released Wednesday. There are also a few Fed speakers, who will be watched closely for any comments on the expiring programs.
*****
&gt; Any word on fiscal stimulus talks will get market attention, though there is skepticism anything will before next year. If a package is not passed, the unemployment benefits going to 12 million Americans will end at the end of December, and mortgage forbearance will end. Bank of America economists said if there is no stimulus package to prevent these things, there would be a 1.5 percentage point drag on first quarter growth.
*****
&gt; “The biggest thing we need to do is prevent bankruptcies and prevent unemployment from rising,” Nixon said. She said the labor market has stalled, and it is important to avoid the deep scarring from bankruptcies.
*****
&gt; She said it is not too late for investors to get in on the rotation into growth,and some investors are worried they didn’t get in on time. “Value has so much to go to catch up on growth,” she said.

&gt; # The Thanksgiving Trade

&gt; Trading around Thanksgiving has a bullish tendency perhaps buoyed by the “holiday spirit.” First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964.

&gt; Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 33 years since 1987, there have been 9 declines and 24 advances. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness on Monday or Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and selling into any subsequent rally by the end of Thanksgiving week. But as COVID-19 cases are on the rise again remain nimble as exogenous events like Greece’s debt crisis in 2011 or 2018’s fourth quarter rout can cancel Thanksgiving on Wall Street.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/b5ce4af9292059c4d14b95baeef02b2c/d8ddf7af01919e17-07/s1280x1920/c4a8ff5b8e431b28dd3e24654e98204861afd94d.jpg))**

&gt; Also of note is the change in the yearend rally. Prior to 1987, from the close of trading on the Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend, the S&amp;P 500 rallied only 20 times in 35 years. As Thanksgiving bullishness lost steam in 1987, the rally afterwards occurred more frequently. Since 1987, S&amp;P 500 has logged gains in 25 of 33 years from the close on Friday after Thanksgiving to yearend.

&gt; # 5 Noteworthy Charts To Watch As Stocks Soar

&gt; First, the big economic data point this week was retail sales. Although the headline number was a little light at 0.3% versus an expected 0.5% gain month-over-month, it still hit another new all-time high along the way (source: US Census Bureau). “The miss could be a sign the consumer is finally starting to slow amid record COVID-19 cases and more restrictions, with restaurant sales dipping for the first time since April,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; The good news is retail sales has hit a new high for five consecutive months, and the economy has never been in a recession after three consecutive new highs—yet another sign the recession may be over, even if it hasn’t been called officially.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; How strong has the recent rally been? Well, as of Tuesday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 Index was on pace to have its second-best month of November ever. November isn’t over yet of course, but this could open the door to a potential late-month snap back lower after a huge move, which would be perfectly normal and healthy.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; After Monday’s record close, the S&amp;P 500 now has 24 new all-time high closes in 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The surge after the election was historic in many ways. The number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently making new monthly highs caught our attention. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, previous surges in new monthly highs opened the door for near-term weakness, but the weakness was a nice buying opportunity. In fact, a year after previous major breadth thrusts saw stocks higher every single time, not something we want to ignore.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.18.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Last, more than 85% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 recently were above their 200-day moving average—another sign of impressive participation in this recent market strength. Once again, future results would suggest this extreme strength is a sign of potential future strong performance and weakness could be used as a buying opportunity.

&gt; # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Slow

&gt; The October Retail Sales report missed expectations this morning on both a headline and core basis. In addition to the weaker than expected reading for October, September's report was also revised lower.

&gt; Breadth in this month’s report was also negative for the first time since April. Of the thirteen sectors tracked in the report, just five showed growth while eight declined. On the positive side, Non-Store retail was the main bright spot with m/m growth of 3.11%. That’s the last thing every traditional retailer wants to hear and could be indicative of another wave of retrenchment on the part of consumers as the weather gets colder and case counts rise. Electronics and Appliances also reported strong sales growth likely aided by the launch of the iPhone 12. On the downside, Clothing and Sporting Goods both saw m/m declines of over 4%, while sales at General Merchandise retailers dropped 1.1%.

&gt; While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

&gt; # Finally A New High for Small Caps

&gt; It only took over two years, but the Russell 2000 finally put in a new all-time high on Friday. As shown in the charts below, Friday marked the first all-time high on a closing basis since August 31st, 2018; a total of 553 trading days between highs. As shown in the second chart below, since the index began trading in the late 80's, that makes for the third-longest stretch without a new high. The only two longer periods were from March 10th, 2000 through April 2nd, 2004 and from July 16, 2007 through April 26th, 2011. Both of those streaks were nearly twice as long as the past two years' streak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-R2000.png))**

&gt; The Russell 2000 is up another 2% to more fresh highs this morning, but the recent move to new highs has left the index very overbought. As shown in the snapshot of our Trend Analyzer below, at Friday's close small caps like the Russell 2000 (IWM) and Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) are two of the most overbought major index ETFs after having seen some of the strongest performance over the past five days. Granted, as other large-cap indices like the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) were quicker to return to all-time highs earlier this year making them some of the stronger performers on the year, small caps have been laggards on a year to date basis. In other words, this year's weakest performers have been a factor in recent strength. Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

&gt; # A Month for the Ages

&gt; Just when you think you've seen it all from this market, a month like November comes around. Stock returns so far this month have been extraordinary, and what makes the gains even more impressive is the fact that they came not from a starting point of a depressed bear-market environment but instead from a level that was already pretty close to record highs. Within the Russell 3000, which encompasses stocks with market caps of all sizes, the average MTD performance of stocks in the index is a gain of over 15%. Even in the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the average stock in the index has rallied more than 13.5% so far this month! Keep in mind too that these are just averages, and plenty of individual stocks are up multiples of that.

&gt; In the Russell 3000, there are 51 stocks that are up over 50% so far in November. We don't have enough room to list them all, but the first table below shows the twenty top performers. Topping the list is Five Prime Therapeutics (FPRX), which has rallied more than 349% this month! That's years worth of returns in sixteen days. Behind FPRX, there are two other stocks - Cooper Standard (CPS) and Revlon (REV) - which have both more than doubled. Many of the names listed below are unknown small caps, but a handful of names like Transocean (RIG), Coty (COTY), and Lyft (LYFT) are very well known.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-RAY-MTD.png))**

&gt; In the large-cap S&amp;P 500, the gains haven't been as gaudy but are still impressive. As shown in the table below, the twenty top-performing stocks in the index are all up over 30% MTD. One sector well represented on this list is Energy with eight of the twenty names listed coming from that sector.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111620-Best-SP-MTD1.png))**

&gt; While just about every stock in the S&amp;P 500 is up this month, 18 stocks have managed to trade lower. Of these 18 stocks, only two - Hanesbrands (HBI) and NortonLifeLock (NLOK) - are down more than 5%. What's really interesting about this list, however, is that while Energy dominates the list of S&amp;P 500 winners, no sector dominates the list of losers as it's a diverse set of stocks spanning ten of the eleven GICS sectors. The only sector not represented is Industrials.

&gt; # Long Term Averages Taken Out

&gt; With equities having another strong day yesterday, a large number of stocks closed above their 200-DMAs. For the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, nearly 90% of the index closed above their long term moving averages. That was the highest percentage for the broad index since July 3rd, 2014. As equities pullback today, that reading is lower at 86.56% as of this writing which is still in the 90th percentile of readings since 1990.

&gt; As shown in the charts below, the same applies on a sector by sector basis as well. Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Financials, Industrials, and Materials all currently boast readings above 90%. For Consumer Discretionary, there have been a few similarly high readings since the start of the month, and these have all been the highest on record since at least 1990. For other sectors, recent readings have similarly been at multi-year highs. Levels for Communication Services, Health Care, and Materials, are all their highest since September or late August, but for others, it has been much longer since we saw similar readings. For example, the last time Industrials saw as high of a percentage of stocks above their 200-DMA was way back in May of 2013, and for Consumer Staples, the last higher reading was in October of 2013. The sector that has the weakest number of stocks above their 200-DMAs is unsurprisingly Energy. Whereas yesterday exactly half of the stocks in the Energy sector finished above their 200-DMA, today less than a third remain above that level. Granted, that is far better than the end of October when not even 5% were above.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/111720-200-Day.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show a list of the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector's components showing how far each is above/below their 200-day moving average as well as the MTD and YTD performance. Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), and Marathon (MPC) are all the most elevated, currently above their 200-DMAs by double-digit percentages. TechnipFMC (FTI) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV) have been the top performers in the sector, but they both still sit a few percentage points below their 50-DMAs even after rallies of more than 40% this month. The only Energy sector stock to have fallen in what has been a remarkably strong month is Cabot Oil and Gas (COG), though it is one of the best performers YTD with a decline of just 2.4%. Still, its recent decline leaves it as one of the furthest below its 200-DMA.

&gt; # Stocks Flying Around the Globe

&gt; Since bottoming on the last trading day of November, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has had a banner month so far this November rising 10.61% month to date. While there is still nearly two weeks left in the month, SPY is on pace for its best month since April. That is also in the top 1% of monthly moves of the past two decades. Other than April, the only month of the past 20 years that has seen a larger gain was October of 2011.

&gt; Looking across the various country ETFs in our Global Macro Dashboard, there similarly have been some massive moves so far this month. Several of these have risen over 20% and only two, India (INDA) and China (MSHI), have risen by single-digit percentages. Spain (EWP), Italy (EWI), France (EWQ), Mexico (EWW), Norway (ENOR), and the UK (EWU) are all on pace for their best month of the past twenty years. Every other country ETF is also seeing monthly moves in the top decile of their respective 20-year ranges. For some of these, like Singapore (EWS) or Switzerland (EWL), this month has been the best month in over a decade.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.",finance
personalfinance,When should I start comparing lenders and what's the recommenced approach?,"First, I apologize as there are a plethora of threads with the same question, give or take different details.

I'm under contract on new construction and the house won't be ready until March/April of 2021 (Lot has not been cleared yet). For the time being I'm in communication with the builder's preferred lender, but I would like to shop around at some point. Problem is, I have no idea when the ""right"" time is and I'd like to do it efficiently, so my credit score does not become unrecognizable. 

1. When should I start comparing lenders?
2. When should I stop comparing lenders? I read that some lenders will, re-check your credit before or on the day of closing.
3. What's the most efficient or recommended approach?
   1. Does each potential lender have to pull your credit (hard pull) to give you an estimate?

personalfinance,"Deferment Advantage, Inflation?","Hi all,

I just got off the phone with my mortgage company; I called to re-initiate my payments (ending the forbearance through CARES) and to pay off the “delinquent” amount (around $12K). Fortunately, I am in a position to pay that amount off. However, the person I was speaking with briefly explained that deferment is an option (which I was not aware of).

On the surface, this sounds like a no-brainer, which makes me nervous. 

The deferred payment is added as a lump sum (that does not change or accrue interest, I think???) which is required to be paid at the end of the mortgage (end of term or at a sale or refinance). 

Again, I had planned to simply pay off the missed payments and let this all be behind me, but the rather shrewd little part of my brain started thinking this through. If I understand correctly, the $12K that I owe would suddenly be due as a lump sum either 27 years from now (when my loan expires) or when I sell the house. I may stay in this home, and 27 years from now $12K may be a good bit less money than it is now (inflation). In addition, the $12K could either sit in my savings account and accrue interest or be used to pay off a loan with a higher interest rate (car loan).

Am I missing something? Part of my brain wants to just do the simple thing, but part of my brain also recognizes the deferment as an obviously advantageous option (provided I’m not misunderstanding).",finance
personalfinance,Trying to figure out my 2021 strategy.. debt vs investing vs saving,"As we're coming to the end of the year here I'm trying to pre-plan my strategy to get to my financial goals... I've made significant improvements this year in terms of saving/investing/reconciling debt so I feel way more empowered and in a better position than ever before.

I'm 30, making about 160k a year (however my salary is 100k, the 60k is based off of quarterly bonuses so I get larger dumps of cash in each q - what I am actually living on is a lot lower)

I've recently refinanced my private student loan debt and consumer debt and my credit score improved pretty drastically, from 650 to 750 just within a year). Although I still have tons of debt, it feels a lot more manageable and I learned a solid lesson about how to use credit cards responsibly (after living with them all maxed out for 3 years...) -- good lesson to have learned and have behind me. now i usually use my cards for spending but then pay them off in full each month to get points, feels good.

i want to start saving to buy my own apartment (i'm in nyc) but i am still in the stage of accumulating my cash savings to have 6-months worth of expenses. i feel like i'm a bit behind so want to turn it around pretty aggressively. previous years i spent way more than i should on being young, going out to brunch, taking way too many ubers, daily starbucks... also buying furniture, kitchenware, etc -- now i'm way smarter and have everything i need so really don't need to spend much. 

currently:

\~8k in cash, mostly in a ""HY savings account"" but it's 2020 so interest rate is pretty low

\~7k in stock portfolio

\-55k in 401k

\~\~ since i'm about 50/50 cash vs stocks, is that too aggressive?  i have been adding $350 a month to portfolio, plus 2k each quarter, or more if i have extra cash... however i still dont have 6mo of expenses saved so i'm not sure what to prioritize given the current market

here comes the big boiz:

\~12k personal loan (refi'd CC debt from 25% to 11%)

\~30k fedloan (not paying now bc covid)

\~50k private student loan (also refi'd from 12% to 5%)

&amp;#x200B;

i've been prioritizing saving/investing over getting out of this debt - the monthly payment is manageable and i think given my age, i really need to increase my savings in case of an emergency and so i can buy a house/apt eventually - the student loan debt is so high that, in my view, by the time i get out of it, if i am not aggressively saving/investing, i'll be way way behind. but tell me if that thinking is flawed?

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: Should I be allocating more money to savings vs investing, or vice versa? Or has my strategy been pretty decent and I should just continue on this road? Or should I actually start attacking this debt aggressively?",finance
Bitcoin,Taxes on Bitcoin (long-term) aren’t that bad in the US,"I know for US citizens the joke is to say you lost your keys in a boating accident to avoid paying taxes. However, I ran some tax numbers and I don’t think it’s that bad. If you are a married couple AND HAVE NO OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME you can cash out $100,000 per year (2020 rates) without paying any Federal taxes. You may have state taxes, but that’s maybe a reason to move.

This makes Bitcoin a really great retirement income source. And since it’ll probably take 10-20 years to hit $1 million, now is a good time to buy in.

If you are single, I think the annual amount is around $50k. I know $50k and $100k aren’t lambo incomes, but for a pretty good life those amounts aren’t bad (assuming you live in a mid-to-low cost of living location).

If one were to use a “safe withdrawal rate” of 3.33%, a married couple would need $3 million in crypto to be able to live on $100k per year for 30+ years. Of course, this assumes that bitcoin continues to increase in value.

If you pulled out more than $100k per year then you’re only paying 15% (up to almost $500k). I mean, that’s not too bad. It just means you’d need more than $3 million if you wanted to last for a long while.

Maybe my sights are too low, but I’d be pretty happy if I could live on $100k per year for the rest of my life without needing to work. Keep in mind, $100k from a W2 job is not the same since you have to pay taxes, social security, and Medicare. So, obviously, $100k of capital gains would be better than $100k from a W2. Also, I believe some states may not calculate capital gains for health insurance so you may get free health insurance.

I know inflation and new tax laws could change everything in the future, but if things stayed somewhat similar, I probably wouldn’t have to lose my keys in a boating accident when I become crypto-rich! :)

Of course, talk to a tax pro and a financial planner. These are just the ramblings of a crazy person.

Bitcoin,Ark Investment CEO Cathie Wood appeared at the virtual investing in tech seminar put on by Barron's where she discussed the rise of Bitcoin.,"November 20, 2020 04:58 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Cryptocurrency     

Ark Investment CEO Cathie Wood appeared at the virtual investing in tech        seminar put on by [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bitcoin-could-hit-500-000-according-to-ark-invests-catherine-wood-51605906264?mod=hp_LATEST) where        she discussed the rise of [Bitcoin](https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-bitcoin-a-good-investment/).     

**What Happened:** Wood told viewers the 160% year-to-date        increase for the price of Bitcoin could be just the beginning.     

Wood said the decision by the Fed to keep interest rates low, Bitcoin        being a digital alternative to gold and an insurance policy against        inflation as reasons why Bitcoin has increased in price.     

The increase in institutional investors getting involved in Bitcoin is        where Wood sees the price increasing further.     

Wood said it reminds her of the early days of institutions beginning to        make small allocations to real estate and emerging markets. She said the        allocations started at 0.5% and then rose to 5%.     

If institutions allocated mid-single-digit amounts to Bitcoin, it would        take the price to a range of $400,000 to $500,000.     

There will only be a supply of 21 million Bitcoin, with 18.5 million        currently in existence.

**Why It’s Important:** The rise in the price of        Bitcoin would make it the 16th most valuable company by market        capitalization. Bitcoin passed **Mastercard Incorporated**        (NYSE:[MA](http://www.benzinga.com/stock/MA#NYSE))        Friday with a market cap of $335 billion.

The rise in Bitcoin price and demand has also helped the **Grayscale        Bitcoin Trust** (OTC:[GBTC](http://www.benzinga.com/stock/GBTC#OTC))        rise 145% year-to-date.     

Wood is the manager of four of the best performing ETFs in 2020 with the        Ark ETFs.

personalfinance,Should we buy a new house now or in 5 years?,"Long post warning.

TL:DR
We're being given $100k, but we have to use it to buy a new house. We are doing well financially. We have a $200k house, 20-yr fixed 3.5%. Dad wants us to buy a $400k house, 30-yr. Says current rates are 2.5-3 1%. Says with the $100k and $58k equity our mortgage could be $1500, which we can easily do. Does it make sense to buy now with the interest rates so low or should we wait 5 years until I can start working again (currently staying at home with kids)?

Full details:
My husband and I live in a nice, but quaint $200k house in central PA. It's in a small neighborhood near a park. Quiet area, nice neighbors, small yard, split-level, small deck, 3 bedrooms, 2-1/2 bathrooms.  It's nothing fancy, but we feel blessed to have what we do since we have been given so much.

I'm a stay-at-home mom of 3 kids. 1 toddler and twin babies. We have a lot of assistance from both our parents. They gave us their old vehicles so we have no car payments. My in-laws cover our phone bill. We have no student debt since my husband got a full ride, I got a scholarship, and my parents covered the rest. We have index funds and retirement savings and a sizable emergency fund. I was able to save everything I made from waiting tables at a fancy restaurant through college. My parents have money put away for our kids.

The original plan was to make this our home until I can go back to work when the kids are in school. Once I'm making extra money we'd upgrade to a bigger house with some extra perks like a nice deck/patio, fire pit, bigger yard, fireplace, 2-car garage, matching furniture, etc.

We pay $1500/month. $1350 mortgage + $166 property tax. Husband makes $62k/yr. We're able to put about $8k of that away every year because of our lack of bills, debt, and careful budgeting. We have $58k in equity. House is in better shape than when we bought it for $205k 4 years ago. We painted the exterior, the walls, and cabinets, redid the stained flooring in the bathrooms, and patched the water damage in the ceiling and walls.

My parents never really taught me a lot about taxes and did them for me online the past two years. In March, April, May, June, and a little bit of July I made money on Chaturbate and Onlyfans, but I was terrified of my parents finding out and I eventually quit and have some regrets. I only made about $900 on Onlyfans and about $700 on Chaturbate over those months. In August, I filed for PUA to see if I was eligible and filed 5 months of claims at once. I rushed through it and didn’t report any of the online income because I didn’t think it would be federally recognized. A few weeks later I went to check the Chaturbate and Onlyfans help websites to see how they handle taxes, and both send you a 1099 form. I started freaking out that the IRS will notice that I received unemployment during the periods of receiving income and check if I reported it on my claims and then prosecute me for unemployment fraud. I ended up calling the PUA help center and explained that I wanted to report additional income on previous claims and they said I had to talk to a specific department, but that not many calls get through. They tried to transfer me and I couldn’t get through. I had to call PUA again, speak to a different person, explain the situation, and try to get through another time. No luck. I did this several times until giving up and haven’t tried again since. I’m lost, scared, frustrated, and regretful. Please be kind in the comments, I’m sure you all made stupid mistakes when you were young. I just want to know how to get out of this situation and avoid anything ever getting back to my parents about this.

The Reserve Bank uses monetary policy to maintain price stability and to keep inflation between 1 and 3 percent on average over the medium term. The Bank implements monetary policy by setting the Official Cash Rate, which is reviewed eight times a year.

Hints of rising interest rates strengthen the currency.

Price is ranging in the supply zone between 0.6940 and 0.6890 levels. The speech will likely cause a breakout of the range.

Forex,Anticipating an explosive breakout on EURUSD soon - Analysis,"I don't normally trade this pair, but while looking for my trades for the upcoming week, I saw a number of things that excited me, and after doing some drilling in/zooming out, I've become fairly well convinced a significant event is coming up soon. As it's a popular pair, I thought some of you may be interested

EURUSD has generally been relatively quiet since the strong burst of growth it experienced in May and July.

Anyone who has been trying to trade it since the beginning of August, has, in my view, been trading inside the consolidation channel, where the action is chaotic and indecisive

Not to say you can't make money in those conditions, but I think if you zoom out and look at the bigger picture, you may agree that the real opportunity is coming, possibly as early as this week (if not, then likely before Christmas)

This is a longer term trade idea which is based on the 4H, 1D, even the 1W chart. All of these charts are indicating the same thing could happen, and we have a period of confluence now, which if resolved decisively, gives you a fantastic opportunity

However in order to bear fruit to the full, this is a trade you will have to allow to play out, at least for weeks, possibly for several months. I do think that even taking into account swap/overnight fees, it could be worth it. But if you are not patient with trades and tend to start drilling into the 5 minute then panic selling on some short term moves, this one is not for you

So what's the setup?

Let's start on the daily

https://imgur.com/a/t5PxnjT

This is the period of price consolidation which follows the aforementioned explosive rises earlier in the year. Now, before you say my analysis is bad because of how I've drawn the bottom line on that pennant: (1) The bottom line doesn't matter to me because I am only looking for a trend continuation here, I'm not currently interested in shorting it. The only thing the bottom line would be useful for is to indicate*when* the consolidation will finished (2) I believe the lower breakout was caused by the volatility on markets around the US election. I think it was a fakeout and can now be dismissed (3) If you do not agree, fine, move the line down. As I say I'm only presenting a trade on the top line, which appears consistent. 

If this pennant is broken to the upside, the potential is huge. Normally when trading this pattern, you can set a TP around 'the length of the upward leg added to the breakout zone'. In this case you'd be looking at a TP around 1.24. By the way, I am not going to suggest how precisely you trade this, I'll leave your entries and exits up to you. And again, this may take time to play out

Now, if we drill in a bit and look at the 4H, we can see we are in a second consolidation period from what I earlier called the 'election volatility' and the sudden moves that happened around then

https://imgur.com/a/fmAHQdC

The smaller, central pennant is the one to look at on this timeframe. The upper, longer line is what I just showed you on the 1D

What should capture your interest is that we are threating to break both these lines at almost the same time. Any move that breaks both is likely to be decisive and could portend a very strong upward move

For a third piece of confluence, you can see the price rejected 1.189 three times last week. I don't normally pay much attention to resistance, but, it seems to me, the price is attempting to break high out of this channel, and if that line capitulates, as well as the lines on the 4H and the 1D - again, I see very explosive activity coming up

For a fourth piece of confluence, although this is so long term nobody would normally trust/trade it, it's kind of pretty so I'm going to put it in here

The weekly chart

https://imgur.com/a/954MwYQ

It's unbelievable really, but here we seem to have broken a trendline which has been established since the Financial Crisis. I don't know if this line can be trusted, but if you do what the chart says, it's telling you to go long. Interestingly, also points to a TP around 1.24, maybe more like 1.235

My final piece of confluence is based on fundamentals, which I do not trade but nonetheless, I find this compelling:

Since the last period of explosive growth, inflation on the EUR has fallen from 0.9% to -0.2%. Meanwhile, the USD has risen slightly from from 1.0% to 1.2% (and interest rates have remained flat). This hasn't been priced in yet, and from my rudimentary understanding, it should be

So, make up your own minds. Even if you don't want to trade yet, I think if we see the EUR smash some of these key lines, you've got to pay attention. You might want to open some small positions now, you might want to wait for the trend and risk a pullback. You might want to pile in at consolidation levels, should they form. Trading is never easy, so I'll leave all the decisions to you

As I am still learning myself, I'll happily take any feedback on my analysis",finance

Much like the title says, I've been searching this morning only to find conflicting information as to the incentives available for a non-residential application.  The building needs a new roof so the idea is to lock in solar before the end of the year before the federal credit decreases, but I figured I'd post here before reaching out to local installers to get price quotes.

For reference, I used 433 kwh in my first month in the building.  It will be home to my two small businesses, of which only one is currently occupying the building.  Therefore, usage will certainly increase starting next year, especially in the warmer months when the air conditioning is used.  The building is held in a separate LLC and my two businesses ""rent"" from it so the holding company doesn't really produce much by way of profit so I was thinking to purchase the panels in the name of one of my businesses in order to take advantage of the federal tax credit. Our businesses definitely saw a bump in business this year on account of COVID so profit will likely be higher this year than next.

Thank you and I welcome any tips and help you guys have.  I can provide the address if that is helpful.

Just to remind that this is the end of a long-term debt cycle, interest rates should rise up guiding a  healthy deflationary process where the free market leave behind indebted corporate's that couldn't find their place in a democratic demand. 

Instead QE insanity is recapitalizing bank reserves, leading to a new artificial period of credit expansion. This does not represent free market capitalist society where citizens choose which products are needed by purchasing them incentivizing it's production, thriving the business by demand. 

Centralized bail outs seem to be the new reality and looks like the new standard before, during and provably after this COVID crises.

stocks,"10 ways you can MAKE, SAVE and INVEST money ASAP","**If you want to make money right now you should read this as I am going to share with you 10 of the best tips that can make you money starting right and be sure to read everything as I have a bonus tip**

Hey everyone and Welcome, my name is Cristian and today I will share with you 10 of the best tips that can start making you money right now

1. Start saving money and INVEST IT

The most important thing is START SAVING MONEY RIGHT NOW AND INVEST IT, don’t spend it on useless things that don’t add value to you. Either knowledge value, net worth value or future prospect value. This is one of the things that I learned the hard way, as I was spending all my money and never saving and investing it, this has cost me a lot of real money and potential money as I have missed out on a lot of things so be sure and learn from other people’s mistakes

2. Number two has a lot to do with number one TRACK YOUR SPENDING AND IMPROVE IT BY REDUCING EXPENSES

You think you are doing everything you can to start saving money? Well you probably aren’t if you are looking at this post. Start tracking all of your expenses by using your credit or debit card for almost every purchase you do and at the end of every month take your time and look over your statements. Are you satisfied with what you see? Are all your expenses really worth it? Are they adding value for you or future value? Probably not… Are you enjoying 10$ coffees when you can make our own at home for 50 cents? Is that brand name clothing or perfume adding value to you? You can easily get really nice clothes and great smelling perfumes for a lot less when not buying brand names. Another good idea is not to do groceries while you are hungry as you are tempted to buy much more food that you don’t actually need and end up wasting it. Do you really need to pay 5$ to play candy crush? I don’t believe so, you can find tons of games for free but wait a minute, why play games when you should try and do something that adds value to your life? Are you buying lottery tickets? Stop that right now, take that money and invest it. This are just a few examples that can improve your spending habits. Take your time every month and track your expense, cut out the stuff you don’t need and you will start feeling a difference very soon.

3. The number 3 tip is Don’t rush just HAVE PATIENCE. I know, you want Lamborghini money in a week with nothing to start from, Yeah, me too but that is not gonna happen. You must learn to have patience and grow your net worth steadily over time, don’t go on Wall street bets and trade options thinking you’ll get rich by next month, that is a recipe for disaster. You might get lucky 1 in 10 thousand times but there are far better ways of making money. So be patient and take your time.  [SCREENSHOT](https://ibb.co/Q6wyg5h)

Moving up to number 4, INVEST IN STOCKS

Here you can see that if you had invested 30 years ago in 1 share of the SP that money would be worth 10 times that amount right now and even adjusted for inflation you would still be up huge [30 years SP](https://ibb.co/47wkSQq). With the annualized Average Return of investment being more than 6% [AVG RETURNS](https://ibb.co/54NpNZQ). Here you can see that you should not try to time the market as it is really hard to predict what is the best time to buy, you should just get into the stock market, you shouldn’t probably dump all your money in one day. But you should be buying into the stock market every time you get paid would be a great thing to do. As being fully invested in the stock market in the past 30 years has return more than 7% annually, while missing just the 3 best days of the stock market every year could see you end up losing money.  [BEING FULLY INVESTED](https://ibb.co/Jnx6vsF)

Don’t know how the stock market goes? No worries number 5 will help you. INVEST IN ETF’s. What are ETFs? ETFs are exchanged traded funds that you can buy just like stocks. They are very similar to index funds but have lower fees usually and you can find ETFs that track pretty much everything. What are Index funds? Index funds are mutual fonds that are managed by professional money managers and represent a theoretical segment of the stock market with the most important ones being the SP500 that tracks the 500 biggest companies listed on the US stock exchange, the Nasdaq Composite which includes almost all the companies that are listed on the Nasdaq stock market or the Nasdaq 100 which includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies in the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/xhzzqSf) and the [DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE](https://ibb.co/T1jhmr9) that tracks the stock performance of the 30 larges companies listed in the United States. They all have ETFs that track them, [QQQ](https://ibb.co/JkWYL76) tracks the Nasdaq and also has a dividend yield of 0,56%, [SPY](https://ibb.co/T45kYff) tracks the SP500 and has a dividend yield of 1,6% while [DIA](https://ibb.co/Vwt1nGN) tracks the Dow Jones and has a dividend yield just over 2%. but you can also invest in ETFs that track sectors like [SMH](https://ibb.co/m5vZML4) which tracks the semiconductor sector and still has a dividend yield of more than 1% more than almost any bank is giving right now on savings account and also offer growth. Or if you like the airlines and think that they will return to the value they once have there is a ETF for that also under the ticker [JETS](https://ibb.co/bJYnSrL) or if you like banks [XLF](https://ibb.co/WK4BYb0) is a good ETF for those and you can also invest in real estate with tracking a real estate ETF, one for example is [XLRE](https://ibb.co/TWhbMdC) , there are many ETFs that you can choose from not only these one. And as long as you consistently invest money over time, it is almost guaranteed that your money will increase they’re value.

Number 6. Don’t try and reinvent the wheel, it’s really hard to come up with something new in this era, you should just try and emulate and improve what you see other people are doing that make a lot of money. A great example is just creating YouTube videos, there are a lot of people making YouTube videos out there and earning money they couldn’t have imagined. Or you can simply learn great skills that have high paying jobs, like coding or if that is to hard you should try and run Facebook or Google ads for companies or people, start small, get your local business to hire you, a lot of small business don’t know how to get noticed on social media and may pay a lot of money to get more customers

Let’s move to number 7 on the list guys and that is: Don’t buy new things. Guys I now we all want that brand new Lamborghini but let’s face is… THE WORST, ABSOLUTELTY THE WORST MONEY YOU CAN EVENER Spend is on a brand new car. The value of that drops like a rock the second you drive it off the dealers lot. You should only buy used cars, you can get a lot more value for your money with a car that is just a few years old and even might get lucky and don’t lose that much money if you buy curs that don’t depreciate that quickly. Other things you shouldn’t buy new that also demand a huge premium over they’re value is jewelry but be aware you should still get the things appraised by a certified expert before you spend money on jewelry to avoid getting scammed. You can usually find pretty good deals on luxury jewelry at reputable pawn shop or eBay items that offered guarantees. Also one last thing you should never buy are pets… This will do two great things, one you save a lot of money when adopting a pet and two you will do a great thing for a pet that is looking for a nice welcoming home.

[CAR DEPRECIATION](https://ibb.co/6Fd1Mc0) /

Number 8 on my first 10 tips on how you can make money right now is PAY OFF THAT HIGH INTEREST DEBT

So, one thing that can start making you money right now is paying high interest debt, I know I told you earlier to invest your money into the stock market ASAP but guys… that interest rate is killing you believe me. You should try and pay off that debt as fast as you can especially the Credit Card DEBT. Try to never, but never have debt on your credit card, as they have the highest interest rates on any kind of loans with even [EXCELLENT CREDIT](https://ibb.co/Yc5H9Y5) the lowest annual percentage rate is still 15% while it does depend from bank to bank with the Discover credit card having the lowest interest and Capital One having the highest at over 25%. After you pay this debt you should then focus on personal loans which have the second highest interest rate at about 10% followed by student loans and auto loans. The one debt you shouldn’t necessarily try and pay of as fast as you can are long term fixed mortgages with interest rates being at all time low rates you should probably take advantage right now and refinance your old mortgage at a much lower APR. So my opinion is that if you have high interest rate loans like credit cards, and personal loans you should get rid of that ASAP I would pay off that debt with 80% of the money I can save every month and the rest of 20% I would invest in the stock market but in the case of lower interest rates you should take advantage by the leverage mortgages offer you and you should invest more in the stock market as the annual average return is much higher than your interest rate. [AVG LOAN RATES](https://ibb.co/TRZr5vm) / [CREDIT CARD RATES](https://ibb.co/3BCcvP3) / [LONG TERM LOANS RATES](https://ibb.co/Z8JsSdc)

Number 9 on the list is TRY NEW THINGS, if you haven’t already found your niche, you should probably try as many new things as possible until you find the one that works for you. You should find that thing that you really enjoy and can also add a significant amount to your net worth, you shouldn’t waste your time with jobs or businesses that you don’t enjoy or don’t have the potential to add big to your net worth

And finally number 10. Invest in real estate and rent out.

You should go out and find good real estate deals, you should seek out houses that are undervalued in a nice neighbourhood. Don’t seek houses that require a lot of work to restore, because if you don’t know what you should really do you might end up overspending on the house. You should get leverage on the real estate with mortgage rates being so low right now. Also go out and find good renters as this will bring up a good steady cash flow as a passive income, this also gives you great tax advantages and is a hedge against inflation especially now with all this money being pumped in the world there is a risk of inflation in the future. There are a few cons for real estate investing the main one being that they require more work than just owning stocks but this is a great way to diversify your asset allocation. So, I believe that you should do both as your income allows you, you should try and buy more and more real estate and rent it out as this will make you control a lot of money with really small upfront costs but you should also keep investing in the stock market. You should try and find your own balance as this is highly depended from person to person [REAL ESTATE PRO/CONS](https://ibb.co/fxKjGNp) / [STOCKS vs REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/wQtCQZ4)

Hey guys, thank you for sticking this far and as a reward for sticking this far here is a bonus tip for you

As soon as you turn 18 you should try and get a credit card to build up your credit history. But be very careful don’t go and spend all the money on the credit card and don’t pay it off as this will negatively impact your history. You should try and own at least a couple of great credit cards that offer great benefits use them but as soon as you can pay that thing off every month so you can enjoy getting a great credit history that will help you later in life when you apply for bigger loans like mortgages.

I purchased a Honda Civic LX-P while in a desperate situation when I needed a car. Back then, I knew absolutely nothing about finances. Now, I relatively well versed. However, my ignorance of finance was taken advantage when I purhcased the car in July. My car is valued at approx. 13,000. I owe \~19,000 on it. So I'm around 6,000 underwater. Also I am paying an exorbitant interest rate of 7.65%. Is there any good way to get out of this situation? I'm open to trading my car in for one less expensive.",finance

personalfinance,Best 2-3 year investments,"Hi!
I have a fully stocked emergency fund and savings, plus a maxed Roth IRA and a solid monthly contribution. My finances are all in order, no debt.

I am planning on buying a house in 2-3.5 years time, with my current girlfriend, who would become my wife before we buy a home together.

I will have 30-35k in stock sales (after paying long term capital gains), and want to invest it in a relatively ""safe"" investment to have in 2-3 years.
I have an AMEX HYSA, but the interest rates have been garbage, due to covid (.60%).

Besides the HYSA, what are my best options for investment options with lower risk (I'm well aware that only guaranteed rate bonds, CDs, etc. Can truly ""guarantee"" a certain rate).
CDs. Bonds and the usual suspects have terrible rates right now, usually even less than the HYSA.

A conservative bond fund seems similar to what I'm looking for, but is probably a little higher risk than I want.
Looking for something that won't tank in value if the market does another big drop over the next 2-3 years.
I can tolerate a little risk, but I don't want to risk losing more than...let's say 5% of the 30k initial investment.

How can I squeeze my $30k a little bit more than .60% from a HYSA in a 2-3 yr time frame that won't absolutely tank if the market takes a big hit?
I understand risk and reward with investing..looking for something with lower risk, but not zero risk.",finance

I also have my federal loans that’s stopped at $33k with 0% thanks to covid lol 

I have 12k in my savings just sitting there - with no growing interest rate.

personalfinance,"Trading a car to reduce payment, is it wise though?","So I currently have a 2020 Rav4 Hybrid. I'm anywhere from 3 to 5k upside down currently. Its a good car, no problems and truthfully I have no problem making the payment. However, I may be making a career change in the next few months that may reduce my income potentially but need to make the move for resume building to go a bit higher in my industry. So I wouldn't mind reducing my liability. 

So money wise I owe about 35k on the nose. Trade in is about 30k to 32k. My payment is $651. I'm leaning towards buying a used car for around 10k to 15k mark and rolling my negative equity into it. I am fairly good at negotiating so I'm aiming to be closer to the 3k side. Either way I always do my math on worst case so I'd base it on 5k. My plan would be to finance for 60 and pay extra as well as keep some additional in savings for any possible repairs that need to be done since I would be in an older vehicle. So with an average interest rate I'm guessing about $300 to $400 on payment which will leave me an additional $250 to $350 a month depending on what vehicle ends up being right.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans or keep money in investment account,"Hello! 

Basic info here: I have about 25k in student loans across 7 different loans. The average interest rate is about 4%. My dad gifted me 30k once I turned 27 with no strings attached which turned into about 32k since October. I'm incredibly grateful for the money of course, and I wasn't expecting it. 

My loans are a bad mark on my credit report. I messed up early in the loans and was late on 7 months of payment due to not understanding when they kicked in. Other than the loans and a credit card, I don't have any other accounts on my credit report. I want to move out soon, but I'm worried that if I do, I'll just keep paying the minimums and they'll never be gone. 

I could put 5k towards them with money I have in my savings now and keep 12k in the investment account, but is that a good idea? Should I leave the money in the investment account? I'm just second guessing myself because it's a lot of money and I think I'm just really anxious with the state of the world right now. Should I have that much money just in case?",finance

We have the cash to buy the car in full. We were wondering how we should approach this. Should we take out a joint car loan with a higher interest rate and pay it off the new car in one year, two, or three year? We would pay some interest and hopefully there isn’t a early payoff fee.

Would this help improve my credit score?

Or should I just sit tight and save as I won’t have much debt per month. Every month after taxes I make 5200 a month. A bills/rent I’ll save about 3500 a month. Right now I only have one credit card. Should I open another credit card.

stocks,Stock market news recap| Next week expectations | Buy stocks now or time to get out? [11-23],"**What happened last week in the stock market and what to expect next week, is it late to get in the stock market or is there still value? Let’s discuss this and more**

Hey everyone and Welcome , so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indexes drop with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/r63grbk) being down 0,42%, finishing the week up 0,2%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9whHcdZ) down 0,68% and finishing 0,8% down for the week while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/9V3z9jd) lost 3 quarters of a percent as this was also the same percentage that it dropped for the week. The VIX went up 2,5% but finished the week flat as it has for the past couple of weeks after the election. There was about an even split of companies advancing to declining as the volume continues to drop. Though there was a sharp sell-off in the last 30minutes to end the trading week as I believe a lot of people don’t want to hold the money in the stock market over the weekend as cases of the illness rise in the US. [CHART](https://ibb.co/8gb1Csf) / [VIX](https://ibb.co/WsNMvGv)

Here is the heat map from yesterday and the heat map for the whole week and it’s obvious that this was a pretty much mixed week as financials and energy sectors have recovered a little bit of the ground they lost during the last 8 months of recovery while the leaders of the recovery, the big tech struggled a little this week. [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/r7QFV0m) / [WEEK](https://ibb.co/9VWyGGH)

Next week is pretty low on interesting earnings though I think I am going to try and buy some small pieces for companies like Best Buy, GAP and Hormel as I believe they may have some upside potential, I also think Dick’s sporting goods will do good but I think the expectations are a little high for that company and despite meeting the analyst expectations the retail investors might jump off the bandwagon and the stock may suffer. [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/56yWLs9)

Also, important economic data will only come until Wednesday as the stock market and economic data take a break for Thanksgiving. The most important numbers coming are the MARKIT PMI’s, the consumer confidence index and a lot of critical data that comes in on Wednesday as you can see here [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZKHM2cD).

The worst performing sectors on Friday were financials, industrials and surprisingly technology also, while the only real bright spot were communication services. [CHART](https://ibb.co/Df47v43)

Some great news for online retailers came in as the first week of November saw a more than 80% increase in online shopping traffic with 20% less traffic around malls vs last year but an almost 60% increase since March. The rise of e-commerce is still expected to continue big in the next years as analysts expect sales to grow between 25 and 35%. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/YfWJJ4W) / [NEWS](https://ibb.co/KWFF2Dy) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/9wmFS0w)

Moving on, two of the biggest giants in the tech sector and in the whole world, Apple and Microsoft also announced that they will team up to create a controller supported for IOS devices as the gaming industry has seen a huge spike and is expected to have huge growth in the coming years while Microsoft also seems to be targeting Zoom as they are removing the 40minute limit starting on Thanksgiving and are offering free all-day video calling via the TEAMS app. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0mwb9KR)

Just take care and don’t rush into winners just because they are up huge this year, look at companies that have potential just like DraftKings and Penn Gaming, as the companies have huge tailwind especially legalized gambling in more and more states with a growing online presence and sports expected to have big returns in the next years. With Boeing being another company that might struggle in the short-term but for the long-term I believe is still a great company to own as they are expected to also have the 737 max banning lifted in Europe in the next couple of months. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/pwq0M2g) / [NEWS](https://ibb.co/G5hLmzq)

Also, car makers are getting more and more stamps of approval as they transition into the EV world, as 2 big Detroit giants GM and Ford are making a huge push to compete in the EV market with Tesla. The most recent was a buy rating from UPS on GM as they set the price at 50$ which implies a 16% upside.[NEWS](https://ibb.co/R3Y0WBP)

Just a quick mention as Netflix saw its stock up more than 1,5% on Friday as the company has struggled to regain momentum after weaker than expected growth in the last earnings report and has been dragged down by people selling the company after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine news. I still believe this is a great company as they and Disney will be the two biggest players in the streaming business in my opinion in the long run while ROKU also seems to be benefiting a lot from the dying of traditional TV as they are hitting all-time highs both in value for the company and subscribers. [ROKU NEWS](https://ibb.co/HFxLjQ2) / [NETFLIX](https://ibb.co/729dGWq) / 

So guys stay safe for the holidays as danger is still around, with the CDC urging people to not travel at home and also be safe while investing as the rift between the Treasury and the Fed may bring some volatility to the market unless a stimulus is passed by the time Biden taxes over even if the programs that will not be extended are not critical for the economy as they acted more like a backup in case of emergency. I believe the US should take the same approach as the UK which plans to present its biggest borrowing plan since World War Two. [UK NEWS](https://ibb.co/R40cy6n) / [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/nkRCR0X)

Don’t rush into the market if you missed the rally until now as I believe there are a lot of people who kept cash on the sidelines and missed the best moments to invest this year as the human mind plays tricks on us, just try to stay sharp and not put all your eggs in one basket. Be diversified and choose great companies as I believe we might see the market going up until the end of the year  as December has been one of the best performing months for the stock market over the time, with stocks seeing the Santa Claus effect almost every year while we also have to wait and see if the FDA approves the Pfizer vaccine on the 10th of December which I believe will be a good catalyst for the market as it has traded sideways. Today we also got news that Regeneron’s antibody cocktail has just received emergency use authorization from the FDA, this is the drug that was administered to Trump and made him have a quick recovery from the illness.

Payment information:

    Principal and Interest	$1,382.56
    Hazard Insurance	$83.42
    City Tax	$419.82
    Next Payment Amount	$1,885.80

I am located in Massachusetts. If I understand correctly, a conventional loan with PMI was the result of us not putting down 20% so in exchange, we were given a slightly higher rate. I was told I could refinance and get rid of PMI but I don't think that's the case here since it's a conventional loan and PMI is in the payment (if someone could clarify this I would appreciate it)?

So is it time to consider refinancing? Credit scores in the household are high 800s and this is our only debt. Not much in liquid savings at the time. 

Bonus question:

Is there anything I can do besides putting extra money towards escrow since every year, we get an escrow shortage notice and have to make a payment in order to balance it out? I believe this is due to property taxes increasing since the house is going up in value?",finance
personalfinance,question about taxes,"So in 2017, I bought cryptocurrency worth roughly 400-500$. Some on Coinbase and some on Binance. For the past two or three years while filing taxes, I didn't report anything about the cryptocurrency since I only bought coins and never actually sold them. After a discussion with a friend about the recent rise in crypto again, did I discover that exchanging one coin for another coin is taxable as well, such as ETH for XRP. 

Honestly, I haven't paid much attention to cryptocurrency since bitcoin ""crashed"" in early 2018. So I only recently logged back into Binance and discovered that I had been receiving airdrops for certain coins over the last two years. I've been trying to figure out how much ""income"" I've received over the past two years via airdrops. After looking through transaction history for all three years and doing some calculations... I had a capital gain of about 90$ in 2017, a capital loss of about 21$ in 2018 and an income(from airdrops) of roughly 5$. 

I'm wondering if its even worth amending all three years' tax returns or instead of amending the old returns, if I could somehow just put it all on the 2020 tax return and pay whatever I owe. I have tried amending the 2017 one on TurboTax and according to the software, I owe 4$ in Federal and like 2-3$ in State. If amending is the only option, can someone please let me know which forms I need and what the steps would be. I only know I need the 1040x for amending, but it wasn't clear what other forms I needed to complete the amendments. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off any of my loans with the savings I've set aside?,"When the government suspended interest on federal student loans, I started setting aside $1,000 a month in a separate savings account, with the idea that I might dump the contents of this account into my student loans right before interest picks back up (thanks r/personalfinance for the pro-tip!). I've continued paying at least double the monthly minimum on all of my loans as I had been prior to the pandemic.

As of today, I currently have $8,250 in said savings account, and the following balances on all of my loans:

* Private Loan - $10,279 at 4.55%
* Federal Direct Consolidated – Subsidized - $4,164.66 currently at 0.000%
* Federal Direct Consolidated – Unsubsidized - $5,058.09 currently at 0.000%
* Car loan - $1,980 at 6.19%

I currently have $6,800 in my checking and $13,500 in my regular savings account. With how much less I've been spending on gas, restaurants and random trips to Target, my spending has been pretty minimal and my checking has been around this amount since I started the separate savings account. I still have a full-time job and consistent, stable income.

Now that I see these balances, I’m not sure whether I should pay off one whole loan, put more money towards several at once, or if I should just continue saving and paying off at the rate I am currently (and pray student loan debt is canceled soon).  What do you think is the smartest way forward?

As a part of my severance package I'll remain on payroll until Mar 2, 2021, and then get a lump sum severance payment. I've already accepted a new position that I will start after my last active day in my current position. 

I currently make $82K/year and in the new position will earn $100K/year. I'm currently contributing 20% of my gross salary to a 401K plan (company suspended it's 3% match in 2020, but announced it's coming back for 2021). The new job is for a small company that doesn't currently offer a 401K plan, as I understand it my tax-deferred retirement savings would therefore be limited to $5K/year in an IRA. 

I'm considering upping my 401K contributions for the current job to \~90%, i.e. basically everything that is left after covering payroll taxes. Based on my calculations this would allow me to put \~$17.5K into my 401K before the layoff, and then I could supplement with $5K into an IRA throughout the rest of the year. In essence I would be frontloading the 401K contributions I would otherwise make throughout the year into the first 2 months. I'm estimating this will save me \~2K Federal Income Tax (I live in a no income tax state).

Forex,Hedging $1.5M USD - DX vs Fed Broad vs COFER,"Long story short I need to hedge \~$1.5M USD from major currency moves from Dec 1 until early-mid 2021. As far as I can tell, easiest method would be to use DX futures, but IBKR charges $120/month for NYBOT data, which seems expensive (and inflexible) when I can create FX positions and rebalance daily. Obviously there is a huge risk here with how volatile things have been, but these funds needs to stay low VaR and liquid so my only other real option is a basket of near 0 and negative yielding notes/bills, which at this juncture I can't justify.

Back to FX, I have two questions:

1. Since my goal is to hedge against FX moves (capital preservation), the majority of that $1.5M will still be maintained as USD, but what %? My best guess would be to mirror the global Foreign Exchange Reserve  (COFER) makeup ([https://data.imf.org/?sk=E6A5F467-C14B-4AA8-9F6D-5A09EC4E62A4](https://data.imf.org/?sk=E6A5F467-C14B-4AA8-9F6D-5A09EC4E62A4)), which keeps me at around 61% USD, but I'm not convinced this is my best option as US-based investor. What other global currency baskets (indices that include USD) should I be looking at?
2. Hedge Makeup: It looks like the two major non-USD baskets are the official ""Dollar Index"" (DX, DXY, USDX - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.\_Dollar\_Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index)) and the Fed Broad Index (H10, G5 - [https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H10/Weights/](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/H10/Weights/)). The DXY has a heavy Euro tilt and excludes CNH which seems antiquated, but the Fed index's import/export makeup is relatively irrelevant for my purposes (which more closely resembles hedging related to international real estate). How do I reconcile these two dollar-based indices, which themselves differ from the above COFER?

personalfinance,Missed payment impacting my credit score. Anything I can do?,"Hello all,

About 18 months ago, I had a serious delinquency on one of my credit cards. I'm usually pretty strict about paying off my cards as I used to churn. This card was one I  barely used however, and one $40 payment went unpaid for 3 months, dropping my score pretty substantially. Stupid on my part and a risk of churning but really a one time event.

This is specifically impacting my FICO score . It's at 710 and has been there for almost a year now. My Vantage score is \~750 and is not a problem, I think the missed payment was reported differently there. I know I'll be looking to buy a new home in the next couple of years, and having above a 720 or 740 FICO is pretty critical in getting the best interest rate which is thousands of dollars over the course of a mortgage. 

Is there any recourse available to me? Can I get the delinquency removed for 'good behaviour'? Or am I just stuck with it as it is for the next 6 years until it disappears off my report? I don't think I can dispute it as it was a long time ago and the missed payment \*was\* valid...",finance

Koinal.io offers a fast and secure method for purchasing Bitcoin and leading cryptocurrencies from major currency exchanges. Join provides the advantage of purchases through bank-issued credit cards and bank-issued credit cards.

## Bullish on Bitcoin

The analysts offer a pro-Bitcoin position based on assessments of the current market and emerging trends. Bitcoin has emerged in global markets as a potential hedge against monetary policies that drive inflation. Like gold, many investors see Bitcoin as an asset that does not depend on monetary policy for its value. In determining Bitcoin’s growth and investment potential, the bank’s analysts looked at current investments and long-term trend data.

## Expanding Markets for Bitcoin

The use of Bitcoin has grown in recent years to include companies that seek to hold the asset as a hedge against unwanted economic changes. They include Square’s decision to add $50 Million of cryptocurrency to its balance sheet. The use of Bitcoin as a corporate asset suggests the Canadian trend of converting cash reserves to Bitcoin continues in the US.

PayPal’s decision to offer Bitcoin to its customers will increase potential buyers by a significant number. PayPal can offer cryptocurrency to more than 350 million active accounts.

### The New Safe Harbor

Gold is a traditional safe harbor for investors seeking to balance a portfolio and hedge against volatility. The demographic trend suggests a divide between older and younger population groups. For many younger investors, Bitcoin has a certain appeal. A higher percentage of millennial investors prefer Bitcoin to gold as a hedge. This emerging trend can support a doubling or more in the cryptocurrency’s value.

I luckily just got a job making about $86k a year so I can thankfully afford to aggressively pay down my loans to save interest in the long term.

Would it make more sense for me to use an income based repayment plan to lower monthly payments, and then use the extra money to pay down Loan 2?

investing,Long Term Rental Apartment Fraud in China (DNK),"Original article in Chinese, translation by DeepL and OP.

With the rumors of bankruptcy of Danke Apartments(DNK) and continuous defaults by Ziroom Apartments, how long can Long Term Rental apartments survive?

I couldn't bear to read the rumors about Danke Apartments declaring bankruptcy and frequent defaults of Long Term Rental Apartments, so I decided to write another article.

It is true that for young people who are new to Tier-1 cities (Beijing, Shanghai, etc.), they cannot afford to pay rent on a quarterly or yearly basis. Long Term Rental apartments, which charge monthly fees and are simply furnished, are supposed to be a good business.

However, over the past few years, more than 60 Long Term Rental apartment companies have defaulted, and a variety of shortcomings have emerged, such as paying high prices acquiring apartments, renting them at low prices, then the executives flee to foreign countries with the money, defaulting on rent payments to landlords, giving tenants arbitrary price hikes, and charging high service fees .......

At present, among the remaining leading enterprises, such as Ziroom Apartments claims to have 500,000 landlords and 3 million customers, and Danke Apartments claims to have 400,000 rooms and has served 1 million customers. With such a huge number of properties and customers, why is it that suddenly the liquidity is strained and the company has been reported to be going out of business?

In fact, many readers are not aware of the financial model of Long Term Rental apartments.

The Financial Model of Long Term Rental Apartments

Whether it's a Danke apartment or another Long Term Rental apartment, they all have the same basic routine.

The first step is to find a landlord who will waive one month's rent to cover the renovations needed for a Long Term Rental.

The second step is to find a tenant to rent the apartment, and there are usually several options for monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual payments. The tenant will usually be asked to choose the monthly payment because it gives a certain cash bonus.

And therein lies the catch. If the tenant chooses to pay monthly, he or she must apply for a ""rent credit"" with a finance company. Long-term rental apartments will generally lure tenants into signing a one-year lease by reducing the rent by hundreds of yuan in various ways, so that the tenant can get a loan from the finance company for a total of 11 months' rent, which will be credited to the long-term rental apartment's account at once.

The tenant pays one month's rent up front, with a one-month security deposit, and then pays the rent once a month. Ostensibly, the tenant does not have to pay the interest on the rental loan and only has to pay the monthly rent according to the negotiated rent.

For example, if an apartment costs the landlord 3,000 yuan per month to rent, he rents it to the tenant for 3,600 yuan per month.

At the same time, the tenant pays an 8% management fee of $240 per month. In total, the long term tenant will receive $3,840/month.

In fact, the tenant is renting the apartment at an interest rate of 28%. This is also a disguised usury that raises the price of the rent.

The third step is that the tenant loan goes into the pocket of the Long Term Rental apartment in one lump sum, and they take this prepaid rent to continue renting, renovating the apartment, and running the company.

Their profitability lies in the difference in rent, as well as the difference in interest.

So if they are managing hundreds of thousands of apartments, why are they running out of money on their books?

There are two reasons for this.

The first one is that they expand like crazy. When they get a rental loan, they immediately jump into the market to grab another property. Once they get the property, they don't rent it out immediately, and they lose the free time in between.

These rent payments to landlords take up a lot of money.

The second is the cost of renovation. Usually when they get a house, they will renovate it first. If the cost of renovating one room is 50,000 yuan, the capital occupied by 400,000 rooms will be as high as 20 billion yuan.

This is an astronomical figure, so while the revenue of long-term rental apartments continues to grow, the amount of losses also continues to expand.

For example, in the first three quarters of 2017, 2018 and 2019, Danke Apartments suffered net losses of 272 million yuan (657 million in revenue), 1.370 billion yuan (2.675 billion in revenue) and 2.516 billion yuan (5.712 billion in revenue), respectively. In the past three years, the net loss exceeded 4 billion yuan.

In order to be profitable, long-term rental apartments must be able to continue to operate most of the renovated properties after recovering the costs of renovation.

In the event of a large-scale landlord surrender, or a tenant surrender, the Long Term Rental apartment's financial chain will break (they run out of capital).

This is because if the landlord surrenders the lease, the cost of renovation will not be amortized and will become a loss.

If the tenant surrenders the lease early, the Long Term Rental apartment needs to repay the loan and interest from financial institutions.

At present, the share of rental loans in the revenue of Danke Apartments and other long-term rental apartments is over 60%. 2019, the debt ratio of Danke Apartments apartments is over 100%.

In other words, the debt ratio of these long-term rental apartments has surpassed that of real estate developers, who are essentially dancing on financial leverage.

Since 2019, nearly 60 Long Term Rental apartments have gone bankrupt due to financial breakdowns and mismanagement. After the explosion of a number of parent-rental apartment institutions, many places in China also explicitly issued a letter to stop ""rent loans"".

In December 2019, the Opinions on Rectifying and Regulating the Housing Leasing Market Order were issued, which included rent and deposits into the regulatory accounts. The Opinions require that the rental income of housing rental enterprises shall not exceed 30% of the amount of housing rental loans, exceeding the proportion shall be adjusted in place by the end of 2022.

This means that all Long Term Rental apartments such as Danke Apartments and Ziroom Apartments must reduce their rental loan ratio, which also means that the loan funds they rely on for survival and expansion will be greatly reduced.

If there is no capital transfusion, the financial chain may break at any time. This is the main reason why so many Long Term Rental apartments have gone bankrupt.

Long Term Rental apartments are suitable for young people in big cities, but the innovation of this model has no technical content, and the main threshold is capital.

For example, the investors of Danke Apartments are Tiger Global Fund, Pleasure Capital, Kaiwu Investment, CMC Capital, and Chunhua Capital, which hold 20.0%, 15.7%, 10.4%, 9.4%, and 6.9% of the shares respectively, and Ant Financial also holds 7.8% of it's shares.

Those long-lease apartments without wealthy and generous investors are almost dead.

But no matter how good an investor is, it's hard to hold on for long when faced with a venture that continues to fail to see a profit.

The mandatory requirement of ""within 30% of the rental loan ratio"" will put an end to the wild growth of Long Term Rental apartments. It is necessary to think about how to make legitimate profits in business, not just to make a large scale, monopolize the number of houses, and then play the Internet game of harvesting after autumn.

Didi (Chinese Uber) ended up playing the monopoly, and failed to do the harvesting after becoming a monopoly. What's more, the long lease apartment is even heavier than Didi's model, dancing on the financial bubble.

Before the end of 2022, more and more Long Term Rental apartments will definitely go bankrupt and the executives would flee to foreign countries. Therefore, both landlords and tenants need to keep their eyes peeled, look carefully at the leasing contract and loan contract, and say no to all the overbearing clauses.

At the same time, in the trillion-yuan rental market, long-term rental apartments are a product needed by young people, but a better system is needed to regulate them, rather than letting them fall into this high-leverage financial game.

The status quo not only raises rents and the burden of renting for young people, but also adds a huge financial risk to society.

Yellen, 74, will have her work cut out for her, with the U.S. economy in the midst of the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression. But Yellen’s deep experience with macroeconomics, in addition to her familiarity with the inner workings of Washington, could prove to be useful tools as the Biden administration takes a swing at a fiscal response to the crisis.

stocks,$UBER is an excellent long term buy let me explain why,"TL;DR at bottom

First off I need to start by saying that I hate investing in a firm that is in a duopoly. I say that because in my experience firms will try again and again to beat out their competition. A great example of this is fedex vs ups. While both companies have performed well this year (as a direct result of covid) long term trends are not in their favor. these companies will both go back to fighting for market share and pricing one another out. Another one is Visa and Mastercard (in this case the winner is Amex). At the end of the day in most duopolies the winner is the consumer.

With that being said with the initial ipo of both uber and lyft I planned on staying far away from the two. However, recently I have come to realize that uber is a much different business than lyft. Lyft is entirely focused on giving rides while uber is simply focused on transportation. Think for a second about Uber you have Uber eats, raid hailing, and uber freight. I think the most slept on aspect of their business is uber freight it’s a revolutionary platform for drivers to find new freight deliveries. 

I almost never hear anyone even bring this aspect of their business up when talking about uber. In addition to freight we still have uber eats and regular uber. I don’t like uber eats at all. This will continue to be a losing sector until it becomes automated (which they are investing heavily in). That is simply because it costs uber more to send an order than they are being paid for that order. I will say the same for doordash. When they have an ipo I promise you it will bust. No food delivery company will ever be profitable until the drivers are completely cut out of the equation. Finally we have regular old uber the bread and butter of the business. The initial problem with this was regulations. However, in a town that recently allows ubers we almost always see DUI related accidents go down so there is a really good argument to allow uber into any town. I believe there is really not a good reason to deny uber entrance into a new jurisdiction. The main factor that causes a city to deny uber to operate is because of bad behavior from drivers. This is a simple fix with more intensive background checks and well eventually autonomous vehicles (which again they are putting a lot of money into). 

Let's talk about financials. 

Bad news first. **Uber is not profitable** and I can’t entirely explain to you as to why that is. Other than the fact that startup costs are very high I can not give you a finite reason as to why they are losing so much money. For a software company they have a very high percentage of expenses being debited to administrative and general I think this could easily be reduced but I was unable to figure out why exactly this number is so high for a firm that is basically an app.

P/E ratio: 27.03--- really fucking bad

Price/Sales ratio: 26.85 --- terrible

Unfortunately those ratios have gotten worse over the last 12 months and I respect anyone who avoids Uber solely based off of those numbers because that’s not a good sign. 

Now for the good news.

Uber has seen an increase in users, an increase in revenue, and an increase in market share over every period to date. This is a really good sign and very few companies can say the same. Basically Uber is taking heavy losses at the moment to expand the market as well as their market share. In addition to that i'm sure you already have heard about California legislation that passed in favor of uber/lyft. This was huge for the company and really will shape the future of how they will operate.

Now let’s talk about COVID

As you could imagine corona has had a big impact on uber stock. However, don’t forget about the eats sector. This part has seen triple digit growth and is more than enough to keep uber afloat. Once we have this virus behind us Uber will be in high demand and we could see some really great numbers coming next year. 

TL;DR: Uber has a debt problem, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. If Uber can reduce administrative expenses while keeping a large budget for R&amp;D the road to profitability would be much shorter than Wall Street might imagine. 

Price targets: (these are somewhat guesses to be honest)

bonds,CNYB - Gaining Exposure to Chinese Government Bonds,"The Governor of the People's Bank of China has recently published an article concerning the direction of China's future financial policies, including the intention to pursue traditional monetary policy without the use of quantitative easing or negative interest rates, as well as  the aim to maintain a stable value for the yuan. The plan to allow market forces to play a bigger role as part of further reforms in the financial markets was also mentioned, in addition to the government decision to expand the opening up of China's markets to foreign investors. Further information can be found in [**this article**](https://www.investorinsights.asia/post/china-s-monetary-policy-and-the-future-of-foreign-investment-in-china).

While international retail investors cannot purchase Chinese bonds directly, there are ways to gain some exposure. iShares CNYB, whose details can be found in this [**article**](https://www.investorinsights.asia/post/ishares-cnyb-gaining-exposure-to-chinese-government-bonds-individual-and-institutional-investors), is one of the options and has gone up steadily this year.",finance

personalfinance,First real job with 401k - what do I do now to best prepare myself for the future?,"Hi Everyone! I am new to the working world and don't have a lot of background in finance so I apologize if I sound naïve - I'm doing my best and trying to learn!

So a little about me - I just graduated this past May (graduating into a pandemic definitely wasn't the most fun but not much I can do to control that). I was very fortunate to land a temp job working in a covid lab that is super close to my parents home right out of college. As a result, I saved up enough to pay off my student loans (11.5k) - haven't paid towards it yet because I am still in my grace period. 

I accepted a new job and relocated for work at the end of October. My new salary is now 80k before taxes which is a lot more than I was expecting to make right out of college. After taxes, medical, dental, vision, etc my monthly take home pay is a little under $5k. Rent, bills, and food each month come out to be \~$1500. 

In the bank right now I have $16k in checking and $3k in savings. Once I pay off my student loans that will bring my checking acct balance to $4.5k. 

So here is what I have done/plan to do:

\- I set up my 401k and will be contributing 3% of my salary to get my company's 3% match. 

\- Plan to open up a Roth IRA and put in the full 6000 this year. Will continue this every year.

\- Move money around in different accounts (I have an Ally bank account that I plan on putting my savings in for a better interest rate and I'm looking into a Morgan Stanley investment acct)

This is what I'm confused on:

\- Should I be contributing more to my 401k? How do I decide on the percentage?

\- Should I open other investment accounts like one through Morgan Stanley?

\- General advice on how to handle money/start budgeting for future goals like a house, kids, etc?

If this is too much in one post just let me know and I will take it down or break up into different posts! I'm just a little overwhelmed by this all because I came from a pretty low income family and my parents know nothing about retirement or have any plans for their futures. All of this has only inspired me to try and take control of my finances. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Where can I look to find the right refinance for my home in southern VA,"My mother has been telling me she recently refinanced off her VA loan, and the interest rates are way low RightNow.  I think I am at 4%?  I have only owned for a year and a half, I did have a late payment due to my own lack of paying attention, but I was wondering where people suggest I start looking.   I'm not sure I would be eligible, but I would hate to miss you due to fear of not getting it, or ignorance on places to go.   My loan is a VHDA loan",finance
personalfinance,Will a card upgrade offer to one with rewards reset the length of time for the line of credit?,"I received an email from my credit card company stating that they could upgrade my current credit card to one with rewards and no annual fee. It is something that would be better for me since the current card has a yearly fee + no rewards.

My concern is if I upgrade this card, would that reset the length of time for it? It's currently the longest LOC I have and I feel I will need it as I plan on taking a large loan out later in the year.


The offer does state that the credit limit, interest rate, card number, payment date, account settings will not change. As well as no affect to my credit score.

The security number and expiration date will change.


Should I ignore the offer and opt to not use this card? I do have another card with incentives I actively use.",finance

personalfinance,I'm thinking about getting a high yield savings account until I have enough for a cd,"So I've never had anything more than a run of the mill checking and savings account. I started looking into high yield savings accounts after hearing the jingle for Goldman Sachs on the radio, but varo seems to have a higher yield.

 I told my mom about it, and somehow, for someone that has also never had more than a basic checking/ savings at the same bank, had some knowledge about these kinds of accounts that I had overlooked, mainly that they have variable interest rates. She also didn't trust them, worried that if things went sideways the bank would shuffle off with my hard earned savings. Supposedly the fdic(?) keeps that from happening, but I'm still reading up on it. 

But I do want to place it in a high yield savings account, that way I can use it when I need it while still making some money back, and according to what I could find on varo, as long as I keep it under 10k I can make almost 3% back... as long as the rate doesn't dip. 

Once I get to the 10k I'm planning on putting it in a CD, but I haven't brought this up to my mom because it was a pretty recent change of plan. 

As an aside, she did suggest I become a loan shark. Seriously. I would rather not.

 Tldr: any advice on how to move forward with my savings plans in a less loan sharky manner would be appreciated.

Edit: I promise you guys my mom is cool when it comes to finances, its just that I didnt expect her to already have a plan to become a loan shark, she only brought it up the one time I spoke about the high yield savings idea. She's very respectful when it comes to finances.",finance

I have constantly worked towards this goal by [Chruning](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/), and the simple things like paying my bills on time, putting all additional funds towards my debts, etc.

Now I want to know, what some of you guys have been able to do by having an 800+ score?

personalfinance,To sell my home or to rent it out?,"Hello! Long time lurker here. So I cannot make up my mind on whether I should sell my home or rent it out. I have lived here 4 years and my plan was to Airbnb or rent it out down the road. I did Airbnb out half of the rooms while I lived here (pre-covid) and it was awesome. But I got a job offer in another state, so it's time for me to make a decision.   


The details:  
Purchase price: $198,000  
Current mortgage left: $190,000 (re-financed and dropped pmi, etc)  
Interest rate: 3.15%  
Monthly payment: $1,133 + $130 (pool) = $1,263  


Realtor estimated sale price: Starting at $294,000  
Realtor cost: 4-5% (depending if he brings the buyer)   
Sale profit (zillow):   **$78,492**   


Renting estimate: $1,900/mon   
Renter company fee: 10% of rent   
Monthly profit: 1,900-1,263-190 = $447  


My options are that I could check out a cheaper rental company. Or once my life settles down (a few years), go back to Airbnb for a larger profit. The house is 10 mins from the beach, so lots of tourists. I would love to keep this home for if I do Airbnb, then I could always book a week for a cheap vacation. But I would possibly buy another house at my new location in a few years too, and who knows what the market might do. I don't think this area is too over inflated... If I did rent it out, I would keep the profits in a savings account for future repairs until I reached \~$10k or so.   


Just looking for some advice / conversation. :)",finance
personalfinance,Discover Card Repayment Plan,"I will try to keep this concise, if you have any questions you think could help you answer my question better, I will be happy to answer them in the comments.

I'm trying to buy a house. I have a decent amount of savings but my credit is holding me back. I applied for a mortgage with two lenders but both applications were denied.

My credit score is around 600-620, depending where you look. However, earlier this evening I payed off, in full, an outstanding credit card debt which was charged off a couple years ago at $2,800. Apart from my student loans which are in good standing, the only outstanding liability I have in my reports is a credit card repayment plan I set up on a defaulted Discover card.

The balance of the Discover account is roughly $5,900. It has a wonderful APR of 0.99% and a monthly payment of $180. However, Quicken Loans/Rocket Mortgage identified it, along with the other credit card account, as something that could potentially be holding me back. At this rate, I will not pay it off for another few years.

Looking at my 3 credit reports, the statuses report ""PAYS_AS_AGREED"", ""Current Account"", and ""Closed."" on Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian respectively.

I understand that at 0.99% APR, I'm basically getting free money by sticking with the repayment plan. However, that is dramatically outweighed by the cost of paying rent for even a year--much less three--if that is what is holding me back from getting a mortgage. My question is, is this actually hurting my credit score? In a couple of the reports it seems to show as in good standing. Would paying it off in full as a lump sum improve my creditworthiness in the short term?

Tl;dr: I have a hardship repayment plan set up with Discover for a defaulted credit card at a favorable interest rate. Will my creditworthiness significantly improve if I pay it off in full immediately?",finance
personalfinance,"NJ, received bill for Installment Interest, because i did not make required estimated payments","Hi, I live in NJ, work in NY. Each year my company gives me a W2 which says that it paid federal tax and NY tax. I end up filing in both NY and NJ, get a large return from NY, and basically pay most of it into NJ.  I got a bonus/raise, which probably bumped me into some kind of a new threshold, as I haven't had an issue before.

I just received a bill which claims I need to pay $42.02 for 'installment interest', and it looks like the issue is there was supposed to be money paid during the year, but because i waited until the end of the year, I have to pay the interest.

I'd like to avoid this situation from happening again, though I'm sure I'll be in the soup again this year, as again I haven't been making these payments (or maybe I still have time? to do it?).  I don't really know how to prepay or how to calculate how much I need to prepay.  Or perhaps there's a way to tell my company to deduct NJ tax during the year.",finance
personalfinance,Changing job with a 401k loan - what are my options?,"Last year I took out a $30k loan from my 401k to make a 20% down payment on my house. The current balance on that loan is $24k.   


I'm currently interviewing for jobs with three different firms and it's likely I'll make a decision in December. The problem is that is I leave, I'll have to pay the loan amount back, or pay taxes and penalty on the $24K by treating it as an early withdrawal (which would be around $6-7K).  


I have around $10k in savings (cash poor since buying the house). This is a 3 month emergency fund. 

Other info

Age 34  
Pretax Income $145K (new job will probably be in the $125K range, it's a career switch with better longer term opportunities and work more in line with my skills/interest).  
Debts: $8k car, $24K 401K (shown above), Mortgage  
I usually save around $4k/month (around $40-50K per year depending on vacation spending).  


These are my options that I'm aware of:  


1. Suck it up and pay the penalty (awful last resort option)
2. I read in an article that I can keep making monthly payments till April 2021 (tax deadline) by leaving the 401k with old employer. This would give me four extra months to pay it back. Is this true? I still don't know if new offer includes signing bonus (likely does but I'm not banking on it), but if it does then I can probably come up with $24K by April next year.
3. Dave Ramsey would kill me for saying this, but taking a personal line of credit loan to pay off the $24K and avoid paying penalties, and paying off the new loan asap. The interest rate on this would be in the 6-10% range.

What should I do? Any other suggestions?",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinancing Reality Check,"Long story short, my wife and I closed on our first house last June with a 4.375% 30-year fixed mortgage. Since then, mortgage rates have continued to fall, so I reached out to the MLO who handled our original mortgage. Talked to him about wanting to refinance to take advantage of the lower interest rates and free up a bit of extra money every month (better in my pocket than the banks). I could get 2.75% for a fixed 30 year with 1.425 points (my wife and I both have good credit scores in the upper 700's/low 800's).

After talking through things, he sent over a draft cost sheet and I was a bit taken aback. I was expecting a few thousand dollars in closing costs, but the cost sheet showed $10k when adding up all the costs. I've broken down the costs and some details below:

* Current loan balance: $122,000
* Prepaid Items (taxes &amp; insurance for escrow): $4,050
* Closing Costs (various bank, title, etc. fees): $4,150
* Points: $1,850
* New loan balance: $130,200 (current loan balance + prepaid items + closing costs), and I would pay the $1,850 for the points at closing in cash.

&amp;#x200B;

So all in, I'd be paying nearly $2k out of pocket, plus adding $8k to the loan balance by rolling in the prepaid items and closing costs. I realize that I need to get some costs from other lenders, but for anyone that has refinanced their mortgage before, is what I've described above as completely crazy as I think it is? FWIW, my mortgage is with a large national bank (PNC).",finance

stocks,Dot com bubble vs 2020,"I’m curious what’s everyone’s opinion on if there is an EV bubble being created similar to the dot com bubble in 2000. 

Here are some quotes off Wikipedia that I think may be similar to what we are experiencing now:

Preclude to the bubble:
Wiki: The 1993 release of Mosaic and subsequent web browsers gave computer users access to the World Wide Web, greatly popularizing use of the Internet

2020: many traders are on Robinhood picking up “meme stocks” and lots of people unemployed, thus an increased interest in trading.

Wiki: At the same time, a decline in interest rates increased the availability of capital.

2020: fed has also decreased interest rates 

The bubble:
Wiki: As a result of these factors, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any dot-com company, especially if it had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a "".com"" suffix in its name.

2020: Kinda different, but if you replace the .com/internet prefixes part with “EV” I think it carries a similar point/situation.

Wiki: At the height of the boom, it was possible for a promising dot-com company to become a public company via an IPO and raise a substantial amount of money even if it had never made a profit—or, in some cases, realized any material revenue

2020: sound familiar? Nikola?

Bursting of the bubble:
Wiki: On January 10, 2000, America Online, led by Steve Case and Ted Leonsis, announced a merger with Time Warner, led by Gerald M. Levin. The merger was the largest to date and was questioned by many analysts.

In February 2000, with the Year 2000 problem no longer a worry, Alan Greenspan announced plans to aggressively raise interest rates, which led to significant stock market volatility as analysts disagreed as to whether or not technology companies would be affected by higher borrowing costs.

On March 20, 2000, Barron's featured a cover article titled ""Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash—fast"", which predicted the imminent bankruptcy of many Internet companies.This led many people to rethink their investments.

Enron and 9/11 also contributed to the bubble popping.

2020: ?

personalfinance,Using a private loan to pay off credit card debt with a lower interest rate?,"Hello All, 

During this pandemic and its quarantine, I lost my job. And since I am young, unemployment based my wages off of when I was a student (I was only getting $160/week with a lot more bills to pay than when I was a student)

Nonetheless, my fiance and I were struggling significantly for several months trying to make ends meet. As a result, I have now found myself in several thousands of dollars of credit card debt (gas, groceries, etc.) I know I should have been more prepared with an emergency fund and shouldn't have rung up the credit card debt. But now it is KILLING me. The interest rate is high around 23% and I am struggling to pay it off. I have a couple part time jobs now and that is helping. 

INFO: before the pandemic, I paid off my balance in full, every month. That was the only way I had used my credit card in the 4 years I have had it. Carrying a balance is new to me. The only other debt I have is federal student loans and a modest auto loan for a commuter car to get to and from work. 

Today, I got a letter in the mail from Discover (who is also my credit card carrier) about applying for a personal loan with a fixed rate of 6.99%. They specifically mentioned that this could be used to pay off high balanced credit cards.

stocks,Analysis of the Key Distruptors in the EV &amp; Automotive Industry,"Hello all,

I decided I would do a comparable analysis of some major names in the EV industry to make sense of the current hype and growth estimates - and no, I will not be including Chargepoint or Workhorse. Given that the EV sector is still in a growth phase, I decided not to use price multiples and instead focused on performance, liquidity, how the street has treated it, how management has treated it, their supply chain and geographic exposure. Here is what I found.

---

#**[1-Year CAGR](https://i.imgur.com/SeGsfvM.png)**


Given the growth phase most of these companies are going through - and the impact of the coronavirus - a 1 year time frame for their CAGR seemed appropriate. Within CAGR I look at some very important fundamentals - Sales, EBIT (Operating Income), Net Income, and Free Cash Flow. Of the Chinese EV companies, Nio is the only one capable of generating net positive CAGR as you can see Xpeng and Li Auto drastically falling behind the rest of the pack. Nio even outperformed its North American competitors, General Motors and Tesla. I chose these two as comps because they are both the biggest competitors internationally against the up and coming Chinese EV companies, and have the potential to even dominate a share of China's EV market should the government allow it. I did not include Nikola in this as they are a pathetic scam in my opinion, but also because all of their numbers were so incredibly negative that it was completely skewing the data sets. So overall here is the ranking of these companies when compared against each other and the average:

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. General Motors ($GM)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

#**[Analyst Coverage](https://i.imgur.com/w4nIIR3.png)**

Analyst coverage is a very important factor for the majority of investors. Often times upgrades and downgrades can drive stocks for the month and can even act as the fire that lights up the volume of it. There is an expectation that analysts know what they are talking about but do keep in mind there is often a ton of outside influences on their decisions, such as the investment of their firm and political influences. Look more into how Enron extorted brokers for a 100% buy rating. 

Anyways, we see a lot of holds obviously as these companies have very rocky financials for the most part. Tesla and General Motors, having been in the spotlight for much longer and in a grander way, have the highest amount of buy ratings. There is only 1 sell rating across the entire data set and that comes from Tesla, which is expected due to the controversy of its growth and I will not consider it a threat. General Motors has a signifigant amount of Hold ratings due to their volatile past and overall historical decline which they are just now compensating for with a break into the EV market. This is likely to shift bullish in the future as the stock has seen growth as of late. The Chinese stocks are lacking in coverage as they are just now getting the attention of investors internationally, however they all have a significant amount of buy ratings and their coverage is far more positive than their American counterparts on a % of ratings basis. For that, I will rank them higher than Tesla or GM.

#**[YTD Performance](https://i.imgur.com/997gUV2.png)**

These companies are the hottest investments on the market right now, flat out crushing the indices and reaping in rewards for investors. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a huge factor in these companies and the idea that each of them can be the next industry leader. So far we are seeing each company get an equal share of the hype - driven up or down by their ability to meet the obligations of the market. (ie,. crushing earnings and meeting demand for delivery). NIO has ran laps around the rest of its peers as it was the first to receive such attention and came from the lowest of prices, having plunged to $2 a share in what feels like centuries ago. General Motors has moved the weakest as it is a value play that has been in the game for decades and has other segments it relies upon for growth. Xpeng's massive 40% move today pushed it above Li Auto and has it catching up to Tesla. Whether or not that happens, only time will tell.

#**[Short Float](https://i.imgur.com/yTmoymh.png)**

This sector has enough of the market betting against it to make any value investor go pale. However it has not stopped the companies at all, and the bears have been ripped to shreds as seen in the YTD performance. Li Auto has the highest short float at 15% as it is the youngest and smallest of the Chinese EV trio and is still relatively new. Investors often hear about Xpeng or Nio first before they find out about Li Auto so it does not attract the same hype as its counterparts, leaving investors to value it more heavily on its fundamentals which are gutter trash as it is still in its growth stage. The social media war between Elon Musk and his short sellers has seen the short float drop drastically from the double digits to where it currently sits at just over 6%. This is likely to go down in the future as it has been validated in its addition to the S&amp;P 500, showing to investors that it is no longer the shitty growth stock they used to bully it for. General Motors on the other hand has little to no short sellers as it is still in the ""old boys club"" of stocks. The street favors it much more highly given its massive track record and mega market cap. As these companies gain more in share price and attention, they will most likely get caught in the cross-hairs of sell side analysts more often.

#**[Margins](https://i.imgur.com/mSIapfl.png)**

Margins are one of the best ways to value a company's operation capabilities, regardless of whether or not it has positive cashflows. In the automotive industry, operating margins are a very important number but often fall flat due to the capital intensity of the industry. Companies such as the ones listed will often have highly negative margins as they are still finding solid ground for their balance sheets and are focused on delivering on their promises to customers and developing a pipeline of sales. 

With that in mind, we need to currently focus on which is the shiniest of the turds as every Chinese EV stock currently has crippling negative operating margins. Despite previous remarks, Li Auto has been shown to have the upper hand on Nio and Xpeng, with a significantly higher gross margin as well as less negative operating and net profit margins. Xpeng has a lot of catching up to do as it has nearly a negative 130% operating margin. General Motors and Tesla still come out on top as they have dealt with these financial issues long long ago. 

1. Tesla ($TSLA)

#**[Liquidity Multiples](https://i.imgur.com/yAcorJo.png)**

Liquidity multiples are not something used often other than Current Ratio, which is the most important of the three in my opinion. The Current Ratio tells you how many times over a company can pay off its current debt with the value of its current assets. The Quick Ratio is what tells you if a company can pay off its current liabilities with its current liquid assets. The Cash Ratio is a spin off of this in which the current liquid assets are replaced with merely cash and cash eqiuvalents. It is far more restrictive and pins the company for a lack of cash on hand which is not exactly fair given the current stage of these companies. 

Anyways, Li Auto has the highest of these margins by a longshot. This is most likely due to its smaller size as companies just starting out will have less assets and liabilities and will show incredibly volatile multiples. Once it achieves a higher valuation this will taper off and most likely join its Chinese counterparts. Tesla and General Motors have the smallest of these ratios as they have much bigger balance sheets and expanded operations. Xpeng and Nio are second best to them as they are just now beginning to enter a valuation phase where it is harder to maintain such a high ratio like Li Autod does. The industry overall has very good ratios however which is a surprise given the financial state it is in. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)

#**[Leverage](https://i.imgur.com/LWNG0oE.png)**

Financial leverage expands upon the liquidity ratios I mentioned above by comparing assets and capital to the debt. I chose the total amount of each fundamental to accomodate for the difference in growth and size beteen General Motors, Tesla, and the up and coming Chinese EVs, which have much more near-term obligations as they are still growing. 

Nio automatically raises a red flag as its Total Debt / Total Equity is in fact negative, and by a significant amount which implies it has negative shareholders eqiuty. In a realistic world, this would imply Nio is on the brink of being dissolved and that there is a massive liquidity draught from investors fleeing ship. The company has been successful thus far despite this because of how incredibly cheap debt is, and Nio is swimming in it. Should interest rates rise in China or the US, this could destroy the company in the short-term. However with Yellen being brought back into the fight, it is highly unlikely US interest rates will go anywhere anytime soon. 

General Motors has the highest Debt/Equity as it has been on the rocks financially for a while now and has a lot of issues to get through on its massive balance sheet. This is the equivalent to a senior citizen being bound to a wheelchair. Whether or not it can compete with the young and tough Tesla is dependant on their current investment strategy in EV, and if Nikola is anything to go by, I don't think they stand much of a chance unless they get more competant management.

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. General Motors and Nio have tied as they are both equally dog shit in this regard

#**[Institutional Ownership](https://i.imgur.com/N4foBOn.png)**

This helps signify if the street is putting its money where its mouth is, and also shows us where that particular mouth is.  Li Auto has seen investor activity quadruple as funds and ETFs have quickly added it to their holdings. This is set to taper off as it grows and solidifies itself amongst its peers. Meanwhile, funds cannot find the door fast enough as they run far the hell away from General Motors, with 54% selling off as of late. My guess is that the Nikola screw up made the boomers spit out their coffee during the live stream and realized GM's EV potential is dead in the water until further notice. Tesla's lack of institutional ownership can be attributed to funds 1) taking profit, or 2) selling off as TSLA no longer qualifies for their fund and finally 3) Institutions shifting their assets into other EV stocks as Tesla is no longer the only signifigant eqiuty in the basket and there is room for more growth oppurtunity in smaller companies like Nio, which has seen a neat 43% raise in institutional ownership. Funds are getting their feet wet and slowly adjusting to having a position in the Chinese EV market. The Chinese EV market is in fact dominating and Xpeng and Li Auto have both soared as well, due to the recent spike in confidence that the trade war with the US will end under Biden and that renewable energy is the future of China.

#**[Geographic Exposure (As % of Revenue)](https://imgur.com/a/OGA9nSc)**

Geographic revenue is pretty rigid right now as the Chinese stocks are landlocked in China. Whether or not Tesla dominates the market in China is everyone's concern right now and when you see that the operating leases of Li, Xpeng and Nio are primarily financed through CCP subsidiaries, you realize China has no interest in foriegn invasion of market share. Tesla may gain some footing, but I think the market will primarily be contested between the three stocks that call it home as they are being funded similar to the US funding the space race with Nasa and Boeing. The 0.4% other is from a supposed revenue stream coming from Macau, of all places. Not sure what to make of that. General Motors has the most diverse revenue geography with 13% of revenue coming from places outside of Asia and the US. Given their signifigance in the broader automotive and industrial industry, this is to be expected. Tesla has focused primarily on the US during its massive growth phase and the incentives raised by those such as California who made it much more attractive to own their products. They are slowly breaking into Hong Kong and Mainland China but are waiting on more interest from the government entities, and as I said above that is not likely going to turn out in their favor enough for it to move markets. Overall I will be ranking them on their diversity of geography.

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Tie for third between the Chinese EVs - Nio, Li, and Xpeng Motors

And last but not least...

#**[Supply Chain Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/o52ruKR.png)**

The supply chain is critical to any corporate infrastructure. A weak link can break the whole chain and having a higher amount of suppliers and customers means less risk if one of them fails to accomodate. 

Given the developments the Chinese EVs are still going through - and considering their funding by government subsidiaries - private and public contractors are not too present in their supply chains. Nio, hower, has 31 suppliers and 7 partners it sources from. This would often be a good indicator, however with the previous liquidity and margin ratios it tells us that they have a huge cash problem if they are losing so much money despite such a signifigant backbone of a supply chain. Verticle integration is certainly out of the picture for Nio anytime soon as they cannot even stand when supported by others. It is currently a free rider and being pushed to its current value by these partners and suppliers - not that this will stop any time soon. Given that they are just now rolling out production, it shows them having 0 customers. Disregard this.

Given the massive networking conglomerate that is GM, they have 441 suppliers and 39 customers - those 39 customers probably being worth trillions in combined market cap. I grabbed these numbers from FactSet as my bloomberg terminal is close to 200 miles away. If you have access to one though and are curious, run the SPLC function on GM and see what you get. 

1. General Motors ($GM) 
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

Do what you will with these numbers and factoids. How you weigh each factor and the ranking of the companies is up to you. Li Auto and General Motors tied for first as they are both the biggest and smallest companies in the basket. NIO is second place and overall I would consider it to be the most level headed choice as it is not too big or too small, not too volatile or too stagnant among other things. I personally have shares in NIO as of $31 and don't regret it, however I don't look to expand my exposure to the sector anytime soon as I'm currently tied up in other investments. Here is the full album of the stats, enjoy!

investing,Analysis of the Key Distruptors in the EV &amp; Automotive Industry,"Hello all,

I decided I would do a comparable analysis of some major names in the EV industry to make sense of the current hype and growth estimates - and no, I will not be including Chargepoint or Workhorse. Given that the EV sector is still in a growth phase, I decided not to use price multiples and instead focused on performance, liquidity, how the street has treated it, how management has treated it, their supply chain and geographic exposure. Here is what I found.

#**[1-Year CAGR](https://i.imgur.com/SeGsfvM.png)**


Given the growth phase most of these companies are going through - and the impact of the coronavirus - a 1 year time frame for their CAGR seemed appropriate. Within CAGR I look at some very important fundamentals - Sales, EBIT (Operating Income), Net Income, and Free Cash Flow. Of the Chinese EV companies, Nio is the only one capable of generating net positive CAGR as you can see Xpeng and Li Auto drastically falling behind the rest of the pack. Nio even outperformed its North American competitors, General Motors and Tesla. I chose these two as comps because they are both the biggest competitors internationally against the up and coming Chinese EV companies, and have the potential to even dominate a share of China's EV market should the government allow it. I did not include Nikola in this as they are a pathetic scam in my opinion, but also because all of their numbers were so incredibly negative that it was completely skewing the data sets. So overall here is the ranking of these companies when compared against each other and the average:

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. General Motors ($GM)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

#**[Analyst Coverage](https://i.imgur.com/w4nIIR3.png)**

Analyst coverage is a very important factor for the majority of investors. Often times upgrades and downgrades can drive stocks for the month and can even act as the fire that lights up the volume of it. There is an expectation that analysts know what they are talking about but do keep in mind there is often a ton of outside influences on their decisions, such as the investment of their firm and political influences. Look more into how Enron extorted brokers for a 100% buy rating. 

Anyways, we see a lot of holds obviously as these companies have very rocky financials for the most part. Tesla and General Motors, having been in the spotlight for much longer and in a grander way, have the highest amount of buy ratings. There is only 1 sell rating across the entire data set and that comes from Tesla, which is expected due to the controversy of its growth and I will not consider it a threat.

For that, I will rank them higher than Tesla or GM.

We have some outstanding debts that we could eliminate (student loan and 401k loan for closing costs on new home).

First, is it possible to do a cash out option at this point? I know that generally cash out will have a higher rate but we have already locked in our rate.

Second, if it is possible, is it a good idea?

The interest rate on 401k and student loans are about 7% and 5% respectively. Total outstanding amount for both is about 20k.

Adding this to the refinance loan would increase the monthly payment by $90. Currently pay $450/month on student loan (private loan) and $280/month for 401k loan (still contribute to 401k with loan outstanding).

It's what he drives currently and is inspected, no major problems as of yet. My concern is obviously how long is this caddy going to last me considering it already has 130k miles on it? And also, will not be a money pit since it's a 12 year old luxery car, I've read mixed reviews both praising and trashing this specific car and I'm just not sure. Maybe some of you have experience with cadillacs and or experience in dealing with used cars in general. Are the inevitable repair costs going to be worth having essentially no car payment? Or should I stick to the reliable honda with high monthly payments. 

Also I'm aware that obviously another big factor is to simply just make more money, I'm currently working on finding a higher paying job.",finance

personalfinance,Is it worth using a consolidation service for debt under 10k ?,"So right now I've been carrying almost an $8000 credit card debt for years on one card that has about a 13% interest rate. I've just been paying off the interest each month which averages about $225 (I know this is dumb and irresponsible, no need to harp on me! I've just never made real money so its been a struggle as well.) I want to get off this stressful unending debt train and start paying off that balance asap. I don't have a lot of money coming in but enough to pay this minimum as well as other bills, without any extras (I do keep my monthly living costs relatively low). I have about 30k in student loan debt but the interest on those is lower so I figure I should start with the credit card.

I keep seeing these ads for debt consolidation and counselling pop up on my feed. I decided to call one. They said they could reduce my interest rate to 0% and proposed a monthly payment of $180, $160 of which would go directly to the balance of my credit card and the remaining $20 to them. The initial fee to sign up is $50. This seems worth it to me if it means paying off my balance way faster. 

Most of their info seems to check out; they're a non-profit and charity with a good rating on BBB. Reviews are good on most sites except Google reviews, where there were many 1 star reviews saying that using the service had tanked their credit, and that the credit mark (R7 status?) stays on your credit score for several years!

Does anyone have experience using one of these companies, or have knowledge about their impact on credit score and general usefulness? I'm real tempted but can't afford to get screwed.

stocks,"Thinking of dropping my house down payment on index funds, thoughts?","So I've been saving up for a house for the last couple of years and then got laid off from my job. They said I would have to at least be employed at a new job for 6 months before I can get approved for a mortgage. Meanwhile my 42k is just kinda sitting there. I was thinking of putting it in index funds during those 6 months so it can grow more and I can get a better house. The thing is, with covid rising and unemployment as well, I'm worried it can suddenly drop. The other thing though, is we all thought that would happen this year with all that's going on in the world and yet it has been one of the biggest bullmarkets ever. I'm a relatively new investor and I've seen many say that we shouldn't use this year as a benchmark for the stock market but at the same time my money is just sitting there gaining a measly interest rate compared to what I could be making in index funds. So what are your thoughts on this plan?

Edit: wanted to add I have unemployment and another savings account to pay my expenses for all of 2021 if need be, so that 42k is not something that I'd need to live off of till I get another job.",finance

investing,Ford stock is climbing,"Ford is currently at 9.42 today, from 8-something yesterday, if memory serves. I used to work as a contractor at GM, and between the two, I definitely have more trust in Ford to be a stable investment. Part of my faith in Ford comes from the fact that they worked themselves out of debt without the help of the federal government, unlike GM. Another reason is because, during my time working as a contractor, I noticed that the entirety of GM management that I came across seemed to believe that the trucks they were producing essentially rendered their Cameros, Corvettes and other luxury vehicles nearly obsolete in the market, because the trucks offered all the luxury features and the added utility that a big vehicle naturally brings. 

For reasons I couldn't quite grasp, they continued to produce vehicles which they believed were undermined by one of their own products and which they didn't seem to have faith in, in terms of selling power. Ford, meanwhile, seems to have focused on trucks first and foremost, which, as GM seems to believe, have superior market potential for the aforementioned reasons. GM seems committed to production of luxury vehicles for reasons other than simple supply and demand motivations. I heard some say part of it was the tradition and the association between product and brand. I'm not sure, but the fact that I couldn't understand their rationale makes me skeptical of ever looking to them as a stable investment. Ford, from what I can tell, seems to understand their niche and their limitations and seems willing to operate within them, whereas GM seems to be banking the prestige of their vehicles making up for the lack of popular demand for them; maybe they think they are going to experience another Transformers.

I am not an expert on either company, these are just my two cents. But my gut is telling me that Ford is worth it, both because of its low price and its seeming stability.",finance
personalfinance,The future of prime rates. Better to go with fixed interest or variable?,"Hi all, want to reach out here for some input on which term to go with for my SBA  loan. One option is to go with a variable interest rate of 4.76% (prime+1.51%)and I can do free rate modifications every year to take advantage of a lower rate. Or I can lock in an interest rate of 5.69% fixed for 10 years (term of the loan). Right now prime is at 3.25% and I’m not sure how long it’ll stay at that rate. The last time it was 3.25% was in 08, during the crisis. right before that, it was 7.25%. Then to go to 4.25% it took 9 years. So is it safe to say it will take 9 years to go up 1 full percent again to get the economy out of recovery? This pandemic has created more economic injury than the 08 crisis.

personalfinance,FHFA Announces Conforming Loan Limits for 2021,"https://www.fhfa.gov/mobile/Pages/public-affairs-detail.aspx?PageName=FHFA-Announces-Conforming-Loan-Limits-for-2021.aspx

    
    

Washington, D.C. – The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) today announced the maximum conforming loan limits for mortgages to be acquired by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2021.  In most of the U.S., the 2021 maximum conforming loan limit (CLL) for one-unit properties will be $548,250, an increase from $510,400 in 2020.     

Baseline limit
The Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) requires that the baseline CLL be adjusted each year for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reflect the change in the average U.S. home price.  Earlier today, FHFA published its third quarter 2020 FHFA House Price Index® (FHFA HPI®) report, which includes estimates for the increase in the average U.S. home value over the last four quarters.  According to the seasonally adjusted, expanded-data FHFA HPI, house prices increased 7.42 percent, on average, between the third quarters of 2019 and 2020.  Therefore, the baseline maximum CLL it in 2021 will increase by the same percentage.     
    

High-cost area limits
For areas in which 115 percent of the local median home value exceeds the baseline CLL, the maximum loan limit will be higher than the baseline loan limit.  HERA establishes the maximum loan limit in those areas as a multiple of the area median home value, while setting a “ceiling"" on that limit of 150 percent of the baseline loan limit.  Median home values generally increased in high-cost areas in 2020, driving up the maximum loan limits in many areas.  The new ceiling loan limit for one-unit properties in most high-cost areas will be $822,375 — or 150 percent of $548,250. 
Special statutory provisions establish different loan limit calculations for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  In these areas, the baseline loan limit will be $822,375 for one-unit properties.
As a result of generally rising home values, the increase in the baseline loan limit, and the increase in the ceiling loan limit, the maximum CLL will be higher in 2021 in all but 18 counties or county equivalents in the U.S.",finance

I can't say that I'm happy because I'm not. The light at the end of the tunnel for a lot of people this year was the PS5. A new generation with so much to look forward to. An event that only comes once every 7/8 years, where people from everywhere can celebrate together in unison online. And just enjoy the medium of games.

But even that little bit of a silver lining has to be snuffed out in some way or another. Scalpers and their Bots infesting websites that hold limited stock makes me sick. Creating a super inflated market for these things that make people impulse buy them at double the original mark up. 

I don't necessarily want to buy one right now as I'm waiting for Cyberpunk and clearing out my back catalogue before the year is through. But it doesn't mean that I don't feel sad and ANGRY for my fellow, working class gamers who have been waiting anxiously for so long and with enough money saved up to get one of these things.

I urge anyone who see's this and who is considering to splash twice as much on a PS5 to keep your money seated and WAIT. Do not fall prey to a broken system, we are gamers but consumers first and foremost. YOU have the power to nullify this money-making sheme by simply waiting.

personalfinance,Help with Backdoor IRA - already contributed to Roth IRA for 2020.,"Hi! I'm sure this q has been asked before but am still a little confused on the process.

My AGI will exceed the Roth IRA income limits for 2020 due to some realized stock gains I'll be reporting on my 2020 tax return - bumping up my AGI.

My question is..I already made a 12k contribution to my Vanguard Roth IRA account on 7/15 of this year (6k for 2019 and 6k for 2020) so I imagine I'll need to  recharacterize my contribution from my Vanguard Roth IRA to a traditional Vanguard IRA? I found a good reddit post from someone who had a similar issue. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/30u6ky/backdoor\_roth\_with\_already\_contributed\_to\_roth/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/30u6ky/backdoor_roth_with_already_contributed_to_roth/) 

I'll prob call Vanguard to confirm but some questions I had were:

1 - what is the actual recharacterization process like? Just call Vanguard and have them convert my ENTIRE Roth IRA to a Traditional IRA? I don't have any tIRA accounts or rollover accounts (thankfully!) so I suppose I'll need to open one with Vanguard now.

2 - I assume Ill just need to recharacterize 6k of my contribution I made for 2020? (not 12k since 6k of that contribution was for 2019 in which I wasn't MAGI limited).

3 - what is done with the profit I made in the Roth account? So a lot of my stock appreciation this year came from my Roth (although I already had plenty of funds in my Roth prior to 2020). I don't need to pay tax on my entire Roth IRA would I?

I understand there are specific IRS forms and reporting rules related to this so I'll make sure to do research separately on it.

Sidenote - for 2020 I maxed out both my 401k (19.5k) plus HSA ($3,550) reducing my AGI. I also have started making Fed and State ES pymts throughout the year.  I don't think I'll be assessed any underpymt penalties or interest since my tax withholdings and ES pymts exceed 110% of my prior year (2019) tax liability.   

Thanks in advance for any feedback! I'll also make sure to let you know what I find out from Vanguard after giving them a call!",finance

personalfinance,What is the best way to deal with my car loan I am upside down on? (Don't want to keep car anymore but what are my best options to improve this situation?),"I pay $342.31 for 72 mo for a 2016 Honda Civic EX 2.0L Sedan CVT with 47k miles (Purchased at 34k)

The sale price for the car is $15,589 with $975 in taxes

My Annual Percentage Rate is 6.89% My payments began 11/14/19

I've had the car for about a year now. My current balance atm is at $17k and it was $24,646 of total payments (amount financed $20,083.94). This was my first car that I bought and I took my dad with me to help me out and we are both co-signers. I know it's more expensive than it should have been especially because both the dealer and my dad pushed me to get this Ally Protection extended warranty thing (Major guard coverage) and it looks like it added another $2,789 and GAP another $411. God knows what other $hit they added under my noob nose. I know I'm paying a lot and this. bad deal I got stuck with but I've been paying on time ever time this whole year. I don't have a credit card or anything so this car is the only thing building me credit so I'm sure it's good atm. Can I refinance (also do it in my name only exclude my dad) and try to lower my interest rate? I'm really bad with this stuff.. can someone lead me in the right direction as to what I can do at this point to better my situation? 

Currently thinking maybe I can try to refinance the loan in my name and somehow return or get refunded for the Ally Protection and GAP insurance.  Just to try and lower the final total of the loan? Advice on this? I never used them so it should be possible to get a partial refund at least? Once I do that maybe I can decrease interest rates since I should have somewhat of a good credit score by now and have a new loan maybe with a final total of $15k once all that stuff is returned (hopefully) and sell it for that price. Right now I'm upside down maybe $2k? If I sell it like this I'd have to sell it at 15k and then have $2k left on the loan and no car. At least I'd be out of this deal. If someone buys it at 15 then I can just pay the rest and then get the title for the new buyer. I honestly am not having trouble with payments but I know it's a bad deal. I want to try and ask here what my options could be... 

I want a different model car but I will loose way more money if I trade it in and that negative equity will just roll over. I have another car I can use so I'm thinking just do that for now and save up for the downpayment for the car I really want but do it right. But really I want to 1) decrease the total amount of my loan somehow 2) sell my car and avoid trading at dealerships 3) start over not roll over. 

Anyway, I do like the car. I just regret getting the cvt transmission instead of 6spd and it bugs me that Im overpaying for a car I almost want lol Honestly, I'm not having trouble with payments.. but I think this is a terrible deal and im overpaying. Im asking here because as you can see... I am terrible with financial decisions. Just need advice because Im terrible at this stuff. Thanks guys",finance

I opened a credit card nearly 10 years ago to help out a family member who was desperate (food, clothes, utility bills, medical - serious things) - racked up almost $6K CC debt. They weren’t able to pay it so I’ve been making just over minimum payments all these years to try to chip away at it ($100-200/month) with interest 20%.

I have one other credit card for emergencies I’ve used in the past ($900 balance, also 20% interest rate, paying minimum 100/month, down from balance of $3k), haven’t used it in forever.

investing,Market Impact from Capital Gains Tax Increases,"While the new administration has been clear that the [40% capital gains tax only applies to households in excess of $1M earnings annually](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-biden-capital-gains-tax/fact-check-biden-willonlytax-capital-gainsat-40for-those-earning-over-1-million-annually-idUSKBN26Z2CA), it strikes me that this might have a negative impact on the market which many are unaware of entirely.

The Long-Term Capital Gains provides investors an incentive for staying in the market longer (&gt;1yr) and investing in a company's future, rather than focusing purely on short term gains due to being taxed higher. The equitable increase to a federal income tax for those high earners would seem to accomplish the following:

* Potentially reduce cap gains income for the government because those in the market will want to wait until the tax is reduced to realize their gains
* De-incentivize new investments because of the tax burden if they need to exit the market when taxes are so high

Is there any precedent for this in the past? What might those high-earning households look to as alternative investment vehicles, if anything?

The only counter I can see to this is that with the fed rate as low as it is, stocks are really the only way to realize gains in the current market so there may not be other options.

Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin has to make people rich,"I see the argument that Bitcoin isn’t going to work because people aren’t buying stuff with it because (1) it’s not fast/cheap to transact, and (2) people don’t want to part with it because they don’t want to miss out on gains.

I‘ve thought about this a lot and feel like I have a good reply. Let me know if my thinking is correct.

The short of it is this: **Bitcoin has to make people rich for it to have a chance to have critical mass so that people would actually switch to it as a currency.**

I don’t think the average person would switch to a new payment system without BIG benefits. I talk to a lot of folks about money (I’m in the finance industry in the US) and hardly anyone knows about fiat, inflation, fed reserve, how interest rates are set, et cetera. I mean, they may have heard the words but can’t explain what they are or the pros and cons of each.

Because the average person just wants to know that they have X dollars available so they can by thing Y, it leads me to believe that they aren’t going to rock the boat. Why download an app to spend a currency that isn’t what they are used to? It would be like convincing everyone in the US to switch to the metric system. The metric system is superior to the imperial system but we keep using the latter (myself included) because it’s the most common and has no critical mass.

With this is mind, why would the average person use a cryptocurrency? Personally, decentralization, non-custodial, non-inflationary, sovereignty, etc are big selling points to me - but I don’t think they mean much to the average person.

The benefit that I think HAS to be included in a crypto for it to work as a currency is that it has to make the early adopters rich. We need a LOT of people to get on board to make it work and the only way the average person is going to get on board is if it’s going to make them rich (because superior principles don’t seem to matter to most folks). 

That all being said, Lightning has been working pretty well for me. I’ve spent probably $5-10k via Lightning in the past few months without issues. I know it’s beta, but it seems to be working pretty well so far. I just make sure I increase my BTC holding by the amount I spend so I don’t have less or I use Strike and use my fiat to buy things via Lightning.

So, to answer the issues above, Bitcoin has to be designed in a way that encourages long-term holding and the enrichment of early adopters. And, aside from that, Lightning is already doing pretty well at making Bitcoin a currency. Maybe Lightning isn’t the answer in the end, but layer 2 probably has to be the answer (vs a layer 1 that is a currency first).

personalfinance,I feel like I'm paying way too much in taxes but every year I wind up owing?,"Without getting into tons of detail here: 

Edit for clarity: 

I am salaried and have 24 paychecks a year (""bi-monthly"" or twice a month on set dates). My after tax paycheck is just under $4100 a month. (There are no months with 3 checks or 5 checks, it's always the same amount). 

I just saw a post on Money Diaries Active that says ""I’m [F]22 years old living with my parents. I recently got my first full time job in early August that pays a salary of $54k. I see about $3690 monthly after taxes and everything else taken out for insurance and my TRS account (for which I honestly need to learn more about)"". 

That figure of 3690 a month **after all withholdings including taxes** as the comment states feels very high to me, especially considering I make $21,000 more a year than this person and am somehow taking home only about an additional $300 a month.

I checked my pay stub and I'm paying 25% of my check in federal taxes, or $775 a paycheck. This feels high, but again, what the heck do I know? **Edit** this is JUST federal. Not state or other withholdings. ONLY federal! My pay stub has a calculator breakdown and this is what it says. Insurance etc. is just over $100 a paycheck. 

I've run into tax issues before by adjusting my w-4 incorrectly so I'm reluctant to do that, but on the other side, no matter what amount of tax I pay I magically seem to owe the gov't thousands on tax day. (I have my taxes done by H&amp;R block--although last year I filed my own taxes with Turbo Taxes). For example, I got a severance payment from a previous job that was taxed at 40% and somehow I still owe the gov't 3k in taxes from last year. Sigh. I trust that there's a reason but it feels like I'm getting rooked here and I just don't know enough about taxes to fight this. 

Edit: Previous years aren't really my issue here, that's just me complaining, my issue is that someone making 54k is somehow taking home **after taxes** almost the same amount as me, someone making $75k.

Are there any lower-cost resources that can help me sort this out? It is irritating in the extreme to be paying through the nose for taxes and always wind up owning.

I’m in the final stages of selling my condo and expect the closing to happen in the next 2 weeks. However, I’d like to begin looking for and possibly making an offer on a new property while I await my current closing to take place. 

Would it be detrimental for me to get a pre-approval before my closing and the money hitting my account? Right now I have about half of the deposit I would need for a home in the price range I’m looking for. The other half is coming from the sale of my current home. 

Things to note: 

- I have very little debt. Only use one credit card that I pay in full each month (often paying it off several times per month to keep the balance low or at zero)
- No student loans, car payments, alimony, etc. 
-My credit is in the 730 to 750 range 
-I earn over 100k per year 

I’m concerned that getting the pre-approval prior to having the money from my closing will end up with me getting a worse interest rate of a lower maximum approved amount. 

TL;DR: haven’t closed my current home. Will need the money from closing for the full deposit on new home. Should I get a pre-approval for new home now or wait until closing is complete?",finance

personalfinance,Company incorrectly processed my change in percentage related to contribution in 403B. Looking for possible solutions and general awareness for others to keep keen eye on paycheck,"Good evening everyone

During the summer I followed this SUB closely and decided I wanted to get close / meet my limit of $19,500 for 2020.  I had to make up some ground.  My company requires a form to be sent to the HR department which I indicate the contribution percent change I'd like to go with.  Around August I sent in a change to my contribution and on the form indicated ""50% (fifty %) so there was no mistake.  The change was processed and on my next couple paychecks 50% was correctly deducted from my gross amount for my 403B contribution.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to September.... I sent another email to HR changing my deduction from 50% to ""30% (thirty %).  Just as I did before when I changed it to 50 I used both numbers and words so that it was clear what I wanted.  As before, HR acknowledged they received my email and stated the changes would take place if feasible on next paycheck.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I swallow my pride and admit I f'ed up.  I did not carefully look over my 4 paychecks following that change and understand that is my fault and my fault only.  With that said, for the past 4 pay periods only 5% has been deducted from my gross to be contributed to my 403B.  Due to HR not processing my request correctly and I not taking the time to do due diligence and check my pay stubs I contributed close to $800 over 4 pay periods when it should have been nearly $5,000 in my 403B.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything that can be done retroactively; especially given I provided HR with the correct percent contribution I wanted to contribute, they acknowledged the change w follow up email and still they processed it wrong?  Am I just SOL and chalk it up to an important lesson learned?

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any insights and or steps I can take for this please advise.  I will be reaching out to HR next week.  THANK YOU hope this helps someone else.  Check everything about your paycheck carefully and diligently!

\*\*\*Fidelity handles the 403B if that matters

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: Company handles all changes to personal 403B contributions via form submission.  HR acknowledged my desire to contribute 30% pretax to 403B, however, screwed it up and the following 4 paychecks only deducted 5%.  Missed out on nearly 5k pretax contributions for 2020.  Do I have any recourse or ability to retroactively deposit to 403B and if so can taxes for those checks be adjusted since it should be pretaxed contribution?",finance
personalfinance,Any way to use M1 Borrow to help my situation? Should I use it to pay off my car payment?,"Currently M1 plus ($50 for the year) will allow me to borrow on margin at 2% interest. Can't figure out if it is simple or APY.  I have a large portfolio and can borrow 5x what I'm asking, so not worried about maintenance calls.

My car loan has 19k remaining at 3.59%. My payments are $530. Would it be beneficial to use M1 borrow to pay off the car and lower my interest rate? A little concerned that M1 is variable so they can change the rate at any time, but doesn't look like the fed will change any time soon.

personalfinance,Student debt interest payment,"Hey PF,

I have a question about student debt interest that I hope someone can help with.

My GF graduated back in June. Her student loans are all currently in ""deferred"" or ""grace"" status, but she's been making payments on them regardless to take advantage of them not accruing additional interest during covid.

Today, she received a letter from FedLoan, informing her that she needs to pay off an amount of $10,464.73 in interest by 12/12/20, or that amount will ""capitalize"" onto her principle debt, and she will have to pay interest on that new amount as well.

Is this... Normal? It seems incredibly strange that she would have to pay off all that interest at once, on 3 weeks' notice. It also seems strange that her interest could be added to her principle, to then pay interest on that.

Does anyone have any experience with this? Is there something obvious we're missing here? Is there any way to get around paying such a large sum in such a short period of time?

Thanks in advance to anyone that can help

EDIT:

I think we've got a handle on what's going on and a plan of attack. Thanks to everyone who reached out to help",finance

I, like many others got into the stock market last March, and noticed considerable hype concerning stocks and trading overall among some peers, which I expected to die soon after the pandemic situation settles. Fast forward today and people are giving stock advice on tiktok and a serious amount of people are into the stock market. Since I am new myself, I understand I can be biased since I have no reference points, so I would like to ask the oldies of this sub if they could confirm my observations.Secondly, my key take if this is to continue, is that I would start looking at stocks purely from a supply/demand perspective, because ultimately it is what price action boils down to. I have been discouraged from following this strategy since institutional traders dominate said price action, but with more retail traders entering the market I am reconsidering; many 'meme' stocks with no fundamental catalysts are soaring simply because people are buying. In addition, there are talks of negative interest rates in Denmark and the UK, if other countries follow  I think the stock market would appear even more attractive to individuals.

investing,How Three TikTok Stars Beat Back U.S. Plans to Ban the App,"In early September, a handful of TikTok stars, most of them in their early 20s, gathered on a Zoom call to tackle a weighty question: Should they take on the U.S. government?

After more discussions,  Doug Marland , a 23-year-old comedian from  New Jersey , raised his hand to join a lawsuit objecting to the Trump administration's order to ban the app. Two others -- musician  Alec Chambers  and fashion designer Cosette Rinab -- also volunteered.

The three have a combined 7.4 million followers on TikTok and make their livings off the app. The suit argued that a ban would mean losing their income and limiting their ability to express themselves.

The lawsuit got little attention when it was filed in a  Pennsylvania  court. The TikTok stars ultimately prevailed -- and the case has become central in creating a path for the app to maintain its foothold in the U.S., where it is now used by almost one in three Americans.

It looked like a grass-roots effort, but it was not. Behind the scenes, the legal action was orchestrated by TikTok and its Chinese parent company,  ByteDance Ltd. , according to people familiar with the matter. It lined up the influencers to be plaintiffs, connected them with a top First Amendment lawyer and helped create a legal strategy that was complementary to a separate lawsuit the company pursued under its own name, the people said.

It was an unexpected twist in a geopolitical business saga that began this summer, and continues with a preliminary deal still under negotiation that involves  Oracle Corp.  and  Walmart Inc.  taking stakes in TikTok.

ByteDance and its potential U.S. partners are optimistic about completing a deal in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with their discussions and internal thinking. On Wednesday, the Trump administration granted ByteDance a one-week extension to complete a deal, putting the new deadline at  Dec. 4 .

In August, President Trump signed an order calling for TikTok to be shut down or, alternatively, sold to a U.S. company. The administration said it feared ByteDance could share information about U.S. users with the Chinese government, which the company said it would never do.

The first ruling in TikTok's favor came with its own lawsuit, which argued that an initial  Commerce Department  ban on downloading or updating the app would harm the company's business. On  Sept. 27 , Judge  Carl Nichols  in the  U.S. District Court  in  Washington, D.C. , determined that the government likely overstepped its authority under national-security law. The government appealed the decision, and the case is still ongoing.

On  Oct. 30 , Judge  Wendy Beetlestone , in federal court for the  Eastern District  of  Pennsylvania , ruled on the influencer lawsuit. She blocked  Commerce Department  restrictions that would have barred U.S. companies from listing TikTok in their app stores -- a move that would effectively make it inoperable in the U.S.

""Without access to the TikTok app, Plaintiffs would lose access to all of these followers, as well as to the professional opportunities afforded by TikTok,"" Judge Beetlestone said in her decision.

The U.S. government has appealed the ruling. The government called the plaintiffs' claims meritless and argued their request to block the ban would "" necessarily infringe on the President's authority to block business-to-business economic transactions with a foreign entity in the midst of a declared national- security emergency.""

In a statement, TikTok's interim head,  Vanessa Pappas  said: ""We stand behind our community as they share their voices, and we are committed to providing a home for them to do so.""

 One  of ByteDance's goals in recent months was to draw out the Trump administration's assault, the people said, betting that key officials would likely become increasingly distracted as the election approached.

The TikTok review by the administration began with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which evaluates deals for national security risks. That committee has ordered ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations of TikTok, out of concern that user data could be shared with the Chinese government given regulations there that require companies to hand over huge swaths of information. ByteDance has said it would never share data with the Chinese government, though analysts and experts say companies generally have little choice but to comply if asked.

ByteDance's legal efforts were designed to chip away at the more punitive efforts by the Trump administration, even while it pursued a deal that would satisfy the Cfius order, which also has bipartisan support in  Washington . Any deal will ultimately require signoff from the U.S. president.

Although President-elect Biden has not made clear his position on TikTok, the committee's divestiture order would still likely stand under new administration.

For now, an outright ban of TikTok appears off the table: On  Nov. 12 , the  Commerce Department  said it wouldn't enforce the order that would have effectively forced TikTok to shut down, citing the ruling in the stars' lawsuit, and the administration's legal options are dwindling.

""It's a big muddle because of these lawsuits,"" said a senior administration official.

Ms. Rinab, a 21-year-old senior at the  University of Southern California , said she started crying when she learned of the court victory. ""I was so, so happy,"" she said.

""This entire experience has been one I'll never forget,"" said Mr. Marland. ""It taught me a lot about the country, the way laws work, and court procedures.""

While TikTok was aggressively pushing back on the proposed bans in the courts, it also pledged to work cooperatively with national-security regulators on the potential deal that would address the U.S. government's data-security concerns.

In mid-September, the company announced it had chosen  Oracle  as its partner to secure its data in the U.S., with the software giant and  Walmart Inc.  taking ownership stakes in a new company that would run TikTok's U.S. operations.

A key sticking point that still needs to be ironed out is the size of the ownership stakes for ByteDance and its new U.S. investors, according to people familiar with the discussions and internal thinking.

The negotiations have already helped  Walmart  forge closer ties to TikTok, something that has motivated the retailer from the beginning, according to people familiar with the situation.  Walmart  is working toward partnering with TikTok on providing warehouse and shipment support for sales made through the app, and  Walmart  CEO  Doug McMillon  now has relationships with TikTok's executive leadership, some of the people said.

Executives at  Oracle , who see TikTok as a major customer for its cloud business, expect the deal to be completed before the end of the year, a person close to the company said.

ByteDance kept its lawsuits against the U.S. government active in part to ensure that the app didn't face a shutdown as the negotiations took place.

Mr. Trump would still prefer to get rid of TikTok in the U.S. altogether, though his attention has shifted to other matters, the senior administration official said. The official said that even though Mr. Trump gave his preliminary approval to a deal, he has never been fully sold on the idea because he doesn't want a transaction that could be perceived as benefiting  China .

Inside the Trump administration, Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin , Attorney General  William Barr  and  White House  economic adviser  Larry Kudlow  have all said in meetings at times that they believe a deal could work, while  White House  adviser and  China  hawk  Peter Navarro  has advised Mr. Trump to avoid a deal, according to the senior administration official.

TikTok believes it will still likely need to divest its American operations or face persistent questions about its handling of U.S. data, according to people familiar with the matter.

A deal must ultimately get signoff from the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment and Mr. Trump, as well as the Chinese government.

The lawsuit was designed in part to put a human face on TikTok. Mr. Chambers, the musician, joined the app in late 2018, and a cover version of Halsey's ""Without Me"" recorded in the basement studio at his parents' house earned him thousands of early followers.

Now more than two million users follow his videos, many of which feature his own original music or his covers of radio hits. The 25-year-old from  Connecticut  has earned endorsement deals to promote Extra gum and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.

""TikTok has allowed regular kids like me, who don't have access to a lot of money or connections to people who are high up in the industry, to make a stamp in the music business,"" he said. ""I felt like I needed to fight"" for TikTok.

Mr. Marland, the comedian, said he likewise amassed enough TikTok followers to quit his job waiting tables and drop out of school. He now supports himself with sponsorships from brands including Snickers and Reebok, and boasts three million followers.

As threats against the app grew through the summer, TikTok officials stayed in close touch with top performers on the app to reassure them that they had a plan to ensure survival and to dissuade them from switching to rival platforms, according to people familiar with the outreach. As part of those communications, the company stressed that the stars had rights of their own to defend, the people said.

In September, TikTok brought the high performers together to talk on a Zoom call about the U.S. government threats and what might be done about them. They answered questions about how TikTok had affected their lives, according to a person who attended the call. Eventually Mr. Chambers, Mr. Marland and Ms. Rinab volunteered to be plaintiffs in the lawsuit.",finance

stocks,Is over diversification bad? Are less stocks more profitable? Starting a new portfolio,"**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**

Hey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. 

As my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)

So i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less &gt; more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.

So here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don’t make this a 2 hour read time.

I will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

As you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. 

And finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don’t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.

personalfinance,Paying 50% of personal loan off within the first year of a 5-year loan?,"I took a personal loan in order to try and build my credit but I'm not too keen on paying interest on it so I'm trying my best to save some cash in my pocket.

From what I've read, the interest on most loans are based off the existing principal amount and my idea is that if I payed off 50% of the principal (or heck even 70%) of the principal within the first year, would this in term lower my total monthly interest. My contract doesn't have a prepayment penalty and any payment exceeding the monthly payment goes to principal. I know that it's better to keep the loan open for credit building but I'm trying to get the most out of it without paying a great amount of interest rate.

Please give me your thoughts on this. It would really help me navigate ways to save as much money as possible. Thanks

Forex,"Hi guys, is my friend being scammed on forex trading?","So my friend recently told me she going into a new career path. Okay cool, what is it? Forex trading she told me. So anyway, she said this 

“If you compounded your account, starting from a balance of £200 and gaining 10% each week, by the end of the year you’d have £25,000 lol. Nah we don’t pay them directly. But the platform itself there is a joining fee  obv and a monthly fee to be there. Also with anything, with education it’s really about investing in it but the skillset will more help you in the long run. Be wary of things that are free on the internet about trading, there’s a reason why they’re free. The market is designed to take peoples’ money and if the majority are using google/YouTube and finding that they’re constantly losing. Isn’t there a reason why?” 

So a few things, she pays them £150 a month, but now she pays nothing because she got 2 other people to join so it’s free for her. 

Another thing, on the last two lines she wrote, it was sketchy, it felt like they fed that to her to get her to join. I mean, if you’re selling someone something, wouldn’t you say that too? “Don’t get your information on the internet, come buy my service and I’ll teach you” etc. Right? 

So my questions are, 

- is she being scammed? 
- can you earn a decent living with forex trading with 2/3 months of learning? 
- is forex trading courses online actually help? Or can you just watch YouTube, read and study would be more useful? 
- lastly, why would someone who knows how to make a lot of money from forex trading be helping others? Essentially creating another job by making these courses when they can just do forex by themselves and earn a shit tonne? 

I want to help my friend if she is being scammed",finance

I asked for some advice a while ago on this sub regarding exchanges, and got some helpful replies, so I'm back with another query :)  


Does anyone have experience using the above platforms (Nexo, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com)) for earning interest on your crypto?  


Both seem like much better options than putting money in a savings account given the interest rates, and the idea of actually using crypto practically with a card is appealing as well.   


I've yet to really dive into to researching both of these platforms, so just curious what people's experience is with them both?   


They seem fairly similar although [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) seems to have more (complicated?) options, but maybe I'm wrong.

Liquid cash: 375K

Company RSUs: 120K

Retirement Accounts: 200K

Crunching the numbers it seems like I can afford to spend this amount a month on housing and still be able to save towards retirement and continue my current lifestyle. However, I feel a tremendous sense of anxiety in a) increasing my monthly spending by nearly $1,000 and b) losing my financial freedom. For comparison, my current monthly rent is $1,500 for a small 1BD in the same neighborhood.

The reason for wanting to purchase is that rent prices show no signs of going down in my neighborhood despite the pandemic and I have made the decision that this is the area I want to put down permanent roots.

I understand that buying a home is a subjective and personal decision, but I'm curious to hear if anyone on this forum has gone through similar anxiety/dilemma. Any feedback would be appreciated",finance

As it stands, my only debt is my mortgage and my federal student loan debt (all private student loans have been paid off, cars are paid off, no credit card debt). I’m hesitant about paying that off as it seems possible there could be some degree of forgiveness in the future.

Not sure where to begin, but it’s all just sitting in my checking account currently. Should I start looking around at financial advisors to handle this? I currently have a 401k through work, but other than that I have no other investments. I do need to be able to withdraw/gift my brother’s portion of the funds at some point next year - likely in September/October - so that much can’t be tied up long term, but figured that money could earn some interest in the meantime. 

Any advice is much appreciated!",finance

Banking,[US] Blackmailed/Extorted for money. Can my bank do more than they say they can?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to go but it's a start.

On Wednesday 11/25 I was blackmailed/extorted for money to have non-consensual pictures and videos of me deleted. 3 of the 4 transactions were Western Unions paid in cash that the bank says they can't do anything about. The 4th I have successfully filed a claim on but I'm unclear if I'm having that credited back to me. What I'm wondering is what else I can do to maybe get the cash paid Western Unions back?

I have filed a fraud claim with Western Union and an IC3 with the federal govt.

Bitcoin,Could these recent proposals involving non-custodial wallet prohibitions be related to an initiative toward more USA based Hashpower? They can’t exactly come out and say “More BTC should be MADE IN USA and not in China” -Would sound like an endorsement!,"This is a contrarian “Hail Mary throw.” I’m not entirely caught up on just what’s being said and done by usgov and I have absolutely no axe to grind here. To be clear, I’m a btc guy and will NOT, for one, be welcoming our new galactic financial overloards. Just a shower thought, that’s all. Please discuss...

Edit: let me unpack this a bit more. 

Let’s assume the usgov realizes btc is here to stay. At that point they would want to see that China can’t dominate btc hashpower. Well USA can’t go out and say, do your patriotic duty and mine btc! That would seem like an endorsement and hasten the declining utility of their printing press. So how does a country promote more domestic hashpower without being seen as acknowledging the utility of BTC. The same way they get everything done, Timmy,  with regulations!

Regulation, that is purportedly designed to keep you safe from X (losing your btc, I guess?) but is actually implemented to keep the gov safe from Y (Chinese dominance of btc network hashpower)

They did this before: they banned non custodial gold possession to keep them safe from savers opting out of their fiat ponzi. They said it was to keep the citizens safe from “hording” lol heaven forbid!

So the us gov goes out and says that you can only hold btc in a custodial wallet. The custodians are us based. But what about mining? All newly created btc is mined into a non custodial wallet. So they say all right if the btc is mined in the us, then it can go in and/or maybe out of those non custodial wallets, you know from us based mining. Us demand for btc can now be fed only by us generated bitcoins. Hashpower increases in the USA. The usgov gets what it wants without admitting that btc is important.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Thoughts on parking money needed in 1-5 years in municipal bond index fund?,"My wife and I have a significant sum that we could desire using in 1-5 years for a potential down payment on a house.

My research has lead me to Municipal Bonds, specifically VWSTX or VWSUX. I'm interested in these funds due to the growth being free from federal income tax. 

What are thoughts on parking this money in a fund like this? There are other alternative non Muni Vanguard Bond funds too that I've considered, like VBIRX or VFIRX, as well. But obviously these don't come with the same federal tax advantage.

stocks,Joe Biden's administration could end up developing major passenger rail infrastructure. Which companies should we anticipate to benefit from such policy?,"I've recently been interested in passenger rail potentially becoming a much bigger industry in the coming decades, as North American governments and municipalities are starting to wake up to it's potential. In the wake of Biden's presidential win, and a possible Senate majority on the horizon, it is looking like we should be seriously be considering the possibility of the United States rolling out a multi-trillion dollar infrastructure plan. For reference, skim Biden's page: [https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/) and note how the team explicitly states their intentions to develop municipal transit and light rail networks, while also **Sparking the second great railroad revolution.** Even the Biden campaign site had little train graphics on it at one point. I should also point out that Biden is famous for his dedication to the Amtrak system as a passenger and also a key advocate for it's upkeep, for this he has been nicknamed Amtrak Joe.

I think it is safe to assume that Joe Biden and his administration have real intentions to invest heavily in rail transport as part of their green infrastructure plan. Therefore, I think it would be wise to start breaking down the industry and looking into which companies are poised to get involved and benefit from this ""revolution"".

But I have a few questions:

Since I have virtually no experience researching this field, where should I be looking? I know that a lot of equipment is made by overseas companies, but also a significant amount is manufactured in America.

Has anyone else been looking into this for some long term plays?

I haven't been able to find many people discussing passenger rail in general. Perhaps it is because most major passenger rail operations in the states are government corporations, or because the industry is mainly fed by very large, diversified companies. So my question is, are there even companies that are heavily weighted/invested in specifically passenger and light rail development? Should I be looking at European,and Asian markets instead of North America?

Anyways, it interests me as I am keen on developing a greener portfolio. It would be cool if I could get away from airlines and invest in rail.

investing,Why do we talk so much about “Robin hood Traders”,"Self managed discount brokers have been very hot recently pushed by young adults. Looks like if you are a young adult trading on the market, you fit the “Robin hood” category. A lot of analysts was explaining the big push of Tech stocks during the dip recovery due to this new generation of Robin hood trader. That is the explanation for Tesla and NIO having an “overvalued” price. 

However, anyone who has financial knowledge knows that small retail investors do not have a significant influence on the market. Do you really think that the most broke generation, investing their 20k, can alone push the market so high? The big players are the pension funds, endowments funds, investment funds, hedge funds, corporations, all the boomers got a shitload of money. 

So I don’t understand why I see sometimes financial guys on TV mentioning “Robin Hood Traders” when they are trying to explain a high valuation of a certain stock. I am sure it is a drop in the sea, it is not like Robin Hood traders were the FED being able to print money at an infinite rate to put in their beloved stocks.",finance
personalfinance,Expensive stuff shipped much earlier than anticipated. I missed a call from them. Now they're charging me hundreds of dollars for warehousing. Any recourse?,"At the end of September I made a very big (for me) purchase: over $1000 for some polycarbonate panels from eplastUSA.com. Lots of comparison shopping, lots of measuring, etc.; I need them for a greenhouse. I was mindful of the notice on their site saying ""lead time"" could be delayed by up to 2 weeks. 

Then nothing happened for quite a while. Their website message about ""lead time"" changed, I think, and I tried a few times to contact someone there (by phone and their web-chat) with no effect. 

Sometime in October I checked the website (you have to know your order number/URL, and check that way) I saw that my items would be shipped (presumably from Wisconsin, where eplastUSA is located, but possibly from elsewhere) on 11/23.

I'm in NY state, and it has started snowing (occasionally). I needed good weather to deal with these huge panels outdoors (cutting, etc.). So I left a phone message and (I think) sent an email, both saying ""this is so late that I'm considering canceling the order."" This is 3+ weeks later than suggested on the website when I made my order and gave my credit card info.

OK, I settled down to wait. To my surprise, a few days ago (11/24) I got an email from eplastUSA saying ""the shipping company"" (no company name, number, or email provided) had been unable to contact me. It was an almost useless email, as it gave me no way to contact this company, or even which phone number I should look for on my phone. I get a lot of spam calls... like, a LOT. Some days it's around 10 or so. I answer, listen for around 10 seconds, then hang up if nobody answers. I have never answered any call where anyone remotely shipping company-like has said anything (but lots about my car's warranty and Marriott hotels).

It is probably notable that my voice mail is f***ed up. I don't think it's working, though I didn't realize that until recently. I think I set it up wrong.

Today (11/27)  I got a physical letter from ABF, dated 11/20, saying they had been unable to contact me for delivery. I checked my phone logs against the phone number listed in the letter and saw a single phone call on 11/19. I wasn't expecting the stuff to even leave Wisconsin (or wherever) until 11/23, thinking it would then take a couple of days to arrive here. 11/23 was the ""shipping date"" when I last checked eplastUSA's site. 

ABF's letter informs me they are charging me $38/day warehousing until I fix this. That cost is now into the hundreds. This is officially the worst deal I've made on anything in the past several years (except my child, but she has non-monetary benefits). 

It is after hours on a Friday right now. I'll call first thing tomorrow (Saturday). I've emailed eplastUSA and ABF expressing my dismay at the unexpected charges, and suggesting to both parties that, given the huge delay in shipping, I might need to cancel my order completely and have it returned. At this point, the warehousing charges are in non-trivial territory for me; I have to think carefully about what's in my bank account, what goes on the card, etc. (though this won't bankrupt me or make me miss a house payment, thank heavens).

What options do I have? What advice does anyone have? If you just want to tell me I done fucked up, please keep it to yourself. However, if you want to say I done fucked up but then you have some suggestion for how to minimize the damage or fix things, I'm all ears (criticism and all).",finance

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Retirement Investing (Roth vs Traditional + Bitcoin IRA vs GBTC vs Checkbook IRA),"There's a lot of talk on this reddit about IRA crypto investing. Here's a comparison of different options based on my readings of various r/Bitcoin posts and external sites, and some spreadsheet calculations. 

Calculations assumptions:  


1. Traditional IRA money available for crypto investment: $100k
2. Annual return on BTC/crypto portfolio: 30%
3. Investment horizon: 20 years
4. Marginal income tax rate: 30%
5. Bitcoin IRA up-front fee: 10% (this can vary)
6. Bitcoin IRA annual custodial fees: $250
7. Bitcoin IRA withdrawal fee: 1%
8. Bitcoin IRA annual BitGo-related fees (.6%)
9. GBTC annual fee: 2%
10. Broad Financial Checkbook IRA annual fees: $300
11. Broad Financial Checkbook IRA up-front fees: $1,295  


**Roth Conversion vs Traditional IRA**

If you're contemplating converting your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA then investing funds in BTC or any crypto, you'll end up with the same amount at the end, but I think Roth wins the tie-breaker: 

* **Roth IRA:** If you started with a $100k Traditional IRA, if converted to a **Roth IRA**, then invested in Bitcoin, at the end of 20 years you'd have $13.3 million tax-free.   

* **Traditional IRA:** If you kept it in a **Traditional IRA** then invested in Bitcoin, you'd have $13.3 million after-tax after 20 years - same amount as with a Roth IRA conversion.   

* **Tie-breaker**: You should chose a Roth if you think your tax rate will be higher when you retire. Also, unlike Traditional IRAs, Roths do *not* require you to take annual distributions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin IRA vs GBTC vs Checkbook IRA**

If you're contemplating investing in Bitcoin using Bitcoin IRA vs buying GBTC with your IRA funds vs using a Checkbook IRA , I believe you'll get the best return using a Checkbook IRA, but it's not as easy to get into and manage vs the other two. 

* **Bitcoin IRA:** If you started with a $100k Traditional IRA and moved it to **Bitcoin IRA** and invested it in Bitcoin, at the end of 20 years you'd have \~$10.8 million in your Bitcoin IRA after up-front fees, annual fees, withdrawal fee and taxes.   
\* Bitcoin IRA offers the opportunity to earn interest by lending your crypto to institutional investors. Interest rates vary from 3-8%. Interest earned can more than offset all other fees (you'll have \~$14.7 million after tax assuming 3% annual compounded interest on portfolio).  

* **GBTC**: If instead you used the $100k to buy **GBTC**, you'd have \~$9.8 million in your account after annual fees and taxes. The 2% GBTC annual fee really hurts your compounding effects. GBTC is simple since it trades just like any stock, but that simplicity will cost you.  

* **Checkbook IRA:** If instead you moved your $100k to a **Checkbook IRA** (like one run by Broad Financial), and invested it in Bitcoin, at the end of 20 years you'd have \~$13 million in your Checkbook IRA after up-front fees, annual fees and taxes. This method allows you to own your own keys if you like (""nacho keys"" as I've read on this subreddit!) and invest your funds in other alternative investments, like real estate or private equity. I think you'd be able to lend your crypto here too using platforms like nexo.io.  
\* Checkbook IRAs do involve working with an entity like Broad Financial to create the LLC you'll need to hold your Self-Directed IRA (SDIRA) account. You'll also have to open a business account at an exchange to purchase your coin and a business bank account (more hoops to jump through vs non-business accounts). This options puts you completely in charge of your funds with no middle man.   
\* If you invest in something that doesn't qualify for SDIRA accounts, the IRS can deem your whole IRA as illegitimate and remove the IRA designation -  forcing you to pay income taxes on the entire amount.

personalfinance,Only 7 months into 30-year housing loan. From 3.25% to 2.625%. Is it too soon to refinance?,"I purchased my very first home approximately seven months ago at an interest rate of 3.25%. At the time, it was considered a really good rate in my area (Illinois, Will County). Now, everyone's talking about how the rates are hitting ""record lows"" and the six-month period of when we can refinance is up and now I'm starting to consider refinancing. Right now we have an offer for 2.625% at the usual 30-year fixed rate.

I did a little research and saw that if someone was to refinance, that the new rate should be about .5 to 1% lower. Is it as simple as that? We are barely half a year into our current 30-year loan, so I'm assuming the sooner we take advantage, the better the saving in the long run?

Hey y’all,

About 2.5 years ago, I put some money in a savings account, hearing it was a good idea.

Anyway, I did all the right things and calculated and paid my quarterly estimated payments. Tax season came around and, shocker, I ended up still owing. I paid what I was told. 

Fast forward to now, I've not had any tax issues until now. They are saying I didn't pay SE tax, and a few others.

Recently, he received a bill from FedEx in the amount of about $100.  He called the number in the letter, and they quite frankly were downright rude to him.  He gave me the letter, and I looked up the FedEx CS number on their website, which in fact matches the number in the letter.

I called them and received an explanation for the bill.  They claimed that a package was mailed from Tucson, AZ to Detroit, MI back in March and that the delivery charge was not paid.

I asked for their address, and I sent a debt validation letter.  A letter with a copy of the shipping label was sent back to him.  His name, address, and phone number were listed as the Sender.  His last name spelled wrong.  Also, he lives in Illinois, and has never been to Arizona.  The Recipient is a person my father does not know, in a state(Michigan) he has also never been to.  

FedEx says the labeled was printed online, and that the CC information given was invalid.  It was then dropped in a FedEx box in Arizona, where it was delivered to Detroit.  Tracking information shows the package arriving at the destination as listed on the shipping label.

Dad stated to FedEx that he did not ship the package, his last name is spelled wrong on the label, had no CC with the last 4 digits used, never been to Arizona, and doesn't know the recipient.  Despite this, they gave him a date of early December to pay the bill or face collections.

# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.
*****
&gt; Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday’s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.
*****
&gt; The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday’s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April’s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&amp;P 500 since its origin in 1957.
*****
&gt; November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.
*****
&gt; Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.
*****
&gt; “The death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn’t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.” Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.
*****
&gt; “We did not see major selling in Nasdaq,” as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.
*****
&gt; # Jobs report
&gt; There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday’s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.
*****
&gt; “My thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed’s minutes, they’re in transition here. They’re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.
*****
&gt; Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. “The employment data clearly has been weakening,” said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.
*****
&gt; Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.
*****
&gt; “It is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,” noted Simons.
*****
&gt; Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.
*****
&gt; Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.
*****
&gt; “The theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,” said Faranello. “The real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?”
*****
&gt; Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. “The question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,” she said. “I think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.” The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer
*****
&gt; Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.
*****
&gt; “We still see the Nasdaq leading,” said Krosby. “Whereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.”

&gt; # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined

&gt; December is now the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

&gt; In the last seventeen election years, December’s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&amp;P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000’s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.

&gt; # Sector Weights Rising and Falling

&gt; For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&amp;P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&amp;P 500 as shown in the charts below.

&gt; Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.

&gt; Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&amp;P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.

&gt; # A Month to Be Thankful For

&gt; Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.

&gt; Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**

&gt; Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**

&gt; There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.

&gt; # Biden - Best Since Reagan

&gt; The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&amp;P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&amp;P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&amp;P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.

&gt; On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&amp;P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.

&gt; In aggregate, the S&amp;P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&amp;P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&amp;P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.

&gt; # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds

&gt; What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.

&gt; The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.

&gt; Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.

&gt; # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

&gt; As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.

&gt; Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&amp;P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&amp;P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.

&gt; Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Let’s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the ‘40s the last time the S&amp;P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-3-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Let’s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-4-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Let’s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.”

&gt; The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-6-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the ‘average’ stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn’t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Let’s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-8-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into ’21, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn’t only about the US anymore.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-10-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days. This is extremely rare, yet, extremely bullish going out a year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-12-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As we showed in Frothy Sentiment Rides Bullish Technicals, the huge number of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 making new monthly highs should make bulls quite thankful.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-13-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Earnings are expected to see a major bounce back, as the global economy gets back online next year, making many investors quite thankful.

&gt; Economic forecasts may not develop as predicted.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the final reason to be thankful? Dow at 30,000!

personalfinance,Where to keep down payment cash? Savings account vs retirement accounts,"Hoping to get some advice on what to do with my cash. I have around $40k+ cash in a savings account yielding around .4%, 20k of which is an emergency fund I don't plan to move out. The rest is for a house down payment. I also have various investment accounts, one of which is my Roth IRA which currently sits around $110k (fed primarily by 401k rollovers).

I'd like to purchase a house in the next few years, but haven't solidified any plans as I'm comfortable renting currently and have been waiting for a drop in the housing market. As I have sufficient contributions in my Roth IRA which I could pull for an entire down payment if needed, is there any reason for me to hold cash past my emergency fund, other than potential market volatility?

Looking to choose between:

1. Keep DP in savings account. Funds stay liquid but don't have any growth potential. No impact from market volatility.
2. Move DP into 401k / IRAs. Funds gain growth potential, but I'd have to withdraw contributions from my Roth when time comes for down payment. Not concerned with market volatility impacting amount available.

I've been reading up recently on the ""Mega Backdoor Roth"" strategy, which is likely contributing to my leaning towards option #2 (although I have yet to confirm my current 401k would allow for it).

Any thoughts?",finance
Forex,Why Fundamentals Matter: Evidencing the value of Economics in Forex,"In my last comment on a post I wrote that I wish I knew that 5 factors (interest rate, bond yield, inflation, money supply and current account) drives any currency.

I got a lot of questions about that and now I want to show you all why you can put your technical approach to gamble with in the rubbish.

Currencies follow yields. More precise the real yield. International search of capital for profitable investment opportunities makes a currency rise or fall. The only measurement in value of a currency is its yield you get or pay if you borrow.

In my following example I analyse the United Kingdom and its Pound Index. The GBP you see is not only against the USD but all major currencies.

As you can see in the picture, the real yield (a calculation of the UK 10 years Bond Yield - Inflation (CPI)) determines where the Pound Index is heading with some exceptions. As I told earlier, there are more forces we have to consider.

On the first hint you can see that the real yield skyrockets up and the Currency Price doesn't follow. The reason is that there are other factors that drives the currency too. You also see that the money supply increases strongly too at that moment. As you know, more supply (in this example in money) means less in price (in this example the pound index). There is also very weak PMI data and the combination of strong increased money supply and strong drop in interest rate tells us there was a crisis that prevents GBP to rise despite the higher real yield. In times like this, higher yields are in demand when a country is in crises to compensate higher risk but this another story.

On the hint 2 you see that the strong drop in real yield doesn't force the GBP to fall. The reason is that the Current Account Balance strongly rises. Current account is the difference between all money flowing into the country in a particular period of time (e.g., a quarter or a year) and the outflow of money to the rest of the world. So if we see that more money is going into the country it means higher demand for that currency. At this time the money supply was just ranging. And as we know, more demand and ranging supply means higher prices.

Now it's your turn to convert this knowledge into a model which analyse all currencies with this approach and find the most attractive currency and the least one to trade in combination. You can set up a scoring-model for each country that evaluates these 5 factors and trade the highest scoring country against the lowest one.

The grey line on the first chart is the real yield when you calculate the 10y Bond Yield - 10y Inflation Linked Bond Yield when you want to get a sentiment of the inflation expectations from the markets without having to wait for the next CPI news which comes only once a month. But this is more advanced stuff you can ignore at this time hehe

If you have got a feeling for this approach you can go further with making bond yield expectations and inflation expectations etc.

Copper and Oil tells you how the Current Account Balance of Australia and Canada will be. Milk and the Fonterra stock is a good gauge for New Zealand. ABB, Alstom, Bachem, BASF are major exporters of Switzerland etc..

If you want to learn more about economics, I recommend you to read ""The Secrets of Economic Indicators: Hidden Clues to Future Economic Trends and Investment Opportunities"". Read the pages 1 - 29 Page. Page 13 and 14 tells you what bonds and currencies are most sensitive to. The other pages give you a very detailed information about any economic indicator out there. Just read the important ones for your trading. Just go find the book on the web hehe

Hopefully I could change your approach in trading to be a better trader in this game. Leave a like if you think this was helpful and ask me anything.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage programs for nurses,"My gf is a nurse and is thinking about buying a house in the next year or so. She has enough saved to put 20 percent down if she wants to but might put down less just to have more cash in hand.

We have recently heard about various assistance programs like the nurse next door program or EHHAF. https://www.teachernextdoor.us/NURSE

It seems like most of these programs give some kind of down payment assistance or can reduce pmi etc. Unfortunately it is hard to get any real info unless you really start talking to them which she isn't ready to do yet. 

I was wondering if anybody has used any of these programs and if they were worth it for you? I know sometimes for things like this you get some money up front but then end up with a higher interest rate which kind of cancels out the benefits.",finance
personalfinance,Car dealership ran credit without permission and financed loan through a bank I did not agree to,"At the end of October I bought my first car. I came in to the dealership pre-approved for an amount through Weokie. I was told by the bank I would have to close on the loan in one of their branches, since it was a special first time buyers loan, and to just explain that to the dealer. When I did the dealer explained to me that this wasn’t true and Weokie wanted me to close on the loan there so if i fell behind on payments they could seize all my assets instead of just the car. After hearing this I decided to proceed with closing on the loan at the dealership. A few minutes pass and they tell me they will have to pull my credit to find my loan at Weokie and that they will only pull my credit for Weokie. I tell them that’s fine, as long as it’s just the one bank because I don’t want the hard inquiries on my credit and they reassure me that it will be. When we’re closing on the loan they tried to sell me on using a Communication Federal and getting gap coverage. This gave me a better interest rate and I wouldn’t have to jump through the additional hoops that the Weokie was wanting me to to qualify for their first time buyer program. I looked up Communication Federal and saw that they opened up a new location that was less than 5 minutes from my house. I thought it was weird that I was able to be approved at this other place because I was told that they wouldn’t pull my credit for any other bank. But I agreed. 

As the month went on I got notified that I had 7 new hard inquiries on my account. Then in the mail I receive a letter from Wells Fargo telling me all the info on the new loan I have with them. There isn’t a Wells Fargo location in my state, and knowing this I would’ve never agreed to have my loan there. I’m just wondering what I can do now. Can I dispute the hard inquiries? Can I move my loan to a bank thats in my state? I haven’t made the first payment yet.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on debt before buying first home (33 yo breadwinner),"My apologies for the long wall of text forthcoming...

My wife and I will soon be moving for me to accept a promotion at work in late December or early January.  The plan is to buy a house as soon as possible before we move or after we arrive (we have the option to stay with a family member for a couple weeks if necessary). We have been talking about buying a house using an FHA loan for quite some time and have $10,000 set aside specifically for that purpose.  My concern is that my credit score is around 670 due to some credit card debt that I am carrying. I have just under $10,000 in credit card debt which I want to pay off ASAP before applying to prequalify for a mortgage loan as my credit should increase dramatically when doing so.
My plan was to take out a personal debt consolidation loan to pay off the credit card debt and help my credit score before applying.  My concern however is that my score will be affected by the hard inquiry on my credit, a new loan and my debt to income doesn’t change I just consolidate to one payment and have a lower interest rate.  The alternative I was thinking was to take a 401k loan on my account to pay off the debt as it won’t hurt my credit score and I pay the interest back to my 401k over the length of the loan.  The downside to this being that I miss out on that sweet sweet compounding interest and possibly gains.  Is the benefit to my credit for the purpose of buying the house worth it with a 401k loan?  Last option I thought of was to take 401k loan, get the house then take a personal loan to repay the 401k to avoid missing out on 401k benefits and still get the cards payed off using a personal loan long term.

Any advice is greatly appreciated and I can provide more info if needed.",finance

personalfinance,Roth IRA Certificates - interest rate vs. duration,"Hi all,

Besides my pension, I also have a Roth IRA to which I contribute $500 monthly ($6K yearly). (I believe that's the max for a Roth, yes?) Currently the interest rate is pretty poor (.1%), so what I've done over the last few years is every month or so open a Roth CD, which yields a higher return than the regular savings account pull the money from the savings account and put it into a CD.  Of course, whenever I do this I'm shown a list of various lengths of deposit and their respective rate of return.  I scan through it and think something along the lines of, ""if I leave my money in for 2 years instead of 1, I'll earn an extra .6% over the one-year CD.  But the 3-year CD earns only an extra .4% above the 2-year CD. Is the extra 12 months worth it?""

So that's my question: how can I determine the best rate for my CD?  I know that the longer the duration of the CD, the better the rate of return, but is there a point at which I can positively say that the small increase in return is NOT worth tying my money up for another year or 2 years?

Along the same lines. Is there a point at which an increased difference in interest rate would make it worthwhile to close several of my smaller Roth CDs, pay the 3-months interest penalty, and dump all the money into a higher yield Roth CD?

Edit: as I am still uninformed about some of thing you've suggested, what I'm trying to do is get a better return solely on the funds in my Roth savings account.  I'm open to options, but not take the money out of my Roth.  Are there other ways other than the aforementioned CDs?

personalfinance,A Couple Dependent Care FSA Questions,"So, we took our 2 daughters out of daycare mid March of this year because of COVID-19. My wife then got laid off about a month later and got a new job about a month after that. Her new employer offers an FSA for dependent care. It was early enough in the year that we figured our daughters would go back to daycare soon so we maxed out the contribution to $5,000 for the year thinking we'd have no problem hitting that once they go back. They never went back (and won't be going beck for the rest of the year).

**Question 1**: Can we get reimbursed for what we paid the daycare from January 1 2020 to mid March 2020 even though we didn't actually contribute to the FSA until June 2020? Is there a federal ""rule"" about this? Or does it depend on the plan and we need to ask the FSA administrator?

**Question 2**: If the answer to question 1 is that we can't get reimbursed...   
We've been paying our parents to watch the girls since taking them out of daycare. They are not a daycare, just grandparents. Can we get some kind of invoice from them and then get reimbursed from that? Knowing, of course, they'd need to pay income tax on what we paid them.",finance
dogecoin,Will DOGE ever be capped again?,"I was reading that DOGE was initially capped (like BTC?) at 100 Billion DOGE, but that was changed to in 2014. According to the Ledger website:

“Whereas most crypto currencies take a deflationary or minimalistic inflationary approach to their monetary policy, Dogecoin is perpetually inflationary. A fresh 10,000 DOGE is created per block at a decreasing annual rate. There is roughly 120 billion DOGE currently in circulation, surpassing the initial cap of 100 billion that was changed to an uncapped design in 2014 by Palmer.”

Assuming all of this is accurate, and while approaching crypto through the lens of Macroeconomics 101: should I consider DOGE and BTC to be quite different assets?

Based on my current understanding, BTC is 1) medium of exchange, 2) unit of account, 3) store of value. DOGE is just 1) medium of exchange. 

I’ve just begun my journey into crypto currencies [well, I’ve finally stopped buying on Robinhood for giggles and I’m now taking it more seriously]. My main goal with DOGE is to hold coins in cold storage (just incase), and keep some in a hot wallet so I can tip fellow Inu.

personalfinance,The elephant in the room,"It's been 1 year since the birth of my sweet daughter. Her grandmother gave her a ceramic pink elephant bank. Every paycheck my wife and I stuff money into the elephant. A year later the elephant is full.

personalfinance,"Financial planning for 2021, am I missing something?","So I am starting to plan for next year, setting a list of the things I want to accomplish. This year I worked on a savings goal for a good emergency fund. I have successfully saved about 7 or 8 months of living expenses. Right around $15k. The only debt that I have is my truck. I currently owe about $13.1k on it, and it is worth about 19k. My current savings plan is pretty aggressive, mostly so I could hit my savings goal. I will reduce this for 2021 to pay off my truck this coming year. I want to pay a grand a month. Since I get paid every two weeks I get two paychecks ""extra"" per year that do not have any bills attached. This will help me get it done in 2021. 

My main decision is, do I go ahead and use what I have saved to pay off the truck now, or continue to save a bit while also paying it down in chunks? My interest rate is 4.4%. 

I calculated what I would have in savings at the end of 2021, and it comes out to be about the same amount. Right now, I am saving $900 a month. If I pay it off in $1k chunks my savings will decrease to about $400 a month. However, if I pay it off right now, starting in January my savings will be $1400 per month. Employment is pretty stable so I am not too concerned, as I would be able to build back my emergency fund pretty quickly.

investing,Impact of debt repurchase on leverage,"Hi folks, 
The corporate bond market has seen a wave of refinancing whereby companies that issued debt  back in March 2020 at very high coupons are calling these issues and issuing new bonds at much lower rates. How does this affect the balance sheet and leverage ratios?

It seems to me that if a company issued a $100 bond at par, we would see $100 in assets and 100 in liabilities. We would also see a 100 flow in the cash flow from financing.

Let’s say that the company calls those bonds at $150 because rates and spreads are now very much lower. Let’s further say that they borrow this $150 from the bond market. In this case, we would now have 150 in assets, 150 in liabilities, and a net cash from financing flow of 150-100 = 50. There would be no expense on the income statement immediately, but going forward the interest expense would be lower as rates are now very much lower. This reduction in interest rates and interest expense is why a company would refinance in the first place, even though the balance sheet now looks more leveraged with 150 in debt.

Is this accurate? Any thoughts",finance
personalfinance,Got an inheritance and new job at the same time. Is it worth rushing that money into a roth so I can max my 2020 contributions?,"Hi guys.  I'm 29, single, male, and live in an expensive east cost city in the USA. I just inherited 15K. I currently have about 2k in checkings and exactly 3k in savings, and that's it. No retirememt account or investments. No debts, though. I'm about to start my first ""real"" job after finishing grad school, getting 81,050/year and also the typical suite of federal US govt employee benefits, primarily good healthcare. That job starts in about 10 days and the first paycheck will come about two weeks after that (assuming everything goes smoothly). My expenses are 1650/month for apartment + parking, 320/month for car lease, and about 160/month for car + renters insurance. I just started the apartment/car lease after I signed the job offer. Before that, I was back at my parents, although from 2015-2019 I was living in a different expensive city doing graduate school. Additionally I have been recieving 500/month (after tax) due to a different inheritance from 2016. I have no idea when this money will run out, but I estimate roughly 9-12 more months.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I should rush that 15K (or as much as I'm allowed to) into a roth or something, since I haven't made any money this year (but start a fairly well paid job in early Dec) and want to max my contributions? Or should I keep it as an emergency fund, since I don't have much on hand? I don't really know how to start a roth either. Do I need to negotiate anything, like a percentage? Can a banker take advantage of me by offering a bad deal? I don't know much about this kind of thing. I asked somebody at Chase, where I have a debit and credit card, what the maximum is to use a roth, and he said 125k. I doubt I'll be making that much for a few years, if ever. So I want to set up one while I can. I asked what the most I can contribute in one year was, and he said he'd get back to me. This was before I found out about the inheritance, I was mostly asking becuase of planning on contributing from my salary. I was supposed to start early Nov, but it was pushed to early Dec. I'm confident it won't get pushed again.

solarenergy,[Ultimate Guide] Should I Install Solar on My Home?,"# Intro &amp; About Me  [👋](https://emojipedia.org/waving-hand/)   

Hello. I'm Josh Lapin, and I founded [SkyCapSolar](https://skycapsolar.com).  My company provides free, online solar power consultations to homeowners in [32 states](https://skycapsolar.com/areas-we-serve/).  After meeting with hundreds of families across the country, I've decided to write a guide that addresses the most common considerations that people have when deciding whether or not to put solar panels on their home. 

This guide does NOT replace meeting with a solar energy expert to build a solar power proposal tailored to your unique energy needs and personal solar goals. After reading this, if you decide you like me and want a free one-on-one online solar consultation with me, you should check to see if we [service your state](https://skycapsolar.com/areas-we-serve/), and then [schedule a free consultation.](https://skycapsolar.com/schedule-consultation/)

# What State Do You Live In? [🇺🇸](https://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%B8/)

The state that you live in has a dramatic effect on whether or not you should install solar on your home.  

First, some states receive way more irrandiance \[sunlight\] than others. For example, It's obvious that California receives more sun than North Dakota, etc.  The amount of sun that your panels receive dramatically shifts the amount of panels you need, the cost of the system, the 25-year-savings, and the break-even point on your system.

Second, different states have different net metering policies.  Understanding Net Metering is Critical to understand how residential \[or commerical\] solar works for you and your home. I recommend watching [this short video from energysage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wId3Llpr4ZM&amp;ab_channel=EnergySage)  State net metering policies can require your power utility to offer full Net-Metering to their customers, which significantly impacts the financial analysis of your solar power system.

Third, some states offer incentives or tax credits to people who install solar panels on their home.  For example, [South Carolina currently offers a 25% State Tax Credit](https://skycapsolar.com/2020/11/15/installing-solar-panels-on-your-south-carolina-home-or-business/) to customers that install solar on their home. In addition to the 22% Federal Tax Credit for 2021, that's a whopping 47% off of your solar power installation!  (Disclaimer: Consult your CPA or Account to determine eligibility for Federal or State Tax Credits, I am not a CPA or Accountant.)

# Who is Your Power Utility? [⚡](https://emojis.wiki/high-voltage/)[🔌](https://emojipedia.org/electric-plug/)[⚡](https://emojis.wiki/high-voltage/)[🔌](https://emojipedia.org/electric-plug/)

The two most important factors pertaining to your utility are:

Does Your Utility Offer Net Metering?

What is your current electric rate?

If your power utility charges you a very low rate for electricity (for example, [Lower Valley Electric in Wyoming](https://www.lvenergy.com/)), then it's possible that the payoff for solar is infeasible, and you're better-off sticking with you great electric rates with your utility.  

If your power utility charges a high rate for electricity (11c/kWh or more) for example, [IREA in Colorado](https://irea.coop/)   
or [Southern California Edison in California](https://www.sce.com/), then it's likely that your solar power system will generate a great financial return!

I personally ensure that my customers power utility rates AND utility net metering policy are properly accounted for when generating solar proposals, a step that is so often overlooked...or even maliciously modified to exaggerate savings and production of the system!

&amp;#x200B;

# Which way does your roof face? [🏠](https://emojipedia.org/house/)

In America (and [anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere](https://news.energysage.com/solar-panel-performance-orientation-angle/) for that matter), it's most efficient to install solar panels on a South-facing Roof.  East&amp;West can also work well, although it may be 10-15% less efficient depending on which state you live in.  North, however, is never a good option for solar panels, and receives far less sun than other directions.

If your roof is bad for solar, it may make sense for you to look into a ground-mounted system (putting solar panels in the ground instead). With groundmounts, we can face the panels exactly 180 degrees south and tilt them at the most efficient angle.

# How Long Will You Live in Your Home?[🕒](https://emojipedia.org/three-oclock/)[⏳](https://emojipedia.org/hourglass-not-done/)[🕒](https://emojipedia.org/three-oclock/)[⏳](https://emojipedia.org/hourglass-not-done/)

The #1 reason I have seen people decide against putting up solar panels, is because they are going to move in the next 7 years, or because they are unsure of their future plans.  Depending on many factors, it generally takes between 9-15 years for your solar power system to pay for itself, so it's understandable that some people decided against putting up the system if they're going to leave before that.

One counter to this concern, however, is the beauty of [transferable solar loans](https://www.joinmosaic.com/2019/01/29/2019-1-29-selling-a-home-with-solar-panels/).  Most people go solar for $0 down, with a low interest rate and fixed monthly payments similar to what they used to pay for electricity!  With a transferable solar loan, you can pay monthly towards your solar power system, and then with a like-minded buyer of your home you can arrange for the loan obligation to be transferred to them...and it's off your hands!  This recently made a huge difference for one of my customers in Castle Rock, Colorado, that is going to move in six years but still decided to go solar with a transferable solar loan.

If you are interested in getting a solar proposal and speaking with an expert, I would be happy to meet with you via Zoom Meeting for a free, one-on-one consultation.  I'll design a solar power system for you, and answer each of your questions to your satisfaction! [Just fill this out and I'll see you soon!](https://skycapsolar.com/schedule-consultation/)

personalfinance,Can’t get vehicle loan,"Hey all, I’m having a tough time obtaining a vehicle loan. I have a BoA credit card that I use every month ~1- 3k on random misc items and I always pay it off on time every month. My FICO score is 800 and I can not for the life of me get a vehicle loan! I just graduated college and want to purchase a graduation gift for myself so my buddy is asking 40k for his vehicle and every single bank that I contact won’t give me a loan because I don’t have enough “credit history.” I have 0 debt coming out of college, absolutely no bills, and my previous vehicles were all purchased in cash. How would I proceed with making progress on my credit history by owing money on something “major” if they won’t give me a loan on something in the first place?! I honestly just want to build my credit up so I told the banks that I will put 20-35k cash down and ask for the remaining amount on a loan so that I can start to have a credit history and they denied me. My monthly income more than supports any monthly payment that they have told me but they refuse to give a loan because of no credit history..

EDIT: I’m not sure why people are sorta giving me a hard time. I’m only curious as to why the bank won’t give me a loan and seeking advice on how to build credit. I know that purchasing a used vehicle is not a smart idea. Yes 40k for a used vehicle is expensive but I can find a stock vehicle and dump more money than the asking price of my buddies vehicle. I don’t need a daily driver since I already have one that is paid off. I’m just looking for a weekend car.


EDIT 2: I received the loan with a co-signer. Interest rate is 2.31% through Wells Fargo. For all of you said “iTs iMpOsSiBle or this is a troll post,” this is me telling you that it’s doable. For future people who may stumble upon my situation, PLEASE think about opening other lines of credit perhaps other credit cards if you’re responsible enough. I have an 798 credit score upon graduating college since I pay off everything on time and utilize my credit card (but definitely don’t max it!). If your bank is declining you because you “have insufficient credit,” you can avoid this by opening other lines of credit. Thanks!",finance

Hey everyone and Welcome so let’s start with the recap of what has happened in the stock market since Monday.

Monday the [DOW](https://ibb.co/ryHzJ3C) rose by more than 1,12% with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/PG8CcgX) also gaining more than half a percent while the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/Qfwj6QX) was the laggard barely up 0,2% to finish the day while The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SdCNtBZ) had another big drop closing at 22.2. About 70% of the companies were gaining while 80% were trading over 50 and 200-day moving averages. The stock market was lead by the energy sector, which saw a major spike of almost 5% with Financials and Industrials also up more than 1% for the day. The rally was pushed mostly by small and mid-cap value stocks while large-cap growth companies were lagging as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Kbvv08B) with the biggest company in the world, Apple, dragging down the sector, down almost 3% for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/LSxy7Mj) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZHYXxRW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/pynTjjH)

Reports also came in on Monday that the PS5 and the new xBox have been sold out the moment they are available in stock, as the two gaming consoles are enjoying great demand, this bolds well for the parent companies Sony and Microsoft especially if they can keep up with the demand for this holiday season including Black Friday, holiday [RETAIL SALES](https://ibb.co/J2vDV3F) are forecasted to rise between 3,6 and 5,2%. [XBOX &amp; PS5 NEWS](https://ibb.co/qFMvRz5)

All this while Europe will start to re-open again after a contraction of the economy due to the latest lockdowns. As they saw the Eurozone PMI falling by almost 4% in October. [EUROZONE NEWS](https://ibb.co/8DFqbd7)

Some good news came from [STORE CAPITAL](https://ibb.co/rHy6pGj) as the rent collections for November remained at 90% with no new tenants requiring deferrals, this suggests that companies are managing to survive even with the current restrictions in place.

We also saw reports that Janet Yellen will be the next Treasury pick as she would become the first person to be at the top of the FED the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury and she will become the first woman to lead the Treasury. [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/bRyZk8G)

Moving on, Tuesday we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/K0SW54V) spike more than 1,5%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/8j7WcXs) rising 1,6% and the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/S7D4MJ3) up more than 1,3% in what was a very good day for the stock market with more than 70% of companies advancing and 167 new highs on above average volume. The leaders were once again Energy and Financials, as this 2 sectors, will be two of the fastest benefiting from the end of the pandemic. The rally was continued with value companies leading the way for the 2nd straight day. You can struggle to find red spots in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/FgNk2rg)  from Tuesday but there were a few in healthcare and real estate. This was the first time that the [DOW](https://ibb.co/C7dYJVD) closed over 30k. [CHART](https://ibb.co/FHmJRYw) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/C2WXYW6) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/S5DbTNV)

[NIKOLA](https://ibb.co/M15WTJ4) stock tumbled after the recent rally as the GM deal seems less likely every day, as the deadline for the deal is December 3rd.

While October [HOME SEARCHES](https://ibb.co/8PVX9KT) surged over 200% as a Redfin report shows, this leads me to believe that the strong housing demand will keep remaining at this levels for a good period of time. 

On Wednesday we saw the stock market take a breather, as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/0f0Xt8g) lost 0,6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/LYdGYSz) lost 0,16% while the pandemic plays regained some momentum with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/37Y7qGX) being up almost half a percent before the stock market closed for Thanksgiving.

About 54% of companies were losing ground with below average volume for the day, as Technology and consumer discretionary and staples were the gainers for the day. Value plays did see some normal corrections after the huge gains in the last days as investors were cashing out some money probably before the day off.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PDyDqBb) from Wednesday as only a couple of companies Like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Shopify were gaining, while the energy sector was the biggest laggard.

Also the AAII investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/CM9RsDQ) from Wednesday showed that people are getting more bearish or bullish as the neutral feeling fell way below the historical average as bullishness remains very high. This is usually a contrarian indicator, as more bullishness gives me reason to take profits and bearishness to invest in the stock market, though I don’t have the same confidence in this as in the past, as I expect this market rally to last until the end of next year.

News came in from Delta Airlines as pilots approved pay cuts and lower guaranteed hours that could avoid more than 1700 pilots getting cut off. This are great news both for the company and the pilots, as air travel will pick up again in the next years. [DELTA NEWS](https://ibb.co/PmHQMDf)

Also, Deere reported blowout [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/z4C2L6S) and a beat of more than 1$ per share and a revenue only 0,6% below last year while also issuing strong 2021 forecasts as they see the equipment sales climbing more than 10% compared to 2020 with a strong net income guidance of 3,6 to 4 billion $ compared to the May guidance of 1,6 to 2 billion $. [4Q 2020](https://ibb.co/FKNjHKs) / [2021](https://ibb.co/PT8GhBW)

We closed the week on a short day on Friday as the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/8PXVwTT) led the way up 0,93%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6Pgyrd9) up 0,24% and the [DOW](https://ibb.co/82j8ft0) barely up 0,13%. As we saw about 55% of the companies advancing on way below average volume due to the short day of trading with 85% of companies trading below average volumes. Friday was a pretty divided day as Health Care and Tech lead the way while Utilities and Energy saw a slight pullback after the big gains this week. [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/s3n9Sdb) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/Ldx38vW) / 

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TggK0j5) from Friday as we see that the market was dragged higher by the big tech companies and communication services while the rest of the market was pretty much lagging.

So for the week, the Nasdaq lead the way up 3% and closed at the 45th record of 2020, the SP followed up 2,3% and closed a 26th record of the year with the DOW also rising 2% in this shortened week. While the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n6M1Z9k) closed the week just below 21, at the lowest level since February.

So great signs for the recovery of the economy still popped up almost every day, as the stock market is more forward looking than it is a reflection of the current economic conditions. As November will likely be the 7th straight month of job gains, though they will be the fewest in number since the recovery of jobs has begun. [NOVEMBER JOBS](https://ibb.co/ZVMDxtr)

Also, Bitcoin has seen its price drop from almost all-time highs at 19,5k down more than 3k before bouncing back to around 17k. The cryptocurrency was due for a correction as it had seen a huge rally in since Labor Day and this correction came as news popped of the Treasury attempting to rush out regulation on crypto-wallets. This would be a big negative factor for people who own Bitcoin not for just it’s value but for using it also. But we will have to wait and see as the Treasury boss will be replaced when the Presidency changes. [BITCOIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/FhpVSjC) / [BITCOIN CHART](https://ibb.co/myVqJzN)

Some company news from Friday were that [PALANTIR](https://ibb.co/hDMN8vz) saw it’s stock plunge from all time high of 33,5$ to 27,6$ after Citron tweeted that they are shorting the stock with a 20$ price target. This are common tactics that short sellers use in my opinion to get the fast results they expected.

Also, Tesla has seen a huge spike in the last weeks since the SP500 news, and the stock might see another spike as Musk [TWEETED](https://ibb.co/qyLQXRp) that the full self-driving feature will be released wider in the next weeks as the company finally approaches the end of software development as they collect more and more data. Tesla has surpassed Berkshire and is now the 6th largest company in the US as the stock is up more than 600% year to date making Elon Musk the second richest person in the world behind only Bezos. The company will go into the SP500 index at about 80% of its total market value cap as the index only counts the free-floating shares. I believe we won’t see such a big spike in price when the company will be added to the SP in December, just like it happened with the stock split its more of a buy the news sell the event type of thing. As I expected the stock jumped over the previous all time highs and it might see a little correction when the event actually happens, but in the long run this a company that I will continue to own in my portfolio.

Next week we will have some interesting earnings reports that I expect to beat the estimates from companies like [NEXT WEEK EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/6yNcM9m)

[AUTOHOME](https://ibb.co/nQ08V04) which is a company that has great potential as it trades at a low P/E, they offer leads and services for auto consumers in China and they have a very wide consumer base to spread to.

With [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/br3pPJC) also expecting to report on Monday after the close, I recently just sold out of my position in Zoom. I think there is too much positive expectations for the company as it trade at almost 200 times earnings per shares.

Also, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/D5dwYYW) are expected to announce earnings on Tuesday, as the company saw it’s stock tumble after the news of a possible acquiring of Slack. In the long run that will be a very good play for the company as they have continued to buy more and more companies that allows them to keep growing.

Other companies that are reporting and are very interesting to watch are [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/X3YBpqN) and [OKTA](https://ibb.co/rGLJtPW) also on Tuesday with [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/vvmSw3p) , [Dollar General](https://ibb.co/23YQzcg), [Marvell](https://ibb.co/nfbYcgG) and Snowflake reporting on Wednesday.

Good news came this Saturday for online retailers as sales jumped more than 20% on Black Friday and are expected to grow between 15 and 35% tomorrow as Cyber Monday may set a new record for online sales.  [RETAIL EXPECTATIONS](https://ibb.co/QFbmcPD)

Here are the most important economic data that we are looking for in the next week as it will be a week full of numbers that may impact how the stock market reacts in the near future.

EURJPY- Daily downtrend ended on 2020/05/15 in which it started doing HH and LH.As of now, I expect a sustained uptrend (Reached and reacted to the monthly fibo retracement) breaking out the weekly trendlines with a possibility of reaching 130.000 if momentum is strong enough.I would be looking for a breakout at the lower timeframe (1hr/4hr) for entry confirmation if we broke 125.000.

Fundamentals;

EUR-  The euro retains a leading role in G10 positioning, and is proving once again quite resilient to some mounting idiosyncratic risks: sharply rising infections, fresh lockdown measures, and the EU Recovery Fund in jeopardy.

JPY- We remain less constructive on the performance of JPY relative to other G10 peers due to our expectation for the relative real rate differentials to favor a more range-bound path. Ultimately, with the BoJ to remain reactive, not proactive, in their MoPo efforts, Fed policy will be the most important factor in determining the outlook for JPY.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

In this case, I would be looking for a breakout on lower timeframes (1HR/4HR), since this level has been broadly ""problematic"" I will wait for strong fundamentals to give fuel and momentum.

If we broke the level 1.20 with strong momentum I would be looking towards the 1.25 level.

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentals;

&amp;#x200B;

EUR- At a time where US real yields are rising more than Bund yields, this

could lead to investors taking profits on existing longs, keeping spot

moves locked in the narrow 1.16-1.20 range held since summer.

However, A Biden presidency and loose Fed likely keeps the USD

weak versus its major trading partners. We expect the global growth

backdrop to materially improve next year and experience less trade

friction, EUR positive

&amp;#x200B;

USD- There will be no rush to remove the loose fiscal/ loose monetary mix

support in our view. As summer data trends decelerate, further Fed

support for real rates markets will be increasingly likely in our view,

keeping the current USD trend lower intact.

• The Fed will likely also be keeping an eye on the trajectory of USD

real yields. If $ real yields, from intentionally suppressed levels, rise

too far, too fast, this may unwind all of the “good work” achieved so far.

Therefore the Fed’s shift to average inflation targeting allows it the

flexibility to keep policy dovish.",finance
investing,Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox,"December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

 They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%  
Net loss: $149 million

[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

## Wish (ContextLogic)

Symbol: WISH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  
Revenue growth: 32%  
Gross margin: 65%  
Net loss: $176 million

[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish’s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.

**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish’s business with new rules or requirements.

personalfinance,Is using Worthy Bonds like a savings account a bad idea?,"I am accumulating a sizable amount of savings and want to put it in an interest-bearing savings account, but the rates are pretty crap at the moment. Worthy Bonds have been suggested to me and after doing some research about them, they seem like a solid investment at a 5% return. The money invested can, apparently, be withdrawn at any point and you keep the interest.

Would it be a bad idea to buy these bonds and treat them as a savings account? I want to be able to withdraw my money at any moment in case of emergencies, but otherwise I would leave the money in there indefinitely so it can compound. I know the interest rate for savings accounts will go back up, but even on good years I don't think they get near the 5% Worthy Bonds offers. Any input would be greatly appreciated!",finance
Bitcoin,Deep in the rabbit hole: Bitcoin is a living organism,"One of the primary thesis that sets the groundwork of Richard Dawkin's ""The Selfish Gene"" is the idea that Genes are the living organisms while we, the animal/species are simply a container for the Gene. The Gene uses the container as its agent and the rules of evolution to continue surviving. Our genes outlive us. You carry within you, Genes that are as modern as a few hundred years old and as old as a billion years old. Some of them are responsible for the most basic animalistic functions while others are more interested in the higher order functions of intelligence. All of them have perfected a greater system of survivability than you, a container of exoskeleton, carbon and water that decomposes rather quickly.

You can kill other human beings but you can never destroy the human genome. Only a major external calamity can destroy all genes, instantly. They must all be snuffed out immediately if they are to be truly destroyed. And this is hard given how well they have perfected survivability.

In this theory, I find similarities of Bitcoin.

The proponents of Bitcoin understand something instinctually : you cant shutdown Bitcoin because it simply incentivizes someone else to join the network. Similarly, a large dump of Bitcoin suddenly makes it quite attractive for a new whale to rearrange their finances in a way that takes advantage of a decentralized asset. In this manner Bitcoin has gone from $0 to $20,000 in a short 10 years. 

The simple minded argument against Bitcoin, ""We will shut it down"" / ""We will ban it"", is laughable.

***What*** exactly will you shutdown?

***How*** do you ban something that simultaneously exists everywhere &amp; nowhere?

Bitcoin is in fact a living creature in the digital world that is in itself an ethereal space with no basis in reality. Yes, physical wires connect the digital space, but many parts of the internet &amp; Bitcoin included are not dependent on these wires for restarting where they left off. If you shutdown the internet/Bitcoin, it can be restarted. The entire blockchain &amp; the software is but Speech: information. At its most extreme it can be printed on several reams of paper if it satisfies you to see it in physical manifestation.[An interesting digression here is the recognition by United States that open source software is equivalent to speech in the Bernstein vs United States lawsuit concerning the software that made up PGP encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/remembering-case-established-code-speech)

&gt;*This court can find no meaningful difference between computer language, particularly high-level languages as defined above, and German or French....Like music and mathematical equations, computer language is just that, language, and it communicates information either to a computer or to those who can read it...*

The genius of Bitcoin is the idea that for the first time we have created self-replicating information that incentivizes us, to keep it alive.

The nodes &amp; operators of Bitcoin are not Bitcoin. They are simply the agents that have a real incentive to keep this animal alive. The incentives available to nodes &amp; operators are also available to nation states, regulatory bodies. 

There is nothing to gain by banning / outlawing Bitcoin other than ***shifting the incentive*** to someone else. Now which smart person would want that?

personalfinance,Traditional 401(k) versus Roth 401(k),"Looking for advice.  Here’s my situation:

I am 45 years old and looking to retire by the age of 60.  I currently make $120,000 annually.  I also have rental income that brings in a total of $30,500 annually.  All my living expenses total just under $4,000 per month.  

My employer gives me the option to invest in a Traditional 401(k) and/or a Roth 401(k).  Each year I contribute the max to the Traditional 401(k); I have a total of $60,000 in it.  My employer matched at 5%. 

I also have a Traditional IRA with a total of $500,000 as well as a Roth IRA with a total of $259,000.  Each year I contribute the max to my Traditional IRA.  

Moreover, I have an HSA with a total of $11,600; each year I contribute the max to this account.  

I also have an employee stock purchase plan with a total of $26,000.  I contribute to this account too.  

Finally, I have a mutual fund totaling $54,000.  I contribute roughly $2,000 per month to this mutual fund.  

Combined, all of these accounts total $910,000.  I have all this money invested in low-cost index funds with Vanguard and Fidelity.  I will continue contributing the max to these accounts and keep them in index funds. 

As for real estate, I own a rental property whose mortgage was paid off in 2014. I receive $2,546 per month in rental income.  The annual property tax is $9,800.  Maintenance costs have been low for my rental property.  I have been renting out this property for six years and will continue to rent it out for at least four more years.  I might sell it after that. 

Last thing: I invested $2,500 in Bitcoin and have seen that grow to $3,500 as of yesterday.  I will not invest more than $10,000 annually in Bitcoin — that is my limit. 

I live in NYC.  Besides Federal Tax, I also pay NY state and NYC city tax. My marginal federal tax rate in 2020 is 24%; my effective federal tax rate is 12%.  My effective state tax rate is 8%.  I am single and a major saver — I invest my savings.  I do NOT spend lavishly.  

Here is my question: Going back to my 401(k), should I contribute to my Traditional 401(k) or should I contribute to my Roth 401(k)?  Or should I do a split?  I have no idea what tax rates will be in the future, and I don’t plan to spend lavishly in the future.  I also want to keep my tax burden as low as possible for the rest of my life.  Keep in mind that I do pay federal, state and city taxes.  

Also, do you think I’m on track to retire by 60?  Do you think I can retire by 55?  Anything I should be doing differently?  

I appreciate any insights.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst many foreign investors have been captivated by Chinese equities, including stocks of Chinese companies listed in China or Hong Kong as well as in the US, fewer investors have turned their attention to China's debt markets. A reason for this is that it was relatively difficult to invest in Chinese fixed income until the expansion of [CIBM Direct](https://www.investorinsights.asia/cnglossary) in 2016 and the launch of [Bond Connect](https://www.investorinsights.asia/cnglossary) in 2017, although the Chinese government and regulators have increasingly opened up foreign access to the country's bond markets in the past few years. Moreover, the establishment of these schemes has contributed to the inclusion of Chinese government bonds in major global indices starting in 2019, whilst the relatively high yields of Chinese sovereign bonds are continuing to attract more and more investors from across the globe as large degrees of monetary easing and low to negative interest rates are becoming the norm in major economies.

&amp;#x200B;

As of the end of 2019, the US is still leading the global bond market, with a market size of US$41.2 trillion. The EU27 countries follow with a combined bond market size of US$21.8 trillion, although taken at the individual country level, the Chinese bond market is the second largest in the world at US$14.7 trillion (approximately RMB99 trillion). The Chinese bond market has overtaken Japan's bond market in size since 2019.

Bitcoin,Do you think Brian Armstrong is collaborating with the government to drop the price of BTC?,"Maybe it's to scare off investors with potential regulatory issues, and then have the fed tagged along with all the big banks scoop up BTC as fast as they can at a discount. I'm sure hedge fund managers are getting calls right now saying they need to accumulate this asset, and still need to profit. I'm sure they're freaking out. This happened in China. They pulled the exact same stunt. I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist, but I believe that we have to be pretty naive to think that government and wall street are going to stand on the sidelines as this new asset completely disrupts the entire global monetary system. I expect a bumpy road. I expect the US to scare people out of bitcoin by threats of banning it, or regulating it to a point where there's no longer incentive to own it. After they gain enough control over it, then they will advertise it as something positive to the public. The very reason as to why Bitcoin was created was because Satoshi saw what happened during the housing collapse of 2008. Self intertest is what drives the global economy. Right now, they are incentivized to act in the way I'm suggesting. Thoughts?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Need help figuring out my student debt,"Hi guys - I'm looking for some advice. Undergrad ended up costing me a pretty penny of around $90,000 in loans. Some are federal/government, some are through the university I attended and I also pulled out a few personal loans.

personalfinance,Don't accept PayPal for FB Marketplace or local transactions!,"I consider myself a fairly scam aware guy. Normally if I'm not sure of a certain payment method, I just look it up and see if there are any prior stories. I've sold a lot of stuff. I thought I was safe, but of course I apparently screwed up.

I listed an expensive item on Facebook Marketplace for about $2000. I had someone message me about it, asking if he could pay via PayPal F&amp;F and asked for my e-mail address. I initially said I would accept F&amp;F, but after reading the ToS and reading about chargeback scams, I figured I'd be safe and go with Goods and Services. I let him know this, and he was fine with that. We agreed on a meetup place and time (a public place). He then sent payment immediately, with a random emoji in the description. He also had his address included, which is where my screw up apparently started, but I didn't realize at the time. I was suspicious, so I did some investigating, and see that someone had called him a ""scammer."" I asked him about this, but he fed me some story about a buyer being unhappy with the a sale because of the payment method, which was likely a false story. I wasn't really comfortable continuing with the transaction, and would've cancelled and refunded him. The problem is, with PayPal's recent changes, if you want to refund a customer a Goods and Services transaction, you have to pay the 2.9% cut that PayPal takes. So as uncomfortable with the transaction as I was, I decided to go through with it because I didn't want to be out $60. I also definitely had the money in my account, and it wasn't some sort of fake PayPal e-mail scam. I chose to record the entire transaction so I'd have proof of delivery if he tried anything with PayPal, and I had seller protection from PayPal to protect me.

I meet up with the guy at the agreed time and place. I'm taking proper COVID precautions, wearing a mask and using sanitizer, but he's not wearing a mask. I know I should've insisted he put one on, but I was honestly relieved, because if he was trying to steal from me or pull a scam, he'd be wearing a mask, right? Perfect way to hide your identity, and I'm recording the entire transaction. I give him the product, and have him give me a call to make sure he's the same person I was talking to on FB marketplace. We part ways. Immediately afterwards, as I try to confirm the sale with him via Facebook Marketplace, I see that he's blocked me.

I'm now extremely nervous, and I contact PayPal repeatedly, asking them what I should be doing to make sure that my money is safe, and they never give me a proper response. 3 days later, the transaction is in dispute because he filed a chargeback, and I can't access the money. I upload exactly what happened, along with chats and texts we sent, along with the video I took of the transaction. After several fruitless phone calls and chats, a month later, this morning I'm told that the money has been removed from my PayPal account because I didn't provide proof of shipment. I filed a police report shortly after I was hit by the chargeback, but didn't pursue it aggressively because it was still in dispute. At this point, I'm not really sure what to do. 

As for others making local transactions? I'd avoid PayPal entirely, even though Facebook themselves recommend it. Just use Zelle, or plain old hard, cold cash. Have the buyer look at the item in person If you need to use PayPal don't give your e-mail address, and don't accept it like I did. Get their e-mail and send an invoice via PayPal, although I'm still not even sure that you'll be protected even then. I know I technically screwed up, but what PayPal did felt very predatory to keep their fees and not provide protection.

EDIT: PayPal Friends &amp; Family has even less protection. If the buyer files a chargeback like you have here, you have no chance at seller protection; you just lose the money.

EDIT 2: People telling me I’m dumb and should’ve known this was a scam; I’m not looking for people to feel bad for me. I’m posting this because I checked this subreddit ahead of time, and didn’t see anyone post about this type of scam before. [It’s also not mentioned on Facebook’s tips for selling safely](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/learn-more/safety/) nor is it mentioned on the [common PayPal scams page linked in that page](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/security/common-scams/). Being scammed doesn’t mean I screwed up, it means I was taken advantage of. Don’t want people to make the same mistake of using PayPal like I did.",finance
retirement,Traditional 401(k) versus Roth 401(k),"Looking for advice.  Here’s my situation:

I am 45 years old and looking to retire by the age of 60.  I currently make $120,000 annually.  I also have rental income that brings in a total of $30,500 annually.  All my living expenses total just under $4,000 per month.  

My employer gives me the option to invest in a Traditional 401(k) and/or a Roth 401(k).  Each year I contribute the max to the Traditional 401(k); I have a total of $60,000 in it.  My employer matched at 5%. 

I also have a Traditional IRA with a total of $500,000 as well as a Roth IRA with a total of $259,000.  Each year I contribute the max to my Traditional IRA.  

Moreover, I have an HSA with a total of $11,600; each year I contribute the max to this account.  

I also have an employee stock purchase plan with a total of $26,000.  I contribute to this account too.  

Finally, I have a mutual fund totaling $54,000.  I contribute roughly $2,000 per month to this mutual fund.  

Combined, all of these accounts total $910,000.  I have all this money invested in low-cost index funds with Vanguard and Fidelity.  I will continue contributing the max to these accounts and keep them in index funds. 

As for real estate, I own a rental property whose mortgage was paid off in 2014. I receive $2,546 per month in rental income.  The annual property tax is $9,800.  Maintenance costs have been low for my rental property.  I have been renting out this property for six years and will continue to rent it out for at least four more years.  I might sell it after that. 

Last thing: I invested $2,500 in Bitcoin and have seen that grow to $3,500 as of yesterday.  I will not invest more than $10,000 annually in Bitcoin — that is my limit. 

I live in NYC.  Besides Federal Tax, I also pay NY state and NYC city tax. My marginal federal tax rate in 2020 is 24%; my effective federal tax rate is 12%.  My effective state tax rate is 8%.  I am single and a major saver — I invest my savings.  I do NOT spend lavishly.  

Here is my question: Going back to my 401(k), should I contribute to my Traditional 401(k) or should I contribute to my Roth 401(k)?  Or should I do a split?  I have no idea what tax rates will be in the future, and I don’t plan to spend lavishly in the future.  I also want to keep my tax burden as low as possible for the rest of my life.  Keep in mind that I do pay federal, state and city taxes.  

Also, do you think I’m on track to retire by 60?  Do you think I can retire by 55?  Anything I should be doing differently?  

I appreciate any insights.",finance
personalfinance,How do I decide where to put extra money,"Hello, 

So I currently have 3 loans, a private student loan, a federal student loan, and an auto loan. I have about $11,000 to put into them and am trying to decide which one I should be putting the money into, or if there is something else I should do with this money. 

The loans are broken down like this 

Private student loan $46,520 with 6.25% interest (thinking I should refinance this) 

Federal student loan is 7 loans totaling $22,835 with interest rates ranging from 3.76-4.66% 

Auto loan is $13,010 at a 3.74% interest rate. 

I’m leaning towards the federal loan if I’m able to refinance the private loan to a better interest rate but am looking for other opinions.

Bitcoin,Make Most of the Gains With None of the Stress: Join HODL Gang Today,"Seeing a lot of new users asking about how to make some profits with Bitcoin. You’ll find that 98% of Bitcoiners agree, join HODL Gang today.

What’s HODL? Simply put, it’s an investing strategy of buying and holding without monitoring trends or otherwise timing the market.

Why HODL? For all the reasons you’re here, because Bitcoin is in an immensely bullish position. Also, because the global market for Bitcoin is one of the most opaque markets that has ever existed. Trading in and out of the Bitcoin market is nothing short of gambling for 99.99% of us. 

When to start your HODL? Today. Consider using Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) by buying a small amount of Bitcoin every day, week, or month. For example, instead of piling in 20K today, go ahead and do 2K each month for the next ten months. 

Why DCA? Because it gives you time to learn and to build confidence. Bitcoin corrections are painful for investors who lack confidence. Many will sell a panic floor because they are unable to believe in an investment they still need time to fully understand. People spread disinformation during our weakest moments and you need to be able to judge what’s true and what’s FUD. You could potential maximum profits by piling all of your investment in today, but you’ll have a healthier relationship if you take your time, become conditioned to the swings, and study up.

When to sell? HODL Gang dreams of living off the interest of their Bitcoin as liquidity markets mature. If you feel it’s time to sell, as with making your initial investment, consider DCA. Your 20k became 49k and that feels like a huge run, your confidence is down because of some piece of news you read, instead of selling your 49K today, sell 4K each month. You might be surprised at how quickly you revert to buying. 

What if I have a health emergency? Sell and take care of yourself. Health comes first. This isn’t a cult. The excitement you see here is largely from users like me, who spent years studying Global Finance and who one day began to truly see the innovations of Bitcoin. This dream is bigger than you probably realize at right now. Remember, health comes first!

What if I need to pay off high interest credit cards? This is tricker, you might kick yourself later, but I recommend selling for this purpose. A 22% interest rate is insane and abusive, terminate that relationship and restart your Bitcoin DCA buying after.

Should I mortgage my house? This is even trickier to answer. First, because I don’t give high risk investing advice to strangers. Second, because interest rates are so low that the mortgage cash will almost certainly earn more in Bitcoin than it will cost in interest. For posterity I have to discourage this plan. You need a place to sleep, to have peace, and to be healthy. I’d recommend sticking to DCA but I won’t discourage you from crunching your own numbers and making your own well informed choice.

Does OP put their money where their mouth is? No my mouth is on my face or buried in some tang. I put my money in my hardware wallet and HODL that shit.

software,"Why is there no ""Superhuman"" for Google Calendar?","TLDR: Frustrated business professional looking for better calendaring software, trying to understand why nobody has created the ""Superhuman"" for Google Calendar.

stocks,Pros and cons of investing in 5 upcoming tech IPOs from Airbnb to Roblox,"December and January aren't typically busy months for initial public stock offerings, but this time around, they'll be an exception. Almost a half dozen well-known tech startups, each already valued privately at over $1 billion, have recently filed for IPOs, including Airbnb, DoorDash, and Roblox.

They're hoping to take advantage of strong investor appetite for tech stocks, despite the pandemic, and to catch the coat tails of other tech companies that have recently made [successful debuts](https://fortune.com/2020/08/29/2020-ipos-palantir-tech-ipo-asana-snowflake-predictions/). Shares in cloud database company Snowflake are up 129% since its September IPO and those of data mining company Palantir are up 215% since its September listing.

Here are key details to consider in weighing whether to invest in the latest batch of would-be public tech companies. Financial data is from the first nine months of 2020 unless otherwise indicated.

## Affirm

Symbol: AFRM  
Fiscal 2020 revenue: $510 million (fiscal year ended June 30)  
Revenue growth: 93%  
Gross margin: n/a  
Net loss: $113 million

[Affirm’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920126927/tm2026663-4_s1.htm)

Founded in 2012 by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, Affirm aims to [bring credit and lending to customers of all kinds of online retailers](https://fortune.com/2020/02/05/credit-cards-levchin-affirm-ceo-daily/). Those hard-to-miss layaway offers for a pair of shoes from Cole Haan or that cute coffee table on West Elm’s website? Affirm works behind the scenes to process the loans and often covers the cost of the item (in some cases, partner banks fund the loans). So far, Affirm has signed up over 6,500 retailer and helped consumers pay for almost $11 billion worth of products over the past three years.

**Pros**: Affirm says its “buy now, pay later” system is superior to credit cards, with no hidden fees or high interest rates (most Affirm offers are zero interest rate). Like other hot consumer companies, Affirm also touts its net promoter score of 78, suggesting more than three-quarters of customers would recommend the company.  As e-commerce grows, there’s plenty of room for growth in the market—less than 1% of e-commerce transactions in North America relied on “buy now pay later” deals. And Affirm says its data analysis of consumers’ ability to pay lets it avoid major losses.

**Cons**: The largest e-commerce sites, like [Amazon](https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/) and [Walmart](https://fortune.com/company/walmart/), have no need for Affirm and could even launch their own lending services. So could big banks or other financial institutions that can borrow money more cheaply than Affirm can. And more than one-quarter of all of Affirm’s lending has so far come from customers of a single retail partner: Peloton.

## Airbnb

Symbol: ABNB  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $2.52 billion  
Revenue growth: -32%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $697 million

[Airbnb’s S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1559720/000119312520294801/d81668ds1.htm)

As the now-famous story goes, Airbnb co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia decided to rent some airbeds in their San Francisco apartment after a big design conference caused local hotels to be fully booked. Their little web site, AirBedandBreakfast.com, eventually grew into the titan that has rented space to 825 million customers cumulatively across 220 countries.

**Pros**: The fast-growing startup took a huge hit when COVID-19 curbed travel, but has since [almost bounced back](https://fortune.com/2020/06/30/airbnbceo-brian-chesky-bookings-rentals-recovery-2020-ipo-coronavirus-pandemic/). Bookings were down 72% in April compared to the same month in 2019, but for June through September, the declined narrowed to 19% to 23%. The company also brags in its regulatory filing that pandemic-related spending cuts, including slashing headcount by 25%, make it more efficient going forward.

**Cons**: The pandemic showed that the travel industry is subject to sharp downturns that cut into Airbnb’s sales, and infections are on the rise again worldwide. The company has also battled restrictive rules in many cities and countries seeking to ban short-term rentals. Airbnb's filing disclosed it’s also in a battle with the Internal Revenue Service that could cost it $1.4 billion if it loses. And even after being in business for more than a decade, Airbnb is still on pace to lose around $1 billion this year.

## DoorDash

Symbol: DASH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.92 billion  
Revenue growth: 226%  
Gross margin: 53%  
Net loss: $149 million

[DoorDash S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

After moving to the U.S. as a child, DoorDash co-founder and CEO Tony Xu worked as a dishwasher in a Chinese restaurant to help make ends meet. The point of DoorDash, he says, is to help strivers and small businesses thrive. Now in business for seven years, DoorDash “dashers” deliver food and other items from almost 400,000 businesses to 18 million consumers per month as of September.

**Pros**: DoorDash is the leading provider of delivery with over twice the market share of runner up Uber Eats as of October 2020. The pandemic has [ignited much faster growth](https://fortune.com/2020/05/25/coronavirus-jobs-food-delivery-doordash/) in food delivery as people avoid going out to eat. Some smaller players have already sold out (DoorDash bought Square’s Caviar service for $410 million last year), but further consolidation could let DoorDash charge more for its services.

**Cons**: Once the pandemic passes, many DoorDash customers [may return to eating](https://fortune.com/2020/11/16/can-doordash-maintain-its-pandemic-boost/) in restaurants. Although California voters approved a measure to continue to classify gig workers like DoorDash’s dashers as independent contractors, other governments still are trying to classify gig workers as employees, which could wreck DoorDash’s business model.

## Roblox

Symbol: RBLX  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $589 million  
Revenue growth: 68%  
Gross margin: 74%  
Net loss: $206 million

[Roblox S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm)

Much more than a video game, Roblox has become a virtual environment for millions of people and companies [to create their own games](https://fortune.com/2019/07/16/roblox-100-million-monthly-active-users/). Co-founders David Baszucki and Erik Cassel went from making software simulations for physics labs to creating Roblox in 2004. Now some 31 million people play daily, including three-quarters of all U.S. kids age 9 to 12, the company says (Research firm Dubit put the figure at [half of kids 9 to 12 this summer)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/technology/roblox-tweens-videogame-coronavirus.html).

**Pros**: Roblox has plenty of reasons for developers to stick around, including its large devoted customer base and the Lua scripting language that makes it easier to make new games. About two-thirds of current users are from the U.S. and Canada, so there is room for considerable overseas expansion.

**Cons**: The pandemic super-charged Roblox growth rate, but kids may decide to put their screens down and play more outside after the crisis ends. Many users play on devices running [Apple](https://fortune.com/company/apple/) or [Google](https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/) software, putting Roblox somewhat at the mercy of the twin tech titans’ app policies. Other games have been banned and the app stores decide how much of each sale they are entitled to. A joint venture with Tencent to bring Roblox to China could be impacted by increasing trade tensions or new restrictions. And gaming and social media platforms come and go depending on the latest fads. Roblox could be the MySpace of gaming.

## Wish (ContextLogic)

Symbol: WISH  
First nine months of 2020 revenue: $1.75 billion  
Revenue growth: 32%  
Gross margin: 65%  
Net loss: $176 million

[Wish S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822250/000119312520298630/d82777ds1.htm)

Overshadowed by better known rivals like Amazon, [Alibaba](https://fortune.com/company/alibaba-group-holding/), and [eBay](https://fortune.com/company/ebay/), Wish [focuses its e-commerce services](https://fortune.com/2020/11/20/online-marketplace-wish-files-for-ipo/) on the “affordable” segment of consumers. Founded in 2010, Wish now helps more then 500,000 online sellers hawk goods to 100 million monthly active shoppers. Parent company ContextLogic has its name on the IPO registration filing.

**Pros**: Shopping online isn’t just for the wealthy. Wish says it's targeting the 44% of U.S. consumers and 85% of Europeans who have household incomes of $75,000 or less, plus shoppers in developing countries. Wish’s platform is mobile first, and 90% of purchases happen via its mobile app. Although Wish doesn't make a profit, it generated free cash flow (or cash from operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment) of $23 million in the first nine months of 2020.

**Cons**: Wish faces off against many larger rivals, such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, plus Shopify and Walmart. To compete against the giants, Wish spends vast sums, over $1 billion so far in 2020, on marketing. With deep connections in China, U.S.-based Wish could be hurt by worsening trade tensions. And as with other startups dependent on mobile apps, Google and Apple could undermine Wish’s business with new rules or requirements.

gaming,"Listen up, gamers! I need your help.","[TL;DR at the bottom]



I'm a 13yo guy from Slovenia who would love to be able to play video games but doesn't have the right equipment.
Since my birthday is in December, every year I merge the festivities with my bd to be able to purchase something a bit more meaningful that will last for years to come.

So this year, when the PS5 just launched, I knew that's what I was gonna get. But here's the problem: my parents are strictly anti-gaming. The cost of the console wouldn't be an issue because I've carefully saved for around 3 years now and gathered more than enough for 2 PS5s.
Their concern is that gaming would destroy me, estrange me from the outside world, make me rot from the inside and, finally, the classic, it'll make me stupid. They say that ""games are for people without a future that'll end up working at a gas station"". They say that what I have is already enough (I sometimes play games on the phone but you all know that those are...bad to say the least) and that I don't need a whole machine to waste my time. They see video games like a means to divide me from them and turn me against them and to make me into a nobody who is just part of the mass.
They already constantly ramble about how I use the phone too much. And it's true, I do use it quite a lot now with this global pandemic, but I need it for online school and it's my only window to the outside world. It's the only way I can talk to my friends and I wouldn't call that a waste of time.

I've tried telling them that games aren't all that bad and showing them all the benefits of gaming and all the articles stating that video games, in fact, aren't the purest form of evil and the creation of Satan himself (published by professional psychologists and other P.h.Ds), but they just scoffed and told me that it's all paid by game corporations and fake.
And I would kind of understand them if I were a horrible student. But I'm not, I'm quite the opposite. At 13yo I'm already in middle school, while the normal age for 1st year middle schoolers is 15. I've been getting straight 5's (the highest grade here in Slovenia) and I study regularly. Apart from that, I also practice piano 3 hrs a day and am really good at it. English is my 3rd language and I speak a total of 4 languages fluently, so I don't see why I wouldn't deserve to have something to relax to.
I've already tried everything in my power to convince them to let me buy a PS5 and am kind of desparate now, so please, can you link me to an article or forum that you think will convince them or share your story or basically just help in any other way?

TL;DR: My strict anti-gaming parents won't let me buy myself a PS5 *with my own money*, because they say that video games are a total waste of time and the creation of Satan himself, apparently. Please help me out on this any way you can.

Sorry if some typo maybe accidentally slipped by.

Thank you in advance, any help would be thoroughly appreciated :)

stocks,"Global stocks &amp; US futures down as Trump returns to Trade War with Semiconductor industry-disrupting ban on China’s largest Chipmaker, SMIC","Lame duck president Trump, setting aside his election challenges, has resumed the Trade War against China in his remaining weeks in office with a tech sector-disrupting ban on SMIC, China’s largest chipmaker. 

His earlier threat of banning SMIC in late Summer had sent the then-soaring tech stocks into disarray and put a top on tech indexes on September 1 and sent the NASDAQ into a sinking pattern for months afterward. However, the markets have enjoyed a broad rally since the first week of November, which began in industrials, small caps and value stocks, but finally brought the tech sector to new highs last week for the first time since September.

The ban on SMIC is particularly disruptive of the US tech sector, and not just Chinese tech, because the US semiconductor industry is the dominant world supplier of semiconductor production equipment and design software and China is its largest customer. In turn, SMIC is in the supply chain for many US electronics products. The US semiconductor industry has been rallying since the election, in part, based on rising prospects of Biden’s win marking the end of the spread of the trade war into the semiconductor sector. 

Trump’s return to trade disruptions in the final weeks of his presidency, particularly in the tech sector, may mark the end of this current rally.

Additions factors that can combine with a disruption of trade to bring an end to this rally are OPEC+ discord ahead of a meeting to determine near-term changes in oil production levels for the remainder of the pandemic, the Treasury department clawing back some $500B of emergency bailout funds from the federal reserve in what many view as a premature declaration that no more aid is needed, the negative and uncommunicative tone of the restart of stimulus talks with the still-GOP-dominated senate and some due profit-taking and consolidation from the strong November rally that has brought indexes to new highs. 

November has seen one of the strongest post-election rallies in US history. November’s post-election relief rally was unquestionably partly due to relief from businesses that have been suffering declines, like the semiconductor industry, due to Trump pushing forward with a trade war while the country has been experiencing a pandemic recession.

EDIT: The small cap semiconductor stocks that I'm following are crashing into the open. Looking for some signs of strength in the few minutes after the open, but this might be a buying opportunity that Trump has given us as a parting gift before handing the WH over to Biden.",finance

personalfinance,How to find out if refinancing my home mortgage is right for me?,"TLDR; I've been putting additional $ towards my principal since day 1 and not sure paying $12k in closing costs is worth saving 1.375% in my interest rate.

Non-condensed version:

Started a 30 year conventional loan with a 3.75% APR in January 2015. Put 20% down and do not have PMI. Original loan amount was $246,000.  My current principal balance is $194,307.64. At the minimum I've been paying an additional $275 when I send in my monthly mortgage payment.  My goal has always been to pay as little interest as possible while paying down the home as fast as possible.

Began the process to refinance to a 15 year loan with a 2.375% interest rate and the info included in the loan estimate has the loan amount at $209,500, with my monthly payments + $100/mo.  The new loan amount is what I find most unsettling because it's +$15k of what I currently owe and I'm not taking any cash out. My estimated cash to close is $221.

When I plug my last year of payments into an amortization calculator I'm not getting to the number I'm at today. So while yes, I know a 15 year loan will help me own the home fastest, what I'd really like to know is what would my completion date look like if I just kept my current rate and added $375/payment instead of $275.  Want to know if the additional fees warrant getting the lower interest rate, or if I should just pull the plug on this altogether.

Working from home today but will check back hourly if there are any questions I could answer to give more information.  Appreciate your input. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Advice on paying off $7.5k of debt prior to nursing school?,"I have been lurking for awhile and was hoping to get some advice as to what the best thing is to do in my situation as I get gridlocked in my mind about what I ""should"" be focusing on. I will throw out all of the numbers first and shove all the background info at the bottom in case you want to skip it.

#**All my stats**:

**Salary**: $2,400/month + variable hours (Instacart/Uber/Doordash)

**CC 1**:
- $3,233 at 22.90% interest

**CC 2**: 
- $3,947 at 22.24% interest

**CC 3**: 
- $250 (this is one used for vet/dental emergencies; interest rate is like 29% if not paid off by Feb/March)


**Monthly bills** (excluding CC's):
- Rent + utilities: $900 (*cries in California*)
- Electric: $60ish currently (goes up to $150 in hot months)
- Wifi: $31
- Car payment: $200
- Insurance: $45
- Student loan: $240
**total bills**: ~$1,476

**Other expenses** (bare minimums):
- Gas: ~$130
- Spotify: $5
-Phone backup/storage: $3
- Youtube Premium: $7 (allows me to listen to class lectures while doing food delivery/commuting)
- Instacart: $10 (timesaver also)
- Food: $300
- Medications: $30
**total other exp.**: $485

**Leftover money after bills/expenses:** $439

**Goals**: 
Short term:
1. Pay off CC's by November 2021 prior to nursing school
2. Have a reasonable savings prior to nursing school

Long term:
1. Better credit score (current is around 695)
2. Retirement planning
3. Investing

**Background**: 
I finally finished a sociology degree this year and ended up having to put a few classes on my credit cards (as well as throw my very small savings towards it as well). Not my best decision, but I wanted to finally be done with it as it's taken me awhile. I would like to pay this all off by this time next year at the latest as I hope to start nursing school full time (which will be my 2nd, more substantial degree/career path).

My current take-home salary is $2,400 a month working full time at an office. I also do Uber/Wag/food delivery so I can have flexibility in increasing it, but I'm taking rigorous nursing pre-requisites so I am trying to be careful about balancing extra hours with that.

I live with 2 roommates in a lower-income area of a major city in California, and I live away from family, so there isn't much wiggle room for that :/ I tried to get approval for a personal loan/credit card with a better or promotional rate for a balance transfer, but I could only get $1,000 from my bank that I'm waiting to receive. I have 2 bank accounts that I put my direct deposit in to separate + automate bill paying and etc. 

Most of my fluffy expenses are used for time-saving things (Youtube/Instacart) and sometimes I will get fast food (which is my vice, much to the dismay of waistline). 

--------

**TL;DR: I'm hoping for some insight on how to tackle my financial situation in a reasonable time frame and what I should be focusing on/prioritizing (eliminating debt first? savings first? both?).**

This is the highest balance I've ever had on my credit cards and I'm very ashamed of money/spending and just of my general existence at this point, so any suggestions are welcomed and very very much appreciated. :(",finance

personalfinance,Better to pay off credit cards or home loan?,"Hello, I'm looking for an opinion on this matter and I'll try to keep it short.

We are selling our house and purchasing a new one with closing in the next 30 days. Profits from the sale will be high enough to pay off the following two debt items, but not both.

1) A loan I took out cover the cost of a new roof and to put some towards a high-balance credit card.

2) My remaining CC balance and my wife's remaining CC balance.

The interest rate on the loan is 11.5%, credit cards around 16%. Loan monthly payment is $925, CC monthly payment (combined) is about $600.

If I pay off the loan, I get back $925/month which is a lot. If I pay off the CCs, I get back less, but cut out higher interest. However, I'm concerned if I pay off my CCs in one payment my credit score will take a dive (I am OK with this somewhat since it would occur after we get into the new house). Also, if I pay off the CCs I would have about 7k left over, but 0 if I pay the loan.

personalfinance,Rental property refinance questions,"I have a rental property that I bought in 2018 with a balance of around 128k (bought it at 5.35% interest and \~80k down). 

I'm looking into refinancing it given that interest rates are so low:

The bank I'm talking to has presented me with 2 options:

Option 1: 30yr loan at 3.4% interest - monthly payment decrease of around \~$150

Option 2: 20yr loan at 3.4% interest (Same as 30 for some reason, the 15yr was actually higher interest at 4.2% or so) - monthly payment increase of around \~$40

I plan to keep the property for maybe 5 more year before selling it, therefore I'm trying to figure out the option that makes the most sense financially. Closing costs for both options are the same around \~3.2k

I'm leaning towards the 20-yr loan since I'll be forced to pay more towards the principal, which guarantees a larger profit when I do sell it. Am I thinking about it wrong? Any advice would be  appreciated.",finance

I am a 24 year old making 35/40k a year in the midlands  uk.I am not in an industry likely to be massively effected by Covid .My credit according to Experian is around 900(good). All i ever hear about is how credit is cheaper than ever right now.

I've always been relatively responsible with money. In fact i am planning on moving back in with my mum to bolster up saving power.

Why is is when i went to Natwest (who can see my salary, and spending habits), and ask for a 20k Loan  they offer me an incredibly high interest rate. They advertise 3.4% APR online but quote me 17.9% APR!

I have looked elsewhere and it does seem like the pool of products available have dramatically shrunk. Is this enticing lenders to charge more for money for borrowing even when there are rumours of negative interest rates on the way?? Some quotes i got for a loan on comparison sites were 20% APR+

I have looked through the terms i should be able to easily afford the 20 k loan over a period of 5 years. I will then be able to bolster my credit (first serious loan, barring student)

CryptoCurrency,The threat to Bitcoin that no one is talking about.,"There have been two trends related to Bitcoin that pose a serious security threat to Bitcoin's longevity:

1. Bitcoin's value proposition transformation from digital money to digital gold (reserve asset/collateral).
2. Externalization of transactions to other blockchains (wrapped bitcoin tokens) and/or centralized digital custodian services like Paypal.

To put it simply, the long-term security of Bitcoin protocol's depends on the value of transacting directly within the Bitcoin network. The lack of significant scalability of layer 1 along with trends that effectively reduces and diminishes the value of directly transacting in the network can be catastrophic in the long run. Every bitcoin that is externalized to Ethereum, Paypal and others is being indefinitely frozen in its native protocol. The remainder is being used more and more as a reserve asset and collateral. This is not good folks, and we cannot pretend it is not happening or that it is insignificant.

Bitcoin's security economic incentives were not designed for it to be a reserve asset and have transactions externalized to other systems. Ultimately if this trend is to be reversed the network needs to scale at layer 1 and/or the utility value of transacting natively must increase - there are no tangible propositions to realize either in the foreseeable future. Another solution would be to change the consensus mechanism and/or monetary policy. Eventually something must give, but for now it is entirely up in the air.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Just to clarify on the need to scale layer 1. Layer 2 solutions are scaling at a factor of layer 1, and a deficiency in the base layer can still cause severe bottlenecks that could potentially render secondary layers impractical.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Factors to Consider - Refinance w/ Points vs No Points,"Overall, looking at the Closing Costs and the interest rate difference, refinancing at this moment looks like it's smart. What I'm grappling with is Points vs No Points.

I created a calculation that takes into account the monthly payments with No Points (2.875%) vs Most Points (2.5%). With the Closing Costs and the Points Costs factored in, the break even point is around October of 2026 - 6 years from now - where I would pay less if I bought points right now. 

A few factors that I had been pondering:

* Points makes sense when you're going to keep it well beyond 6 years or the duration of the loan
* No points allows me to refinance in the future if the interest rates dip even more - gives me flexibility for a refinance to make sense at that point
* No points allows me to sell the house for a new house within 6 years - without any ""financial"" hit.

It's a single family house within a growing neighborhood and has some unique sought after features within homes in the area.

My wife and I intend to upgrade the house within 3-4 years but hoping we can keep the current house and rent it out. The only reason why we wouldn't is if the rental market is bad at that time and we don't want the burden of dealing with renters/rental agent.
