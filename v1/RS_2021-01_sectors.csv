personalfinance,Refinance or Pay Off Vehicle ?,"Hey Guys

 Currently have a auto loan in the total amount of $11,700 with $7,000 remaining with an APR of %15 ( horrible I know ). 


I took this loan out in 2019 I was 19 with a mediocre credit score just due to a thin profile. At 21, My credit is nearly 800 and I have a perfect history and multiple revolving accounts in hood standings. If I refinanced this through Navy Federal I could probably get a interest rate around 2-5% most likely with payments somewhere like $100-150. If I pay this straight off I’ll only have about 5k left in savings. If I erase this car note out my monthly expenses are around $500 with a gross of around 2,500 each month. 


I want to move out soon so I’d like to have a padded savings which is why I’m unsure",finance
personalfinance,Recent graduate—how to balance paying debt with investing in my future?,"I’m 25. I finished grad school in August and have been saving basically 100% of my income since then, as my student loan interest and payments are frozen (due to covid) and I am not sure how I should best distribute my money.

The stats:

* 25 years old, not married.
* I currently make 70k/year (~~62.5k~~ 51.5k this year after taxes) as a PT and live at home. My only expense at this time is gasoline for my car, and my commute is only 4 miles per day. My boss told me that I can expect a 3-5% pay raise each year.
* I have $140,400 in student loan debt ($131,404 principle). Interest rates vary between 3-7.6% (the largest loans are 7.6%). All payments and interest compounding is paused until Feb 2021.
* I currently have $30,000 in savings.
* I have $0 saved for retirement at this time. My company does a 401k match, but only starts matching after 2 years (starts then at 1%, goes up to 5% match of your gross compensation after 6 years).
* Credit score is 755.

My plan starting January 2021:

* Pay $28,800 towards student loans each year to be debt-free in 5.57 years.
* Put 15% of gross income (about $10,000) each year to max out Roth IRA and put the rest in 401k. Also, contribute $6,000 to a Roth IRA for the 2020 tax year.
* This leaves about $~~24,200~~ $13,200 leftover per year.

Goals:

* I would like to move out within the next 2 years. The total yearly cost for this in my area including rent with a roommate/utilities/food/insurance/etc. would come to about $12k a year.
* I would like to buy a house at some point in the next 10 years.
* I have a long-term girlfriend and would like to get married in about 4-5 years.
* I would ultimately like to have a comfortable, financially solid future. Living in a cozy 3 bedroom house, driving a used car, going on a vacation every year or two, not worrying about money, etc. I would also consider retiring early but need to learn more about that first.

Questions:

* Is my current strategy financially sound? I’ve seen advice to prioritize paying off debt ASAP but I don’t want to fall behind on retirement savings.
* What should I do with the leftover $~~24k~~ 13k? Roughly half of this amount will be spent on living expenses once I move out.
* Should I be looking for additional sources of income? A second job? I enjoy my work-life balance now quite a bit but could make cuts if necessary.

Thank you!

Bitcoin,I bought the ATH in 2011: A decade of HODLing,"There have been a few other long-term HODLers sharing their stories recently and I've greatly enjoyed reading them and reminiscing about Bitcoin's past. Here's my story - I hope it's as entertaining as the others.

\---

Every number between 0 cents and the current ATH has been, by definition, the all-time-high at one point. Don't let that prevent you from taking a risk in something you believe in. Extend your time horizon to a decade and lock your coins away.

\---

I've been a libertarian since I was a teenager. The expanding role of the State is something that I've been worrying about for most of my life. While learning about the immorality of the existence of the State, at some point I learned about monetary policy and how inflation is robbing everyone on an unprecedented scale. I tucked this knowledge away and was determined to figure out a way around it when I started making my own money. (This paragraph is the only one involving political philosophy, go ahead and continue reading)

I first heard of Bitcoin in 2010 on one of the many forums I frequented in my libertarian internet circle. It was an interesting concept to me, but I didn't pursue it at all. Again I tucked this knowledge away for future use.

I heard of it again several months later (2010). This time I decided to try it out. I remember downloading and syncing the reference wallet and using a BTC faucet to send coins to my wallet. I forget exactly how many it was... 5, maybe? That's as far as I went with it though. At some point I deleted the wallet and the downloaded blockchain - probably to make room for a Steam game or something. Those coins are gone.

That's right - Steam. I have been a gamer for most of my life as well. I owned a powerful graphics card at the time: The Radeon 5970.

The third time I heard about Bitcoin was in May 2011. I had heard that the price was lifting off and people were making a lot of money from it. This time I decided to dive in and see what I could figure out.

This was where I fell into the deep rabbit hole of Bitcoin. I remember getting so absorbed in it that I didn't sleep some nights. I was working my day job, going home and learning all that I could about Bitcoin. Learning about how addresses were generated, how wallets worked, how mining worked, how the difficulty adjustment worked, everything that I possibly could.

After a week or two of obsessing and reading about Bitcoin, I decided that this was the most important invention since the internet - the most perfect form of money ever created. One of the most ingenious systems ever designed by man - and NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT IT YET.

I can't recall if any other coins existed at the time, but between 2011-2012 I remember other coins like Namecoin, Peercoin, Feathercoin, and some others. I don't hear about any of those other coins these days... besides LTC and XRP, of course.

I decided that I wanted in. I needed to get some Bitcoin. I needed it NOW!! This would be like buying stock in the Internet itself but better - no counterparty risk, and I could be my own bank!

I wasn't making a lot of money at the time, so putting money towards anything discretionary wasn't going to be friendly to my budget. Yes, I owned a badass gaming rig, but that was my only luxury in life. I knew I was going to buy for the long term, so I decided to put aside $500 and go for it. I was going to buy Bitcoin.

At the time, Mt Gox was the only game in town that I can remember. I don't think BTC-e existed yet, or maybe I just hadn't heard of it.

I signed up for a Gox account and figured out how to fund it. There were a few ways to do this, one of which was another app called Dwolla. So I signed up for Dwolla and got verified. I then deposited my $500 and initiated the ACH transfer to Gox. BTC price at the time: $3.

I had initiated the transfer on a Tuesday evening after work. I was informed that the transfer would arrive at Gox on Friday.

I watched agonizingly as the price climbed hour after hour, day after day. $3.50. $4. $5. $6. I was missing the boat!!! By Thursday evening the price had doubled.

At work on Friday, I checked my email on my phone practically every five minutes. The transfer didn't go through the entire work day. I had plans with friends that evening - damn it, I was going to have to try and do this on my phone while hanging with my friends?!

I ended up making my first BTC purchase while sitting in a movie theater. I bought 50 Bitcoin for $10 each - during an all-time-high.

I still hodl every one of these coins today.

(The movie, for the curious: X-Men: First Class)

I couldn't stop there, though. The more I learned, the more I had to know. The more I had to DO. That's when I got into GPU mining.

This was a time before ASICs. I believe GPU mining was relatively new -- before this, miners were only using CPUs (which were in 2011 -- like GPUs in 2020 -- obsolete for SHA256 mining).

The next day I dove headfirst into Bitcoin mining. I downloaded the software and set up an account on Slush Pool. I ran my 5970 on full blast for a while and went out with some friends. When I got back, my bedroom was noticeably hotter than it was when I left. So that's what I was going to be dealing with? Ok, fine.

I also couldn't play any demanding video games while the miner was running. I'd have to dial the hashrate down, or disable it completely. Ok, I guess I can manage that.

After a few days of dealing with that, I decided to buy another 5970. If I got bored of Bitcoin, it would still make The Witcher 2 run better!

All told, between mining with Slush Pool and BTCGuild for a month, I managed to mine an additional 50BTC that month.

I still hodl every one of these coins today.

One day, my electric bill came. $350. For my 1BR apartment? That can't be right...

I called up the electric company and told them they double-billed me.

""Nope, that amount is accurate. That's what you owe for this month. Have a nice day!""

And that was the day I stopped Bitcoin mining.

I had been telling all my friends and gamer friends about Bitcoin the entire time. They laughed at me. I told them they wouldn't be laughing when I was a millionaire.

Soon after, Bitcoin crashed -- HARD. Dropping from $32 at its peak to $2 over the next few months -- one of the largest price drops in its history.

I was dejected. I stopped talking about it with my friends. The gamer communities I was a member of made fun of me relentlessly, trashing Bitcoin every day. News articles celebrating Bitcoin's death popped up everywhere. It was the first major public crash, and I felt all alone.

I uninstalled the Bitcoin price widget from my phone. I moved on with my life and tried to forget about Bitcoin. I left the wallet on my PC, but deleted my copy of the blockchain.

I barely thought about Bitcoin for the next two years. Any time someone brought it up at work or in my friend group, I changed the subject. I was completely demoralized and thought I had fallen for the biggest scam of all time.

After this unbearable TWO YEAR period... Bitcoin came back.

One day I opened r/Bitcoin and saw utter elation all over the front page. What the hell was going on?

Bitcoin had surpassed the last all-time-high and was climbing still. $50... $100. And it was still going!!!

I snapped out of my multi-year funk right then and there. Somehow my paper financial loss had clouded my judgment and made me forget about the fundamentals that made me interested in Bitcoin in the first place.

""Bitcoin was back?"" It had never left. It was still the same decentralized, unforgeable, instantly transferrable miracle asset that I had fallen in love with.

I got back into mining again, but I didn't leave my GPUs running 24/7 like I had before. Eventually, ASICs started coming out and obsoleted GPU miners, so I had to start mining LTC instead and selling them for BTC. I mined on a site called give-me-ltc and did my trades on BTC-e.

Eventually I got tired of managing my miners, paying extra for electricity, and dealing with switching stuff around for gaming. I stopped mining again and moved on to other things.

I exited this phase with an additional 30BTC and over 400LTC. I still hodl every one of these coins today.

Eventually, BTC hit $1000. I watched this live on [bitcoinity.org](https://bitcoinity.org). I remember this day vividly.

The graphic shown on bitcoinity for every price point was usually some sort of funny gif - someone dancing, someone acting crazy, someone making a funny face, Mr. Bean watching signposts fly past his car. This time, the gif was different - it was serious.

It was an astronaut on the moon. A flag was planted behind him bearing the Bitcoin logo.

Tears welled up in my eyes. This was significant. Bitcoin was being recognized for what it was - the most perfect form of money ever created.

My stack was now worth enough to pay off all of my six-figure student loan debt. I had thought that I would be paying this debt off for the rest of my life. Bitcoin meant potential financial freedom to me.

I didn't sell a single satoshi.

Of course, $1000 didn't last, and paying off all my loans with my stack was no longer a possibility. The price did not recover for almost FOUR years -- even longer than the previous crypto winter. During this time I bought a few more coins through Coinbase.

The 2017 run-up was a blur -- except for one day...

The day I became a crypto millionaire.

My family didn't grow up with a ton of money. I never had the latest clothes, toys -- well, anything. We weren't poor, but we scraped by. I didn't have a great education in personal finance.

Being a crypto millionaire went straight to my head.

Driving to work on that day, I remember thinking I was the most badass person on Earth. Somehow I had managed to manipulate some computer numbers around that were now worth over a million dollars!!

I couldn't help it - I told everyone at work. I was a crypto millionaire. I couldn't shut up about it. I told my family. I told my friends. I told everyone.

I went to the store to grab a few things. Walking the aisles, I couldn't stop thinking about it. ""These people have no idea they're standing next to a MILLIONAIRE.""

Of course, my crypto millionaire status didn't last long.

This time, though, I SODL a few coins at the peak. I bought a house and a car.

A month or two later, I was no longer a crypto millionaire.

Seeing the altcoin season was kind of crazy to me. For a few months, you literally could not pick a losing coin. Everyone was a winner. It was sheer insanity. I picked up a few ETH to get some exposure, even though I didn't (and still don't) believe in it long term.

I'm doing pretty well these days. I am numb to any price activity at this point. The last time I bought was the dip down to $4000 in March. I don't know how anyone could have resisted that one.

Other than what I SODL in 2017, I still hodl all of my coins.

You may be able to see a pattern here. There's always going to be another all-time-high. There's always going to be a crash or a correction. You're probably going to feel stupid more than a handful of times being a HODLer. But eventually these feelings go away.

I have a few more anecdotes and random thoughts to share, so I'll make them bullet points below:

&amp;#x200B;

\- I held on to my BCH for a while. I will admit that I was TERRIFIED during the flippening. 6-12 months later, I sold them all for BTC.

\- I immediately sold all my BSV for LTC.

\- I hold BTC, LTC, and ETH. That's it.

\- I don't believe in any of these centralized or ""new and improved"" shitcoins. I'm a BTC maximalist through-and-through. The only other coin I'd consider at this point would be Monero. I know almost nothing about it and I haven't done any research on it, so I don't hold any.

&amp;#x200B;

FUNNY

\- I gave $5 of BTC to a friend in 2013. They forgot about it. I reminded them about it this year. They sold it for $175.

\- I gave $30 of BTC to a friend in 2013. They sold it in 2017 for $750.

\- I solo mined IxCoin (literal who?) for a few days because I wanted to feel what it was like to solo mine a block. I did not solo mine a block.

\- My favorite Bitcoin meme is ""This is gentlemen."" Why don't people say that anymore?

&amp;#x200B;

REMINISCING

\- Wallets I used: Bitcoin core -&gt; Armory Offline (airgapped with TAILS) -&gt; Electrum Offline (airgapped with TAILS) -&gt; trezor

\- Armory was flaky as fuck. I moved on to Electrum after the 20th time Armory failed to sync the blockchain. I remember having to manually export the private keys using some Python script because I couldn't get the wallet synced.

\- Reddit is too slow for BTC sometimes, so I would go to the BTC-e trollbox to get some realtime action. Now that BTC-e is gone, I typically hang out in /biz/ when Reddit is boring.

&amp;#x200B;

REGRETS

\- Not buying more. Not mining more.

\- Not selling BCH for BTC immediately. That one still stings.

\- Focusing a little too much on paying down debt vs buying more BTC.

\- Buying precious metals in 2013. What a waste.

\- Selling in 2017. But, I wanted a house and a car. Regretting taking profit is stupid, but I can't help it.

&amp;#x200B;

THOUGHTS

\- I never once tried to convince anyone to buy Bitcoin, despite how much I talked about it. I tried to convince people of the potential and that the Fed was evil, but I never once said, ""You should buy Bitcoin"" to anyone.

\- I see another 10x for BTC. Just buy BTC. Don't buy anything else. Just buy BTC and fucking HODL.

\- HODL through these crashes. They make you stronger. After a few of them, nothing will faze you. Be a fucking man and HODL on to your coins!!!!!

\- People just don't understand the network effect of the BTC protocol. No one cares that another coin has better features. No one cares that there are better internet protocols. They use what has the most infrastructure and support. Don't fall for these shitcoins.

\- People don't understand the layering concept. Increasing blocksize simply isn't the solution to scaling Bitcoin - second layer and beyond is the solution.

\- Taxation is theft.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this was at least mildly entertaining.

Happy New Year!!!!!

financialindependence,Estimated Taxes - Annualized Income Tax Method Planning Spreadsheet,"Link:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WJnEcpNJ7N2n5kLwvV6JfGpxrwX_DNfFSAc-j236P98/edit?usp=sharing

Please COPY the spreadsheet and don't request edit access.

Original credit goes to a Bogleheads user TaronM that made the original spreadsheet. I updated his spreadsheet for the Tax Jobs Cuts Act which the original poster wasn't willing to do, which took a lot of work as the annualized income forms changed significantly. 

I updated his spreadsheet as I'm on SSDI income and was wracking my brain trying to estimate taxes correctly for $0 penalties. I'm invested all-in on Hedgefundie's UPRO/TMF portfolio and re-balancing that can throw off significant capital gains every quarter. In one year I'm either $0 federal taxes or paying $40,000 in federal taxes solely due to rebalancing my portfolio. SSDI is tax free with $0 income, and up to 85% taxable otherwise. 

I looked everywhere for an online calculator or software package to spit out numbers and the only thing I found was a ""Please contact us for pricing"" offering. Being too cheap to hire a CPA for this and not wanting to do these forms once a quarter, with the workload of doing a tax return, I decided to do the work once and build upon what TaronM started. 

# Instructions
Make a copy for each new year from the template. 

Put in your tax brackets. I have the single tax brackets, if you're married, you'll have some work to do to put in the married tax brackets. Put your YTD date income for each ""quarter"", the first 3 months of income, the first 5 months of income, the first 8 months of income, then finally in December your total income.  You'll do this 15 days before the estimated taxes are due at each quarter and put your ACTUAL income received. 

Save this spreadsheet and refer to it at tax return time. You'll have to enter the same numbers you estimated in your tax program of choice for the annualized income method. 

You'll probably want to save this spreadsheet for 7 years with your tax return in case you're ever audited to show that you did the worksheet. My spreadsheet puts every number into the worksheet for you. 

Enjoy saving money of having to hire a CPA year round to do the busy work by hand and tell you how much estimated taxes you owe.

Cheers! 

# Limitations
It does no QBI phaseout rules, they're really complex. If you're self employed I trust you're putting in realistic numbers and knows how this QBI phaseout works. My spreadsheet will spit out whatever numbers you put in same as the Annualized Income Method forms itself. I have not tested this part extensively so YMMV on it. Remember: garbage in = garbage out. 

# Disclaimers

I'm not a CPA. I've only tested this for my expected situation of SSDI, ordinary income, dividends, qualified dividends, short term capital gains, and long term capital gains. I've tested this with 2019 tax brackets and a 2019 Tax Act Return. At most TaxAct generates a $1 or $2 penalty, which is a lot better than the $100-$200 in penalties I was facing with my previous attempts to figure out estimated taxes on my own.

# How this spreadsheet applies to FIRE 

We're more likely to retire early, and our income is based off our portfolios, and we may have uneven income in a year (say withdrawing $40k extra from stocks in June to fix a roof.) FIREing doesn't give us much withholding opportunities either - so we're either paying estimated taxes or doing 60-day rollovers of 100% withholding IRA withdrawals. Another poster yesterday was asking how to estimate such taxes and so I decided to post this today! :)",finance
investing,Let's reflect on our performance in 2020,"*Happy New Year, folks! It's certainly been an interesting one.*

*I thought it would be interesting to look back on how we did for the year and reflect on what went right and what didn't.*

I'll go first. This year, my CAGR ended up around a tidy 30% (Personal RoR, although my TWRoR is similar). 

I'm quite happy with my performance, given my relative inexperience (I've only been in this game for ~4 years, and this was my first year trading options). We'll see how much of it I'll have to give back in the next correction.

**What did I do right?**

Well, my core positions have been pretty consistent. ~15% of my portfolio is in semiconductors, mainly TSM, and the structural advantages, increasing applications, and large moat that this industry has continues to pay off. 

My next largest sector is consumer discretional retail (AMZN, BABA, MELI, RTH, WMT), which saw a huge boost because of the lockdown. I am worried about seeing some pullback next year and shoppers return to their previous habits, but we'll handle that if/when it occurs.

My biggest gains have been from well-timed purchases of smaller cap companies: BJRI, BLMN, M, JWN, DLTR, and AAL were all very kind to me.

ARKK, ICLN, and QCLN have been good ways of getting exposure to areas where I don't have a strong point of view, but see potential for continued gains.

I got into SPACs the last few months of the year. It's a relatively low-information market, and seems somewhat luck-based, but I have made some successful plays there as well.

My decision in August to keep any funds not allocated to an active strategy or thesis in VTI and VTWO instead of in BND or as cash has paid off, due to low interest rates and asset inflation.

**What was just OK?**

My third largest sector is healthcare, which underperformed relative to the eyepopping gains in tech and retail. I'm alright with the opportunity cost there.

I made a small investment into Bitcoin, which I sold at $19k after a 16% gain. I should have held (hedled?) - but I have trouble remaining confident in investments without a strong underlying value investing thesis.

My luck with short-selling has been poor this year. My short positions in GSX and NKLA were pretty successful, but I lost a lot of money shorting FCPT, ACC, BLMN, and BJRI earlier in the year. On the other hand, the excellent performance of BJRI and BLMN meant I later turned them into (ultimately very profitable) long positions, which I likely wouldn't have discovered without the initial short thesis.

There are so many astounding run-ups I knew about rather early on and missed out on: TSLA, MRNA, NIO, PLTR, QS. The hype around these tickers and the sky-high PE ratios scared me off, which might not be a good response in the current market regime. That said, my investing style has to fit my philosophy and psychology to work, so I'll remain disciplined in trying to find opportunities that match my approach.


**What choices were mistakes?**

I tried options this year. I began by paper trading options and lost a lot of (fake money). I then moved on the real-life option plays, and basically broke even. Even so, the stress is *unreal*. I understand how the option greeks and Black-Scholes works, but it still catches me by surprise when the price moves in my favor and my positions lose money anyway. The wide bid/ask spreads and crazy volatility is really hard to deal with, and a single options play starts to take up more space in my head than the rest of my portfolio. As a result, I often end up selling too soon. I don't think directional options plays are for me. I may try selling covered calls in the future.

About 60% of the time I've tried to catch a falling knife this year, I've failed. OTGLY and SWI are two good examples. I'm still not sure how to deal with this.

I suck at scalping - My attempts at day-trading SPXL and SPXS during March and April's high-volatility periods destroyed the subsequent 3 months of returns.

**What did I learn?**

Value investing is still alive and well in 2020 - you just need to understand how to look for opportunities and value growing companies.

I need to respect the tax man: I didn't max out my 401k contribution this year because I wanted to amass some cash in order to eventually put a down payment on a property - I'm going to pay for that in April.

I still don't know where the sweet spot is for leverage. I know options aren't it for me, but I can't help but feel that I could improve my returns by levering up on my high-conviction, low-volatility plays. I'll continue to explore this in 2021.

Excited to see how you all did this year!",finance
personalfinance,Legal to take advantage of IRS installment plan low interest rate?,"I had an unexpected LT capital gain earlier this year, and I do have funds to pay the 15% tax on it in full. Doing some research, it looks like I could request a payment plan with a .25% penalty rate + 3.25% interest (federal funds rate of .25 + 3%), or a total rate of 3.5%. This is significantly lower compared to the rate of return for my investments. Taking into consideration the risk of the federal funds rate skyrocketing or my investments significantly underperforming, would it be legal and financially sound for me to request a payment plan and invest the amount owed? It looks like the IRS doesn't take into consideration my current ability to pay, so seems like this is having a low interest loan? I must be missing something here.",finance
gaming,What's new in Borderlands 3? What other games are like BL3 for Co-Op,"My friend and I played a whole lot split screen co-OP. We have all the DLC up to Flustercluck Krieg lol. 

But we stopped playing pretty much right when that came out. I used Moze and he used Fl4k. He also has all 60 Amara but he had her before I joined in so our primary ones are Moze and Fl4k. We created new characters to play through together. I chose Zane and he chose Moze. 

We started discussing playing BL3 again so I was curious what's new in the last few months?

Any new weapons?

Any new missions?

What weapons got buffed and which ones got nerfed? 

Any new badass builds or meds?

I heard there was new trees? Does it make a huge difference? If so what exactly?

I tried reading the blogs and such but its hard to really tell what's new and going on since we left off. So if anyone could give a quick rundown or tell me what's most important and the biggest changes that would be awesome! Thank you!

I cross posted to BL3 subreddit but sometimes I get nothing from that SR lol.

But I also want to know what other games are good couch co op games? It's hard to come by very many good ones that are worth picking up and fun to play co op with.",technology
personalfinance,IRAs and savings goals,"We're working on our budget for 2021 which has brought up some questions for you lovely folks. Neither my wife nor I (29M) have opened up IRAs. My wife is currently a stay-at-home mom. She can't make any IRA contributions since her income is 0, right? I have focused my retirement savings on my 401k because my job matches at 50% up to the annual contribution limit. I've been able to max out my 401k and HSA, but it doesn't leave anything for an IRA. 

Aside from retirement, we have also been saving up money for a bigger house. We will be buying a new home in the next 1-3 years. We have $30k earmarked for that in a high interest money market account, but the interest rate has dropped significantly. Would there be a downside to putting $6k into a Roth IRA each year with the plan of pulling out our contributions to put towards a house? 

I know it is frowned upon to pull money out of retirement accounts, but it seems better than the money just sitting in a bank account. There is the volatility of the market too, which could potentially decrease my money if I need to pull it out while the market is low, but we do have enough flexibility that we could wait to withdraw. Am I missing anything?

personalfinance,Old company was bought out by new company and now has messed up my federal withholding and given us paper checks despite having new DD forms filled out back in October.,"Thanks for any help and advice in advance! So basically the company I previously worked for was sold/bought out by new company. Obviously old company had my W4 and should’ve turned it over to new company, but now I am listed as single and having a dependent instead of what was correct before (under old company) which is single with no dependent. Is this going to affect my income tax at all? I believe since they took over in December it might not affect it unless they don’t fix it before the next check (first check of 2021) but I am not 100% sure? Next problem is that they had meetings in October where we filled out direct deposit forms for the new company but 3 full work weeks/paychecks in and still only our store manager has direct deposit for his, literally just him no one else not even an assistant manager or anything, and now we have heard we probably will need to fill out new deposit forms but no reason was given to why we need to redo them which seems very odd how they did his but no one else’s??

How do I fix both issues at once (if possible)?
Do I need to fill out a brand new W4 and DD form too? Is there a certain order to how I should go forward?",finance
personalfinance,Question about auto debt,"I'm in a total pickle. I am about -$7,000 equity on my vehicle. I purchased it brand new and have been at 3 not at fault accidents. I've explored my options and I'm not in a position for devaluation claims. My auto insurance is about $160 a month and my car payment is currently $410 a month. I am really tempted to purchase a new vehicle. I still owe $15,000 on my vehicle, and I have 3.5 years left on the loan. The vehicle does not do well in my geographical area and quite honestly after this last accident I am just done with the car. 

I know its stupid to get another vehicle and roll over into a new loan. What other options do I have? I looked and I'll have a very similar vehicle payment and interest rate if I get a new vehicle. I'm not opposed to downgrading at all if it somehow saves me money. What are your thoughts/opinions/guidance?",finance
personalfinance,Pay off house after retirement?,"48 year old here, working in the federal gov't, married, 3 kids. Have emergency fund of $15K, don't have any debt besides the mortgage and that's what I'm thinking about. (Full disclosure..I've done NO math on the numbers below..just guestimates.)

We just bought a new house...mortgage is 30 yr fixed at 2.63%..and I started thinking that I'll be 78 when I pay that bad boy off...ugh. I've been maxing out my TSP (gov't version of 401K) and should be able to continue to do so until I retire which will probably be around 60. Right now, I have about $600K in there and I'm hoping I'll have over a million when I retire. House cost $380K so let's assume I owe $300K when I retire. I know I could grab all my TSP and pay off the mortgage in one fell swoop but then I'll have a pretty big tax for that year.  So, is there any reason I can't (or shouldn't) take out $50K a year and pay it off over 6 years? My tax burden will be much less and it'll be paid off! 

Other things I spose I should mention.  In retirement, I'll have my TSP, Social Security, a pension (~ $40K or so a year) and I'm also considered 60% disabled from my time in the Air Force so I've been getting ~ $1400/month, tax free.  This should continue until I'm pushing up daisies.  Wow, reading all this..seems like I have first world problems.  Ouch.  Well, any insight would be appreciated.  Happy New Year!",finance
personalfinance,Want to get rid of financed car but I'm not sure which is my best way out.,"Hey there! A year ago I got a 2008 Audi TT for $9,000. I put $3,000 down, and financed the rest at a 22% interest rate. My monthly payment is $275. My car insurance payment is $255, that is the cheapest one I was able to obtain through a family friend who works for the insurance company, I'm 19 years old so that doesn't help my case. I have paid most of the interest off and have about $5,000 left on the principal. 

I would want to get a new car soon, within the next couple of months. The car needs new parts, which, including labor, can cost me up to $1,100.  The car still drives like new, though, there are really no issues with it. I could sell the car for what I got it for since it has been appreciating over the past years. I was thinking on getting a $5,000 loan to pay off the car, sell it for $8,000- $9,000, privately, and: 1) Use that to buy cash a more recent, cheaper car like a 2010-2012 Honda Civic and save up for a year to upgrade later down the road (no pun intended) while still having that $5,000 loan and paying it off aggressively. Or 2) pay off the loan with what I got from selling the car and use the rest to buy a 2000-2004 Honda Civic which would allow me to save up more money. Money that I could slightly make grown by investing in the stock market, doing my due diligence and research, of course. 

Another option I thought about while writing this is keeping selling the Audi, using that as down payment for a more recent car, 2016 Toyota Corolla or 2016 Honda Civic, still have the $5,000 loan and try and pay it off as quickly as possible, and then focus on the payment of the new car. The problem with this is the higher insurance rate I might be paying. But having those two open credit lines might help my credit score out, right? 

I guess I have to think in terms of leverage and equity. Thanks for reading and I hope I made sense.",finance

XRP,"Unless the SEC has Ripple, Brad, and Chris has some type of evidence of those 3 saying xrp is shares in the company ""ripple"", legally they did nothing wrong. Just mimicking the federal reserve and treasury actions.","Isn't that legal? From my knowledge, yes it is. 


As from my understanding in the United States, currency is anything used in the exchange of goods or services and it doesn't matter who or how it's created. 

Take in account,  thousands of years ago people used seashells in exchange for goods and services, same thing with metal coins and paper of today. 

It's all basically built upon a belief system of what something is worth.

""Currency Definition"" https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp


Unless the SEC actually has a document, a video or audio recording of Brad, Chris, and Ripple telling someone that xrp is the same as buying shares in their company ""ripple"", I think legally the case is extremely weak and at most there will be a forced resolution with a few million as a fine since it's the USA federal government but at least the USA sec will lose this case.

The case will be done in the courts of new York south district aka NYC.


This case makes no sense to me because literally all USA cryptocurrency exchanges are subject to huge fines and lawsuits if xrp is found to be a security.

Basically the United states securities exchange commission is saying you as a private citizen cannot create your own currency, especially if it's created by a company which legally in the United states is considered to have the same rights as a human being. 

This is very strange to me and can't see how the sec has a strong case for this without officially defining the definition of currency for the entire United states government, that they cannot do because those definitions are only decided by a combination of all branches of government but initially started in the house and Senate. 

I'll be honest, if ripple loses,  I'm suing both coinbase, and kraken and I know I'm not the only one. 

Essentially,  the USA will bankrupt all these USA companies and lose thousands of jobs because of it.

I honestly don't think the u.s. will allow that to happen.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Need advice on Paying down student loan debt vs. Retirement/Investing,"Basically I am just looking for advice on where and how to manage the money I saved during 2020, the year of COVID. 

I'm 32, single

Rent: $1, living in one of my parent's houses. (No planned moves or changes anytime soon, milking it as long as I can)

Student loans: Private: 60k (18k at 5.3% and 42k at 4.5%. \~$1.1k payment a month total) Federal: $40k ($0 per month, deferred. Also the company I work for qualifies for forgiveness after 10 years)

Salary: $60k at 70% of full salary. Scheduled 5% raises every year and opportunities for overtime. Made $82k for 2020

401k and 457 with 5% contribution for each. Company does not match because we receive full pension and benefits when we retire.

My monthly expenses are relatively low, all I pay for is my lease, car insurance, cell phone bill and food. All insurance and benefits are covered by the company.

Because of the unsure COVID-19 economy I was basically saving most of my take home income and paying the minimum payments on my loans incase I were to be laid off or furloughed so I would have enough money to get me through. Lay offs and furloughs are no longer a concern so I'm wondering if the money I have saved is better used throwing into an investment account or simply paying off the entire $18k student loan. Which should free up about $470 a month. I plan to increase my 401k contribution by 5% once I get my raise in February.

I opened a Wealthfront investment account and threw $1k in there just to see how that will go. But, I feel like I'm sitting around with some money that could be either paying off my debt or invested and I don't know which way to go about it.

Polkadot,Equilibrium's approach on assessing system risk,"Synthetic assets and decentralized stablecoins will continue to be stable in value if borrowers either have excess collateral or if the insurance pool is sufficiently capitalized. Equilibrium stress tests collateral and bailsman pools on-chain, and the incentivizes borrowers or bailsmen  by scaling the interest rate, depending on the available liquidity. 

https://preview.redd.it/wpo1apukyq861.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8290f87118bd8aedb6d3ee68897e8c15467c435f

Equilibrium uses a methodology similar to the SEC’s Theoretical Intermarket Margining System (TIMS). The idea is that margin should be set to the maximum loss the portfolio would incur under adverse market scenarios. 

Equilibrium calculates system losses in the following way:

* Calculate value of the collateral/bailsman/debt pool in normal market conditions.
* Calculate collateral/bailsman/debt pool risk (portfolio volatility). 
* Calculate discounts (Value at Risk) for each pool given confidence value and pool volatility.  
* Calculate the value of the collateral/bailsman/debt pool in stressed market conditions.
* Calculate insufficient collateral:  insufficient\_collateral = max\[0, debt\_value \* (1 + debt\_discount) - collateral\_value \*(1 - collateral\_discount)\]
* Compare insufficient collateral with stressed insurance value to calculate the scale:  scale = (insufficient\_collateral / stressed bailsman pool value)\^alpha  Scale is initially bounded between 0.5 and 2. Alpha is a parameter that drives the steepness of the scale curve. 
* If there is more insufficient collateral than there is stressed bailsman liquidity, the scale is &gt; 1 and the borrowers' interest rates scale higher. If there is excess bailsman liquidity, the scale is &lt; 1 and borrower interest rates scale lower. This market mechanic strives to achieve equilibrium in system solvency. 

Insufficient collateral, however, can be a deceptive measure. Consider the following hypothetical system configuration:

https://preview.redd.it/im10edtgyq861.png?width=941&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=584d0d1ae8c07045ceb8db2b56cb742f70c19bb7

It makes no sense to include Borrower1's collateral and debt into aggregate values when calculating system risk, as this position is virtually risk-free and would lead to improper calculation of insufficient collateral. Equilibrium sets a cap on portfolio LTV, beyond which the portfolio is considered to be riskless.  So far we've covered risks related to expected and unexpected losses, but we haven't touched on the risks related to excess losses going beyond the stress levels we've set (the right tail in the chart above). In other words, what do we do when the bailsmen themselves get liquidated? Equilibrium uses treasury pool as a third line of defense, where EQ funds that accumulate from interest fees in the treasury are used to cover bailsmen losses.",cryptocurrency

# Initial observations:

* *Previously on Top Ten Crypto Experiments*: after a **$3000 investment** in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies, my combined portfolios were worth **$‭5,154**‬ ($435+ $2,432 +$2,287) as of the end of November 2020 - that’s **up about +72%** for the three combined portfolios
* Today's $1k purchase brings the total investment up to $4k since January 2018.
* The 2020 Dropouts:  BitcoinSV, Tezos, and EOS
* The 2021 New Additions: Polkadot, Cardano, and Chainlink
* ADA was in the Top Ten in 2018, took a two-year break, and is now solidly back in the Top Ten.
* The ""Three Year Club"" will be upgraded to the ""Four Year Club"" - this group is comprised of the only Cryptos to be in the Top Ten at the start each of the last four years.  They are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, XRP, and Litecoin

Other than that, it was an, um, interesting experience to buy BTC at over $29k after buying at over $13k three years ago.

# FAQs

**Q: You compare the Top Ten cryptos to the S&amp;P 500.  Wouldn't it be more fair to compare the top ten stocks vs. the top ten cryptos?**

A: I've thought about this quite a bit (monthly actually, for the last three years): what I'm after is a total crypto vs. total stock market comparison. Tracking the Top Ten Cryptos isn't perfect, but they usually make up about 90% of the total market. If I only tracked the Top Ten S&amp;P 500 by weight, I would only be tracking about 22% of the S&amp;P Index. A more fair comparison is the entire S&amp;P 500, which accounts for 75% of the entire US market.

Still imperfect comparing 90% of one thing vs. 75% of another, but still hopefully close enough to be useful.

**Q: You bought Tether?  Why?**

A: I debated back and forth on whether or not to include Tether for the 2019 and 2020 experiments (Tether is not in the 2018 Top Ten). At the end of the day, these are snapshots in time, so like it or not, Tether is in the Top Ten. In some ways, this whole experiment is turning out to be much more of a documentary or picture of a particular time in crypto rather than an investing strategy. 

Plus “Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments Minus Tether Plus Number Eleven” didn’t fit on my business card.

I try to be impartial, but no one gets into crypto for stablecoins. I do look back with fondness (and look forward to a future) when stablecoins aren't in the Top Ten. 

That said, these are exciting times in crypto.  These days you can get some pretty interesting interest rates even on stablecoins, something I may factor in going forward now that I am the proud owner of $300 worth of USDT.  I may do a stablecoin spin off experiment, where I report on different interest bearing platforms (Aave vs. Nexo vs. Celsius, for example).

**Q: Why bother actually buying all of these cryptos?**

A:  I found actually having some skin in the game has been motivating and has helped me to complete and share my monthly updates, even when all seemed dark and hopeless.

**Q: There's got to be an easier way to get exposure to the entire crypto market, right?**

A: Lots of smart people are working on it.  For example, check out what they're working on at [https://cryptex.finance](https://cryptex.finance/)

**Q: How long will you run the experiments/any plans to sell?**  

A: I'm still enjoying the experience, no plans to sell at the moment.

**Q: I hate Coin X, why is it included in the experiment?**

A: If it's in the Top Ten on January 1st, it's in the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiment, simple as that.

**Q: What about weighting?  Or rebalancing? Or selling and replacing a Top Ten dropout coin?**

A:  Weighting is interesting, but to be beginner friendly, I went for an even 10% allocation when I started three years ago and have kept it up for consistency's sake. Weighting would also lead to the rebalancing question, which is a bit advanced for this experiment.  Plus with only $100 investments, fees would eat me alive.  Similar to selling dropouts and buying ascending coins.  There's so much movement in crypto, not worth the fees.

personalfinance,"IRS still withholding refund filed in Jan 2020 has created a desperate situation, need advice","Timeline and summary first, questions at the end.

To be brief, we adopted a large sibling group from foster care (4+) that created a large tax offset (adoption tax credit).  We don't make enough to actually use that tax credit, until years later a layoff happened that resulted in a modest disbursal that included a fixed, up-front 25% tax withholding.   Come tax time (Jan 2020), the tax credit kicks in and fully negates the withholding, resulting in a moderate tax refund.

Timeline plays like this:

* Filed in Jan 2020, electronic, with auto-deposit, same as all prior years
* Accepted by IRS before Feb 15th, immediately put on hold due to new laws that require hold on returns with EIC/dependents - hold period allows up to 60 days
* COVID hits, shuts down IRS halfway through the hold period
* IRS opens back up in May-ish, they state they have a new 60 day period and the first one just gets magically reset because of the shutdown
* They run it out to day 60 and then say it's been flagged for review to determine if it should be audited - that generates another 60 day hold
* They run that timer out to day 60 and then determine, yes in fact, we are going to send this to the Audit/Exam department
* Audit/Exam department gets it, says ""Nope, this is 100% in order and never should have been sent to us"" and almost immediately kicks it back to the first group that's been holding it all year - that was early November
* First group says Okay you are clear, you should have refund by Dec 15th
* Call back around Dec 10th, get someone that is super helpful and explains that in fact, the processing group that has been holding it hasn't actually done anything at all with it - it's just sitting there, and from the date of my call they'll put in a referral requesting that something be done with it but that group now has a -  you guessed it - new 60 day timer to respond.
* I was further told in an indirect fashion that this would be a waste of time because they still wouldn't do anything at the end of the 60 days and it would be a good idea to contact Taxpayer Advocate

The referral to the advocate was set up - they were supposed to contact me within 7 business days.  No contact.   Attempt to contact them, it goes to a voicemail whose box is full and you can't leave a message.    And now the ""Where's my refund?"" link doesn't even work anymore because they've taken it down to ready it for the new tax year.

Mortgage is behind, debt is increasing, and there is literally no end in sight on this.  I fully understand COVID has messed everything up but while that may partly explain the situation it does not excuse it and I can't afford to simply leave it at that and walk away.   We are literally talking about someone just needs to click a mouse button to solve all my problems and I need help figuring out how to make that happen or find other ways to deal with the knock-on effects that the absence of this refund has caused (IE mortgage behind, debt, etc).     Yes, the stimulus will help deal with some of the debt but at this point that is like throwing a band-aid on a knife wound.

Is there any way to force or request some sort of supervisor intervention with the IRS?    Is there any workarounds to Taxpayer Advocate being completely non-responsive?   Is there any other suggestions or ideas about different ways to try and achieve resolution here or just suggestions in general on how to deal with this mess.   Any constructive input is greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Updating information here in case anyone searching reads this.   Finally received a call from the Taxpayer Advocates --- They are stupid busy and they will literally only call you one time and if you don't answer they will schedule a follow up that could be 1+ month out where they will again make one single call.  Make sure you answer every phone call until you have spoken with them if you go the TA route.   

TA was able to tell me in detail exactly why the return was being held.   The claimed tax withheld amount didn't match up with what they had on file due to unique circumstances (a severance) but the audit department declined to review it - not because it was not worthy of audit, but simply because they were understaffed and overworked and my case was small peanuts that fell below an arbitrary line to qualify for review.   So it was sitting in limbo until I could file an amended return.  Something that a half-dozen IRS reps could not tell me over an entire year despite specifically and repeatedly asking to verify if there was any issues or discrepancies.  

So, long story short - if you are having a hold up, don't be afraid to hit up to taxpayer advocates and perhaps get more concise information and quicker resolution.",finance

Forex,"No amount of news can explain impulse moves, or any moves. Watch price action","I always see people wondering why dollar did this, why did the pound do that, why is the euro this or that

In actuality, no amount of news or fundamentals will explain anything. Things are not as correlated as they seem, either. For instance the US stock market has hit ATH yet at the very same time the dollar has been weakening. Those who watch the DXY’s price action as opposed to watching news would see this

News is also there to distract, and if anything you should wait after news events like NFP/ FOMC. 

Either way, there will never be a true explanation for anything. If you backtest certain news events or rumors, the price always follows the trend anyway.

Lets say price is trending downward. News may spike the pair, especially if it stalled and showed slight upside momentum at a support (engulfings, moving averages, etc). It will more than likely spike, but then it continues down anyway. Its more profitable to wait after and get on that lower high point riding the trend

im in no way rich or whatever but the less you pay attention to the news, or even try to wonder WHY a price did this or that, you’ll never really get the correct answer. Forex and world markets dont give a shit about the vaccine either lol. people dont click buy when they hear a special report at 9am about vaccines, they were there buying low at 6:30am/7am when everyone was asleep. 

The ONLY thing that does show the future of a currency is the GDP and unemployment rate. Because if the unemployment rate is too high, Fed wont raise rates, meaning a weak dollar. Its just that simple. we have access to the same data they do. Facts over sensationalist news

Turns out, we've been fortunate enough to keep steady employment. I got the $600 stimulus today and I thought for a moment about dumping it into my student loans. But why should I take the money the government gave me and give it right back to them? We're getting married next year, am I crazy to think it makes more sense to pay this towards one of our vendors who is likely struggling?

personalfinance,Tracking Every Dollar in 2020,"Long-time r/personalfinance lurker... 32M with spouse and toddler - after many years of making money choices with ""How it felt"" and not really understanding where every dollar was going, I took the time to track all our accounts in 2020 and aggregate into a single spreadsheet to manage and thought I'd share.

**Here's a quick % breakdown of where our money went:**  
19.1% Retirement &amp; Savings (Beefed up Emergency Fund to 6 mo &amp; Increased Retirement Contributions)  
29.9% Mortgage &amp; Home Expenses (Utilities, Maintenance, Built a fence in the backyard, Refinanced 2x down to 3.5% then 2.5% for 30 yrs)  
14.0% Shopping &amp; Entertainment (71% of which was Target/Amazon)  
9.6% Transportation (Paid off both cars a year early)  
8.0% Daycare (Kids are expensive)  
7.6% Groceries  
5.0% Restaurants &amp; Dining  
2.3% Insurance (Auto &amp; Life)  
1.5% Health Care  
1.0% Travel  
2.0% Everything else

**What I learned:**  
\- Getting finances in order is a process, don't feel anxious to fix everything at once. Just take the first step and review your statements.  
\- Keep the number of credit card accounts to a minimum. The extra rewards/cashback are not worth the headaches of managing.  
\- It's a fun exercise to look through and pick off expenses that you don't provide value and upping your savings rate. Subscription services you don't utilize are easy pickings and will save you more than you'd think.  
\- Target Pick-up and Amazon are convenient, addicting services. Use cautiously and limit non-necessary items from your purchases.",finance

I keep hearing advice on paying off my student debt before investing further, but since my student loan interest rates are lower than the average rate of return of index funds (using 7% here), it seems like a waste of money to put extra money towards student loans instead of index funds. Wouldn’t it be smarter to be in student debt and be farther along in my goal of having $300k to use for a major milestone since capitalism considers student debt “good debt”?

- $300k for down payment/maintenance on a house or to leave the country (not sure which one yet, all I know is I’ll need $$$). Invest $500/month in index funds, increase to $2k/month starting Feb 2021.

financialindependence,From 10k to 955k in 7.5 Years (with Graph),"[Graph](https://imgur.com/R9aEdNR)

This is the my third year following up on the [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/e6mdm0/from_10k_to_650k_in_65_years_with_graph/) and [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bjghrb/from_10k_to_500k_in_6_years_with_graph/) financial review posts.

Honestly, not much has happened this year with the pandemic. My wife and 1.5 year old toddler basically stayed (and attempted to work) at home since March. Spending is pretty darn low (about 36% of our income) but we've been cooking some amazing meals. Missed some awesome vacations and have pretty much settled into a ""I never want to step into an office again"" mindset. This graph starts 6 months after graduating college when I had already accumulated 30k and ends on...well today(ish).

**This graph is for two people, not just me as of July 2015**

Since the last updated I've:

* Started a second Amazon Affiliate site that is now generating 2k a month with zero effort.
* Kept my toddler alive and unharmed
* Built an awesome outdoor kitchen with only the help of my wife

Some answers to common questions are below:

* This spreadsheet was built in google sheets using the stacked area chart type
* Wife and I are both 29 years old, live in Houston, TX and have a 1.5 year old. We got married in July of 2015. (This graph shows combined finances)
* Total expenses for the kid were 2k for ""stuff"" (furniture, car seats, crib, etc.) and 6k total for all birth, epidural, check-ups etc. Daycare is 1.1k a month. We've found this has had basically no effect on our overall savings rate at this stage of our FIRE journey. We are not saving separately for the kids college expenses but will instead just skim some of our investments off if need be.
* I managed to get 30k by myself after only 6 months out of college by working and saving from my 20hr/week job during college for 4 years and living extremely cheaply during my first year afterwards.
* Real estate is not included on this graph, for reference we currently have around 191k in equity in our home and owe 148k (total value of house is \~340k) . We have a 15 year mortgage at some absurdly low interest rate. We do pay off a little extra month because it makes me feel good. We'll pay it off in around 3 years or so. If you include real estate we've got over a million bucks!
* We keep a 30k emergency fund in my savings account for....emergencies.
* The dip in the middle of 2015 is when we bought our first house (224k 10% down payment) and then the month after I got married
* The dip in the end of 2018 is when the stock markets dipped a bit and we bought our next new construction house (340K 20% down payment)
* Wife and I are both engineers (Electrical and Mechanical respectively) in the oil and gas industry
* Paid off student loans somewhere in 2016, I don't remember when exactly as they were not astronomically high my wife had loans, I did not. In terms of ""family help"" my parents gave me 2k to use as a down payment on a car (which I still have) and sent me on my way. My wife had an old car already out of college which we no longer have.
* Our taxable investments are 100% invested in VTSAX with vanguard.
* I record data points for my graph at the end of each month and look at every account I have money in.
* We have no credit card debt and pay it off at the end of every month.
* Wife bough a new car this year (ugh) but at least it was a good deal and is less than $500/mo I think. It does not impact our savings rates.
* Salary for me went about as follows with 2 years between major increases (64K starting -&gt; 74K promotion -&gt;97k old job -&gt; 115k current job)
* Salary for my wife was (78k starting -&gt; 84k promotion -&gt; 93k promotion)
* Basic investment strategy (max 401k's-&gt; max IRA's -&gt; invest 80% of the rest in vanguard -&gt; pay a bit extra on the mortgage
* My end goal is 3MM by 40 years old where I plan to FIRE in style!",finance

Because of this, I won't be able to access any mail sent to the address I submitted to ZenBusiness to form my LLC.

ZenBusiness takes 11-14 days to form the LLC, and they have been out of the office due to the federal holidays.

Bitcoin,Two things that bother me about BTC...,"I'm loving the price rises, the start of a new bull run, the inflows from institutions, the favorable press from People Who Matter(TM) etc as much as anyone, and I'm holding forever because I buy into the long-term proposition that BTC is a generational store of value, like most capital assets, but...

1. Do we really know what the institutions' plans are medium- to long-term? I agree with the consensus that they're getting in at least partly to shield themselves from the beating that fiat is about to take from central banks, but what happens if/when central banks once again get a hold on inflation? What happens when interest rates pick back up? Institutions move in and out of gold under the same circumstances. For that matter, what if we're all wrong and the institutions are in this for the bull run? What if they're all planning to profit-take at $50k? I understand that any specific scenario on its own is unlikely, but my point is that their intentions aren't fully knowable. They can read charts much better than most of ""us"". They know when the last halving was. Maybe whales don't manipulate the price anymore, but I'm far from convinced that institutional investments constitute legitimacy on the same scale as precious metals yet.
2. Which brings me to point #2. How much of BTC's rise against fiat lately is pricing in the expectation of future fiat inflation? Everyone who genuinely thinks they're buying a Lambo when BTC hits $1M might be in for some serious disappointment when they discover that fiat inflation means that Lambos start at $4M by the time Lamborghini starts accepting payment in BTC. I'm exaggerating, of course, but on the other hand, BTC has risen about 430% (6784 to 29917) in the last 12 months as compared with USD. If you compare it with XAU, it's only 280% (5.59 to 15.74). Those are substantially different, and enough to make me concerned about the true value of the apparent price rise. Speculating is completely pointless at this stage, but I find it interesting to wonder what the ultimate ""fair"" price of goods in sats/BTC will be, and how sellers will behave.

Footnote to point 2: An additional thing to worry about there is why people will ever spend BTC. Unless we get to the (IMO, extremely unlikely) scenario of 100% global adoption as the sole means of exchange, the incentives will always be in favour of saving/investing BTC (no, maxis, DeFi is not going away. Yes people must be able to invest BTC and get a return, otherwise it forms a shitty economic system which people will abandon because it fails to allow for the creation of wealth.) and spending whatever alternative is less deflationary/provides less return. Basically the only way people will be incentivised to spend BTC is if their creditors only accept BTC for payment of debts and obligations. Otherwise you're using an inherently deflationary asset to pay inflationary obligations.

I realise these are not popular talking points. I realise I'm mixing short- and long-term problems in the same post. I am prepared for incoming thrown projectiles from people whose mellow I'm harshing. I'd love to have it explained to me what I'm missing that these worries aren't real concerns. Also, in this sub with all the threads about new ATHs every 20 minutes and the undeniable excitement because we genuinely are at the beginning of a new bullrun, it can be very lonely to feel like I don't know exactly what I'm buying long-term, and it'd be nice to know if anyone else shares these concerns.",cryptocurrency

investing,Where to start getting a self-education on international (primarily EU - US) financial &amp; legal corporate operating patterns?,"I have to start by exemplifying the things I want to learn about because I don't yet have even the language to ask my questions more specifically.

Example 1. Stocks for, let's say, Coca-Cola are listed at multiple exchanges across the world. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola exists both as a global entity with HQ registered in US and - the tricky part - as a collection of corporations each based in a different country, which may or may not be called Coca-Cola. For example there may be Coca-Cola Germany whose role and relationship to Coca-Cola US might seem obvious but there might also be Helenic Drinks Greece which plays the same role as Coca-Cola Germany but for Greece, Bulgaria &amp; Romania.

Interesting questions I want to clarify:

- When you buy Coca-Cola stocks on the, let's say, Istanbul Stock exchange, what are you actually getting in relation to this slew of legal entities all related to Coca-Cola US?
- What is the relationship between Coca-Cola stocks sold in US and those sold in other countries?
- Considering how Helenic Drinks from my example is a Greek company, how exactly does Coca-Cola US maintain executive and board control over this company? How is Coca-Cola's IP licensed to Helenic Drinks so that the latter can act in front of the public at large as if it's no different from Coca-Cola US? In what way could Coca-Cola US lose control over Helenic Drinks?

I want to learn the main international legal aspects that keep the collection of Coca-Cola corporations acting as a whole. I'm aware one can spend a lifetime becoming a pro in this domain but what I'm after is just critically important knowledge that an investor/entrepreneur should know. I know for practically-certain that certain international treaties regulating ownership across borders of both physical &amp; intellectual property rule this domain. This is why investors from US (as an example) don't go pouring money into countries with whom US doesn't have such treaties. Where do I even start learning about this?

Example 2. I'm an Eastern European (Romanian) and looking to establish a Romanian (i.e. in the EU) company whose only valuable asset will be IP. Because this company will operate on a very narrow market niche, I need to be careful from the get go about how I'm going to protect said IP.

Where do I start learning about how you register trademarks, patents &amp; write licensing agreements that are reasonably enforceable across borders when you are a small company? The ""reasonable"" part is extremely important here because there is no way a startup like mine could afford - for years - a lawsuit against a predatory company from US. So I need to be smart about my moves, make sure I'm in the right and strike, if needed, when I'll have the resources to do so.

Trading,10 Investment/Trading Ideas by UBS Analysts - Part 1,"\*Long post warning\*

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Long US Small cap over US Large Cap**

The significant underperformance of the Russell 2000 vs the S&amp;P 500 since mid2018, and really since early 2014, has left investors wary about reallocating to small caps. We see a number of reasons to favour small over large:

* Small caps have outperformed after recessions. The Russell 2000 has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 10pp-30pp in the year or so following the end of recessions (Figure 141). Additionally, our ISM cycle work also shows considerable outperformance of small caps in the early stages of a cycle. The depth of the COVID shock and likely solid recovery is a good set-up for small caps, in our view.
* Small cap earnings are recovering fast, with greater upside to 2022 earnings. Small cap (S&amp;P 600) forward earnings estimates have recovered at an exceptional rate since the collapse in H1'20. Current NTM EPS estimates for small caps have caught up to S&amp;P 500 forward estimates, normalised to expectations at the beginning of the year. Small cap forward earnings could rise 27% over the next 12mo+ if 2022 expectations hold – 9pp more than the potential forward EPS increase for the S&amp;P 500. Importantly, earnings momentum for small caps is much stronger than for large caps. Small cap Q3 2020 EPS ended up beating consensus expectations by a massive 67% in aggregate, compared to a 17.5% earnings beat for the S&amp;P 500, which was still a record.
* Small caps at \~12% discount to S&amp;P 500, biggest since 2002. The S&amp;P 600 small cap index is trading at 19.5x forward earnings, or a 12% discount to the S&amp;P 500, which is the largest discount since 2002. Small caps have typically traded at a premium, given the many small firms that have negative earnings, so the current discount is \~24pp below the historical average. Additionally, the dividend yield for US small caps relative to the S&amp;P 500 is still well above average levels, and points to further upside for US small caps over large caps.
* Vaccine sensitivities suggest small caps could outperform further. Small caps outperformed large caps by \~2pp on major vaccine news days, implying there could be significant further potential outperformance of small caps vs large caps on continued vaccine momentum and economies reopening.

**Tl;dr:**

* After past recessions, Russell 2000 outperformed S&amp;P 500 by 10pp-30pp during the following year.
* Earnings momentum for US small caps is much stronger than for large caps, highlighted by the 67% aggregate Q3 earnings beat for small caps.
* Small caps are trading at a big discount to large caps despite better earnings momentum and higher expected growth into 2022.

**2. Long US Health Care over US Staples**

* Collaborating with UBS Healthcare analysts, we assessed the potential impacts of election scenarios for the key policy issues in detail. We see a Biden win and split Congress as a good outcome for drug pricing, ACA and other issues. We think progress on Healthcare policies via legislation is less likely, beyond must-pass items such as Medicare/tax extenders. Overall, lower policy risk should be reflected in many areas of Healthcare where policy was an overhang.
* Healthcare policy overhang is still priced. Healthcare is trading at a \~26% P/E discount vs the S&amp;P 500, near a 30y high, with discounts within Healthcare subsectors also considerable for those segments exposed to regulatory risk. Thus upside could be notable as uncertainty fades. Within the Healthcare sub-industries, many of the affected areas are trading 15pp to 25pp below average relative discounts: Biotech, Pharma, HC Tech, HC Services, Distributors, Managed Care and Facilities. On the other side, Life Sciences, Equipment and Supplies are trading 15pp+ above prior average relative levels. Some of the relative repricing has likely been driven by the fall in interest rates – valuing growth more in a low-rate world. But some of the relative repricing likely also reflects the risks from the election.
* Managed Care and Hospital stocks have rallied 20% on average in the 6mo following elections. The anomaly is likely due to the large discount that typically gets priced in for regulatory risk, which eventually reverses as uncertainty recedes. The forward P/E for Managed Care going into the 2020 election was at a \~36% discount to the S&amp;P 500, slightly greater than the average 33% discount. Hospitals show a similar pattern. Pharma in this election has also priced more risk, with drug pricing reform an overhang. We see further upside ahead for Healthcare as that policy risk re-prices and growth should remain solid, particularly relative to other defensive sectors.
* Healthcare is the preferred defensive, with upside vs Staples. On 2022 earnings, Healthcare is trading at a 23% discount to Consumer Staples, just above historic lows. Healthcare could lag in a recovery, but Staples have seen a pull forward in demand during the pandemic from the stay-at-home theme. Reopening and vaccine adoption would be a headwind to near-term Staples growth. Relative re-rating potential for Healthcare can provide upside vs defensives in a recovery.

**Tl;dr:**

* A Biden win/split Congress is a good outcome for drug pricing/ACA.
* Healthcare is trading at a \~26% P/E discount vs the S&amp;P 500, near a 30y high. Within the Healthcare subindustries, many of the affected areas are trading 15pp to 25pp below average relative discounts.
* We see further upside for Healthcare as policy risk re-prices and with growth remaining solid.
* Reopening and vaccine adoption would be a headwind to near-term Staples growth.

**3. Long UK &amp; Germany over Spain &amp; Italy**

* UK: This year, the underperformance has accelerated. This underperformance has left relative valuations to Europe on P/E, P/BV and dividend yield all at, or close to, 20-year lows. And that extreme valuation discount is not due to just one or two sectors, but is actually widespread across the whole market. Out of 24 UK sectors, 18 currently trade on larger P/E discounts to their European peers than their 15- year average. Additionally, the UK has superior earnings momentum relative to Europe. We favour banks.
* Germany: Germany has the cyclicality and exposure to a global economic recovery. It is now cheap on both relative P/E and cyclically adjusted P/E. The dividend yield premium to Europe is near an eight-year high. Earnings momentum is above the rest of Europe.
* Spain: Spain has the weakest relative earnings momentum in nine years and is likely to see the weakest profit recovery into end-2021 – with earnings expected to still be 24% below 2019 levels. Our macro team also points out the relatively poor macro backdrop. Spain currently ranks 12th out of the 12 countries on our European country scorecard.
* Italy: Italy has underperformed, but only broadly in line with the relative earnings momentum deterioration. Additionally, we see only limited further tightening of the BTP-Bund spread – a key driver

**Tl;dr:**

* Both the UK and Germany have high cyclicality and cheap valuations relative to the rest in Europe.
* Spain has the weakest relative earnings momentum in nine years. Italian valuations re-rating exhausted along with BTPs.

**4. Long Korea over China**

* Korea, as a cyclical market (72% of the index) has tended to outperform in phases of industrial recovery, such as we expect in 2021. China, on the other hand, has outperformed in 2020 on the back of: (1) being first in and first out of the virus, and (2) having a relatively positive sector exposure that is skewed to 'new economy' sectors benefiting relatively from changing consumption patterns around the pandemic. What changes in 2021 is the ongoing shift to a global manufacturing recovery, while the delta on growth in China does not move to the same degree. On top of this, Korea is at the 20th percentile of its relative valuation range compared to China over the past 10 years.
* To some extent, this trade has shades of Value versus Growth, but in neither market are the Financials a large part of the index (8% in Korea, 14% in China), so in reality this is more about an industrial cyclical recovery compared with a tapering off in performance from 'new economy' stocks in an economy that has already largely recovered and opened up. Moreover, the largest stocks in China now face recent and unexpected regulatory headwinds, while we have a very positive view of the memory semi cycle, which plays into the largest sector by market cap in MSCI Korea.

**Tl;dr:**

* Korea to outperform through the 2021 industrial recovery. Korea's relative valuation to China is in the bottom quintile of its historical range.
* Strong memory semi cycle should help Korean IT trump China's internet companies exposed to regulatory risks.

**5. Long Europe reopening basket over North Asia reopening basket**

* While many Asia-Pacific countries have been lauded for their handling of the pandemic, this could potentially be a relative equity challenge in 2021. As vaccines become available, the incentive to open up is likely to be higher among populations where the virus is more embedded. Conversely, the threshold to open up borders in economies where the virus has been largely eliminated is likely to be much higher. Even as vaccines are provided to the most vulnerable in society, we think governments in economies where the virus is less prevalent will be less willing to open up at the same pace, having worked so hard to reduce transmission close to zero.
* This creates an interesting scenario where domestic mobility and global travel restrictions ease more rapidly in populations where the virus is endemic, compared to those in parts of APAC where virus management has been strict and effective (for example China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand).
* How to think about this in terms of equities? There are a few ways to play this. One is to go overweight the vaccine-sensitive stocks in Europe, versus the same group in Asia. In Europe, the sectors that have performed best on vaccine news are Healthcare Equipment, Construction Materials, Autos, Capital Goods, Transportation, Consumer Durables and Consumer Services. Many of these consumer-related sectors might benefit more from a more broad-based and international opening up, than the more domestic opening up that has happened hitherto in China.
* Figure 150 and Figure 151 show the relative performance and relative valuation (given cyclically depressed earnings, we use P/Book) of these sectors in Europe to those in Asia – the European sectors are considerably less expensive in relative terms compared to Asia, while performance has also suffered in relative terms.

**Tl;dr:**

* APAC economies that dealt with COVID-19 faster and more efficiently are likely to wait longer to fully reopen even as the vaccine is rolled out.
* In Europe, consumer-related sectors might benefit more from a more broad-based and international opening up. In China, the gains in those sectors might have run out of steam.

Trading,10 Investment/Trading Ideas by UBS Analysts - Part 2!,"\*Long post warning\*

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Long Mexico over Brazil equities**

* Our preference for MSCI Mexico over MSCI Brazil is driven in part by a more favourable macroeconomic outlook in Mexico, where we expect GDP growth in 2021 to recover to 4.3%, versus 3.0% in Brazil. As a major trading partner, Mexico is well placed to benefit from a stronger US economy next year, now that presidential election uncertainties are largely behind us. From a fiscal sustainability perspective, Mexico is also better positioned, with public debt/GDP estimated at 53% next year versus 97% in Brazil. Additionally, Mexico would likely benefit more from an early rollout of an effective vaccine. In a positive vaccine scenario, our economics team forecasts Mexico's 2021 GDP growth increasing 200bp versus the base case – the largest improvement among the countries under our EM coverage (Figure 152).
* Earnings momentum turned positive in Mexico in September 2020, after over six months of downgrades. With 3Q20 earnings in Mexico beating consensus expectations by 38%, we believe there is further upside risk to 2021 earnings estimates. In contrast, Brazil posted a 4% earnings miss in 3Q20. Mexican equities also offer compelling valuations, in our view, trading on a 12- month forward P/E multiple of 14.3x. Relative to MSCI EM, it trades at the 16th percentile of its long-term valuation history. This contrasts with MSCI Brazil, which is currently trading at the 83rd percentile (see Figure 153).
* The key risk to our views is FX, given the sharp depreciation in the BRL relative to the MXN this year. To neutralise this potential risk, we recommend simultaneously buying BRL/USD and selling MXN/USD, which we estimate would cost c2.2% pa.

**Tl;dr:**

* Better 2021 economic outlook in Mexico than in Brazil.
* In Mexico, vaccine upside risk is the highest in MSCI EM.
* In Q3, earnings beat in Mexico but missed in Brazil.
* In Mexico, valuations are among the cheapest across EM.
* A stronger BRL is a key risk to this trade. We thus recommend hedging.

**7. US 5s30s steepener**

* Over the past six months the correlation between 5s30s and 10yr rates has been 0.87. So 5s30s is simply another way to be short the market but with less painful carry and roll than being outright short 10s. That carry and roll dynamic is why we prefer steepeners to shorts when 5s are closer to 40bp, but would shift to outright shorts when 5s get to 30bp, as the carry and roll on 5s deteriorates as yields get closer to IOER (now 10bp). Anyone who owns 5s as a way to help a carry on a short position should stop owning those 5s when low yields mean they add more risk and less carry.
* As we discussed in the supply section, in Q4 2019 the market needed to absorb about $34bn of 10yr equivalents of Treasury supply each quarter (issuance less Fed buying less rolldown). In Q4 2020 the market will need to absorb about $255bn of 10yr equivalents. And assuming that the Fed starts tapering in Q3 of 2021, the market will need to absorb about $355bn of 10yr equivalents in Q4 2021.
* Supply tends to have a much more powerful impact on longer maturities. First, the front of the curve is much more firmly anchored by policy expectations than is the long end. Second, the amount of Treasuries in the 5yr duration bucket depends far more on how many 7s, 10s, and 30s are rolling into that bucket than by the size of the 5yr auction, where there is no rolldown into the long end.
* Back in the 2013 taper tantrum, 5s30s was fairly stable, as the impact on the back end from reduced expectations of Fed buying was matched by expectations that tightening would come sooner – which pushed up 5yr yields. This time, we think the FOMC's new strategy of leaving its Fed funds target unchanged until inflation sustainably hits 2% means tapering of purchases is less likely to sharply increase expectations of near-term tightening.
* Term premiums have rebounded in recent months, but they remain quite low by historical standards. We expect left tail risks to diminish in 2021, leading to a rise of 20-30bp in the 10yr term premium.

**Tl;dr:**

* We tactically move from 5s30s to outright shorts if 5s fall to 30bp, as 5s are part of the trade mainly to help carry and roll. And 5s won't carry or roll well below 30bp.
* The market is currently absorbing about 7½ times the dollar duration that it absorbed in Q4 2019. We think that will rise to 10x by Q4 2021.
* The Fed's new strategy of waiting for inflation to move above 2% before tightening means the Fed should be able to taper without sharply pulling forward tightening expectations.

**8. Receive Aus 10y Pay NZ 10y**

* Our highest conviction cross-market rates trade for 2020 is to buy AU 10Y bonds (or 10Y futures) vs pay NZD 10Y IRS. AUD 10Y yields are presently \~10bp over NZD 10Y IRS and fair value based on our forecasts has AUD 10Y bonds \~40bp below NZD.
* Our RBA policy view is more dovish than market pricing, and our structural model suggests 10yr bonds are currently cheap vs fair value (FV is \~0.7%). We expect RBA QE will eventually have a dampening impact on ACGB term premium; especially given the already reduced free-float.
* In contrast, the NZD rates market has still to fully price our view of: (1) no rate cuts in 2021 (NZD OIS is currently pricing a terminal OCR of \~0%); and (2) an ongoing taper in RBNZ weekly buybacks as the Bank approaches \~50% ownership of the NZGB market. This should shift the whole NZD curve higher, and steepen up as term premium should move higher vs current levels on a less favourable supply/demand outlook. Indeed, we estimate that fair value for 10y rates is currently at \~1.2%.
* This trade combines the market where we are the most bullish and the market where we are the least bullish (relative to market pricing). It embeds our views on relative monetary policies (RBA and RBNZ stances to converge, as the RBA turns more dovish and adds to QE and the RBNZ tapers its buybacks), and relative supply dynamics (with net-net issuance expected to be negative in Australia, vs a small but positive net-net issuance in New Zealand).

**Tl;dr:**

* The AUD market is cheap to our fair value model, and should be strongly supported by the RBA…
* …whereas NZD is pricing in rate cuts that are unlikely and is failing to price in tapering by the RBNZ.

**9. Pay 5y5y UK real rates**

* Our expectation that both of the major challenges to the UK's economic situation and outlook – the uncertainty surrounding the end of the Brexit transition period, and the duration and extent of the pandemic's impact on activity – are set to ease significantly over the coming months leads us to anticipate higher yields over the course of 2021. Our trade recommendations and positional bias are therefore constructed to benefit from rising rates, but no meaningful moves are likely at the front end any time soon.
* The MPC adopted forward guidance in mid-2020, stating that the Committee does not intend to tighten policy until there is clear evidence that significant progress is being made in eliminating spare capacity and achieving the 2% inflation rate sustainably. With unemployment forecast to peak at 7.3% in Q2 2021, and to remain above 5% until the end of 2022 (UBSe), the rates market is highly unlikely to price in any meaningful prospect of rate hikes for some considerable time, given this guidance.
* We therefore focus on forward starting rates, which are much less influenced by the near-term policy outlook, and specifically the 5y 5y real rate. Its strong correlation with outright 10y nominal rates (Figure 158) confirms its explicitly bearish bias, while our view that inflation expectations will remain anchored, or could even dip further in the coming months on worries about a persistent output gap and limited policy effectiveness to respond given the proximity of the lower bound, leads us to favour the trade in real rather than nominal rates.
* Although both Brexit and the pandemic are yet to be resolved, relatively positive developments have recently triggered a modest rise in yields. However, as Figure 159 shows, this has occurred alongside lower inflation expectations and therefore seen a more pronounced rise in real than in nominal rates – this is the dynamic we expect to see more of over the coming months, and we recommend paying the 5y 5y UK real swap rate (v SONIA).

**Tl;dr:**

* We expect the easing of the major headwinds affecting the UK to result in higher yields.
* Forward guidance means the front end, however, should remain anchored near current levels.
* We recommend paying in forward space, and favour real rates as inflation expectations may decline further over the coming months.

&amp;#x200B;

**10.EUR 10s30s forward steepener**

* A steeper EUR10s30s curve is our high-conviction structural trade recommendation. While the curve has steepened by \~5bp since end-June and sustainably traded above the 20bp level, it remains one of those few structures that have not regained its pre-COVID highs. We recommend implementing the trade in forward space to benefit from the positive roll-down (7bp/year).
* Our trade thesis rests on the following factors, absolute and relative:

(1) Historically, the curve (currently at 25bp) has flattened below 20bp only in a few episodes in the past 20 years, and in each case the flattening was short-lived. Naturally, once long-end rates reached levels where demand – even from preferred-habitat investors – dried up, the curve stopped flattening.

(2) Alongside this favourable starting point, the launch of the EU recovery fund in May has removed Euro area fragmentation risks and reduced the likelihood of a significant bull-flattening of the curve on Euro area break-up fears.

(3) The significant amount of monetary and fiscal accommodation in the system has provided a floor for risk sentiment. Thus, even though the economic outlook has deteriorated recently because of the tightening of mobility restrictions, markets have not hit an airpocket as they did in March/April.

(4) On a relative basis, while the rest of the G4 10s30s curves have recovered their post-COVID flattening, albeit from less flat levels, EUR10s30s is still lagging.

(5) While the EUR10s30s curve has generally kept pace with the gradual improvement in MSCI Europe, the curve has not moved commensurately to the broader risk rally on vaccine optimism, leaving room for a catch-up higher.

And (6) finally, the significant amount of EU issuance (SURE and recovery fund) over the coming years should also put steepening pressure on the curve, all else equal. Thus, the EUR10s30s forward steepener remains our preferred position for normalisation from the COVID shock and a successful vaccine outcome. It is important to highlight that the EUR10s30s steepening view can also be expressed by better roll-down structures like: receiving the belly of 2y2y/5y5y/10y10y fly, receiving 5s10s30s 1y forward and 5y5y/10y10y steepener.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr:**

* EUR10s30s forward steepener is our structural trade recommendation in EUR rates.
* Past flattening episodes have rarely persisted below 20bp as real-money demand dries up when long-end yields reach very low levels.
* Significant monetary and fiscal accommodation puts a floor under risk sentiment.
* EUR10s30s still lagging its G4- peers, which have already steepened beyond pre-COVID levels.

personalfinance,Home Improvement Loans,"Hi all,

My partner and I just purchased our first home and would like to make some improvements to the property in the coming months, and although we have a little cash, we were wanting to finance a loan to pay for the improvements, which will the work will be approximately 20k. We make ~$145k/year collectively and our mortgage payment is $2500/month. Both around 800-810 on credit scores. No collateral. 

I can’t find too much info on this so the question is, when looking for a home improvement loan, how many lenders should we be looking at while shopping around? And how does that look to the lenders regarding hard inquires on our credit scores? 

Also, as far as success with best interest rates, does anyone have any recommendations as far as lenders?

Thank you for any help you can offer! Thanks :)",finance
personalfinance,Which extended student loan repayment plan should I choose?,"I have a consolidated federal student loan with a balance of $31,000. I would like to pay down at least half or more of the balance in 2021. I'd like to shoot for loan payoff in 24 months or less. I am currently on the REPAYE plan and my payments are scheduled to resume at about $457/mo. I want to lower my payments as much as possible but still make payments of about $1300 monthly. 

I wish to account for dramatic shifts in income if I were laid off. I need to choose between the Extended Repayment plan and the Graduated Extended repayment plan. I believe that the Extended Graduated plan increases the monthly amount every two years. I can't find by how much the payment increases and if there is a cap. There is no cap under the REPAYE plan which is why I am exiting before my loan balance gets to low to make me eligible for these options.

With the Extended Repayment plan, my required monthly payment would be about $230/month. With the Graduated Extended Repayment plan, my required payment is about $156/month for the first two years, but would rise every two years. Which one is the better plan?",finance
personalfinance,Transferring and/or consolidating Under New Servicer a Remedy for a History of Late Payments on Student Loans,"My husband has four federal student loans through Nelnet. He somehow missed payments a few years ago for three months and now each loan shows three missed payments, which obviously are hurting his credit. I have missed payments due to not getting my mail at my current address, but Great Lakes did not record it on my credit report. Lucky me. 

If he were to transfer these loans to a new servicer like Great Lakes would the history of late payments transfer, too? Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I am having trouble finding answer on google.   


Too, are his loans already consolidated since they are all under Nelnet? Or, could they be further consolidated. I think two are subsidized and the other two are unsubsidized if that info helps.",finance
Bitcoin,Anyone else using Bitcoin as a store of wealth as the Fed pumps cash into circulation?,"Disclaimer: Not an economist. But, I've done some research on the current financial environment of the US dollar and the economy, and we are definitely in uncharted territory. Over 20% of all USD was printed last year, and a lot of it went to buying stocks through quantitative easement. 

In this post I break down investment vehicles into 4 main groups.

* Cash and bonds.
* Equity (stocks, real estate, anything regularly traded on the equity exchanges and has been propped up by quantitative easement.
* Gold. You can buy this on equity exchanges but it behaves differently, so I separated it.
* Alternative Investments (baseball cards, rare antiques, piles of dogshit, whatever).

My understanding of what is currently happening:

1. Interest rates are basically 0. That means bonds are not a feasible investing vehicle. So, you can't invest your cash risk free.
2. Over 20% of all USD was printed in 2020. [Just look at the M1 money supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1).
3. This money has been used to buy all kinds of financial assets (stocks, junk bonds, real estate, ETFs, etc.) which has propped up the stock market. People are also starting to speculate that assets are rising in price as a hedge against inflation.
4. Consumer prices (the price of a cheeseburger) has not really changed because... this money is not being spent. It sits in the stock market because there's nothing else to do with it. Do you want to open up a business right now? Go on vacation? Buy more clothes? There really isn't anything to do except pay down debt and buy assets, which is what people have been doing. But the USD is still there.

I'm under the impression that the price of equity has been rising because of both inflation and the fact that the FED is buying it up. The demand is artificial and can't last forever. So, shouldn't stocks be overvalued even after taking inflation into account? Shouldn't we expect a big dip when things start opening back up and people want to use their cash for something that isn't overvalued?

Enter Bitcoin. **I would like to know people's thoughts on my understanding of Bitcoin. I am not an expert.** It is similar to the USD in that it has no intrinsic value. The main difference is that no government can just decide to print more of it. What is the actual value of 1 bitcoin? Unlike gold or real estate, it doesn't really have a true value. It can be mined, so if price sky-rockets to $1 billion then the number of miners will increase which helps stabilize prices, however I find it a better hedge against inflation than other assets because:

1. Gold. Has 'intrinsic value' in that it can be worn as a sign of wealth. It also has practical uses because of its physical properties, but that doesn't really affect the price. It can be used as a hedge against inflation, but unless people believe we are entering some apocalyptic scenario, there is only so much people are going to be willing to pay to wear gold on their wrist, unlike bitcoin, which isn't tied to something intrinsic.
2. Cash. Governments can print more, as the Fed is doing right now. You want cash on hand if you think the price of assets are going to fall. Cash right now is obviously a terrible investment.
3. Equity. The reasons listed above. Artificial demand + printing money means stocks are overvalued.
4. I believe real estate, since it is seen as a traditional investment and is available on equity exchanges under the form of REIT's and others, has gone the way of stocks. The FED has been purchasing REITs and mortgage bonds as a part of QE.
5. Alternative investments (baseball cards, piles of lumber, whatever you can think of). I find these similar to gold, but they have 1 advantage. There is only so much people are going to be willing to trade for baseball cards, however you can't really buy these on equity exchanges. The FED hasn't been propping up the price artificially, so why should I believe their prices can be inflated by QE? I would also like to know people's thoughts on this.

The cons of bitcoin are that it can simply be banned. I don't have the foresight or knowledge to know what kind of havoc that may cause, or what could be used to justify it. It is also a digital asset, if the nukes fall, I guess you were better off with gold or piles of lumber weren't you.

This is all coming from the point of view of an individual investor, which I am. I am not a hedge fund who has billions to invest. I have a few hundred thousand, and it's extremely liquid right now. I don't think the general public has caught on to the idea that maybe 'gold that has no intrinsic value' might actually be a good investment vehicle.

personalfinance,I have taken a loan to pay off my credit card bills and now with my severance payment I’m wondering what should I do with the money,"So I had credit card debts around 200k, not USD. I managed to get few loans and instalments with around 6% interest rate to pay off the debts and now I have 24-60 months loans and instalments. Including my insurance payment, I have a 10k fixed payment every month.
Unfortunately, I was one of the people who got affected during the redundancy, and was paid around 200k severance payment. If I have known that I wouldn’t have taken the loan and just pay all my bills with the money I got. 
Now the problem is, I have no saving, I have 2 part time jobs that I have a pay check between 5-8k every month. I planned on having 1/3 of my severance into a saving acc, 1/3 for investment, the rest will be put into my online bakery business while I work part time jobs.
After doing my budget and realised that my salaries from my part time jobs aren’t enough to cover all my payments, now I’m a little bit panicking and rethink about my plan with my money.
Should I reserve all my money to pay off my loans and instalments instead of dividing them into 3 as I planned? Or should I pay off one of the loans/instalments now even though I’ll have to pay more? I’m considering finding a full time job but with this economy I’m not optimistic. Thank you in advance.",finance
personalfinance,35/USA looking for advice on my current investment/debt payoff/house purchasing scenario,"Hope to hear some positive and informative feedback here! :)

My situation -- 35/M, ~75k sitting in 401(k) and looking for 2021 to be a big year of either debt payoff (4%+ car payment/student loans) or saving cash for a house.

That being said, see below:

I dropped my 401(k) from $15k per year down to the minimum that meets my employers match which is 4%. I was investing $1250 per month into my 401(k), which is $625 per paycheck. 
BUT, now that I dropped that to 4% I am not getting $625 back in my paycheck every month -- I am getting about $400. That's a lot of monthly $$$ going to taxes instead of my 401(k).

Is this still truly the best option for the long-term? I have no inheritance, single income household, no expected money coming my way other than what I earn...

My highest interest loans are as follows:

1) My car loan (4.6%) with about $10.5k left 2) Federal Student loan 4.66% @ $5480 balance 3) Federal Student loan 4.66% @ $7288
All other loans are &lt;3.5% and amount to around $20k total.

If I keep my 401(k) at 4% for 2021, I lose $5450 going into my 401(K) because of the income being taxed before it hits my bank account, BUT I can pay off those three %4.6 loans. However, that means it will be at least 1 more full year before I can save money for a down payment on a house.

I feel like if I go this route I will be close to 40 before owning a home and I wonder if paying 1600 a month for rent is just burning money away. That's another $38,400 over the next two years in rent alone...

SO, is it better to pay off those loans in 2021 or save to buy a house around this time next year?",finance

&amp;#x200B;

**11.Long GBPCHF**

* Long GBPCHF offers extreme value as a leveraged play to vaccine-driven normalisation, supplementing direct long EURUSD exposure and keying off what looks like an imminent Brexit deal. From a spot handle of 1.20 today, we envisage a rally to between 1.30 and 1.40 in 12 months' time.
* The bearish CHF case continues to build. Reduced geopolitical uncertainties associated with the recent US election outcome are freeing the way for more intense focus on progress with COVID vaccines. Rising confidence in a cyclical upswing can be expected to weigh on the franc, especially at the point when lockdown concerns ease. Hurdles for further significant CHF appreciation have only grown, meanwhile. The ECB's PEPP programme has anchored peripheral spreads not only in nominal but also in volatility terms (Figure 162). The SNB remains resolute in its commitment to counter further CHF gains, given its lack of alternative tools and Switzerland's deflationary backdrop. And a Biden administration is probably less likely to press the charge of currency manipulation.
* Sterling trends, too, have been closely correlated with the global business cycle since the 1980s (Figure 163). This is intuitive given the UK's degree of economic openness, and bodes well for a recovery in global growth into 2021. Naturally, dynamics have changed since the 2016 referendum. But cheap valuations offer hope for at least a partial snap-back in compensation, and the UK stands to benefit more than most in 2021, having being hit particularly hard by the pandemic.
* Moreover, the latest news flow points to an EU-UK free trade agreement being struck just in time for year-end ratification by the EU Parliament. Given markets – and hedge funds specifically – are under-positioned for such an outcome, we would expect a meaningful bounce for GBP on even a ‘skinny deal' outcome.
* The main risk to our view is that a global recovery is slow to gather sufficient steam and pique perceptions of higher returns abroad for Swiss investors, or at least encourage them to reduce FX hedges. Without this GBPCHF could be stuck at low levels for longer regardless of how low the bar to outflows has become.

Tl;dr:

* GBPCHF topside is an extreme value proposition.
* Structural CHF downside with few upside risks.
* Sterling remains levered on the global business cycle…
* …with Brexit a near-term likely positive catalyst.
* Key risk remains a sluggish global recovery.

**12.Long 6m EUR call USD put**

* On EURUSD, we would advocate plain vanilla options in 3-6m tenors to participate in a swift repricing of the USD cycle which could take the single currency quickly through our 1.23 forecast. On a 6 vol handle and with neutral skew, 25 delta calls are not pricing such as scenario even remotely. By way of illustration, assume the fundamental drag exerted on the USD coupled with the combined European fiscal and monetary actions have reduced euro downside to 1.14 next year. A repeat of this year's 14 figure range would imply a high for the single currency of 1.28 at some point in 2021. An annual fluctuation consistent with its 45-year average would extend the range to 1.40 (Figure 164 and Figure 165). Hence, selling puts to fund topside provides a compelling way to reduce premium further and obtain an additional delta kicker, in our view.

Tl;dr:

* Option markets do not price euro upside asymmetry – buy EUR calls.

**13.Long Asia HY over Asia IG**

* We initiate a long Asia USD HY vs Asia USD IG recommendation based on our view that positive vaccine sentiment, stronger 2021 global growth and the demand for yield globally will drive spread compression of \~125bp over the next six months from 586bp currently.
* Asia USD HY spreads at 745bp continue to trade close to 1.5-2.s.d. cheap relative to Asia USD IG spreads, USD HY spreads and EMBI spreads (Figure 166). In our base case, based on our model estimates, we expect Asia USD HY spreads to tighten from 745bp currently to 600bp in H1 2021, as excess liquidity risk premium fades on the back of PPI prices moving back into positive territory (+2% y/y) and y/y TSF (ex-Equity) growth averaging 12.5% in H1. Over the same period, we expect Asia USD IG spreads to tighten by only 20bp to 140bp. We also expect the current carry premium (586bp) on offer to force investors to reach for yield, especially with Asia USD IG spread currently at the 21st percentile over the past 10 years. While many investors will likely point to a falling 12m China credit impulse as being a key downside risk for the largely policy-driven Asia USD HY market, we don't think this is likely to be a headwind for spreads until H2 2021, when the credit impulse falls to -5.3% (from 13% currently) and we start to see defaults pick up (\~4%) as a result. Tighter regulation (via the 345 rule) for Chinese property developers (40% of Asia USD HY index) will likely drive greater differentiation among credits, but won't be enough to drive broad-based weakness at the index level.
* In terms of the return convexity, the best scenario for this trade would be if positive vaccine sentiment drives stronger global growth in 2021 but the demand for yield globally remains equally resilient as policy globally (including TSF ex-Equity growth y/y) remains accommodative. This could drive spread compression of \~175bp. Any overshoot to our US rates forecast (1.15% by end H1) or rates volatility should also favour this trade, with the IG leg having 2x the duration of the HY leg. The worst-case scenario for this trade would be if we were to see already rising onshore HY defaults, led by POEs, start to create dislocations in the offshore HY market and the Chinese authorities did not respond with a timely policy response. This could lead to \~50bp of further spread decompression from already cheap levels.

Tl;dr:

* Asia USD HY spreads at 745bp continue to trade close to 1.5- 2.s.d. cheap vs Asia IG, US HY and EMBI spreads. We expect the current carry premium (586bp) on offer to force investors to reach for yield, especially with Asia USD IG spread currently at the 21st percentile over the past 10 years. A weaker Chinese credit impulse should not be a concern until H2, as defaults drift higher.
* Better growth in 2021 coupled with accommodative policy support would be the best environment for this trade to work. This trade will, however, remain sensitive to domestic Chinese policy support.

**14.Long US BB over BBB corporates (2x to 1x Notional)**

* We recommend going long credit risk in US BBs vs. US BBBs on a duration-neutral basis (2:1 ratio) as one of our top total return trades in corporate credit. We like this trade for several reasons: first, BBs have lagged BBB spreads given the Fed's credit facilities target shorter-dated, investment grade debt, leaving BB spreads at 309bp (vs. 372bp average since 2001) compared with BBB spreads at 142bp (vs. 201bp average, Figure 168). The BB/BBB spread at 167bp looks 27bp cheap vs. the 140bp implied from the historical relationship with HY index spreads. Using duration-neutral weights (2:1 current) the BB/BBB spread at 476bp compares with an average of 340bp (Figure 169). Second, the US BB/ BBB spread at 167bp (in line with the 172bp average since 2001) also looks wide when compared to Europe: EU BB/ BBB spreads are at 170bp today versus 231bp on average historically. Third, US BBBs have a much higher duration (8.6) than US BBs (4.3) and EU BBBs (5.3), resulting in much higher carry per unit of duration risk in US BBs versus BBBs.
* We like structuring the trade as duration-neutral for several reasons: first, our 2021 outlook for US HY credit is range-bound, suggesting carry will be king, but investors need to try to minimise volatility. With BB and BBB yields at 3.68% and 2.22%, respectively, this trade produces 5.14% carry per year. Second, our analysis on survivorship bias suggests that there is additional return potential (vs. that implied from BB/ BBB spread differentials) due to rising stars artificially raising BB spreads (and fallen angels lowering BBB spreads) coming out of a recession. Third, the trade should benefit from our interest rate strategists' preference for UST steepeners, with UST 5yr and 10yr yields expected to rise about 25bp and 35bp, respectively, to 65bp and 125bp. That said, the trade is mainly a credit spread trade rather than an interest rate trade. In an optimistic vaccine scenario, we see the BB/BBB spread tightening to 115-125bp (from 167bp currently) as the BB/BBB spread dislocation normalises and BB spreads tighten further, with HY spreads ending 2021 at 370bp (from 435bp). In a downside vaccine scenario, we see the BB/BBB spread widening to 155-165bp with some normalisation in the BB/BBB spread even as HY spreads widen to 480bp at end-2021.

Tl;dr:

* BBs have lagged BBB spreads given the Fed's credit facilities target shorter-dated, investment grade debt, leaving BB spreads at 309bp compared with BBB spreads at 142bp. US BB/BBB spread at 167bp looks cheap vs. the 140bp implied from the historical relationship. Using duration-neutral weights, the BB/BBB spread at 476bp compares with 340bp on average.
* Our 2021 outlook for US HY credit is range-bound, suggesting carry will be king, and this structure generates 5.14% of carry per year. Our target for BB/BBB spreads is 140bp or 27bp of compression. This trade should also benefit from survivorship bias and our US Treasury steepening view. In optimistic/ pessimistic vaccine scenarios, we see the BB/BBB spread at 120bp/160bp, respectively.

**15.Long 10y CGBs vs 10y UST, long CNY vs USD**

* Long CGBs was one of our top trade recommendations for 2020, and we roll it over into 2021. Despite this year's 7.3% total returns ytd (on Bloomberg Barclays index), we expect CGBs to return 5-6% in 2021, with gains likely to be equally split between coupon and FX returns. The duration overlay to the long CNY exposure would act as a cushion if the recent tailwinds (i.e. China's growth supremacy and declining trade escalation expectations) were to turn into a headwind.
* Room for further CNY strength in 2021. China's relatively rapid pace of output gap closure, which has pushed China vs US 10y rate differentials to record wides, the sharp increase in China's share of global exports in 2020, and improving BoP dynamics suggest that recent CNY gains are likely to remain durable in the months ahead. While the pace of appreciation should slow as sequential growth cools (especially vs RoW), we see little reason for a strong reversal. In fact, if CNY were to start pricing in tariff unwind expectations, USDCNY could even extend its downtrend to a 6.30-6.40 range.
* Bond valuations appealing, supply-demand dynamics to improve. The yield pick-up over G10 majors and extremely high real yield (Figure 170) boosted foreign inflows into CGBs (Rmb425bn/US$62bn ytd). We expect the inflows into CGBs to reach US$60-90bn in 2021, supported by the WGBI inclusion (total bond market inflows could reach US$100-130bn). The inflows could be \~30% of the net CGB supply next year, which we expect to decline by \~40% year on year. Improving demand-supply dynamics should partially offset concerns of modest liquidity tightening by the PBoC amid a stronger-than-expected H2 20 growth rebound.
* As credit impulse turns south, so would bond yields in H2 21. Our economists expect policy tone to shift to deleveraging in 2021 and credit growth to decline from 13.8% year on year in 2020 to 11% in 2021. As credit impulse turns negative and GDP growth y/y falls again, we expect bond yields to also start exhibiting modest downside pressure with a lag – most likely from Q2 21 onwards.
* Hedge UST risk. As US growth recovers in 2021 and the Fed tapers its bond purchases in H2 21, we expect 10y UST yield to rise to 1.25% (+35bp MTM). With China's growth recovery already priced, we do not expect a similar rise in CGB yields (2021E: 3.2%, -15bp MTM). Nonetheless, a spread tightened would reduce unwarranted volatility while being helped by a normalisation of the China-US GDP growth differential from 5.7% in 2020 to 4.2% in 2021 (2015-19 avg. 4.3%).

Tl;dr:

* Rolling over our Long CGBs trade with expected return of 5-6% in 2021.
* Little reason for a strong reversal in recent CNY gains that could extend further with tariff unwind expectations.
* Improving demand-supply dynamics should partially offset concerns of modest liquidity tightening by the PBoC.
* As credit impulse turns negative, bond yields expected to show modest downward pressure.

**16.Long RUB vs ZAR**

* The RUB is down 19% against the USD this year, the worst performer in major EM FX after the TRY (23%) and BRL (-27%). By contrast, the ZAR has experienced the strongest rebound in the EM complex over the past six months, and is now 9% weaker year to date. We think the RUB is well placed to catch up from here.
* First, the RUB screens 11% cheap on our behavioural equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) metrics, which model the REER against the oil and CDS spreads. The RUB is thus arguably priced for 12m forward Brent at $28/bl, vs $45/bl today. The ZAR now screens only 3% cheap. Moreover, this framework incorporates current credit spreads, which may be optimistically priced for South Africa – these spreads trade back in line with 5y averages, despite a huge jump in debt/GDP, deterioration in debt sustainability metrics, and deepening structural slowdown in China's growth and imports/GDP over this period. The attainment of the 0.5-1.5%/GDP primary surplus targets that we think is necessary to stabilise debt/GDP leaves no margin for error on either growth forecasts or planned spending cuts, in our view.
* Second, three sources of support for the ZAR over the past 6 months should now moderate. First, South African asset managers repatriated record amounts of capital back in H1-2020 – around 120bn ZAR (c.5%/GDP annualised), likely in response to macro-prudential ceilings on offshore investments being hit as the ZAR gapped weaker. Following the sharp ZAR recovery, this could potentially start to reverse. Second, South Africa has experienced one of the strongest trade balance improvements across EM this year, with the surplus reaching c.7%/GDP annualised in Q3 as imports nosedived. With the economy now slowly recovering, this is likely to gradually turn down. Given that South Africa's export volumes had been stagnant for 10 years prior to COVID, we doubt that the modest ZAR depreciation seen this year will help exports outperform imports. Third, the ZAR has the highest beta in EM FX to US real yields over the past decade: we think these yields have now based.
* Risks to this trade include an earlier tapering of OPEC+ oil production cuts, a sharp increase in US inflation breakevens driving significant outperformance of gold prices, major geopolitical strains between the US and Russia (over those already incorporated into the RUB's current risk premia), or a sharp recovery in foreign flows to (unhedged) SAGBs if wage negotiations make substantial progress.

Tl;dr:

* A shot in the arm for EM growth should help an under-positioned asset class start 2021 strongly.
* RUB screens 11% cheap on BEER metrics versus ZAR which screens 3% cheap.
* Sources of ZAR support over past six months have now moderated: (i) capital repatriation; (ii) strong trade balance improvements; (iii) ZAR beta to US real yields.
* Risks to this trade include an earlier tapering of OPEC+ oil production cuts.

**17.Mexico 2y1y receiver**

* Positive news around vaccine efficacy and the pause in Banxico's November meeting have induced markets to price out further policy rate cuts in Mexico. This may be premature. An accommodative Fed well into 2023, coupled with the AMLO administration's remarkably tight fiscal stance – at 0.7%/GDP, Mexico's fiscal response to COVID has been among the lowest in the world – suggests that Banxico will remain under pressure to ease next year. UBS forecasts show the Mexican economy emerging from this year's shock far slower than EM peers, with end-2022 real GDP levels set to remain 10% weaker than Q4-19 levels, compared to being 28% higher in EM ex China. In this context, further dovish monetary policy despite global normalization is justified, in our view.
* We see the spike in both headline and core inflation since the beginning of the pandemic as being driven primarily by supply shocks that should dissipate as the economy reopens. We expect headline inflation to ease in the remainder of 2020, before temporarily spiking around April amid unsupportive base effects, and then ease to 3.4% by end-21. Core inflation has likely already peaked. Long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. Importantly, if we exclude processed food inflation – which accounts for c. 27% of the core index – then core CPI would be at 2.9%, close to Banxico's 3% target.
* While a deep extension of Banxico's easing cycle could eventually undermine the MXN through carry erosion, Mexico's strong external position (UBS expects the CA surplus to remain stable at c.1%/GDP next year) should keep MXN volatility in check, providing monetary policy room. Our economists' expectations for 75bp of easing would keep real rates narrowly positive, unlike several other large EM peers. Speculative MXN positioning has increased according to CFTC data but remains far from the levels seen in late 2019.
* Even without further easing, the 2y1y at 5% offers positive roll of nearly 50bp p.a. Banxico Board members Guzman and Diaz de Leon are set to be replaced in Dec 2020/Dec 2021, respectively; a more dovish MPC member configuration may also support the case for lower terminal rates. Key risks to this trade stem from ongoing risks in Pemex, more limited sovereign fiscal buffers, or the (mark to market risk) of a much deeper-than-expected global re-emergence of COVID-19 leading to a sharp MXN selloff. Upside risks would stem from faster fiscal reform.

Tl;dr:

* Mexico is set to experience one of the slowest paces of output gap closure globally. Easing risks look under-priced.
* Headline inflation should peak in April, with underlying core measures already close to Banxico's target.
* A robust external sector should help keep MXN volatility in check even as Banxico eases more than markets currently expect.
* Positive developments on the inflation front and a stable MXN should open the door for markets to price in a lower terminal rate for Banxico.

# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.
*****
&gt; The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.
*****
&gt; With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.
*****
&gt; The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.
*****
&gt; “Georgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “It’s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.”
*****
&gt; Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.
*****
&gt; “It’s a binary event,” said Mills, adding it’s of growing interest to markets. “The general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us … The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.”
*****
&gt; Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.
*****
&gt; “The market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.
*****
&gt; “That totally dominates [trading] because it’s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,” Boockvar said. “I think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending” by Democrats.
*****
&gt; # By the numbers
&gt; A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&amp;P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.
*****
&gt; Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.
*****
&gt; There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.
*****
&gt; The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.
*****
&gt; Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump’s task force.
*****
&gt; In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. “We suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,” RBC strategists wrote.
*****
&gt; They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.
*****
&gt; “This suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,” the strategists noted.
*****
&gt; Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden’s presidency.
*****
&gt; However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state’s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.
*****
&gt; Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.
*****
&gt; Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.
*****
&gt; “I think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don’t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,” he said.

&gt; # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021

&gt; Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&amp;P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.

&gt; A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. “Turns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&amp;P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Here’s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.

&gt; # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days

&gt; In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&amp;P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&amp;P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**

&gt; The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&amp;P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&amp;P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.

&gt; # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology

&gt; With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!

&gt; In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&amp;P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**

&gt; Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.

&gt; On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.

&gt; # Growth Dragging on Small Caps

&gt; In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks—proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)—are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**

&gt; As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&amp;P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**

&gt; As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**

&gt; Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**

&gt; In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading year ahead r/stocks.",finance
CryptoCurrency,It's Time to Talk About Monero,"Wsup crypto plebes. You gotta be asking yourself a really basic question. Why did you originally get into crypto? Obviously caz number go up and lambo. But was there another part of you that resonated with the notion of true cypherpunk magic internet money? I think basically all of us have that spark of hope.

But guess what? That road aint easy. Guys like Zimmerman had to fight the original encryption battles over 2 decades ago. Labeled ""digial armaments"" by the USGang. When they printed the PGP code on paper and mailed in internationally, the fedbois retired that battle, knowing they lost. And so here we are. Bitcoin had to fight the original cryptocurrency battle, and we all coalesced to make it a reality.

There are some still clinging to the civil war narratives, but I think most of us see how the TPT[*shouldn't*]B have somehow wrapped their tentacles around the first instantiation of BitTorrent-meets-Money. Don't get me wrong, I think we can all agree that Bitcoin is better than no Bitcoin. But it's time to really pause, reflect.

For those who don't track the happenings in Monero, a summary of the past 12 months:

- Launched the first successful CPU mining algo, for which the ASIC is actually a modern CPU (currently Ryzen Threadrippers are the best ""ASIC"" for Monero). Manifesting Satoshi's famed ""*one CPU one vote*""

- Govts the world over continue releasing analyses admitting their inability to track it. Specifically Monero.

- Cross-chain atomic swaps were discovered (cryptographically speaking), funded, and currently being coded. To be released this year.

- CipherTrace claims to have cracked it, but then the IRS awards their ""let's try to break Monero"" contract to someone else (LOL)

- The largest darknet market announces they no longer accept Bitcoin, XMR only. Other darknets are switching. reddit/darknetmarkets are still full of newb questions about how to Monero.

- Successfully repelled large sybil attacks the past few months, someone out there is attempting to suppress the network. Devs respond like champs, network hardened, daily txn count approaching ATH yet again.

- Continues to maintain the largest anonymity pool in crypto, orders of magnitude larger than all other protocols combined. Including BTC mixing.

Did regulations or FUD stop us from Bitcoin? Hell no. We repelled attacks, expanded, and made the world a better place. We established that P2P free-speech messaging systems were here to stay, even if they encoded the functions of money. And there's a damn good reason why we're seeing a concerted attack on cypherpunk money.

Then they fight you",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Money Market Rates Way Down?!?!,"I've been meaning to ask this for a while, but why are money market interest rates way down. Last year the one I had my money in was \~1.50%, but over the course of this year, it has slowly declined to 0.30%. As far as I can tell this seems to be common among all money markets..

I need roughly $7,500 to get tuition and fees paid, very roughly including food and rent for the next few months.

personalfinance,Refinancing a Mortgage in last 5 years @ 5.375 but risk loosing $60k heloc.,"I hope this is the right forum for this question so please redirect me if not. I am worried I should be jumping on lower interest rates but unsure this makes much sense.  I have a home I have owned for 25 years and refinanced once.  I am now down to 5 years left with a 5.375% mortgage and $63k US left to pay (current principal / interest ratio is $985/$290 per mo.).  I also have a $60k Heloc line, of which $30k is borrowed/outstanding at 4.75% rate.

I think I am at the point now I can begin more aggressively paying down the 30k heloc (already paying at $1,500 per month), which is more attractive in case I loose my job or hit some unexpected event in need to turn back to for liquid cash.

My question is,  should I attempt to refinance and lock in to what I know are substantially lower rates right now.....but.....potentially loosing that $60k heloc option in the interim. Secondly,  is it worth it this close to the end of mortgage, paying 2-3k in closing costs?

Again, just  worried I am leaving too much interest on the table each month, but perhaps worth saving both the Heloc and closing costs considering what remains to be paid?",finance
personalfinance,Parents splitting while I’m in College,"So my parents are getting divorced and I’m (21M) preparing to move out with my dad (45). My mom is insistent on selling the home. It looks like they might get 95-105k profit after closing costs and are gonna split it right down the middle. My dad has about 35K on   an 18’ Silverado with relatively low miles and I honestly really doubt he’s underwater on it but the payments are ridiculous, something like $550/mo (thinking about talking to him about trading it in) My concern is my mom churned his credit and while she’s at a 730 he’s left at a 640. I’m worried about our impact to rent. I can co-sign with a 714 credit score but I only have 3 years credit history, around 5 credit cards, and an auto loan. as well as a minimum wage federal work study job, 20 hours/ week so I don’t know how much weight I provide. He works a full time job at $21/hr 40-48 hours, 4 days a week. He already said I’d only be paying 3-400/mo while I’m in school and I’m relatively low on subsidized loans so I know I have room to breathe for a degree with earning potential (wouldn’t ever go over 20k and am already a junior) I’m not super nervous about the money but more-so renting requirements and how it’s all going to pan out. I’m nervous I might not be approved as a co-signer. I’m in school for accounting but have contemplated working full time and doing a BS in Business supervision and Management since it’s completely online and accounting is not. My intention is to break into Human Resources, but if I do the online program I can start at his job as well making $15/hr doing those classes at night. I have a car note (17’ Optima 30k miles) with 13k left, 9k in student loans subsidized, 4K in a cash account and 6k of free credit. What steps can and should I be taking to make sure this transition is as smooth as possible and start preparing for apartment hunting? My original plan was to use my cash to pay the deposit and first/last (whatever’s necessary) and then he would put about 5k in a liquid account for emergencies, about 10 on his truck and refinance it and then put  the other 35k in a mutual fund to mature for 3-5 years until he’s ready to buy his own forever home. Seriously any help, advice, insight, or suggestions would be so helpful right now, both of use are pretty scared of the unknown but I don’t think we’re in the worst position in the world.

cybersecurity,Is a niche cyber/international relations grad program worth it?,"Hi all, sorry if this is an irrelevant or confusing post. I'm honestly not sure who else to ask at this point. This may be a stupid question but I don't know much about grad programs and what I'm looking for is kind of outside my academic advisor's domain.

I'm a college senior at a large public university, majoring in computer engineering with a strong focus on security and penetration testing. I did recently get a job offer at a large company pentesting ICS systems, starting at $75k. However, I'm also a veteran and I've always been highly interested in geopolitics, conflict, and cyber warfare. As such, I am also going through the application process for some federal agencies that would have me heavily involved in these areas. My (nebulous) dream job would be to find something either in the public or private sector that stands at the crossroads of these two fields. Opportunities surely exist there, but setting myself up to get there seems relatively ill-defined. I assume that a Master's degree is almost necessary, and could also boost my chances of getting hired at the aforementioned agencies if I don't make the cut this time around. I've found a couple of programs that seem to really fit the bill as to what I'm looking for, including:

CMU's MITS [https://www.cmu.edu/mits/](https://www.cmu.edu/mits/)

JHU's MASIS [https://sais.jhu.edu/academics/master-degrees/master-arts-strategic-and-intelligence-studies-masis](https://sais.jhu.edu/academics/master-degrees/master-arts-strategic-and-intelligence-studies-masis)

There are some other ones as well I've found that lean heavy to one side or the other (IR vs information security) but have options for compounded certificates or electives.

The problem is that most admissions counselors I've talked to give an average starting salary of anywhere from $40k-$60k, and even then it's difficult to really determine what percentage of graduates end up working where I'd like to end up. This has me a bit spooked, since it looks like I'd either be taking a pay cut to use my Masters or working a job similar to the one I landed already and not using my advanced degree at all. For the -right- job, I'd be willing to do that. But it does have me wondering whether the degree is really worth it or if this is something I can get into with enough experience and self-study.

On the off-chance that anyone here is or has been in a similar situation, any advice would really be great. Thanks for reading.",technology

CryptoCurrency,Cryptomedia - a realistic pipe dream,"I'm not a programmer, but I have a big idea. What if we created a coin called, ""Cryptomedia"" that funds an ad-free, completely transparent social media company. Something like 0.5% transaction fee when buying or selling coins.

I think even there could be 2 versions; an under 18 version with strict guidelines on sexuality, drug use, bullying, and other inappropriate behavior, and an over 18 version with full nudity allowed, focused on privacy and freedom of expression.

The design for the media would be as clean and minimal as possible, crowdsourcing certain projects like designing filters or even supporting new media file types. The company could be an example of how to handle a utility in the modern world, giving complete transparency into the finances, constantly updating the community on how things are progressing (on the official Cryptomedia page so you can choose to not look at it). The staff involved could be paid a comfortable wage, but no $350 million dollar CEO. In fact, there could be a rule that the highest-paid member can't exceed double the wage of the lowest-paid member.

If successfully implemented, there could be a huge amount of money leftover, and that could be given back to the people who have held the coin based on staking, and maybe could have some community votes on other alternatives like charity, or building renewable energy resources.

dogecoin,"Hi fellow doges, let’s make this meaningful","The Dogecoin is a fun meme coin, that is used for tipping and bringing joy. Its infinite, that’s one of the reasons many people don’t see it as an investment. But it proofed to survive for many years, the community is a bunch of helpful people and there is something else which is infinite: the world and the good things you can do. 


So here is an extending plan to support the dogecoin original purpose:
- For every 1% of the Dogecoin raising you do one good deed. 
- Definition of good deed: something that is beneficial for somebody else or the community = a random act of kindness 
- Afterwards every act of kindness needs to be made public through this forum (Thread: [Link DRAOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/kp5iyi/dogecoins_random_acts_of_kindness/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) Dogecoins random acts of kindness), a short description of what you did is enough, but feel free to be creative.
- Acts of kindness should be done as near as possible to the time the percentage went up… if its +50% = 50 acts of kindness
- Minus % are ignored :-) we are here for the positivity

Since dogecoin is infinite, it can also raise infinite. It’s a win win situation. Let’s use dogecoin for its original purpose: a fun, good meme and a coin of cuteness that should rule the world. Let’s make dogecoin not just the standard of the global financial system, but the standard for good deeds. 

Even if we are not making any money, even if we loose money - we all made the world a better place and are supporting Dogecoins extended purpose. There is not much to loose.


What do you think? Who is in?


(One good deed of Elon Musk (if he is on board) is to bring the dogecoin to the mars)

- Just hug a good friend
- Smile at someone in the bus/tram (no creepy smile)

- if you are a man change the side of the road if a solo woman is walking on it and you have the feeling she might feel insecure

personalfinance,Thinking of using my remaining investment money to pay off private student loans,"I have been steadily paying off my student loans over the past 2 years. I refinanced my Sallie Mae loans, around $13k, for a rate of 4.25% at the end of 2019. As of today, that loan is down to $5.8k. 

I have been aggressively paying of my student loans because I would like to go back to school for a PhD. It has taken me longer to pay off my private student loans  than I would have liked. The only reason I did not apply last year was because of the coronavirus, so  I really want to apply this year and I want this loan out of my way.

Consequently, I have been thinking of pulling my money out of investments, about $3K to just finish the remaining half of the private loan and pay off the remaining balance over the next 6 months.

Currently, I make 47k a year. I have a healthy emergency savings of $8k, fed student loans are $6.4k and a car loan of $4.3k. Is this a wise move?",finance
personalfinance,Would it be best to pay off my car loan before or after receiving a house loan?,"Moreso because of credit scores/reports. 

I have read that paying off a car loan (or any other large loan) will tank/negatively impact your credit score because it removes the ""good"" history of on time payments, the credit utilization total changes, etc. It's made me rethink wanting to pay it off right now because I will be a first time home buyer this coming spring/summer. 

As I see it, I have two options:

A) Pay off the car loan completely in the next couple months and go into house shopping with zero debt, or

B) Pay off the car loan until it has about ~7-8 months of payments left and finish it off once the house loan/mortgage is applied for and active. 

Would Plan A affect interest rates when acquiring a house loan? How long would it (realistically) take to build it back into 750+ territory? I have excellent credit right now and I do not want to shoot myself in the foot. 

The car loan has roughly 24 months remaining as it stands today, but I've saved up enough over the past 6-8 months to comfortably pay it off.

Off course the trends in margin might be partially explainable through the total underlying value of the market, albeit flawed as margin does not directly move with stock prices.

I signed the line on my interest rate for my mortgage, but I haven't yet closed on the property. Would getting a credit card affect the interest rate even if I signed for a specific rate already?

personalfinance,I have a mutual fund with Vanguard that I am using as my retirement fund/savings. Should I move this money over to my jobs (Fed Government) TSP?,"Hi, hopefully this is the right place to ask.

I am 25 years old, and put $3,000 into Vanguard's mutual fund VTSAX last year.

There has been a 27.6% rate of return, and my money has gone up to $6,190.58 in the mutual fund (I put an additional $100 into it every month as well).

I recently got a job as a government employee, and they offer a TSP that I can invest in (and I already am with 3% of my salary).

The TSP matches up to 5%, but I can go up to 15% investment of my salary I believe.

My question is, should I remove the funds from Vanguard (even though it's performing well) to put it all into my TSP, so it's all in one place? And if so, how much of my salary would you recommend investing with? I am living at home with $0 monthly payments right now. I don't plan on touching this money until I retire.",finance
personalfinance,Use savings to pay off loan?,"So for context, I have about 170K in student loan debt. Long story short, I went to an expensive private college and my parents didn’t help pay any of it. I Had to take out loans to pay for tuition, food, books, rent, etc. The good news is that I make good money for coming out of college. 70K and I am due for a raise this year. so, to break down my loan situation

108K sallie mae 4% interest rate, minimum payment- $913.30

28K wells Fargo 6.5% interest rate minimum payment $257. But I pay an extra $260

30K fed loans 0% interest rate ( covid, thank god lol) ( haven’t been making payments on this yet)

$2300 (loan I took out from my school) minimum payment $40, but I pay an extra $40 a month.

I have no credit card debt or car loans. So I really want to pay this off as fast as possible. I have about 9K in savings right now and I was thinking about just paying off the $2300 loan from my school. That way I can put that extra $80/month towards my wells Fargo loan. And start paying $340 extra on top of my $257 minimum payment. I am trying to do the debt snowball. ( I have been watching Dave Ramsey) I wanted to see if that was a good idea.

personalfinance,New W4 - $20 and $56 over and above the standard withholding from each paycheck?,"Hello,

My husband and I are looking into updating our Tax Withholding for each paycheck for 2021.

Up until now, I am still under a **M-2 Tax allowance** for Federal Income Tax while my husband has **0** allowances.

On his last paycheck he had **$138.96** withheld.

After filling out the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator, we get results that say that:

&amp;#x200B;

\- I should enter **$20** in additional withholding per pay period (Line 4(c) on Form W-4 is already pre-filled). This is an amount of withholding **over and above** ***the standard withholding*** **from each paycheck for this job** if lines 3 through 4(c) of the Form W-4 were blank or zero.

***Even though the amount on Line 4(c) is greater than zero, this recommendation would still result in a reduction in withholding relative to your current level of withholding.*** **That is because your withholding to date has exceeded the standard amount of withholding.**

defi,Arbitrage Question,"I'm just getting into DeFi and am enjoying learning more about it. I recently checked out [compound.finance](https://compound.finance) and put some money in it.

USDC: 8.74% supply, 11.11% borrow

USDT: 13.67% supply, 16.56% borrow

My question then is what is stopping anyone from borrowing a significant amount of USDC, trading it near 1:1 for USDT, then putting that USDT down as supply? They would earn the difference in interest rate (13.67-11.11=2.56% in this case) virtually for free, right? I'm a believer in efficient markets, so this really doesn't make sense to me.

The IPO market is manic. Stocks haven’t been this expensive since the dot-com era. The Nasdaq 100 has doubled in two years, leaving its valuation bloated -- all while volatility remains stubbornly high.

It’s a setup that’s left investors sitting on fat returns from 2020, a year that defied easy explanation. It’s also one that has a growing cohort of experts warning about a bubble.

Knowing when market rallies turn from logical to excessive is always tough. It was nearly impossible as 2020 ended, with interest rates pinned near zero and the federal government unleashing another $900 billion into the economy. But history offers clues, and a raft of current market conditions meet criteria that would likely be found on a bubble checklist.

Take a study by Harvard University researchers published in 2019. It noted that while not every stock surge meets with disaster, those that do share some attributes, including increased share issuance, heightened volatility, and a sector or index that doubles and is twice as high as the broader market. Check, check and almost check.

“Are there areas of the market that are in a bubble? Yeah, clearly,” Peter Cecchini, founder of AlphaOmega Advisors LLC, said on Bloomberg’s “What Goes Up” podcast, adding that “many of those are obviously speculative technology companies.”

Share issuance, initial public offerings and blank-check companies have grown so popular that record after record fell in 2020. U.S. companies sold $368 billion in new stock last year, 54% more than the prior high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

IPOs raised $180 billion, the most ever, as companies including Snowflake Inc., Airbnb Inc., and DoorDash Inc. took advantage of the rebound in equity markets. First-day pops in share price among the newcomers were the biggest in two decades, according to Bill Smith, CEO and co-founder of Renaissance Capital LLC.

“Those are telltale signs,” said Robin Greenwood, professor at Harvard Business School and co-author of the 2019 study. “The probability of a market correction is much greater today than in the historical average.”

A subclass of IPOs took off in 2020 as well, adding to worries. Special-purpose acquisition vehicles, which use proceeds from a stock sale to acquire a private company, raised about $80 billion in 2020, more than was notched in aggregate over the previous decade. SPACs that made a purchase are up about 100% for the year, according to research from George Pearkes, global macro strategist at Bespoke Investment Group.

“That’s pretty bubbly stuff,” he wrote in a recent note, though he added that what’s “more remarkable” is that SPACs that have yet to announce deals have gained about 20%. “Obviously, this is pretty speculative behavior.”

While certain assets exhibit worrying signs, the broader market may not be in for an immediate comeuppance. For one, the Federal Reserve has promised to keep interest rates pinned near zero, making stretched stock valuations look more reasonable when compared to bond yields.

And the Harvard researchers say the Nasdaq 100, while on a historic run that’s seen its price double in just two years, is still not exorbitantly elevated relative to the S&amp;P 500 Index, compared to previous bubbles. The broader gauge has rallied 50% since 2018 and is not trailing the tech-heavy gauge by enough to meet their criteria.

Bubble talk has simmered for months, prompting plenty of warnings from the likes of Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn to Wolfe Research strategists.

As the S&amp;P 500 closed out 2020 with a solid but still-modest gain of 16%, spots on the market’s kookier fringes have recently seen trouble. Since peaking in December, vaccine heroes Moderna Inc. and BioNTech have both plunged 35% without any obvious catalyst for the selling. FuboTV Inc., up 596% as of Dec. 22, has lost almost half its value as share lock-ups expired. Shares of insurance company Lemonade Inc. have swung violently as similar restrictions were lifted.

“People have gotten back to a narrative-over-valuation discipline. You can slap the ‘disruptor’ name on something and have it go up 10 times for no real reason,” said Jon Burckett-St. Laurent, senior portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors. “So yeah, there are pockets of the market that don’t make a ton of sense to me.”

Bubble warnings are liable to get louder in 2021, when companies will have to deliver profits that justify valuations that by historical measures have grown stretched. The S&amp;P 500 ended the year trading at almost 30 times profits, meaning it will start a new year higher than at any time since 2000. The Nasdaq 100 is at 40 times earnings, a level not seen in two decades.

Other price trends have raised eyebrows. Bitcoin’s record-breaking advance. Heightened trading by retail investors that’s inflated previously little-known companies. Tesla Inc.’s 750% bulge. Through it all, the Cboe Volatility Index never closed below 20 after spiking to 80 in March. At 23, it remains above its long-term average of 19.5.

“As speculative juices flow, people become more entrenched with opportunities to make a quick buck. That could be dangerous,” said Marshall Front, the chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. “You never know how long the party goes, but it doesn’t end well.",finance

personalfinance,"Help me understand: 401K, Roth 401K and Roth IRA","My employer funds a matching contribution based on years of service which in my case was 75% up to 3% of salary as of end of 2020. I've been contributing the maximum amount. This year, the matching contribution is going to be 100% put to 4% of my salary. I am playing catch up with my retirement. If I continue to max the amount for the matching contribution, should I put more money beyond the matching or open an IRA (traditional vs Roth)? Or can I put more money on both 401K and  IRA so I can maximize my contributions for 2021?

When I made an inquiry from our benefits department, this information was sent to me.

You may elect to defer up to 75% of your Compensation on a pre-tax basis. You may alsoelect to make Roth contributions to the Plan on an after-tax basis. You may elect to changeyour elections to contribute to the Plan on the dates established pursuant to PlanAdministrator procedures. Federal law also limits the amount you may elect to defer underthe Plan ($19,500 in 2020). However, if you are age 50 or over, you may defer an additionalamount up to $6,500 (in 2020).

What do the following mean:

1. You may elect to defer up to 75% of your Compensation on a pre-tax basis. - Is this for the 401K?
2. You may also elect to make Roth contributions to the Plan on an after-tax basis. - Is this a Roth 401K? If it is, how is this different from a Roth IRA? Is it wise to do this with my employer or open a Roth IRA on my own? Pros and cons?
3. Federal law also limits the amount you may elect to defer underthe Plan ($19,500 in 2020). However, if you are age 50 or over, you may defer an additional amount up to $6,500 (in 2020).- My 401K contributions for 2020 is definitely below the 19.5K. Should I be contributing more?

PS. My spouse also works in the same company and we usually file our taxes jointly. I am interested in increasing my retirement contributions but hubby says we need to pay off house mortgage first and we still have 2 kids in college and one in high school to think of. I will be 48 in a couple of months and he is 51. Both of us started late with our 401K. Sorry about the long questions.

personalfinance,Soliciting Tips on Plan for Mom's Retirement,"tl;dr—Sat down and made a retirement plan with mom, would love pointers, particularly on 3) next steps.

Hi all! I am seeing similar posts, so I'm glad I'm not alone on this one.

**Background**: I (M31) started a new job, and have been doing a deep dive on home-buying, housing finance, health benefits, and... retirement. I started ping-ponging thoughts off my mom (F63). I got a little panicky because she didn't have answers to any basic questions, like ""when do you plan to retire,"" ""what is your mortgage's balance,"" ...""do you have a pension."" She is the world's best mom and very smart. However she self-admittedly has no financial skills whatsoever, and never touched the topic of her retirement with a 12ft pole until today. Thank god for pensions and Social Security or there'd be nothing there (I cringe for future generations...). She also raised my brother and I alone, so I think she just didn't have the bandwidth.

So today we did a Zoom with her more retirement-oriented coworker to 1) do a full accounting of retirement/non-retirement assets and income, 2) retirement costs, and 3) decide next steps/modifications. Would love to hear your thoughts/suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Accounting of assets and income**

**Available funds** (before taxes):

* Pension—If mom retires at age... 63: $4.7k/mo; 68: $5.9k/mo; 73: $7.1k/mo
   * ""CAP money"" (idk)—$10k lump sum
* Fidelity accounts
   * $19,789 lump sum (past, no longer active defined contribution)
   * 403(B)—Voluntary fund; $0
* Social Sec Estimator: If mom retires at age... 63: $1706; 68: $2259; 70: $3183.
* Checking in with prior employer from 20+ yrs ago about anything that may have vested

**Houses**:

* Residence: Interest rate is 5%, balance is $192,000, monthly payment is $1636, some 20 years left. No prepayment penalty. Redfin values house at $711k.
* Grandma's house: Paid off. Redfin values at $2.7M. Would be split between grandma's 4 children including mom, and their kids. The two more financially savvy sibs want to sell when that happens, so I reckon we will, but I think that will be a while off (my family lives forever). Rent currently pays for grandma's assisted living.

**Savings**: None.

**Income**: $115k. Has already emotionally accepted working through age 73 or working e.g. a 10-hr job in retirement if neccessary, and I would be very surprised if that proved to be a struggle based on her current health but who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **Retirement costs**:

* Mortgage: Again $1636/mo, some 20 years left, is open to paying down early.
   * $500/mo (!) HOA fee (the crook property manager was just fired and the new one is good, so hopefully this drops).
   * $400/yr home insurance.
   * Slim to none on non-HOA interior home maintenance.
* Car payments: some 7 years left, is open to paying down early.
* Coworker estimated $100/mo plan on top of Medicare.
* Groceries, clothes, occasional restaurants etc. in one of the highest COL areas in the US (she and everyone we know is here and from around here, so don't bother suggesting a move).
* Family vacations 1x/yr.

&amp;#x200B;

3. **Next steps/modifications.** We are thinking shoot for retirement at 73, which would suggest a monthly \~$10,300 before taxes between SS and pension ($120k/yr). This seems high now, but by the rule of thumb of losing 50% to inflation every 20 years, that's maybe $40k when she's 93, right? (Again, family prob all living into 90s.)

* See about any vested funds from prior employer
* Get mom to start attending her work's free retirement webinars
* Refinance residence: Bring the 5% down to 2-3%. Keeping it fixed cost, no fees/prepayment fees (she has \~800 credit). Total black box to me, suggestions welcome.
* Start a $200/mo contribution to her empty 403(b) to start, see if we want to increase it later; see about investing that and her lump sum in a low-risk mutual fund of some kind so she has at least one retirement asset that isn't fully vulnerable to inflation. Maybe add CAP money and prior employer money (if any) to this too.
* Think about paying off car/house early. I suggest doing both this and 403(b), but I assessed that 403(b) should be prioritized over debt, since ROI significantly &gt; mortgage rate and since 403(b) pays taxes post-investment, but open to direction there.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe even $40k/yr is fine once you have no house to pay off, even with high COL and health costs, and I'm just being paranoid. IDK, I have no sense..

Any other suggestions? Thanks folks. I've been here a short while and am already learning a lot. Sorry for length.",finance
Bitcoin,Executive Order 6102 (just be aware),"Everyone investing in Bitcoin for the long term should have at least a familiarity with Executive Order 6102.  This executive order, signed by President Roosevelt in 1933 outlawed the personal ownership of gold over a very small amount. The Executive Order required individuals to sell their gold to the Fed for $20.67 per ounce ($408 today’s equivalent). Violation of the order was punishable by a fine of $10,000 ($198,000 today’s equivalent) and/or ten years in prison.

I point this out only b/c precedent has been set, and legality established, that the U.S. govt is within the law to force sale of an asset class. I’m not suggesting it’s an imminent threat, only that there is some precedent for the U.S. govt to intervene and make owning, buying or selling something like Bitcoin illegal for citizens of America

I currently make 67k a year, have 5k saved and have 31k in federal loans with an average interest of around 4.25. Right now I pay around 500 dollars in utilities and that's it.  The thing is, I left for college just to get away from home and now that I'm back here I feel like the longer I stay the worse it will be on my mental health, the details of which I don't really want to get into. 

I was thinking about getting a house because it seemed like it would be better value than renting since I plan to stay in my current role for the foreseeable future. I work remotely permanently so I dont have to worry about a commute or anything and I could choose an area where the housing isn't so pricey, but I don't know of I'm making a huge mistake trying to apply for a mortgage loan. The only thing I know for sure is that I want to be gone from this house in a year at least. Any suggestions or advice would be really helpful.",finance
investing,Reasons We May Not Be in a Bubble,"I'm seeing a lot of posts comparing this to the 2000 dot-com bubble. Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

[https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)

**My Take:** There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!), and a few sectors that are overvalued, but overall the market looks to be on sturdy ground with the increased savings, and the increased liquidity. There will be peaks and valleys, but I think there's a lot of room to grow, especially once the vaccine is widespread.",finance
personalfinance,What Should We Be Doing with Our Money?,"My wife and I have been pretty financially stable.  I am 35 and she is 29.  We bought a house together a little less than two years ago and at this point in our lives I am wondering what we should be doing with our money.  I feel like we have way to much in our savings and not near enough in other investments?  Our current break down is as follows:

Checking - $5,200

Savings - $20,500

High Yield Savings - $48,800

CD - $5,500

My 401k - $30,000

Her 401k - $10,000

Home Equity - $80,000

I just started a new job with a 10k sign on bonus.  Half will be paid out next month along with another $5000 commission check from my previous employer.  We should get another $1500 or so back in taxes in February.  We were contemplating what to do with this.  Combined our income will be around 140k in 2021.  My wife also has a pension as she works for the government.

As for debt we have:

House - $1,300/month (refi a few months ago down from $1900)

Wife’s student loan - 160/month minimum

Car - $502/month

We currently have around 80k equity in our house (45k down, appraised for 35k over what we bought it for).  One car is paid off and the other has around $26k left, or $500 a month.  My wife’s student loan minimum is $160 a month.  Total take home will be roughly 7300/month after taxes and everything and our monthly debt is around $2500 with all utilities included.  That should leave us nearly $5000 a month. To play with.

We are expecting to get at least 10k, from her inheritance from her grandfather who passed away, in the next six months.  We were planning on using that to pay off her student loan debt.  The reason we have so much in savings is when we opened the bigger account the APR was 2.52%.  The smaller was 2%.  Since then it has dropped down 1.5 and basically nothing.  We feel like we should have at least half of these invested since it’s currently not getting us anything.  Our 401k also feels really low, but I plan on upping my contribution this year to 10% (company matches 3.5) and upping my wife’s.  We were also contemplating paying off our car, but the interest rate on it is pretty low at 2.75%. We would like to make a few extra mortgage payments as well to pay the house off early.",finance

I think the topic for today's discussion is probably the single most important one for all of us, as the answer to the question would determine whether we should even trade in the markets at all.

Why would we ever trade individual stocks, commodities, or other assets if we can't actually ""beat the market""? The market meaning the S&amp;P 500 index or the Dow for those based in the US.

I know this will likely spark lots of criticism and intense discussions. I know a person who publishes investor letters has even gotten a death threat for saying something in his newsletter, also the reason why I'm staying private and anonymous.

Therefore, let me preface it with a few points first.

\- This is solely my personal opinion.

\- Your opinion is just as good as mine.

\- Full disclosure, I haven't worked as a portfolio manager at an institution so I certainly lack lots of experience in managing money compared to those who make a living out of managing pension or endowment money.

\- It's completely fine if you disagree. My goal is not to convince you but to help provide resources for people. The more you know the better.

\- I believe that an ""average person"" would be far better off investing in the market index, just as Warren Buffett said.

\- I agree with the academics, investors, and communities that most people shouldn't try to beat the market as most simply don't have enough time to analyze and monitor companies or have the discipline to stay invested in their ideas.

\- Investing is a game of probability, just like poker. This fund is ""more likely"" to beat the market means the fund has a high chance of beating the market, not ""will"" beat the market.

If you have a pair of aces in a poker game, you wouldn't necessarily win the pot but you have a ""high probability"" of winning the pot.

People say poker is a game of luck but there are professional poker players who win over a period of time. I believe the same is true in investing. Not necessarily ""professionals"" but any investor can beat the market with the right amount of discipline and research.

\- Timing the bottom or top is impossible. But it is possible to guess the top or bottom with a probability. For instance, at the end of 2019, was it more likely that we were near the top of the market cycle or bottom? The answer is obvious.

Now with all that said, I'll say the unpopular opinion.

Yes, we can ""beat the market"".

More specifically, I believe it is possible to beat the S&amp;P 500 net of fees even over a long period of time, say 20-30 years, for those with less than $50 million in the portfolio.

Here are my arguments for today's topic.

**1) It is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**

**2)** **While it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. They are discipline and conviction.**

**3) Security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. For instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, EV, and cleantech will be the future.**

**1) It is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**

But beating the market isn't enough. You have to consistently beat it, for 5 years, 10 years, and 30 years.

I'm sure most of you know that a 1% difference in the 30-year annual return can make a huge difference at the end of the 30-year period due to compounding.

What most probably don't know is the distribution of those returns from a portfolio point of view.

If you make an annual rate of 15% return over the course of 30 years, that doesn't mean you need to make 15% of return every single year in practical terms.

What's happening is that over the course of 30 years, you will make 200% returns, 100% returns 60% returns in the early part of the 30 years, and then slowly decline to 5% annual returns, which altogether make 15% annual return over the course of 30 years.

Theoretically, any investor's portfolio will look something along the lines of this over a time period.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/kpfx3h/investing\_philosophy\_part\_iii\_can\_you\_actually/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Midasinvestors/comments/kpfx3h/investing_philosophy_part_iii_can_you_actually/)

📷

The total compounded annual return is 15%, not the actual annual returns.

This makes sense because, with a $50k portfolio, you will obviously be more concentrated in positions compared to a $50MM portfolio. Therefore, you are taking more ""risk"" in a smaller portfolio.

Similarly, Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, has posted annual returns that look somewhat similar.

📷

If you noticed, the standard deviations are much larger in the earlier part of the years compared to the latter part of the years when the portfolio simply got too big to take that much risk.

In fact, the standard deviation of the returns for the first 20 years is 42% compared to 16% in the last 20 years.

**Where I'm getting at is it is much easier to beat the market by a wide margin with a small-sized portfolio than a large portfolio and therefore, retail investors have a good chance of beating the market, given an appropriate knowledge and discipline.**

It may be common-sense but to reiterate, it is much easier to double a portfolio of $500k than to double a $50 million.

You may think the reason is that you're taking larger risks on smaller portfolios than larger portfolios.

It is true that risks are larger. However, it also depends on how you define ""risk"".

Standard deviations are obviously larger in a smaller portfolio since your absolute size is smaller and therefore, you can't diversify as much.

But standard deviations aren't truly the ""risk"" of a company going under. The true risk of a company going bankrupt is the liquidity, cash flow, and business profile. Even with a concentrated portfolio, I believe it's possible to get large returns with limited ""risks"" as retail investors.

Now, to reduce those idiosyncratic ""risks"" of businesses, we need to apply our ""knowledge"" and ""discipline"".

Which brings to my second argument.

**2)** **While it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. They are discipline and conviction.**

Most people will sell at lows and buy at highs. We sell at lows because once a stock goes down, our cognitive bias kicks in, called the loss aversion bias. We put more weight on losing $100 than gaining $100 and thus, losing money has more impact on us than gaining money.

This is due to evolutionary psychology and there's a good reason why we were evolved this way but that's a topic of conversation for another day.

We also buy at highs because we tend to follow the herd, getting into the hype of trends and manias. Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a strong incentive for people to get in on the EV hype.

People at cocktail parties will brag about their 4x returns on bitcoin or Tesla, which will prompt you to buy them the next day.

Buying at highs and selling at lows are due to a lack of discipline, as the famous investors put it.

This is also the reason why professionals say ""invest in what you know"". If you invest in what you don't know, then you will be tempted to sell when stocks go down because you don't know the company and don't have such a high conviction that it will recover.

As an analogy, I have seen many people make new year's resolutions as losing weight or saving more money to buy a house.

Why is it so hard to do both?

In fact, all of us actually know how to lose weight: eat less and exercise more. Burn more calories than you consume. It's as simple as that.

We also know how to increase the balance on our bank account. Spend less than what you earn, or increase your earnings through side-gigs.

It doesn't take a genius to figure out the solutions to these problems. I believe the same is true for the markets. People generally know which companies will be better off in ten years (Disney, Amazon, JP Morgan, etc.).

So why do people lack the discipline to stick to their plans?

Again, there's a good evolutionary reason which I won't get into in this post.

If Amazon fell 30% today and stayed there fore the next month or two while other EV companies rose 50% in the same time period, most people would be tempted to sell their Amazon and buy those EV companies, hence the ""sell low buy high"" phenomenon.

Take this analysis shown on WSJ.

**The returns of a hypothetical investor who put $10,000 into an S&amp;P 500 index fund at the start of 1980 and missed the market’s five best days through the end of August 2020 would be 38 percentage points lower than those of someone who stayed invested the whole period, according to a Fidelity Investments Inc. analysis.**

This is the significance of self-discipline, the ability to weather through the tough times, or carefully ride the trends.

To gain self-discipline, we need a high conviction. To have a high conviction, we need to do enough research and have a sufficient understanding of the assets we are buying.

As long as we understand that this company will thrive with a high probability, we will more likely to hold onto those positions even in a recession.

**In order to beat the market as an individual investor, we need self-discipline. Self-discipline comes from a high conviction. High conviction comes from enough research and understanding of the security.**

**Security Analysis leads to -&gt; High Conviction leads to -&gt; Self-discipline**

**3) Security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. For instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, EV, and cleantech will be the future.**

I'm certainly not saying analyzing individual companies is easy but as an individual investor who lacks the resources and knowledge about a company, it's still possible to know that a company is a fundamentally strong business trading at a reasonable multiple.

For instance, Fiverr is an Israeli company that allows freelancers to offer their services on its platform. It has grown its sales at more than 40% annually with at least 75% gross margin. Would you expect this sort of company to continue growing in the next five to ten years or go bust?

And yes it's trading at too high of a multiple, at 43x LTM P/S.

But think of it this way. If Fiverr grows its sales at 40%, 40%, 30%, 30%, and 30% in the next five years and has a 25% net margin, it'll have $175MM in net income after five years. With a trading multiple of 70 P/E you get $13B market cap in five years, compared to $6.8B market cap right now.

Yes, these are rosy assumptions but I don't need to convince people that a platform with freelancers will only grow in the future.

Many also argue that you can’t win in the market because there are too many big-money professionals and the person on the other side of the trade knows better than I do.

I absolutely agree with that. But it's not a winner-takes-all game.

There doesn’t have to be a single winner. Professional trader's win doesn't mean our loss.

You don’t need those terminals and market data to predict that the stay at home stocks would have outperformed the value stocks since March.

You don’t have to be a genius to know that China will be the next big player in the world or that Chinese companies are poised to outperform maybe some other foreign competitors.

The important aspect to remember is that the retail investors can easily come to the same conclusion as a professional analyst who has spent thousands of hours on research.

The key differences between the professionals and us is the amount of work the professionals put in and the vast amounts of resources they have, both of which lead to higher conviction (therefore, self-discipline) and informational advantage.

That’s why people like Peter Lynch and Buffett likes to say invest in what you know.

By only dealing with what we are familiar with (easy-to-understand companies), we don’t need to use CapIQ or Bloomberg to come to a high conviction that e-commerce will only grow in the future.

If however, we were to take a stab at a company like Exxon Mobil, we need to know how much of their production volumes are hedged, at what oil price are their rigs economical, how will commodity prices impact the stock performance (you need historical correlation data and regression for different time periods), and so on.

Take bond futures. It’s not that hard to know that as long as the Treasury is issuing more than the Fed is buying, there will be a supply overrun and yields will likely go up (of course it's not as simple as that because you need to take into account numerous other factors like inflation and real yields but I'm making a point here). But I only can monitor that from the numerous data points provided by the sell-side research.

The more complicated analyses are where professional investors have an edge.

**To summarize today's post in one sentence, it is possible to beat the market with a small-sized portfolio given a sufficient amount of discipline.**

Please feel free to use this post as a starting off point when arguing with your friend about beating the market.

investing,10 Investment/Trading Ideas by UBS Analysts - Part 1!,"\*Long post warning\*

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Long US Small cap over US Large Cap**

The significant underperformance of the Russell 2000 vs the S&amp;P 500 since mid2018, and really since early 2014, has left investors wary about reallocating to small caps. We see a number of reasons to favour small over large:

* Small caps have outperformed after recessions. The Russell 2000 has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 10pp-30pp in the year or so following the end of recessions (Figure 141). Additionally, our ISM cycle work also shows considerable outperformance of small caps in the early stages of a cycle. The depth of the COVID shock and likely solid recovery is a good set-up for small caps, in our view.
* Small cap earnings are recovering fast, with greater upside to 2022 earnings. Small cap (S&amp;P 600) forward earnings estimates have recovered at an exceptional rate since the collapse in H1'20. Current NTM EPS estimates for small caps have caught up to S&amp;P 500 forward estimates, normalised to expectations at the beginning of the year. Small cap forward earnings could rise 27% over the next 12mo+ if 2022 expectations hold – 9pp more than the potential forward EPS increase for the S&amp;P 500. Importantly, earnings momentum for small caps is much stronger than for large caps. Small cap Q3 2020 EPS ended up beating consensus expectations by a massive 67% in aggregate, compared to a 17.5% earnings beat for the S&amp;P 500, which was still a record.
* Small caps at \~12% discount to S&amp;P 500, biggest since 2002. The S&amp;P 600 small cap index is trading at 19.5x forward earnings, or a 12% discount to the S&amp;P 500, which is the largest discount since 2002. Small caps have typically traded at a premium, given the many small firms that have negative earnings, so the current discount is \~24pp below the historical average. Additionally, the dividend yield for US small caps relative to the S&amp;P 500 is still well above average levels, and points to further upside for US small caps over large caps.
* Vaccine sensitivities suggest small caps could outperform further. Small caps outperformed large caps by \~2pp on major vaccine news days, implying there could be significant further potential outperformance of small caps vs large caps on continued vaccine momentum and economies reopening.

**Tl;dr:**

* After past recessions, Russell 2000 outperformed S&amp;P 500 by 10pp-30pp during the following year.
* Earnings momentum for US small caps is much stronger than for large caps, highlighted by the 67% aggregate Q3 earnings beat for small caps.
* Small caps are trading at a big discount to large caps despite better earnings momentum and higher expected growth into 2022.

**2. Long US Health Care over US Staples**

* Collaborating with UBS Healthcare analysts, we assessed the potential impacts of election scenarios for the key policy issues in detail. We see a Biden win and split Congress as a good outcome for drug pricing, ACA and other issues. We think progress on Healthcare policies via legislation is less likely, beyond must-pass items such as Medicare/tax extenders. Overall, lower policy risk should be reflected in many areas of Healthcare where policy was an overhang.
* Healthcare policy overhang is still priced. Healthcare is trading at a \~26% P/E discount vs the S&amp;P 500, near a 30y high, with discounts within Healthcare subsectors also considerable for those segments exposed to regulatory risk. Thus upside could be notable as uncertainty fades. Within the Healthcare sub-industries, many of the affected areas are trading 15pp to 25pp below average relative discounts: Biotech, Pharma, HC Tech, HC Services, Distributors, Managed Care and Facilities. On the other side, Life Sciences, Equipment and Supplies are trading 15pp+ above prior average relative levels. Some of the relative repricing has likely been driven by the fall in interest rates – valuing growth more in a low-rate world. But some of the relative repricing likely also reflects the risks from the election.
* Managed Care and Hospital stocks have rallied 20% on average in the 6mo following elections. The anomaly is likely due to the large discount that typically gets priced in for regulatory risk, which eventually reverses as uncertainty recedes. The forward P/E for Managed Care going into the 2020 election was at a \~36% discount to the S&amp;P 500, slightly greater than the average 33% discount. Hospitals show a similar pattern. Pharma in this election has also priced more risk, with drug pricing reform an overhang. We see further upside ahead for Healthcare as that policy risk re-prices and growth should remain solid, particularly relative to other defensive sectors.
* Healthcare is the preferred defensive, with upside vs Staples. On 2022 earnings, Healthcare is trading at a 23% discount to Consumer Staples, just above historic lows. Healthcare could lag in a recovery, but Staples have seen a pull forward in demand during the pandemic from the stay-at-home theme. Reopening and vaccine adoption would be a headwind to near-term Staples growth. Relative re-rating potential for Healthcare can provide upside vs defensives in a recovery.

**Tl;dr:**

* A Biden win/split Congress is a good outcome for drug pricing/ACA.
* Healthcare is trading at a \~26% P/E discount vs the S&amp;P 500, near a 30y high. Within the Healthcare subindustries, many of the affected areas are trading 15pp to 25pp below average relative discounts.
* We see further upside for Healthcare as policy risk re-prices and with growth remaining solid.
* Reopening and vaccine adoption would be a headwind to near-term Staples growth.

**3. Long UK &amp; Germany over Spain &amp; Italy**

* UK: This year, the underperformance has accelerated. This underperformance has left relative valuations to Europe on P/E, P/BV and dividend yield all at, or close to, 20-year lows. And that extreme valuation discount is not due to just one or two sectors, but is actually widespread across the whole market. Out of 24 UK sectors, 18 currently trade on larger P/E discounts to their European peers than their 15- year average. Additionally, the UK has superior earnings momentum relative to Europe. We favour banks.
* Germany: Germany has the cyclicality and exposure to a global economic recovery. It is now cheap on both relative P/E and cyclically adjusted P/E. The dividend yield premium to Europe is near an eight-year high. Earnings momentum is above the rest of Europe.
* Spain: Spain has the weakest relative earnings momentum in nine years and is likely to see the weakest profit recovery into end-2021 – with earnings expected to still be 24% below 2019 levels. Our macro team also points out the relatively poor macro backdrop. Spain currently ranks 12th out of the 12 countries on our European country scorecard.
* Italy: Italy has underperformed, but only broadly in line with the relative earnings momentum deterioration. Additionally, we see only limited further tightening of the BTP-Bund spread – a key driver

**Tl;dr:**

* Both the UK and Germany have high cyclicality and cheap valuations relative to the rest in Europe.
* Spain has the weakest relative earnings momentum in nine years. Italian valuations re-rating exhausted along with BTPs.

* Korea, as a cyclical market (72% of the index) has tended to outperform in phases of industrial recovery, such as we expect in 2021. China, on the other hand, has outperformed in 2020 on the back of: (1) being first in and first out of the virus, and (2) having a relatively positive sector exposure that is skewed to 'new economy' sectors benefiting relatively from changing consumption patterns around the pandemic. What changes in 2021 is the ongoing shift to a global manufacturing recovery, while the delta on growth in China does not move to the same degree. On top of this, Korea is at the 20th percentile of its relative valuation range compared to China over the past 10 years.
* To some extent, this trade has shades of Value versus Growth, but in neither market are the Financials a large part of the index (8% in Korea, 14% in China), so in reality this is more about an industrial cyclical recovery compared with a tapering off in performance from 'new economy' stocks in an economy that has already largely recovered and opened up. Moreover, the largest stocks in China now face recent and unexpected regulatory headwinds, while we have a very positive view of the memory semi cycle, which plays into the largest sector by market cap in MSCI Korea.

**Tl;dr:**

* Korea to outperform through the 2021 industrial recovery. Korea's relative valuation to China is in the bottom quintile of its historical range.
* Strong memory semi cycle should help Korean IT trump China's internet companies exposed to regulatory risks.

**5. Long Europe reopening basket over North Asia reopening basket**

* While many Asia-Pacific countries have been lauded for their handling of the pandemic, this could potentially be a relative equity challenge in 2021. As vaccines become available, the incentive to open up is likely to be higher among populations where the virus is more embedded. Conversely, the threshold to open up borders in economies where the virus has been largely eliminated is likely to be much higher. Even as vaccines are provided to the most vulnerable in society, we think governments in economies where the virus is less prevalent will be less willing to open up at the same pace, having worked so hard to reduce transmission close to zero.
* This creates an interesting scenario where domestic mobility and global travel restrictions ease more rapidly in populations where the virus is endemic, compared to those in parts of APAC where virus management has been strict and effective (for example China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand).
* How to think about this in terms of equities? There are a few ways to play this. One is to go overweight the vaccine-sensitive stocks in Europe, versus the same group in Asia. In Europe, the sectors that have performed best on vaccine news are Healthcare Equipment, Construction Materials, Autos, Capital Goods, Transportation, Consumer Durables and Consumer Services. Many of these consumer-related sectors might benefit more from a more broad-based and international opening up, than the more domestic opening up that has happened hitherto in China.
* Figure 150 and Figure 151 show the relative performance and relative valuation (given cyclically depressed earnings, we use P/Book) of these sectors in Europe to those in Asia – the European sectors are considerably less expensive in relative terms compared to Asia, while performance has also suffered in relative terms.

**Tl;dr:**

* APAC economies that dealt with COVID-19 faster and more efficiently are likely to wait longer to fully reopen even as the vaccine is rolled out.
* In Europe, consumer-related sectors might benefit more from a more broad-based and international opening up. In China, the gains in those sectors might have run out of steam.

Bitcoin,Sold grossly undervalue despite knowing its going to the moon,"First off, yes, I'm and impatient 22 y/o who tries to make money fast.

After hodling throughout the 2017 and summer 2019 highs (taking 0 profits despite advice from many people) I finally became fed up with constantly holding through the peaks and regretting it for the year of lows that followed. Since BTC hit £10,000 in the last few months I have been systematically selling up to £20,000 where I only have 0.05btc remaining. This is what I thought would be the 'smart' thing to do after constantly missing out on cashing profits. Now we are where we are and I'm depressed as I would have a near life changing amount of money (for me at least) and mad that I finally played it 'smart' and missed out big time. 

I know the first rule is to long it no matter what, which I've been living by for 3 years, but go easy on me considering my current financial situating and frustration on constantly missing out. 

Realistically we are going to see a a correction soon, at least in my opinion. I just want to know peoples thoughts on how I played this and to basically make me feel less awful about this than I already do",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Please don't sell to pay off debt,"I'm new around here, but this goes for any appreciating asset. If you are in the U.S., don't sell your BTC to pay off a mortgage or even pay outright for property. Here's why. 

Interest rates are historically low - your mortgage debt is likely to be an asset once rates start going back up. For every $100K in mortgage debt, every additional % point is another $20K in total paid. So if you have a $300K mortgage at 3% and interest rates go up to 4%, the total cost for life of the 3% loan will be $60K less. There is a good chance this differential can become an asset in itself. 
 
And just as important - YOU NEVER OWN PROPERTY OUTRIGHT. You have to pay property taxes, and with the debt the government is piling up right now don't be surprised to see those rates increase. The less capital you have sunk into the asset the greater flexibility you will have should there be significant overreach or other issues (civil unrest, etc). In the meantime, your BTC is completely portable. 

At this point, the only thing I would consider cashing in for is:

1. Temporary mortgage payments if you lost a job 
2. To make a down-payment on a property - the minimum possible. And if with that, you can't afford the mortgage payment, then YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY. You MUST figure out a way to get cash-flow, otherwise there is a high likelihood you will fuck up and wind up losing your investment. 
3. Partial payment on a cash-flowing investment - but only if I already had experience in the field with similar successful cash-flowing investments. 

If you are holding significant Bitcoin right now (and sadly I am not), you have an opportunity to build generational wealth. Please don't squander this gift.",cryptocurrency

Right now, my expenses are paid for by family and there aren't any big things that I want to buy right now, and that is likely to continue until I graduate in 2.5 years (if all goes according to plan). I've read posts that talk about massive gains from saving for retirement a few years earlier, but even with a 7% (compounded annually, and I understand that this is quite high) interest rate, 2 years extra only nets me $3094.07¹ extra, which isn't that much in the context of retirement decades from now after inflation will likely make that even less useful.

During my time while working, social security was not withheld from my paychecks ,and I believe the payment has been deferred? I honestly don't know if pay back this money when I file or December 2021?

I worked 3 other jobs this year though that did take out social security from paychecks.

Additionally started contributing to retirement fund (TSP).

So with all this I was just wondering how I should proceed when filing taxes? 

I was planning to use Turbotax or taxfreeusa. However I don't wanna screw anything up when filing taxes ,and I was wondering when using these resources will their be prompts that asked about if you received economic payment or if social security was defer?

personalfinance,Condo Refinancing Question,"Hi Everyone. I'm in the middle of refinancing my condo and had a question about it. I bought the condo about 6 years ago for around 345k. Since then I've done a lot of work on the home and the area has appreciated significantly. The current value based on recent comps in the building is about $430k. Now that interest rates are fantastic I wanted to lower my monthly payment so I started to refinance. During the refinancing process I entered $430k which isn't an aggressive estimate but it isn't a conservatize estimate either. What happens if the condo actually sells for less than $430k? The loan amount is for $250k and the rest is my equity.

personalfinance,2020 Expenses Summary,"After seeing a post here yesterday that many people found interesting, I thought I would share our breakdown of where the money went in 2020. We are a 35 year old dual income professional couple with a 2 year old son in the Boston, Massachusetts metro area. I started tracking my expenses in 2004 at the start of college when I was living on my own and needed a way to keep track of where money was and what was owed. I did this in Excel and have kept at it since. It's grown from tracking 5 accounts to tracking 15. I still do it in Excel and input line for line all transactions so I can correctly categorize them. I update it every 1 to 2 weeks and it takes me 20-40 minutes each time depending on how much has been happening. It's great to have all the data available and to see year on year trends. We also worked with a financial planner this year for the first time and it made it super easy to get him all the info needed. After the plan was delivered I modified it further to make sure that we're staying on track to our plan.

Below is a simplified summary of where the money went. My tracker has many more categories, but many of them were less than 1% so I added them to other categories for simplicity. For example, I track restaurants, groceries, coffee shops and alcohol all separately but lumped them into one ""Food"" bucket. Hope you find it interesting.

personalfinance,"Confusion on how to calculate a ""Break even point"" with a refi that will actually ""cost"" 120 dollars more a month. (Refinancing 23 yr. left on 4.1 30 yr to a 15 yr. 2.1)","Ok. So some background info:    

Bought townhome in 2005 right before the crash.  30 year fixed, 5.875 interest. (Normal at the time.)   
Refinanced under the harp program in 2012--when the place was worth mothing-- to a 30 year 4.1.  Monthly payment went down of course.    

We *were* going to make extra payments to keep on schedule with the original 30 year loan timeframe. Didn't happen. So we have technically 23 years left on the refinanced 30 year at 4.1  

I can now get a refi to a 15 year for 2.1 because interest rates are so low, with roughly $3,800 closing costs.  This would put us right back on schedule (we've been in the house 15 years), but it *would* have a slightly higher payment of about 120 dollars per month because of the shorter timeframe.  Obviously, even thought monthly cost is higher, a *great deal* more would be going toward principal a month because of the 15 year timeframe.    

However, we don't want to be here for 15 years.  Maybe 5 max? We have kiddos now and townhome is feeling small. We are trying to save tons of cash for a new house. (50 k per year for 4-5 years...we live in an expensive area.) However, we *may* keep this house as a rental as we can get good cash for it per month, and it would make a great long term investment/potential in-law home in the future.   

*But what we are trying to figure out is the break even point and if a refi is worth it since we don't plan on being here more than 5 years as our primary residence.*    

**So, with a new mortgage that would be more a month but paying down debt faster, how do I calculate break even?**   

I entered all the info in a refinance calculator and it says ""-31 months"" to break even.""  Obviously, they are expressing months negatively since the mortgage is higher per month, but can I also use this number to calculate break even? I am assuming that timeframe (not quite 3 years) is the amount if time to make up the 3,800 dollars in closing costs with saved interest?   

Current: 190,000 left on loan  
23 years left  
Principal Amount per month:458  
Interest 652  
Escrow 412  

Refi  
Principal Amount per month: 898 (A big difference of course!)   
Interest 332 (A big difference of course!)  
Escrow 412??  (Would this rise since the home is being ""resold?""  Do my property taxes change here? State of FL.)  

Anyway, obviously a refi is the better *long-term option* as it would save something like 84k over the life over the 23 years left on the original, but with a 5 year time span here, we are just trying to see whether it is worth it to refi. Also, I assume if I keep it as a rental, it is worth the re-fi to have someone else pay down our debt faster. I don't think the 120 a month negatively impacts us that much in a rental situation. 

Anyway, thoughts are greatly appreciated here! If I can confidently say ""not quite 3 years is the break even"", then I feel better. If it is shorter, then great but if it is longer, I need to understand how to calculate that as well.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

When I first became interested in FIRE around 2010, I imagined that 2000 would go down as the worst time ever to retire. So, I decided to start tracking their portfolio performance. Since I was invested entirely in stocks, I looked at how they would do if they were 100% in stocks. These days I have FIRE'd, and my portfolio looks very different. But, I keep updating this analysis each year for fun!

Whenever I post this people ask about other asset allocations. That's more work than I feel like doing. But, I've added a line for someone 100% invested in 10-year treasuries at a 4% withdrawal rate. Comparing that with the stock performance can give you some idea of how a blended portfolio will do.

&amp;#x200B;

**Results**

If you retired in 2000 with 100% S&amp;P500 and stuck to a fixed 4% SWR, you were scared out of your mind only 9 years later with 23% of your portfolio remaining. But if you were super irrational and stayed the course, the next decade+ of returns were so good that you still have exactly 23% of your portfolio remaining as of 3 days ago! Still, you would need historically good returns over the next decade to not run out of money before a 30 year retirement horizon is up. And given the historically high CAPE ratios and low interest rates, I'm not optimistic about stock returns in the intermediate term.

If you were looking for a longer retirement window than 30 years, or if you wanted to preserve a significant portion of your portfolio value, it looks like the year-2000 retiree (who is 100% stocks) would have needed a much lower WR of 2.5-3%. But there are 2 pieces of good new. First, incorporating just a bit of bonds into your portfolio would have greatly offset the poor performance of stocks, leaving you pretty comfortable with a 3.5-4% SWR. Secondly, retiring just a few years before or after the worst retirement year in generations would mean you've actually seen your portfolio grow!

personalfinance,Which debt to pay off first?,"I'm trying to decide which loans to prioritize at the moment, and none of the advice I've seen online seems to apply directly to my situation (or I'm just too dumb to understand it..).

I'm currently a PhD student, and I also have about $30k of federal loans in deferment from a master's degree. They're still accruing interest at about 5-6%.

Should we focus on the med school loans first or put all extra money towards paying off my loans in deferment, since the interest rates are higher? Most of the advice I've seen online suggests paying off higher interest loans, but the comparisons made are usually between loans where the interest rates are significantly different OR the loan amounts are similar. In my case, the loan amounts are drastically different. We want to minimize the amount of interest we have to pay overall as we try to pay off all these loans over the next 5 years.",finance

**TL;DR**: grew up in poverty (financially only, plenty of love and plenty to be happy for), worked hard, valued education, and now I'm getting by. Components of my dashboard are **-linked-** within the post. Enjoy and critique!

**Background**

I'm 27, male, single, grew up in poverty in the rural Midwest. I'm first generation college along with my 2 siblings, state school educated, and tend to think I live below my means. I've been introduced as ""the cheapest a-hole you'll ever meet."" While I am frugal, I always pay more than my fair share, feed guests and provide alcohol, volunteer my time, and tip generously when services are provided (haircuts, meals out, ice cream).

I won't apologize for any privilege. My parents are hard working, loving people who dedicate their lives to our family. There was no family college or direct financial assistance. One of my earliest memories was asking my father if we were rich. His response, ""we are rich in love."" Growing up, we were 5 people living the American Dream, as far as I'm concerned.

I'm employed as an System Admin within the Federal Government. I'm IT by trade only; I majored in a physical science (BS &amp; MS), and gravitated toward statistics and computer science within my field. My earnings/location by year:

* 2015-2016, WI, $15,000 (graduate school)
* 2017, DC, $45,000
* 2018, DC, $56,000
* 2019, DC, $69,000
* 2020, DC -&gt; IN, $86,000
* 2021, IN, $93,000

I've been tracking money in and money out since starting grad school in Sept 2015. I'm talking every receipt, categorized (split &amp; figure tax/item if, say, making a Walmart run purchasing variety of goods) and entered into excel. My approach will certainly seem excessive to some, but it takes me &lt; 1 min to enter the data usually, and I find it fun and worthwhile. Different strokes for different folks.  I've collectively spent MANY untracked hours tracking my economy and developing this tool. It's an ever-changing tool that was originally based off of this [rudimentary budget](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/personal-budget-spreadsheet.html), and grew in inspiration of many of the financial tools I've come across in this sub.  I have linked to graph inspirations for those looking to replicate.

**-**[**Assets**](https://imgur.com/5Rb535S)**-**

My spreadsheet is driven by this Data-Assets timeline. In this snapshot, the timeline spans my period of record, Sept 2015 - Dec 2020. The blocks on the left are fairly self-explanatory. ""Returns"" are shown over the course of the timeline and for the last month (Dec 2020 in this case). ""Balance"" is the Asset balance for the last month of the timeline, and the Net/In/Out is the money in/out during that month. I count investments as money out, so the 'net' is money that didn't have a destination (didn't pay bills/groceries/get invested/etc). ""Savings Rate' donuts are for the last month of the timeline (dark green, 77% for Dec) and the year of the month (light green, 27% for 2020). This savings rate is: ((Take home pay - non savings spending) / take home pay). ""Financial Independence"" was an effort to track FI, though there is a lot of variability. ""Inflation Rate"" is non-savings/non-tax spending compared to the year before. This helps keep my lifestyle inflation in check. I moved cross-country and purchased a vehicle in cash in 2020, which contributed to the 2020 personal inflation.

Here is what the graph on the right represents:

* Purple: Health Savings Account. The dark purple is the amount of HSA invested; the light purple is held by the bank, earning 0.02%. The purple line is total $ in HSA
* Green: liquid assets. The bars represent Savings/Checking/Money Market, CDs, and Series EE Bonds, which were gifts from grandparents in the 90s/00s. The green line is total $ in fairly-easy-to-liquefy vehicles. I am risk averse and hold too much here, though home ownership is hopefully &lt; 5 years away.
* Blue: Investments. The dark blue is retirement (Roth IRA and Thrift Savings Plan-a 401k). The light blue is my taxable brokerage. The blue line is total $ invested
* Black: total assets. I do not include vehicles or belongings in this. I rent, so no equity either.

The IRA/TSP/HSA donuts are used to see where I am in terms of contributions vs limits. Don't worry, the surplus $233 in IRA and $250 in HSA are 2020 contributions to the 2019 IRA/HSA.

**-**[**Expenses**](https://imgur.com/c6zdkL2)**-**

​""Past 12 months"" are sparkline columns representing the relative proportion of the category over the past 12 months (right-most column is darker and is the last month of the timeline, Dec 2020 here). The categories are: taxes, housing, savings, transportation, food, utilities, medical, personal (clothing/toiletries/etc), alcohol, and entertainment. The actual vs expected graph (based on [this](https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/5838-excel-actual-vs-budget-chart.html)) shows what percent I spent on a category relative to my Net (after tax) Income (except I use Gross for savings and taxes). This doesn't add to 100 since I use a different basis for comparing 2 categories. This Savings rate calculation is *dedicated*\-savings only, which differs from the one in the 'Assets' section. I need to revisit, pick one way to calculate, and run with that.

A note on transportation. Prior to tracking, I owned a 1990 98 Oldsmobile regency and then a 1986 Ford Ranger. These vehicles cost $500 and $550 cash, and I paid that and insurance. And they broke down a lot and I spent a lot on repairs (though my dad and I did many of them at home). I lived car-free from 2015-mid2020. I bought a used Japanese car in Sept 2020 in cash when I moved to Indiana. I hope to keep it for many years.

The graph on the right is one of my favorites. I use GETPIVOTDATA to populate the table and create a heat-map of the selected category/sub-category. I can select as many subcategories to compare as I want. The graph is annual cumulative expenses based off the dynamic table. The gray lines are previous years, the bold black line is the average of the previous years, and the red line is the current year. The text (2020: $XXX, Average: $XXX) shows the current month vs average spending to date. This graph has really opened my eyes to the evolution of my spending habits. As a proud Wisconsinite, I've selected my alcohol-related expenses to compare in this image. ""Alcohol"" is liquor store purchases, and ""bars"" is money spent at bars.  In 2016, I was studying a lot and mostly pre-gaming and riding the buzz. Also, it was cheap to get drunk in Wisconsin (25 cent beer nights).  I spent a lot of time in DC bars being a reckless 20-something. I only drink socially, so consumption is down in 2020 thanks to COVID.

The home and vehicle loans are placeholders for whenever I might get those types of loans. My student loans were subsidized. I qualified for academic, community, and need-based scholarships and grants. They paid for my tuition and fees in full, and then some. I was a work-study student, which gave me an edge when applying for on-campus jobs. I averaged 25 hours of work per week, and volunteers 5 hours a week. I was enrolled full-time with 16-18 credit hours per semester. I graduated with a 3.8 GPA undergrad, and 3.9 GPA grad from a great Big 10 school. I worked my ass off and wasn't truly burdened by student loans, knowing I could pay off the loans I took at any time. The money I did borrow went toward living expenses and into the bank, since it was interest-free while enrolled.

personalfinance,"Renter for life? Student Debt, Car, or retirement?","Just looking to get some advice on which direction my personal finance should take. 

31 year old Canadian renter, have a two bedroom apartment on a relative below market lease for $2,200. Currently sublease a room out for $1,250. That rent money is what I'm able to set aside each month for savings. I'm confident I'll always be able to generate income from subleasing. Owning a home isn't a priority/realstic for me right now. 

Currently 9 months into a new role as an Account Manager in the food wholesale industry. It's a stable job, but I'm currently still new and working hard to ""establish myself"", although a bit challenging with the pandemic, but there is long term security. Currently making $74k with very good income potential through stable consistent commission. 

Current have a 10 year old car that is paid off, it has probably two years left based on how much I drive and the make/model. I'm itching to get a new car but know that it best to ride my current vehicle into the ground. 

I have a student loan of 16k that is amortized out for a long period of time. It's on a very low interest rate on an easily manageable payment of $230. My plan is to just leave this and treat it as monthly bill. Dumping all my money into this would just put me at risk of building consumer debt, as I've learned through past experience. I got rid of credits cards a few years ago and I haven't looked back.

I'm currently using YNAB to manage my budget and it has been an absolute game changer for me. . 

My current savings buckets are as follows: 

Emergency $4,000 

Retirement $0 + $500 Monthly 

Car $500 + $500 Monthly

Vacation $500 + $250 Monthly 

Stuff $300 + $250 Monthly 

My emergency fund feels comfortable at $4,000, especially with a seperate car fund. I'd always be looking to top up/maintain that $4,000 amount. My biggest focus areas are sticking to my monthly budget, saving for retirement and my inevitable car repairs and replacement. For me it feels critical that I establish my self in my new career, to hold on to a quality job that I like with great immediate income potential.

cardano,Community Advisor’s Guide to Proposal Evaluation,"Catalyst is perhaps the most ambitious project in Cardano. In its simplest form Catalyst defines the mechanism through which the decentralized Cardano community selects projects to be funded by Cardano’s decentralized treasury. In a broader sense, it is the beginning of a **decentralized governance mechanism**\--a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where the Cardano community comes together to make important decisions about the future of the protocol.

Every few weeks the Cardano treasury makes a certain amount of funds available in the form of grants and anyone can apply to fund their projects.   The process is now managed by IOG but is expected to become incrementally more decentralized in 2021. To vote on the proposed projects a Cardano community member must hold a minimum of 8K ADA, which is the currency of the Cardano platform. Each vote equals one ADA.

While the ultimate decisions are made directly by holders of ADA, the treasury system incentivizes the Cardano community members to serve as community advisors. These effectively serve as sanity filter for all the proposals. The role of the community advisor is to evaluate and rank funding proposals across three dimensions: (i) impact (ii) feasibility (iii) auditability.

# Why This Guide

As we embark on this bold new experiment as a community, we enter the world of finance and economics, which are governed by their set of laws and principles. These principles, if applied consistently, will help us make better funding decisions, which will add to our success as a community.

The purpose of this guide is to expose future Catalyst advisors to several core concepts and mental frameworks that may augment their mental acuity and ultimately improve the quality of our investment decisions as a community.

The end goal is to adopt a set of analytically rigorous frameworks as guiding principles, which will help the community advisors to maximize their impact and minimize resource waste for Cardano. This guide is the first step in a journey that has yet to take us to our end goal.

# The Responsibility of Community Advisors

Although it is not stated explicitly, community advisors have a responsibility to act in the best interests of the Cardano protocol. This comes down to exercising critical thinking to produce well-informed and unbiased assessments of funding proposals. This level of integrity is a foundational assumption and plays a key role in the long-term success of the treasury system and Cardano as a whole.

While we cannot vet every advisor in an open blockchain architecture, we must strive to provide useful mental frameworks to those who take this role seriously so they could do their job well and create avenues for constructive, meaningful discourse. With time, we can only hope that this decentralized organization will encourage the best and the brightest among us to earn the support of the wider Cardano stakeholders through their conduct and through the quality of their decisions.

The very best community advisors will be those who will carefully balance the impact of an idea against its feasibility and auditability while respecting resource constraints. I am confident that their results, measured over a long enough time, will speak for themselves. My preference would be that they be recorded in Cardano’s ledger for posterity and for the objective evaluation of their performance.

# Impact

Impact is one of the major pillars of funding “uncuffed innovation” in Cardano. What is impact and why do we not use some other, true-and-tested metric like internal rate of return or net present value?

Each funding period, the Cardano community formulates a funding challenge, which could be thought of as a funding theme the community would like to pursue.

In that context, impact is a broad measure, which allows us to define and apply it to an ever-changing nature of challenges without too much cognitive limitations. Central to the idea of impact is **ROI—return on intention**. It introduces a crucial distinction from ROI (return on investment), which only measures the monetary form of return. Assessing impact requires that we identify relevant metrics for each funding challenge and measure the outcomes against its declared goals.

For example, the challenge for fund 2 was: **“How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?”**

In this context, impact can be measured with the number of developers and key business decision makers introduced to Cardano. Impact here can be expressed indirectly through awareness building metrics as well as directly through funding specific dAPPs and businesses.

While we need strive to measure economic significance of our funding decisions, we should avoid focusing solely on financial metrics such as IRR and NPV as these could be limiting for a fundamental technology, especially at this early stage, where we are still exploring the potential of the Cardano as a platform.

Thinking in terms of impact therefore is useful, but it does require that we come up with metrics to measure it for each funding challenge. More importantly, it forces us to think more fundamentally about how to set our priorities and formulate future funding challenges. Which brings me to my next point…

# The Pyramid of Needs

Any economic activity we observe, is driven by humans. More specifically, by our wants and needs. Everyday billions of people engage in some form of economically productive activity. They produce and consume goods and services in exchange for money. These kinds of exchanges are facilitated by millions of companies and marketplaces. The entire global economy is a beautiful symphony of economic agents coming to life to satisfy our needs from the most basic to the most ethereal.

A very useful framework to think about these is [Maslowe’s Pyramid of Needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html). In a nutshell, this pyramid describes the full spectrum of human needs from the very basic physiological (food, shelter, water, etc.) to self-fulfillment needs of reaching one’s potential i.e., living a meaningful life.

If we want to truly understand how we should set challenges, we need to study this pyramid carefully and map our challenges to its components. Once we have that level of understanding (it can hardly get more fundamental than that), we should be able to formulate our challenges better and come up with metrics to measure them in the context of impact that they are expected to generate for Cardano.

&amp;#x200B;

[source:  https:\/\/www.simplypsychology.org\/maslow.html ](https://preview.redd.it/b63apg0iw5961.png?width=418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e7d8f23949bdb49cb847c1e6db3478bd668180c)

The advisors need to understand and link businesses, dAPPs or any other treasury-funded endeavor to these needs. The best businesses are the ones which satisfy our specific needs more effectively and efficiently than their competitors.

In assessing the impact, advisors would need to be extremely careful about understanding the use cases and proposals. Assessing proposals should involve a deep dive into the project to understand and perhaps refine each individual project components in terms of the pyramid above.

If the subject matter is beyond their expertise, the advisors should honestly admit that to themselves and move on to projects that they can assess well. One of the best ways to understand our mental limitations, is to be self-aware enough to understand if we are forced to “manufacture” a critical opinion. We all have our shortcomings and understanding them is a sign of mental strength rather than a weakness.

More importantly, adopting this level of awareness by advisors will ensure that Cardano will continue getting exposed to the innovative ideas while reducing the chance of stifling innovation by those who lack the mental capacity to properly understand and assess complex projects. This is also where subject matter experts could play a great role in the community.

That said, advisors could be faced with assessing projects that are objectively convoluted or difficult to grasp. In these cases, the advisors could engage with proposal teams to clarify their positions. If clarity does not materialize after repeated interactions with the proposing team, these attempts should be documented, and the projects should be flagged as hard to assess.

# Feasibility

Gauging the feasibility of a funding proposal involves taking a critical look at the team behind it, assessing the budget and the commitment of the team. Feasibility of the project addresses the execution risk, assuming the idea otherwise makes sense. At this stage we no longer question the impact of the idea but focus on how realistically it could be implemented.

This involves understanding the motivation of the team, its experience, the budget, and the timeline for the execution. These obviously require some degree of judgement by each advisor, so the best course of action is to interact closely with the team BEFORE the assessment and try to understand all these issues.

One thing the advisors should avoid is penalizing teams for execution efficiency. If one team can do the same amount of work in a shorter time frame, it does not mean they are expensive. It means they are better at execution.

# Auditability

The purpose of auditability is to ensure that the team provides enough information to assess impact and the feasibility of the project. It also defines the key parameters of reporting to track the progress of their project. These may vary with each proposal but are crucial in measuring success.

Here again the advisors would be very well encouraged to ask questions, engage with the team to help them formulate useful metrics, if needed.

It is a balancing act by both the advisors and the teams. We do not want to over-complicate the lives of teams by requiring them to spend considerable time to gather and report the minute details about their work. A certain degree of trust here is required, and we should realize that the time and effort of the team is a scarce resource and would be best utilized by working on the end-product rather producing reports that go beyond necessary.

That said, the reports should comprise a set of metrics that demonstrate the impact and the execution progress of the project in clear terms.

# Constraint: Resource Scarcity

Resources are scarce. This concept is fundamental to every economic decision we make as human species. Those of us who realize this fundamental truth, tend to make better decisions over time and are inevitably more successful as a result. This can be seen on a country and on individual levels.

**What are resources?** On a scale of a single individual, resources can be thought of as **time and the productive capacity** **of a person.** The productive capacity of a person is essentially what he can do and how much his work can fetch in the open market. That productive capacity often depends on the level of skills of a person which is often dictated by some combination of practical experience and formal education.

Time, people, and talent, while fundamental resources, are not easily interchangeable, which is why we invented money as a medium of exchange. **Money is a resource. More specifically it is a universally agreed upon proxy for a resource**—something that can be easily used to mobilize people and leverage their talents at a global scale. That is its superpower.

**For countries, companies, and online decentralized platforms like Cardano, money (or ADA) represents a scarce resource.** All else equal ADA is scarcer than its fiat equivalents. Unlike fiat money, which is inflated at a constant rate, ADA’s inflation rate decreases as the time passes.

Resource scarcity acts as a systemic constraint or a filter that prioritizes the projects against the funding challenges set by the Cardano community. We see this on a structural level with each funding period, where the amount of ADA available is fixed, i.e., scarce within that period.

However, it is also helpful to adopt a higher view and understand the implications of our decisions on a longer arc of time, considering the total amount of ADA to be minted.

One way to measure the implications of our decisions would be to divide the amount requested by the total amount of ADA to be issued within a year and base our decisions on that.

# Dos and Don’ts

1. **Do** approach your assessment with a long-term view of adding value to the ecosystem. Provide constructive feedback which is honest but fair.
2. **Do** understand how the project address the funding challenge. If the project addresses the challenge indirectly, ask yourself whether you understand and accept the thought process behind it.
3. **Do** try to understand the fundamentals of each project well before assessing it. Even if you think you understand it, always confirm your views with the project team. This is very crucial.
4. **Do** study the subject matter of the project well before assessing it. Do you have enough basic knowledge to form an informed opinion? Being an advisor offers enormous benefits for the intellectually curious and could enrich your life beyond your wildest dreams.
5. **Do** keep a critical mindset, but give the project teams the benefit of doubt. Always question your own judgement until you arrive at very well-reasoned conclusions by interacting with teams.
6. **Do not** come to the party last minute and try to hammer out as many assessments as you can. It will not help the ecosystem and most definitely will not help you grow as an advisor. This behavior is easily detected and will not help you build a long-term reputation in the community.
7. **Do not** manufacture critical assessments or criticize teams without real substance. If you don’t have anything to add, it is better if you refrain from assessing the proposal. If you fundamentally do not agree with a proposal, always make an honest attempt to understand it, before assessing it. If you have strong reasons to believe a project has serious fundamental shortcomings, make them clear to the team and give them a chance to respond before issuing your final assessment.
8. **Do not** be married to your opinion, however well-formulated. Be open to change your mind if the team addresses your concerns effectively. This is a hard one as we all tend to attach our egos to our opinions. If you do not remove your ego from your thought process as an advisor, you will severely reduce your capacity to contribute constructively.

If I missed anything else, please let me know.

personalfinance,My wife's state income tax from last year still has not dropped,"I realize this might not be the right place to go to but we're a little frustrated and I don't know where else to go....

Last year we submitted our tax returns almost as soon as we got our W2s and got our federal returns about 2 weeks later. My wife also put in for her state income tax(Georgia) while she was at it. We didn't think much about it afterwards because 2020 was just a crazy rollercoaster of a year and we had too much on our plate to think about it. 

But now between tax season being almost upon us and  just finding out that we have our first child on the way we just now realized that it never dropped. We searched our bank account back for a year and some change and... nothing.

Trouble is, I have zero experience filing state income taxes. I'm not from Georgia and my home state exempts me from paying income tax since I'm in the military. We tried calling the GA Department of Revenue, but nobody was home, and she tried using this site that was supposed to track her tax return status and came up with nothing as well. 

Is there another way we can fix this? It's been extremely frustrating and having the extra $800 or so would go a long way to helping us start off on the foot raising our kid.

EDIT: My wife just reminded me that she didn't file the returns until a few weeks later and she had to mail them in because TurboTax was behaving weird. So let's say the USPS lost it. What would our options be(if we even have any?)",finance

However, I don’t know if this would look bad for the loan officer or my credit or anything like that. The accounts were already in collections. Have been for a while.

So here is the scenario. When I was born my mother opened an investment fund. Over the intervening 38 years she forgot about it. I don't recall exactly what kind of fund it is, but it was the kind where the money could only transfer to me when i became of age. A few months ago she got a letter then the investment fund or manager or whatever realized I was now an adult and they stopped trading with those funds and instructed her that the money had to be transferred to me. This money comes out to about 50k. Now half is going to my sister (i have zero issue with this) and the other half is technically mine, though over the last 20 years since I've turned 18 I've cost my parents a lot of money. Legal Fees, Car Repairs, Medical Fees, School, and they paid for my co-op where i live now among other things. By all rights I owe my parents this money, I have no problem with them keeping the 25k.

However I'd like to talk to my mother and convince her to at least take some of it to re-invest again for the future. I read this sub casually and i'm fairly sure one of the first responses is going to be ""Hire a Fiduciary"" and I'll suggest that, but I also wanted to at least start looking in the right direction to suggest what to invest in...

In general I'd want us to invest in Solar and Wind, things that will pay off in another 10-20 years the way her initial investment did. Google/Apple/Nintendo all riskier, but likely to be stable investments in the long run. 

She actually works for a real estate investment company in NYC as a bookkeeper so she's not altogether unfamiliar with this but from my conversations with her she's never done stuff like this. She forgot about this fund afterall!

So I guess my question is, what kind of funds should I suggest we look into, or ask the Fiduciary about if we hire one. If she agrees with me to re-invest 10-15k what should we look into that will grow with time, and maybe even pay out dividends 10 years from now if she wants to retire. Is something that pays out dividends earlier even possible? I don't think the amount is high enough to yield dividends worth anything right away right? Or am I wrong about that?

Oh, and before anyone suggest paying down debt, I'll be suggesting that as well. If i learned one thing reading this place casually is that paying down debt is one of the first steps to investing. I have more then one cards with intrest I'd like to pay down and I don't know if she does, but ask her to consider doing that with me as well. 

My second question pertains to my girlfriend. I helped her file her taxes using the free tax filing tool, and we couldn't submit her federal taxes digitally. When the first Covid Checks were being sent out, we forgot that she was working last year and was going to file taxes, she previously did not. So we used the tool to make sure the IRS had her direct deposit information and like instructed put 0 for what she filed the previous year. We figured this is where we messed up and we were told to just mail in an amended return and the amended return would be considered and would fix it.

Well she got her state refund fairly quickly but she never got her federal refund and she never got her 1200 covid check either. Everytime we used the tool to see the status of her payment we got a message that there was no info at this time. We gave up after 2 months. Now that April is coming up on us again and we're getting 600$ checks this time, I got mine already and we get the feeling she wont get hers again. We double checked with her parents to ensure they were not claiming her or filing for her, as she's 27. They claim they did not and we trust their word on this.
So what can she do to get to the bottom of this? Between her federal rebate and the two covid checks she's missing over almost 2500 combined that the Feds owe her. I think we tried some hotline number provided on the site the tool was but we got disconnected after 2 hours. I want to help her get whats properly owed to her.

personalfinance,Auto Refinance Loan amount larger than original,"Hi all, 

I had about 5k left on my auto loan, paying 280 per month at about 7% interest. 

I wanted to for personal reasons to refinance and stretch it out another 72 months and was approved by the system for 5k at 3% interest for 75 dollars per month. 

I got a notification on the application saying that the lender counter offered for 9.8K at the same interest rate and payment period at 150 per month. 

Does this mean that they'll give me 9.8K to pay off my 5K existing loan and I'll have an extra 4.8K to pay back the loan or add into savings etc? Or that they'll close out my 5K loan and add another 9.8K loan to my name and I wont see the difference? I'm a bit confused and any help would be appreciated!

personalfinance,What to do with EE and I Bonds,"Hi!

My grandparents started putting EE Bonds in my name in 1996 and continued every other month until about 2001 when they switched over to I bonds till about 2011. They recently decided to give me all of the bonds and let me decide what to do with them. 

I have about 60 EE bonds ranging from 1996 to 2002, and 60 I bonds ranging from 2002 to 2011. The First EE bond will hit maturity on 1/2026 and is currently worth \~$55 while the last EE bond is currently worth \~$51. The first I bond will hit final maturity on  05/2032 and is currently worth \~$107 with an interest rate of about 3.7%. The last I bond will hit maturity in 2041 and is currently worth about \~$59 with a 1% interest rate.

I'm currently in no need of this money (thankfully) but wanted to see if there was a smarter way that I could invest it or if I should just let them sit till they hit full maturity. Right now, I'm thinking about cashing the EE bonds since they have such low-interest rates, but I don't know much about the stock market or other investing options.

cybersecurity,Further Education - MBA or JD?,"Tldr; I've got a doctorate in cyber security and close to 40 certs (inclusive of OSCP and CISSP). All of my work has been technical for the past 15+yrs. I'm looking to elevate myself out of technical. Should I reach back for the MBA or jump out to a JD...or do you have a better idea? (I enjoy formal education/academia and I'm open minded.)

Full; I've been in cyber security for a little over 15 years officially and if you consider writing malware for cash back in the late 90s (yes, bad, don't do this, kids), closer to 20 or 25 yrs of experience. I currently work as a penetration tester and adjuct professor as well as free lance consulting from time to time.

My technical certs and tech training ranges from boot camps at small training facilities to training and education at Carnegie Mellon and MIT for specific certificates. I've got nearly 40 certs at this point with Microsoft, CompTIA, LPI, ISC2, Offensive Security, EC-council (shameful, I know), SANS, Oracle, CISCO, CIW, ITIL, and a number of federal qualifications and certifications.

My education is an AA in gen ed, BS in IT, MS in Security, and a D.Sc. in Cybersecurity. This has been a long road over the past 20 or so years to get to my current degree status. All education was part time and I partied out of a lot of schools (up to close to 10 universities at this point, lol). I'd like to stick to part time education and really hammer in my business acumen with another degree or grad certificate.

My work history stretches across education, Federal/DoD, State Govt, Financial, and Healthcare. I've been technical holding titles such as instructor, professor (current), principal investigator, security architect, principal security analyst, and penetration tester (current).

Are there any law nerds, CISOs, or other higher level professionals that focus on security that could give me some advice? I feel like all of my technical background has pigeon-holed me into a tech role. I'd like to branch out and move into senior management or law. I'm not sure about the quals and history that might be necessary to move into either arena (other than the obvious JD + Bar for law). 

Other confounding factor: my base salary is already well over 200k and total monetary comp for my day job is approaching 300k not counting consulting and adjunct work. I'm not in a prime location (RTP, NC). I'm not necessarily chasing the dollars (I'm not NOT chasing them either...), is there much room for improvement without moving to a mega city to boost my income with a JD or MBA?",technology

Bitcoin,Why I'm not selling,"15-20% cap gains tax is absolutely absurd.

I mined my holdings in 2014/15, and because i technically never purchased them, i never reported them on my taxes.

personalfinance,Thinking of the best way to pay my mortgage when I know I will not be living long term in my home.,"Hey PF, I've been on here a bit, but usually I'm in discussions on CCs. 

My wife and I have recently bought a townhome which is perfect for us now, but we know we are probably going to move in 5-7 years.  For our area, there is not much of a renters market so any available are usually highly priced, and we felt that was too long to rent when we know we'll be here a little bit.

We put down only 3.5% and are FHA, but got a pretty good interest rate (2.8%).  PMI sucks, but what are you gonna do.

When we pay our mortgage, we have the ability to pay down principal.  This would be ideal if we want to get rid of that PMI sooner, but we feel by the time we can get out of the PMI, we will probably be looking for a new house.  

So my question is how much, if any, extra money should we be throwing at the principal, when we know this will not be a forever home?

Our first payment was about $600 principal and $750 interest, and I threw an extra $200 onto principal.  $200 is about the amount of money we can set aside to add to principal if needed. (recently married, so our budget is not concrete yet, but I know $200 is the lower end of what we could afford a month.  Probably could increase it to $300)

So, with this in mind, should that $200 go towards principal, or should we invest it?  

We match our 401ks and max our roths, but I really don't want to completely max our 401ks, since we need to save some money now for larger purchases that may be coming up. (Would rather pay cash for a car.)

personalfinance,Create savings account or open entirely new bank account?,"I currently have all of my money in a checking account.  I'd like to open a savings account, but my fiance and I are getting married later this year and will be combining finances shortly afterward.  Bearing that in mind, I'm trying to decide between the following options and I'd like some advice:

1. **Open a checking and savings account at a new bank:** Neither of us plans to stay with our current banks when we marry.  If I changed banks, they would move over to my bank account after we're married.  We would need to use a large or online bank since we plan to move in a few years.  In this case we're leaning towards Ally, but are open to suggestions.
2. **Open a savings account with my current bank:** It's convenient to have a savings account and checking account in the same place.  Opening a savings account at my current bank would be simple, but the interest rate is pretty bad (0.01%).  This may not matter if the account is closed by this time next year anyway.  There's basically no financial advantage over just leaving all of the money in checking (and gaining no interest), but it may help me track savings goals.  I don't know if the work to open the account would be at all worth it.
3. **Open a HYSA with Discover:** I already have a Discover credit card, so I deal with finances through Discover all the time.  Interest rate is currently 0.50%.  I'm hoping that I don't have to move money often between checking and savings.  I also don't know if consolidating accounts after the wedding will be more difficult with yet another account to consolidate.

personalfinance,Why is tax planning and forecasting for the W-4 so hard?,"TLDR: Good at math. Got burned tax planning in W-4 in the past. Got help but wondering ...Is tax planning secret complex math only CPAs and tax lawyers can do? What do you do?

My undergrad was physics, so I guess I know a tiny bit about rocket science. But, why oh why does it seem that figuring out how much I should make sure is taken out of my paycheck (and my wife's as we file married, jointly) to pay federal taxes is SO hard to estimate properly.

**Some Background**

So, we have a mortgage, kids grown and both recently graduated from college and took on some of their college debt via loans. We put away in a 401k (not enough). With all that in 2020 for the 2019 year we ended with the standard deduction from the tax changes from this Administration. But, we felt ""burned"" by an unexpected tax bill with the federal filing last year... actually over the past several years. I always use HRBlock and used TaxAct software and online before HRBlock bought them. I have made adjustments on the number of people I claim. 10 years ago, I often overestimated and got back money (sometimes too much, giving Uncle Sam a nice interest-free loan..oops)

**For 2019 Taxes filed in 2020**

This year, we ended up working with a tax lawyer (oops, big bill from that guy) who got me to file for an extension while he figured it out and did some tax planning. He found a mistake, but I still owed enough for a penalty and then I filed in Oct. By the end of spring, he did a tax planning forecast for the remainder of 2020 and I adjusted my W-4 to take out additional money out of my check for the remainder of the year.

**Planning for 2021?**

Now, it is Jan 3, 2021 and I want to try to get the calculations for how much to get taken out of my paycheck for all of 2021. I tried a couple free online tax calculators but the numbers see super high, plus it is free and maybe, you get what you pay for??

Is this type of planning for people with mortgages, healthcare insurance payments and a 401k something only CPA and tax lawyers can do because it is just too complicated? Does anyone out there do this themselves and found success (success to me is that I have a small tax bill, like a couple hundred bucks due in April)",finance

ethereum,Sales taxes are a burden for business - A thought experiment with ethereum.,"**Intro**

I've been an e-commerce dev for a bunch of years, and as a result I have become exposed to the nitty gritty of how businesses collect and remit sales taxes. Over the last handful of years or so, it's _mostly_ become a solved problem ... kind of. I can't speak for anyone outside the US, but I know that it's a lot easier for non-US businesses when it comes to certain aspects (I may be wrong, I know VAT in Europe can be troublesome). I also can't really speak for many US states where sales taxes are fairly simple (or non-existent). I'm going to keep referring to sales taxes in this post, but I want you to keep in mind that they could also be an analog for some other aspect of business finance that I am not thinking about - ie any time there is a ""fee"" which can't be figured out until you know who your customer is.

**Sales tax basics**

So here in my state, the way sales tax works is that as a business when a customer comes into your brick and mortar store and buys something, they pay the tax based on which jurisdictions your business exists in. This is true anywhere. You'll often have a few different taxes that add up to the total tax which may include state tax, county tax, city tax, and other special districts which can be a million different things like a region that all pays for public transit with sales taxes. This is pretty simple, relatively, and it's easy to know what to charge your customer _before_ they walk in the door.

**Sales tax not-so-basics**

But it isn't always so simple. The product you sell might have options for delivery. In which case (and depending on what state you're in), the customer comes in the store, brings something to the register to pay, and then they say ""I want this thing delivered to my house which is in another city."" The Point of Sale software (POS) will then need a different way to handle how to figure the tax. In some places, this might just be a basic two-dimensional table with a ZIP code that maps to a set of taxes to charge. That's not the case here. You basically cannot accurately determine sales tax unless you enter a specific address and some other computer system takes that address and converts it into a point on a map and then it will look at any other geographic shapes that overlap the point. If the point is inside the shape (which might be a county, a city, a state, etc) then it says ""okay charge this tax"" and if it is inside multiple shapes it says ""here's the few different taxes broken down by type - city/state/etc.

I recall some US federal act from I think the 80s that is kind of related here (I don't remember the name of the act). But this act has to do with cell phones and sales taxes and was done so that your cell provider could determine where to charge you sales tax based on where you used the phone most often and _not_ where you had the bill sent. It determines this through tower triangulation. Again, I don't recall the name of this or know if it's still used, but it's an interesting comparison.

**Third-party services**

Until recently, there's been basically two ways to figure out the sales tax you needed to charge a customer. First, you looked it up manually. You use some system which might be provided by your state or some third-party and you entered those values in an order for tax. This is a bad way to do it because there could be human error during input, the database you're looking up might be out of date, etc. The other way to do it is to subscribe to a service which helps automate this. There's a few companies out there that specialize in this. You pay them a monthly fee and/or a transaction fee each time you look up. For example, our business has used a service which is like $80/mo for 1000 lookups and each additional lookup is $0.08 each. Keep in mind, this doesn't mean an actual _sale_ is happening, you're simply inputting an address and it gives you a table of which taxes apply. You might just be giving a customer a quote which they don't purchase for a few weeks. So each individual sale will have on average more than one lookup. The service we use is very basic, but there are others that are more complex and end up being a regular monthly fee. I have done estimates for our business and it would cost us multiple thousands of dollars a month for a service that exists only to tell us how much to charge customers.

**Misc scenarios**

There are also a million other situations where things change. Maybe your city charges a sugar tax. Maybe the product is not taxable because it's a basic need. Maybe there is an exemption for a charity. The possibilities are limited only by the imagination of various political jurisdictions. 

**Why am I posting this on r/ethereum?**

So this brings me to the main point and where I see smart contracts coming into play and being useful. Doing all this work to manage sales taxes is burdensome for businesses and without experience or a CPA or other resources, it becomes a drain. The main reason for this drain is that you need to have a system built to handle every possible situation for every customer and product. For some businesses, they might not even bother to do it correctly, leading to customers being over or undercharged.

I have seen this personally when I have bought a drink that was charged a sugar tax despite it being exempt from the tax. The law is so complex that the business owner probably just charges it on everything rather than trying to figure out each individual drink's status. Or there might be a situation where the business is using a software system they have paid for, but the software is inaccurate. I recently discovered the giant gaping hole in how Shopify handles sales taxes despite their claims otherwise. Any business in our state using their service for a website or POS will either be doing it incorrectly or paying thousands of dollars a month to do it sort of correctly. 

**So how can ETH help?**

I was thinking about this last night and a very simple thought came into my head that is kind of a big paradigm shift in the assumption of what a business does when it makes a sale (or invoices a B2B client, or anything transactional in nature that is conditional based on the status of the other party). What if instead of a business needing to figure out all these millions of different things themselves and reinvent a wheel that's been invented before, that information was instead stored as part of the customer? This would take the burden off the business and allow them to remain in compliance and provide better service, more accurate pricing, and not be at a competitive disadvantage. 

**How would that work?**

Recall the situation at the beginning of this giant wall of text: Customer comes into store, picks out an item, brings it to the register, and says ""I want this delivered to my house in the next city."" This is the tricky part I have been thinking about - how can the customer's information (their address, taxable status ie wholesale/charity/tax exempt/etc) be used by a POS system to determine all of this stuff automatically so that the business doesn't have to bother with knowing anything beforehand? Existing in a smart contract that the POS would tap into, the customer's checkout is simple and quick and the business benefits because some system just managed to determine the customer's sales tax jurisdictions and add those charges to the order, then the system sets aside those funds for remittance at the end of the day (or month or quarter or whatever). This opens up new opportunities for business to improve and innovate - without these burdens they can quickly build new models that don't need six months of legwork just to handle something stupid like sales taxes.

For reference, I think our business currently has several dozen different sales tax licenses for all the cities near us. An accountant goes to each city's website and downloads their form to apply and then remits the taxes. Some cities have taxes remitted monthly. Some quarterly. Some use a PDF form. Some use a Word Doc. Some use Excel. Some accept online payments. Some require checks to be mailed. I think our state in total has 700 different sales tax jurisdictions.

**Where now?**

I don't really have much of anything to offer anyone. I am hoping that this post simply serves as a reminder that smart contracts can revolutionize business in ways that make the world a better place. I think that these thoughts, while focused on sales taxes, could be adapted for other situations where two parties need to make complicated agreements with each other based on the status of each.

personalfinance,LOC or keep paying car and credit card normally?,"So about a year and a half ago I got a new vehicle, ended up being a really bad deal, sneaky salesman, and I failed to press for the answers I should have. I'll spare the details as I know I've made poor a poor choice and I've given myself a hard enough time over it. 

Anyways, over the past year I've ended up overpaying for a vehicle that is far too late to return, I've looked into refinancing, and talked to several dealers about trying to make new deals that can help eliminate some negative equity and get something closer to its true value. No luck. With the car payments I've and starting a job at a lower position around the same time I've had trouble keeping up with my credit card as well and the issue seems to be snowballing. The car loan interest rate is 7.5%.

With my new job I'm required to supply my own tools which have also cost thousands of dollars. I have 3 years of school left before becoming journeyman, which also means I have three more raises before main journeyman rate. 

Now since I've been denied any other options of getting out of the loan. I was wondering if it would be worth it to get a line of credit. My plan if possible, would be to get the line of credit, sell the car privately, pay the difference of the negative equity with the line of credit and get a cheaper vehicle to drive for the meantime and hopefully knock off a few years and about $12,000 off of my total owed on the loan. 

I've never missed a payment or had any issues that way but I feel like if I don't do something now, it's going to get to a point where I do and I can't risk that. My credit score is already taking a hit having my credit utilization over 30% for such a a long period of time. Unfortunately indint own a home so it would be an unsecured LOC but I do have a co sign if needed. Would this be worth it or do I buckle down and stick out the remaining 5 years of the loan?",finance

personalfinance,"Coronavirus Megathread Update (January, 2021)","# Overview

Last March, we posted a [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fhrfqo/coronavirus_megathread_resources_discussion_and/) with tons of information about Coronavirus-related issues, and in September a [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) was posted with additional information on updates to payroll tax deferrals, student loan interest waiver, and unemployment. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic and recent U.S. governmental actions, we are posting a third installment of this megathread. **Please keep in mind that politics and political discussions are still not allowed here.**

# Stimulus Payments (updated Feb 13, 2021)

If you have not received the first or second stimulus payments at this point and believe you are eligible, or are eligible for more than you have already received based on your 2020 tax return, you will have to file your 2020 tax return and claim the missing amount as the [Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit). Common cases where this applies:

*I believe I was eligible for the first and second stimulus but haven't received it, and still get an error when checking the Get My Payment portal

* I was a dependent in 2019 (and/or 2018 if your 2019 was not yet filed for the first stimulus), or mistakenly indicated that I could be claimed as a dependent, but cannot be claimed as a dependent for 2020 (Note: You don't just decide if you're a dependent or not, verify if you are eligible to be claimed as one [as defined by the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501#en_US_2019_publink1000196863).)

* I had a child in 2020 and am now eligible for the additional amount for a qualifying dependent

You can check if you are eligible with the [IRS eligibility FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-a-eip-eligibility). Non-dependent individuals were eligible for $1200 for the first stimulus and $600 for the second stimulus if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) was below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 for the first stimulus and $1,200 for the second stimulus if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 for the first stimulus and $600 for the second stimulus per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the cutoff amounts noted above, your stimulus payment will be reduced by 5% of the difference between your AGI and the income threshold. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000 for the first stimulus and $87,000 for the second stimulus. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000 for the first stimulus and $174,000 for the second stimulus.

**The recovery rebate credit is determined based on the information on your 2020 tax return**, you can see the amount you’re being credited directly on your Form 1040, Line 30 of your prepared return before you file. Any of the online tax services can handle this tax credit. If you have questions about which tax software to use, there is a [Tax Filing Software Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/kz613i/tax_filing_software_megathread_a_comprehensive/) with more information.

Some people have reported getting the second stimulus payment later than expected, so it’s recommended to double check the status of your stimulus payments on the [Get My Payment portal](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) before filing your tax return. 

### **FAQs:**

* **Q** I filed my 2020 tax return already to claim the second stimulus payment I hadn’t yet received, then received a check in the mail for the missing amount. What do I do?

* **A**  You'll likely have to wait until your return is processed, and then file an amended return, to correct this issue.

* **Q** I don’t file tax returns because I earn below the reporting threshold or don’t have any income. How do I get the recovery rebate credit?

* **A**  You can file a tax return without income. Include any income you do have, even if it is below the reporting threshold, even income from a savings account can be included. Otherwise you may need to add in $1 in interest income in order for the online tax services to be able to handle processing the return. This is essentially what the Non-Filer’s Tool that was open last year did for you.

* **Q** I am eligible for both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. If I never received it, is there anything I can do to get the recovery rebate credit?

* **A** No, the recovery rebate credit is ultimately a 2020 tax credit. The information provided on your 2020 tax return is what is being used to determine your eligibility, your previous return information does not matter at this point.

* **Q** I am eligible for both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. Will I need to pay back what I received?

* **A** No, there was no information provided in the bills requiring payments to be returned if eligibility changes between the 2018/2019 and 2020 tax years. This is also noted in the [IRS FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-j-reconciling-on-your-2020-tax-return).

* **Q** The [Get My Payment](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) portal says the payment was already sent and/or I received Notice 1444 in the mail saying my stimulus was sent, however I never actually received it. What do I do?

* **A** See the IRS page on [Payment Issued but Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Not Received](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-f-payment-issued-but-lost-stolen-destroyed-or-not-received) for guidance on starting a Payment Trace

The IRS has an extensive list of [Economic Impact Payment FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center) with more information.

Be aware of potential scams related to stimulus payments or other coronavirus relief packages. CNBC has a helpful article with examples of [common stimulus scams](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/stimulus-check-scams-here-are-red-flags-to-watch-for.html).

At this time, [a third stimulus has been proposed](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602024/second-stimulus-check-update-senate-kills-2000-payments), but has not been officially passed. If that changes we will update this information to reflect that. **Until then, there is no additional information to provide regarding the criteria for a potential third stimulus or how the payments may or may not be handled.**

# Payroll Tax Deferral

Payroll taxes consist of two related taxes: Social Security (6.2% of wages) and Medicare (1.45% of wages). Both employees and employers pay these taxes (i.e., for every $1 of social security taxes you pay, your employer also pays $1). Only the Social Security portion of payroll taxes may be deferred right now, not Medicare.

The Secretary of the Treasury has been [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/) to defer the collection of Social Security taxes on those making a gross income of less than $104,000 / year ($4,000 or less per bi-weekly paycheck) starting September 1.

Implementing seems to be optional by employers and many employers have decided to not implement this.

The IRS had issued Notice 2020-65 indicating that taxes deferred must be withheld and paid between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021, or interest and penalties will start accruing on May 1, 2021. **The window to payback the deferred taxes has been extended under the new stimulus bill to December 31, 2021. Deferred taxes must be paid by January 1, 2022 or interest and penalties will start accruing.** 

See the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for FAQs regarding the payroll tax deferral 

# Coronavirus-Related Distributions from Retirement Plans

Penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts for Coronavirus-Related Distributions ended December 30, 2020. If you made one of these withdrawals during 2020, remember that you have three years to pay the income taxes on the withdrawal. The IRS has an article with [Coronavirus-related relief for retirement plans and IRAs questions and answers](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/coronavirus-related-relief-for-retirement-plans-and-iras-questions-and-answers) with more information.

# Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Rollover

FSA account balances typically do not rollover year-to-year. The second stimulus package allows for FSA balances at the end of 2020 to be rolled over and used in 2021. Any FSA balance remaining at the end of 2021 may also be rolled over and used in 2022.

# Unemployment Benefits

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) provides benefits to individuals typically not eligible for unemployment insurance, such as independent contractors or gig workers. Under the CARES Act these benefits were set to expire Dec 31, 2020. It has now been extended to March 14, 2021. Please visit your state’s PUA website for more information.

The previous unemployment relief of $300/week from the federal government and $100/week from the state expires Dec 26, 2020 (see the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for more information and FAQs regarding [this executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/) from August). **Under this new bill, federal unemployment will provide an additional $300/week through March 14, 2021, and the maximum number of weeks that unemployment can be claimed has been increased from 39 weeks to 50 weeks.**

**If you lost your job or are at risk of losing your job:**

Please read the information available in the [Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)

# Student Loan Interest and Payment Waiver (updated Feb 13, 2021)

The CARES Act suspended federally-held student loan payments and interest charges until September 30, 2020. The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/) signed in August extended this to December 31, 2020. The December bill extended this date to January 31, 2021. At the [end of January](https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/f), the deferment was extended until Sept 30, 2021. 

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&amp;t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&amp;t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&amp;P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Most mortgage owners eligible for reduced or suspended payments for up to 12 months under the CARES Act 

Key points:

1. The CARES Act covers about [70% of all mortgages](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=406472) in the U.S. (those backed by Fannie and Freddie, FHA, VA, or USDA). Many companies have similar policies for most other types of loans. If you aren't sure what kind of loan you have, ask your servicer.

2. In most cases, you will [not owe the missed payments as lump sum](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/after-you-receive-relief/#repay). There was a lot of confusion about this. The new guidance says that lump sums are not required for [GSE](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Announces-Payment-Deferral-as-New-Repayment-Option-for-Homeowners-in-COVID-19-Forbearance-Plans.aspx) and [federal loans](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/IACOVID19FBFactSheetConsumer.pdf).

3. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

4. Requesting mortgage relief/deferral will appear on your credit reports and may affect your eligibility for refinancing (but doesn't affect your actual credit score).

5. For more info, the CFPB published [step-by-step information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/housing) about how to request payment relief.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs. 

Effective Dec 1, 2020, refinancing mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will incur a 0.5% [adverse mortgage fee](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/refinancing-a-mortgage-will-cost-more-thanks-to-an-adverse-market-fee.html). 

# Relief for Renters (updated Feb 13, 2021)

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) signed in August required certain federal agencies to take steps to limit foreclosures or evictions. It did not include a list of specific actions or policies. 

Following this in September, the CDC ordered [Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/04/2020-19654/temporary-halt-in-residential-evictions-to-prevent-the-further-spread-of-covid-19) that expires December 31, 2020. This has since been extended to March 31, 2021.

Read [Protection for Renters](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/) from the CFPB and visit the [NLIHC page for COVID-19 Rental Assistance programs](https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance) for additional information and resources

personalfinance,Where Should I Keep My Money?,"So I’m 25m and live in a HCOL area (SoCal). I currently make about $105k. I have about $100k saved up and it’s diversified between high yield savings account and investment accounts. I am planning on buying a house sometime in the near future (1-2 years) and was wondering how I should be diversifying my money. I currently have about $40k in high yield savings account that I plan on using for down payment and the rest is in investment accounts. I have been keeping the $40k in savings because I used to earn a decent amount of interest (3% or so) and wanted to protect it from losing value in case the market takes a dump. But now that interest rates are low (0.5%) i have been thinking about putting that money else where to protect against inflation and to possibly have it produce some passive income.

Any suggestions on how to allocate the money?

Here’s one plan I have been thinking about....
Leave about $10k in savings in case of emergency and put the rest into a few different stocks/funds/REITs that pay high dividends (7%-10%). If all goes well I’ll get a decent return on my money instead of it just sitting and depreciating and I can pull it out when I need it. Of course I would have to pay capital gains tax whenever I take it out to use for down payment but I think it still might be worth it. On the other hand, there’s the chance that the market takes a dump and I lose a bit of money if I end up needing the cash. Is this a good idea? Too risky? I am generally a person who likes to take moderate risk

personalfinance,Better to put extra money toward student loans or a house down payment?,"tl;dr:  How heavily does student debt factor in when a bank determines the interest rate or max amount of a home loan?  Is it worthwhile to reduce student debt if it means having a smaller down payment or delaying the home purchase by a year or so?

My husband and I (both early/mid-30's) are planning on buying our first house in about 3 years.  He's graduating this spring with $100k in student loan debt, and going straight into a 3-year grad program that will pay around $50-60k per year.  The grad program will not add to his debt.  After that he should hopefully be able to find a job making 6 figures.  I make $80k per year.  We both have clean credit histories.  Not counting our emergency fund and retirement accounts, we have about $100k saved up that could be put toward the student loans and/or a future house.

So our goal is to buy a house once he's done with his grad program and has a permanent job.  A lot of big details are obviously still up in the air pending his future employment, but I'd like to do whatever we can now to be in a good financial position when that time comes.  

My current thinking is that we should throw a big chunk of money (say, $25k) at his student loans this spring.  (Rationale:  If we just make the minimum payment on the full $100k balance, it'll basically just cover interest.  But if we reduce the principal right off the bat then with the same monthly payments we could actually make progress on the loans.)  Then we spend the next few years of his graduate program saving aggressively for a house. 

He is more inclined though to keep our full $100k savings invested for now AND save aggressively, so that we'll for sure have a healthy down payment + fund for closing costs, immediate house repairs, etc to be able to purchase as soon as he gets a permanent job.  Then with his expected higher salary we would focus more on paying down the loans.  He's ok with treading water on the loans until then.

Are there any good rules of thumb for prioritizing low student debt vs a high down payment?  Or is it better still to take an extra year and have both in place before buying?  

To what extent would the amount of student debt factor into the bank's decision to lend - will there likely be a difference in interest rates or availability of home loans if we have $100k in debt vs $50k vs $0?",finance
computers,My audio keeps fading in and out,"Hey guys, so starting today I started experiencing my audio fading in and out. It will get really loud, then really quiet. I went into and uninstalled audio drivers, then reinstalled them, I disabled all Dolby stuff, and tried different headphones and ports.

I still had the problem after that, a friend of mine has a laptop that has been recently experiencing the same issue and it started popping up for him yesterday.

investing,2021/2022 Scenario: Effects of a Bursting Chinese Real Estate Bubble?,"OVERVIEW:

I want to be optimistic about investing in some Chinese stocks but I'm concerned about a few things. For years now China's real estate sector has been running too hot, people much smarter than me say it would've corrected itself years ago but because of the unique land control system regulated by the Chinese government it's been allowed to keep going.

From my understanding most Chinese people invest in ""land"" for equity, it's ingrained in their culture due to recent history. Unfortunately, this habit has led to overproduction leading to unnecessary ""ghost cities"" and shoddy building standards . From my own research I found that homes in China aren't really built to last long-term as it is in Western countries and there's tons of stories of houses falling apart just years after being built.

From what I've read the Chinese government is aware and seriously concerned about this to the point that they've started increasing financial regulations this past week (Jan., 2021) after easing restrictions this past year to fuel the recovery from the pandemic lock-downs. They won't raise interest rates though, their hands are a bit tied. It appears that many people had been using the increased liquidity to buy and re-sell condominiums in Shenzhen and other urban cities leading to even crazier housing prices that were already inflated to begin with. 

Housing prices have become so high that many younger people won't buy houses but instead have switched to renting. This has become significant enough that tech giants like Tencent, JD.com and Alibaba have started investing more in the rental sector. There's even a Chinese version of AirBnB now called Ziroom backed by Tencent, Warburg Pincus, Sequoia Capital, and Sunac.

While I wouldn't rule out the Chinese government in finding a clever way to continue to mitigate other economic shocks eventually it seems there's to be a reckoning from the years of explosive growth at all costs. Since Western countries and economies have had centuries to grow more sustainable systems this appears to be a unique ""China"" problem.

&amp;#x200B;

CONCLUSION:

Imagining a worst case scenario where this problem gets away from Chinese regulators and creates a recession, how would this affect the global economy and stocks?

Are we looking at just local domestic stagnation from monetary restrictions? 

Would this affect global supply-chains and manufacturing at all?",finance

personalfinance,Feedback on my personal finance strategy?,"I'm switching jobs in about a month, so I spent some time updating my personal finance strategy for the next 5 or so years. I've gone through the fantastic wikis and spent hours reading this subreddit and other resources. 

I'd like to get some feedback on my strategy -- at least just a sanity check that I'm not making any bad assumptions. If nothing else, writing this all out helps me check my own thinking.

My current situation:

1. Age 27, zero debt, $42k annual expenses (conservative estimate based on past couple years). Partner currently in graduate school and on track to have a six-figure income in mid 2022.
2. $68.8k in traditional 401k. 33% VFIAX, 28% VWILX, 24% VEXAX, 15% APHYX, total 0.27% expense ratio. Used Blooom.com to allocate these investments w/ \~60% overall return over \~2.5 years (i.e. contributed \~$43k).
3. $20k in Roth IRA, 100% Vanguard 2065 target fund.
4. $65k cash savings at 0.66% APY.

Upcoming changes to my situation:

1. New job: $175k in California, $600k RSUs vesting over four years with a 1-year cliff. 
2. Not anticipating a significant increase in cost of living. 
3. Would like to purchase a home in the next 4 to 5 years. I think $250k is a safe expectation for a 20% down payment.

Here's my current 5-year plan, in terms of annual figures:

1. Gross income $175k
2. $3.5k to HSA (employer $750 contribution), invested more conservatively than 401k
3. $19.5k to 401k (no employer match)
4. $103k take home pay (according to [this calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/california-tax-calculator))
5. $6k to Roth IRA via ""backdoor"" method
6. $42k expenses
7. $5k charity
8. $50k saving for home

In terms of specific changes:

1. Roll my current 401k into new employer's 401k
2. Re-balance the Roth IRA to roughly match the 401k. The Vanguard 2065 seems a bit conservative.

Here are some specific assumptions I made, which are definitely up for scrutiny: 

1. For simplicity, pretend the RSUs don't exist. Revisit them in a year.
2. I'm not eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA, but backdoor Roth IRA is possible. Rolling the existing 401k into the new employer 401k simplifies the backdoor Roth IRA (due to pro-rata rule).
3. I could allocate more into retirement accounts and go the FIRE route, but ultimately decided against this, because: 
   1. I enjoy my work. If I retire early, I'll just continue doing the same stuff for fun.
   2. I'd like to buy a home in my early 30s. I'm likely to end up in a big city, so I need to contribute a significant amount towards that near-term goal.
   3. The [SmartAsset 401k calculator](https://smartasset.com/retirement/401k-calculator#i4rEuvjroH) tells me that maxing my 401k through age 60 at 7% return with 3% inflation should comfortably provide $80k annual income in today's dollars. $80k is a guess that seems reasonable assuming my mortgage is paid and any potential dependents are mostly independent. On top of this I'm maxing out the equivalent a Roth IRA and HSA.
4. The best return-to-effort ratio for my home savings is a high-yield savings account. I looked into conservative ETFs, dividend ETFs, various bonds, etc. Ultimately it seems like a better use of time to beat inflation by spending time on my skills and getting a raise, rather than trying to eek out an extra percent with some complicated fixed-income asset. If interest rates go back up to late 2019 levels, I'll consider I-Bonds or a CD.
5. Continue using a traditional 401k rather than a Roth 401k. Maxing out a Roth 401k means \~$6k less take-home pay now and ends up roughly the same as a traditional 401k with the \~$6k tax savings invested in a Roth IRA, at least according [to this calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/calculators/401-k-or-roth-ira-calculator/).",finance

personalfinance,Worth it to Pay Down Mortgage to Save for a Down Payment?,"Hello All,

My wife and I currently own a Townhouse with a 3.085% interest rate and about 28 years left on the loan. We have a 6 month emergency fund, contribute 15% of our income to a Roth 401k/Roth IRA (does not include company match), and save the rest in a HYSA (0.5% interest rate, with about 10% of our target down payment). We are slowly outgrowing our townhouse and are hoping we can move to a larger place in 2-3 years.

I had an idea of paying down the mortgage on the house to help save for the next down payment. We will yield a significantly larger return (3.085% vs 0.5%); however, that also means our money will be locked into our loan and not liquid. I have read numerous times on this subreddit that this isn't advisable as it can be difficult to get an offer accepted on a home if you have a contingency to sell your own home.

Would it be advisable to pay down our mortgage to get the better return on the condition that we sell our home first, temporarily move in with family until we can purchase a new home, and use the cash from the sale as our down payment?

Thank you for your help!

Edit: Just to be clear. We would stay in the townhouse for the next 2-3 years until we feel we're close in value or over our target down payment, sell the home, temporarily live with family, then start looking for a new home. So the offer to purchase the next home will all be liquid.

Edit 2 for extra clarification: We will probably sell our home first and then move in with family prior to contacting a realtor to purchase the next home. I just want to know if it's better to put our future savings in a HYSA or in the principal of our mortgage.",finance
personalfinance,Trying to pick a bank,"I'm trying to establish myself better financially and have determined it would be wise to create a second bank account for myself to help me better save money for large purchases as well as make it easier for me to spend less on frivolous expenses. Also my current accounts are set up at a credit union in a state I won't be moving back into on a permanent basis, so I figure might as well start to fully set myself up away from there.

**Some info about me:**

I'm in my early 20's, in undergraduate college in the Atlanta area, but I'm originally from Idaho. I don't really know where I'll be living long-term yet because that's dependent on things (grad school, relationships, jobs, etc) that I just don't know yet.  I currently have a checking/saving/credit card with a credit union in Idaho, which I find to be a bit annoying to deal with at times and I won't be moving back to Idaho on a long-term basis ever, hopefully. 

**Things I'm looking for:**

* Bank/credit union that has really good online services through an app/website, since I'm pretty mobile lately and don't have a super permanent location for the foreseeable future. 
* Has physical locations in major American cities or is mostly online and easy to use online.
* Good security for data and personal info
* A saving feature to allocate money towards saving goals for a car, vacations, etc. I have pretty bad ADHD, so the less involved and intricate this process is for me, the better for me.
* Options for car loans, I'll be considering buying a car after undergrad if it is worth it
* Don't care much about interest rates, I don't have enough money for a high interest rate to really make a big difference.
* Access to Zelle
* Quickly shift money between different banks if possible.
* Can use debit card internationally.

Any of y'all got good recommendations for that?

personalfinance,Refinance fixed 30 year @ 4.2% to a fixed 15 @ 2.6% or a fixed 30 @ 3.0% with cash out for renovations?,"Good Day all,

the title is pretty much my question.  I am currently 3 years deep on a fixed 30 year home loan at 4.2% interest rate and am tempted to refinance.  Initially, I was going to go down to a fixed 15 year at 2.5%, but now I have started thinking maybe I should just get a fixed 30 year at 3% with $10,000 USD cash out so that I can do some renovating AND still have a monthly payment lower than what I am already paying.  I know the downsides of this would be that I'd owe more than I currently do and my loan term would be extended from the remaining 27 years to 30 years.

However, the idea is very, very tempting of getting new appliances in the kitchen, redoing the flooring in the kitchen and baths, and redoing the countertops in the kitchen and baths.  Plus, these renovations would likely lead to an increased sale price in the house, thereby recouping some of the loses.

personalfinance,Should I Accept Upstart Loan To Pay Off my Credit Debt?,"Here is my debt as follows:

Card 1: $19,500 ($400/month payment)
Card 2: $4,600 ($95/month payment)
Card 3: $580 ($121/month payment)

All of the interest rates for the above debts are 12.99%

I was approved for a $10,000 loan through upstart. The most ideal setup being 5 years at 13.47% with a $219/month payment. (I can also toggle with the amount slightly like for example I can do $6,000 for 5 years at 13.66% with a $132/month payment)

If I do this I can pay off cards 2 and 3 and knock about $4,000 off of card 1 which would reduce the monthly payment slightly and the interest amount being added to it every month. 

Is this a good option? My other option is to basically keep making my payments as they are and once card 3 is paid down to start applying the payment from that on top of card 2’s payment and over pay on it. I’ve managed to really fix up a lot of my credit and reduce my debt over the last few years so I want to make sure I stay on a good path.

Right now I'm planning on just moving the pre-tax and employer contributions to the Traditional IRA and my Roth contributions to my Roth IRA. When I go to do this for the Roth the Paychex website asks me if I want to withhold federal tax before doing so, and if I select yes it asks what %. I have NO idea on this, right now I'm unemployed and in my last semester of grad school and my bank account is basically limping along trying to survive until I get an engineering job. I know Roth is taxed now so you're not taxed later upon withdrawal, is that what this is? I have no idea when I set this up if I opted for federal tax withholding at the company level or if this rollover event is where I do that? And no idea what % I should choose to begin with. I suppose I could just select like 10% and wait and see if that was right when I file my 2021 taxes in 2022? And since my projected income this year is looking to be abysmal, should I go ahead and convert all of my traditional stuff to Roth while I'm here?

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is not an investment, things to know and rules to follow for newbies to survive with Bitcoin","There is a lot of new people entering Bitcoin. If you are new here you don't understand what Bitcoin is. The most important part is to understand what bitcoin is, and what gives its value. Here is a bullet list of things to grasp. 

***I'm not writing this for an argumentation or your opinion, i'm doing this to help you understand better and AVOID BIG MISTAKES, if you get ""offended"" take it elsewhere.  I have seen many making the same mistakes over the years. Real bitcoiners/hodlers are really hard on certain points like shitcoins. This is not to be mean or trash the ""idea"" behind the coin, but to warn you that you will likely lose all the money.***  

**This is what you need to do and understand to survive well**

**Bitcoin**

1. Bitcoin is not an investment. You cannot think of it as gold or a stock. Instead think about it as an adoption curve for a new technology, like the radio or TV. But this is the adoption of a new currency or more accurate a store of value. Nothing we have ever seen before. Hence it is not an investment it is something you use to save wealth. See the price as the adoption curve. Maybe hyperinflation kicks in and all your fiats are worth nothing. Btc is the only fixed thing we got. Hence, its the standard to compare against. Therefore its not an investment. If you say it is you do not understand my point. 
2. You are still early.
3. Bitcoin will be ""stable"" when adoption happends. The volatility is not an issue. Your time preference is. See 25.
4. Do not sell bitcoin to ""take profit"". Do not have weak hands. Enter bitcoin with the mindset that this is your savings. You sell when you need to buy something in fiats.
5. **HODL**
6. Do not FOMO. Bitcoin will keep going up, within a year it  might be above 300k USD. In 10 years it might be 10 million. But it will not be zero. If bitcoin goes to zero we have much more primal issues to deal with.
7. Therefore with this knowledge DCA, buy bitcoin every month, spare some to buy during dips. 
8. In doubt zoom out on the chart
9. You need to watch Bitcoin in logscale on charts.
10. Everyone buys in at bitcoin in the price they deserve, it's human nature. 
11. You can try help other get into bitcoin but you will mostly fail.
12. Don't tell everyone that you own bitcoin.
13. Use tor, VPN etc when using btc.
14. Don't fall for the phishing attempts. No one legit will ask you to enter the seed or pins.
15. Bullrun did just start
16. In a bullrun bitcoin does a bunch of 30-40% dips, it can last a few hours to weeks.
17. When bitcoin goes up it goes up fast.
18. If we do not enter hyperbitcoinization were mass adoption happends, we will probably hit around 300k USD +- 100k in this bull run. This is simply because of the inbuilt properties of bitcoin. Then we might have another 80% pull back. But this time more big players are in, that doesn't have weak hands. Hence do not count on a 80% pull back.  
19. DO NOT TRADE BITCOIN, you will lose money
20. DO NOT BUY OR TRADE SHITCOINS, you will lose money
21. EVERYTHING ELSE than BITCOIN is a shitcoin.
22. Bitcoin have no real competitor.
23. Governments wont ban bitcoin
24. One very important part of bitcoin is that its founder(s) is unknown and it needs to remain that way. Otherwise decentralization will not really work.
25. Only invest what you are **NOT** willing to lose. +30% of all USD was created in the last 10 months. Inflation is high  and it will be higher. Somewhere the prices need to adjust the new money base. Even gold lost +90% of its value the last 100 year.
26. Always store Bitcoin in cold wallets. You control the keys. 
27. Never enter the seed phase into a computer. 
28. Assume your computer is compromised.
29. When sending, double check all the data. 
30. When sending a lot, first send a little amount to check it works.
31. The entire blockchain is broadcasted with satellites. 
32. Order btc wallets etc to another adress than you live at If you can.
33. Bitcoin have no upside because fiats have no bottom limit. 
34. Best time to buy bitcoin is now. 

 **Bigger picture** 

1. Most of what you learned in school is not accurate. They taught you that deflation is bad, that when something gets cheaper people will stop buy it. What a lie! No one here have experienced real capitalism. Issues blamed on capitalism is often originated from governments. Capitalism needs a free market of capital to work, which we haven't had for over 100 years.
2. People talk about bitcoin scaling issues, increase block size etc. Thinking 5 min transaction is taking to long. They fail to understand that you should not compare it to VISA. But with golds properties.  You can move 100M USD in Bitcoin for 5 USD and it takes 10 min, this is madness. In any other goods it takes 2-20% to move capital and a long time. Moving 100M USD in gold. That will probably cost +100K USD and take 30 days. Selling a house? Taxes, the house could be for sale for years.
3. Hardest money always win in a free market.
4. Bitcoin was created to separate the state and money. And to create the money with most scarcity. Making it the hardest money. This is a profound idea never used in the modern world.
5. To really understand bitcoin you need knowledge about Austrian economics, psychology and history. 
6. Hard money like Bitcoin affects its surroundings, it set the tone for society. It creates a low time preference world, **which in history have more peace, inventions and development for humans. Because everything have to be paid its real price and therefore must be PRODUCTIVE.** War is pricey. If you are out of money you cannot keep the war going, but today they print money (aka taking your money) to keep it going. Or say social programs: Everything the government does is ineffective by nature. Running a deficit because of a non productive health care system is done today, many countries does it.  But it doesn't work under a hard money system with real capitalism, because **it has to be effective and produce real value to humans.**  Running a deficit with hard money and no monetary policies means increased taxation. If the government taxed you the real cost for their spendings you would not have much left. That is why we have fiats that the central bank can expand, so the real cost doesn show as easily. The median salary haven't moved for 20 years but the median home have doubled in price, health care and education have gone up 200%. Thats where they took your money. The first covid subsidy you got in america, they took 18600 USD from you and gave you 1200 USD back. Since ww1 (mostly 1971) we have lived in a high time preference world that works like this. Understand inflation and the effect of low and high time preference has in society is important Bitcoin changes this aspect to low time preference.
7. Inflation is not price increase, it is expansion of the money supply. Price increase is a symptom of the disease.  
8. CPI is not accurate measure for inflation. Asset and monetary inflation is better.
9. Government creates monopolies, not free markets.
10. Deflation is good. Things get cheaper and better.
11. Learn about the Cantillion effect.
12. [https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)
13. You have not experienced bitcoin until you have went through an entire bull and bear market. 
14. Go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole
15. Modern Monetary Theory, keynesianism, monetarism is all wrong, they all come to different conclusions but all ends with monoplies, deficit, no free capital market and Inflation.
16. Do not touch shitcoins.

personalfinance,Gut check on buying a home?,"M29, single, looking to buy as soon as this summer. Am I ready?

I'm in a HCOL city where a decent 1bd condo in an appreciating neighborhood goes for around $425k-$475k. Based on affordability calculators, that's right in my sweet spot. I *could* get more house on the dollar in the burbs, but, as a single young(ish) adult, staying near the urban core is still advantageous for me from a dating and social life perspective. I don't need much more than a 1bd condo anyway.

My plan *had* been to save until I had a 20% DP to avoid PMI. But given low interest rates and rapid appreciation in this market, I'm considering buying once I can do 10%, which would get me into the market a year (or more) sooner. I think my PMI would be reasonable given my strong credit score, and that I'd be able to drop it fairly quickly thanks to expected appreciation. Plus, with interest rates so low the math may favor making a lower DP in order to invest the difference into the market, even with the PMI accounted for.

How do I look? What am I not accounting for?

* Salary: $117k base salary, eligible for 15% annual bonus.
* Debts: $0. Had student loans and a car note, but all are paid off

* Retirement: $65k between a 401k and Roth IRA. I put in 10% and employer matches 4%. I have zero desire to touch the principal or adjust my savings rate to make buying a home work.
* HSA: \~$3,550 after fully funding for one year. Intend to fully fund this year too.

Based on all the above, June would be when: my DP hits 10% *and* my EF hits 6mo take home pay.

solar,Installer recommendations for Mid-Atlantic/Metri Phila area,"I'm a DYI guy, and have contemplated my own install for awhile. We're replacing the shingle roof this spring, so now is a perfect time.

Here is my beef with solar installers, especially the large/national ones. It drives me nuts that 6.5KW (20x panel) system is $9800 total parts and materials, say another $5000 for labor, but that system quoted from an installer ends up being $35k-$45k. 

I dont need financing, I dont want some no-cost install where I agree to buy thr power back at a set rate for 20 years. I just want to pay a fair price for an install, and not have the prices jacked up so the installer can pocket the federal rebate.

Any good sources for installers in the Metro Phila area? So far everyone I've called is a racket...",energy

personalfinance,Advice on financing a car for the first time - details inside,"Good afternoon! I'm likely about to buy my second car ever, but it will be my first time financing a car (I bought my first in cash) and really my first time taking out any loans (besides student loans). 

The car I'm looking at is a 2012 Subaru Impreza Sport Limited listed at a local dealership for just under 11k with 106k miles. I've been researching and testing cars since the summer, and I'm pretty sure this is what I want. It checks all my important boxes and is right in the price range I was looking to spend. I'm confident in my ability to acquire this car (and that it's a good idea in general) but I want to make sure I do it right, so my questions are more about optimal financing. Below are all the relevant elements of my situation (as far as I know)

* Current credit score is 793. 

* Current savings: about 9k total. don't want to use all of it, but would put a decent chunk down to save on interest. I'd like to have a car payment to further strengthen my credit score (but want to keep it manageable/on the faster repayment end)

* Current car - 2003 Passat GLX which I own completely. 111k miles, no major mechanical, some minor cosmetic. Bought for ~5k in 2016. Could trade it in to dealer for convenience (would hope for at least ~1k) or hold on to it and sell it privately (2-3k?) not really in a rush, I'd take the insurance off it and leave it parked. 

* Current payments: student loans, which I have been paying aggressively and am almost done with. currently frozen too. no other debts. living expenses are relatively trim and can be further minimized. 

* Looking down the road: currently wrapping up a higher ed job (in the summer) that includes free housing. This fall will either be in grad making small but livable stipend, or working in the area saving for/planning a business. either way should have more than enough to comfortably live on, but want to keep some savings

Finally, I have a few questions about the dealer experience since it's new to me - reading about it now, but can I talk them down on price? are there any tricks I should look out for in regards to price or financing? What is a good interest rate/term?


Any and all advice is appreciated. This sub has been wonderful for me over the years, and I appreciate your time! Let me know if there is a sticky/wiki/more specific sub that would be helpful.",finance

I'm in my first year of medical school, of course operating primarily off of loans, and I just received an unexpected cash gift from a family member of $10,000. The check has already cleared so no worries there. I'm wondering how to best use this money. 

I currently have a Roth IRA with about $1500 that I started in 2019 and contributed some to in 2020. I have 6 months of emergency savings in a HYSA (~$7000). My loans are currently at about $15,000 at around 4% interest rate (this will go up of course, and I won't have to pay on it until after school is done if all goes well).

I don't want to buy a house or anything at the moment, as I'm not sure where I'll be in 5 years geographically. I have a car with reasonable upkeep costs that is fully paid off. 

Should I go ahead and max out my Roth IRA for this year? If so, what about the rest? I'll probably keep *some* of the money to spend, a few hundred or so, but I want to be smart with the majority of it.

Trying to decide whether to do a cash-out refi on an investment property to pay off some student loan debt.

With the interest rate reduction I'll still save a few bucks a month on the mortgage, and eliminate the student loan payment altogether. I'd also get a tax deduction on the additional mortgage interest that I'm not getting on my student loans because of the income limits.

Bitcoin,Need advice about getting into bitcoin,"I saw recently on PayPal that there was an option to buy bitcoin. Since PayPal had given me some free cash, I bought a fraction of bitcoin. Then overnight, it's value increased by 10%. This spurred me into researching the currency, and I have become very interested. However, no one around me knows anything about it and so before I get into this, I thought it would be wise to ask the internet.

My goal is to store money away that I don't need now at a relatively high interest rate. Given my financial situation, I might desperately need this money in a couple years, but I'm willing to take the risk and put some aside for now. I don't plan on actually using bitcoin as a currency in the near future.

Firstly, I've heard that it is better to directly buy and store bitcoin yourself than to use third-parties such as PayPal. For my purposes, does this actually matter? And if so, what wallet should I get and where should I buy bitcoin from?

Secondly, what is the best way to monitor bitcoin prices? Is there some sort of way to get a notification when the price goes above or below a certain threshold? Or is there some way to auto-sell/buy based on the prices?

Trading,Blue Sweep effect on markets?,"Trying to discuss this in a way that's neutral to personal political beliefs, but I think it's quite likely to see a blue sweep according to current polls/ forecasts. I think a few things have been priced in (to an extent) since Election Day.

1. Much greater fiscal stimulus. I think it's clear the need for fiscal stimulus given the pandemic. However, with a blue sweep, we can expect greater stimulus and more weight to individual support rather than for businesses. 
2. Tax reform: we can expect trump admin tax cuts to be repealed. I think the most important aspect of Biden's tax policy is the corporate rate increasing. However, it could be reasonable to expect tax implications that disincentive exporting jobs and infrastructure oversees. 
3. Fed Chair placement: though Powell is reasonably liked by both parties, a blue sweep increases the likelihood that democrats support to replacing him with someone from their own party. This greatly affects the level of QE and interest rates that we will observe.

I think at least the Biden victory was heavily priced into most markets, and the street is relatively optimistic. However, I think there's a decent chance we will experience some period of negative interest rates (decreasing fixed income opportunities), falling US Dollar and inflation concerns (which would inflate most asset classes but still don't know the long term effect of this much QE/ stim). 

Overall, I'm pretty optimistic about this new administration, but curious to hear other traders' thoughts.",finance

personalfinance,Traditional IRA vs Roth IRA for my case?,"&amp;#x200B;

Assume my couple's current marginal tax rate is 24%. So investing 12k into traditional IRA, instead of ROTH IRA, can save $12K \* 24% = $2,880 tax right now.

&amp;#x200B;

After 30 years, when we both retire, and we move to state without state income tax, like FL, TX. 

Assume we live fully on social security and IRA distribution. We get 40k distribution from traditional IRA each year. So I have to pay only fed tax, (40k - standard deduction) \* 10% for example, approx. $1,500 each year.  If we take home mortgage interest into consideration, more tax can be potentially saved.

So for my case, traditional IRA is much better than ROTH IRA.

* 70,000+ in Bank A @ ~.0% (Recent passing doubled this account balance)

* 100,000+ in Bank B @ .5% (Kept dropping due to the current circumstances)

* 5,000+ in Credit Union C @ ~.0% (Additional account for any issues with the other two)

* 200,000+ in Fidelity between two accounts (Roth/SEP) in a variety of stocks and funds getting ~20% return

Considering the current interest rates are so low, I recently looked into Rocket Mortgage after doing some research on this subreddit for their refinancing experiences and after some discussion with them, I was offered another 30 year conventional term loan @ 2.75% with closing costs rolled in and paying ~50,000 at close to get my monthly payment under 1000 per month since my cash reserves aren't doing anything for me at the moment.

My question is this actually worth it? With a substantially lower monthly payment, I can quickly rebuild those savings back up after paying the additional closing costs and maintain a sizeable rainy day fund and ensure I have 6+ months of my bills in cash on hand for any emergency. Or should that excess amount just be paid towards the principle to pay it off sooner? Or should I just pay off the loan completely now leaving no monthly payment and be left to rebuild my savings?

Any advice would be welcomed, including any other suggestions on how to best utilize my excess cash, and I can answer any other questions to further clarify my situation, if needed.",finance

As a result I've been living at home and saving a lot, only need another $10,000. 

My FICO Score in general is about 730, but when I was mortgage shopping I was told my Mortgage FICO Score actually about 780-790, so I was usually getting pretty good interest rates in my mortgage pre approvals. I had 3 credit cards open (Best Buy, Citizens, and PayPal) and a car loan. I just recently got approved for the Citi Double Cash. In total, I have about $20,900 in available credit, and usually utilize less than 3% at once. 

I figured I'd try for one final card, the Blue Cash Preferred Card, because I like the 6% back on groceries, the $300 bonus, as well as having 5 total card and probably an extra $3-5000 in more available credit if I get approved. When I applied for the Citi Double Cash card, my score went down 6 points as expected.

Basically, I want to know whether it would be worth it to get the BCP card, since I won't be mortgage shopping until at least June or July. I figure by then whatever credit ding I have from the final card will have grown back, plus I had a really high mortgage FICO score. But I guess I'm wondering if the total age of all available accounts would be significantly lower by getting a new card. The average age of my accounts is now like 5 years.

personalfinance,Refinancing a home loan with 0 closing costs?,"Hi everyone,

So I did do some due diligence in reading on this situation where there is no ""free closing cost"" refinance since the lender will end up lumping it into your actual loan (i.e 200k loan + 2k closing cost becomes a 202k loan). However after discussing with my lender and a loan officer, I was given a refinance offer where the loan closing fees were paid for via a ""lender credit"" on the Loan estimate letter. So in essence, all that I was responsible for in terms of refinancing would be prepayments of property tax and property insurance.

This, however, seems too good to be good. Has anyone else been in a similar situation or have any  advice or insight?

Edit: Also I did forget the caveat about interest rates possibly going up but in my case, my interest rate will go from 3.125% to 2.25% after the refinance",finance

I am starting to consider purchasing my first home but wanted to get some input on whether I'm jumping the gun. I've read a lot of buying vs. renting articles and done some of the calculators and it seems like everything is pointing to buying but I want to make sure its not just confirmation bias!

Background:

* 24yo in Seattle, WA making currently making 85K base with additional 20K in annual bonus/stock comp. Stable industry with promotions almost certain every 3-4 years
* Currently paying 2.7K/mo for rent in a luxury apartment but still maxing out my 401K (pls don't scold me, I know I'm paying way more for rent than I should be but I WFH and am home almost 24/7 so having a ""nice"" place is important to me. I keep my other spending under control. Unfortunately, I expect my rent to increase at least 300/mo when my lease is up in the fall)
* Nominal (\~2k) federal student debt - planning to pay off as soon as COVID forbearance ends, no other debt (I put all my spending on credit cards but pay off the balance each month in full)
* Assets: 45K cash, 110K stocks, 50K Roth IRA, 5K 401K (changed jobs in 2020, rolled over previous 401K to Roth IRA)

I am ideally looking for a home around 550K-600K and am planning to live there for at least 5 years (which is the breakeven on most of the rent vs. buy calculators I've done). This home is going to be more of a starter home for myself. I would like to start a family in my 30s and would probably like to buy a more family friendly home at that point but would likely keep this home as a rental property - potentially renting to my parents who are planning to move to Seattle after retiring in \~5 years.

My current plan for a downpayment/closing costs would be the 45K cash and as much of the 110K stocks as is needed. I won't be touching my IRA and will continue to max out my 401K. There is a chance my parents would kick in some money for the downpayment but I don't want to depend on them for any assistance.

Am I delusional or does this sound like a reasonable plan?

Edit: thank you everyone for your input. I see now that 600K is completely unreasonable despite those hone affordability calculators lol. I think if I can find a perfect townhome for ~500K that would be a better long term choice for myself but I am open to trying to find a condo in the 300-350K range depending on what the HOA fees look like.",finance

personalfinance,$32k in liquid assets &amp; upcoming engagement?,"Hello everyone,

Im curious as to what I should do in my current financial situation. I’ll give details below: 

- 26 y/o male living in midsize city 
- Dating and plan to marry within one year 
- $60k/year pre-tax income ($36k after taxes/health insurance/401k contributions)
- 760ish credit score
- $28k in an Ally high yield savings account (currently about 1% interest)
- $4k in Robinhood stock account
- $13.7k in Vangurd Roth 401k
- Currently putting 12% of my salary in said Vanguard account with additional employer profit sharing at year end

Debt/expenses
- $4.8k car note (1.75% APR) with 9 months remaining ~$541/month
- $650 in rent/utilities
- 2 credit cards paid off in full each month (I put all misc expenses here to gain points and rewards)

Future plans to note:
- Future spouse is debt free and owns the house we will share without a mortgage. She’s a teacher and makes $37k pre tax
- I want to buy an engagement ring in the $15k range (it may be high compared to my current net worth but I see it as a lifetime purchase that I can splurge a little on)

My main question is: what can I do with my cash to get the best return? Should I just keep it in my savings account since I’m about to purchase an engagement ring? Put more into Robinhood and ride the market?

Since interest rates are so low, should I get a loan on the engagement ring and put my cash somewhere else? Especially since my car loan is almost paid off and the only credit activity I’ll have after that are my credit card payments each month?

Should I keep my Roth 401k contributions at 12%? Is that too high? Should I reduce and put some of that in an IRA?

TIA for any help. Wishing each of you blessings and prosperity in 2021!",finance

I noticed that the current interest rate on unsubsidized loans are actually lower than the rate for the unsubsidized loans I took out for undergrad (5% and 6.8% respectively). 

The school offered me more money in loans than I actually needed to pay for tuition due to not needing assistance for housing/other living costs. My question is, does it make financial sense to take out more loans than I actually need and pay off the ones I took for undergrad that is a higher interest rate, or am I missing something here? I have excellent credit, so would I just be better off consolidating my undergrad loans through a separate private borrower rather than going through this?

personalfinance,Buy a Place Now or Continue to Rent,"I can’t make up my mind whether to buy or continue to rent and would appreciate any inputs. I live in So Cal. I have a wife and 2 kids in grade school. We live in an area where the school systems are basically 10/10. We want to stay in this school district for the next 10+ years if we can until they reach college. I make about $145K/year. My wife is only a part time contractor so I don’t want to factor in her income as it fluctuates. We’re currently renting a 2BR, 2BA townhome paying $2200/month. We have about $100K in cash, $100K in a brokerage account. I’m maxing out my 401K. Since the pandemic started, I’ve been able to save an extra $1000-$1500 each month. I think that’s likely due to less driving, no daycare. We have a rental property out of state that breaks even each month. As for other debts, I have a car payment that’s going to be done in about a year. We also make sure to pay off our credit cards each month.

I like the idea of living below my means and investing the savings in the stock market. However, it’d be nice to own a place so I can plant my roots down for my kids in the area we’re at now. However, current prices are about $700K for an SFR where I’m at (if that). Seeing that I have about $200K in savings, I’d like to put 20% down to avoid PMI. If I did that, with the current interest rates, it looks like PITI is about $3000, which is about $800 more than what we’re paying now. To be honest, knowing my budget and spending habits, I’d rather have a $2700 or $2800 to leave room for unforeseen expenses that come with owning a home. Also too, I get nervous thinking about having to spend basically $155K to buy a home, assuming $700K purchase price, 20% down, and $14K in closing costs(?) and basically wiping out most of our savings that we saved for so long. That’s not even including the moving expenses: new flooring, new paint, new furniture, new window treatment. So basically I’d be left with about $45K to manage both a primary and a rental. Is this even enough of a savings? 
I almost feel like I should continue to rent until I’ve accrued more savings, like $250K....Keep in mind that part of my thinking is that I owned a home before during the boom/bust period in 2007 and borrowed way more than I could chew at that time and wound up foreclosing. That brought about some hard lessons I had to learn. It also made me realize that renting vs buying isn’t so black and white.",finance

personalfinance,Received a state levy for taxes that I paid,"Last year I owed on my taxes due to some unfavorable circumstances but I used the push back in the pay date to my advantage and paid my federal and state taxes in full on June 12 2020.

Luckily I save everything and pulled up my confirmation codes and got them on the phone and cleared everything up or so I thought. Cut to oct/nov time frame. I recieve a tax lein in the mail so this time I email their support number and give them all the information codes and screenshots that I saved just in case and they send me this in return.

Good Morning,
 
The payment has been posted and the account now show a zero balance. An updated notice has been mailed.

Cut to today I look at my paystub and see they have put a state levy on my paycheck for the amount that was on the tax lein. (Slightly more than the taxes I paid)

I sent another email this morning containing all the original information in addition to the lein satisfaction letter number and plan on calling to insure that they get this cleared up.

I’m 23 and have some debt and savings and I’m at a cross roads. I am in the USA. Right now, my monthly expenses don’t count rent, so it’s really just credit cards, my car bill, and those car expenses (about $500 a month counting gas, insurance, etc). 

After taxes I make about $3,000/month. Currently I am in about $3,500 worth of credit card debt with 3 credit cards without a good interest rate. 

I have about $7,000 in savings, I was planning on using this to pay debt off slowly and then move out and pay tuition for school (basically use this savings for the next few years for education/living). 

But, I really want my debt gone and have made huge strides the last 6 months and the $3,500 in credit card debt is what I’m left with. At what point do you think someone should put off all debt with the consequence of having significantly less in savings. I do believe I can build my savings back up but I’m having issue with just dropping $3,500 due to uncertainty on the world and within the next few years of my life. 

TDLR Should I use my 7,000 in savings to put off my remaining CC debt all at once or keep making lesser payments, leaving me with more comfort of having more in my savings in case of emergency.

My current knowledge is that the interest rates and QE measures from Central Banks and FED determine the ""price of money"" (which is 0 now, right?). This in turn acts as a baseline value from where the interests of savings accounts, mortgages, government and private debt and many other loans/financial agreements start from. This would explain why saving accounts pay little or nothing in Europe in US or why mortgages are relatively cheap right now.

financialindependence,"Adapting to changing conditions- Consider Investing in dividend paying stocks as ""bubble/volatility proofing"" when FIRE","So the common idea on here is to just go into a broad stock market ETF like VTI and just withdraw a fixed amount each year. Basically, 4% is the magical safe withdrawal rate, so once you hit $1 million, you can withdraw $40,000+ inflation for life. Most of this belief is based on historical data.

We then saw a post earlier this week that showed that a 4% withdrawal rate since 2000 from the S&amp;P500 meant that your current NW would be just 23% of the starting amount. This would certainly cause anxiety especially with the market volatility https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kpodhb/charts_2020_a_good_year_for_people_who_retired_in/

Some people might argue ""you cherry picked the worst year"", but mathematically, you're most likely to hit your retirement goals when the market boomed to an all time high than after a crash.

When the tech bubble crashed, the S&amp;P500 dropped by nearly 50%. If you were invested in tech ""growth"" stocks, you would've been hit way harder. The Nasdaq fell by 77%!

When relying on selling shares to fund retirement, you're vulnerable to whatever price the market dictates. So if unjustified panic results in prices too low, you still have to sell at that price.

So if you lose 50% of share value, your 4% withdrawal rate becomes 8% of your portfolio.

In the past, bonds were the means of hedging against said volatility risks. But back in 2000 bonds were yielding 6% and were actually a great alternative. Now treasuries yield 1% which won't even beat inflation.

I would argue that in the age of low interest rates, dividends should play an important role in protection against excess valuations for retirees.

Dividends historically have been less volatile than share prices. For example while the S&amp;P 500 dropped by nearly 50% in 2000, dividend payments hardly budged https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend/table/by-year The same is true in 2009, when the stock market dropped by 60-70%, but dividends only dropped 20%.

As was seen in 2000, Some of the companies most at risk of bubble territory are companies that aren't paying dividends. Companies that don't return capital to shareholders, but are priced highly based on expectations of future growth. 

Most of the stock market price growth for this year has been from non-dividend payers like Tesla and Amazon. Tesla is currently trading at 34 times their annual revenue, and 1459 times their earnings. So much growth is priced in that the slightest slowdown in growth will decimate their price.


As a young investor trying to grow wealth to reach fire, investing in growth opportunities can be a good long term play. Even if you buy into a bubble you have time to recover if you hold. Lower prices are an opportunity to buy more for less. But as someone depending on their stock portfolio for income, a change in prices affects you dramatically.

Historically, the dividend yield on the S&amp;P500 was high enough to fund retirement on it's own. Before 1985 the yield was almost always above 3%, and often averaged above 4%.

However the dividend yield on the index as a whole has hit record lows this year, as valuations of growth companies surge, and companies look to buybacks and acquisitions rather than dividends to utilize excess capital.

With the S&amp;P500 dividend yield being at all time lows(1.5%), overall market dividends don't provide the level protection they have historically. With treasury yields at &lt;1%, they are vulnerable to inflation/interest rate hikes, have little upside, and produce little to no income.

Investing in a dividend paying index to provide a baseline level of income can help reduce the need to sell during a downturn while still providing upside.",finance

personalfinance,Options for saving for a down payment,"I (23F) am hoping to buy a house within the next five years. I live in a HCOL area and moving isn’t an option. I’d need 100k for a 20% down payment on an average 2 bed in my area. I’ve already accepted that I’ll have to take loan with PMI, but I’m looking for the best ways to save. I can save about 12-15k a year. Right now I have the money sitting in two HYSA. Account 1 has a 2k monthly deposit limit and transfers the total amount into a regular savings once a year, but has a 3-4% interest rate. Account 2 is Ally’s HYSA with a .5% interest rate. 

I know that opening a brokerage account isn’t recommended for a down payment due to volatility and time in the market. However, I know I want to open one down the line anyways. I was potentially thinking of taking half of what I can save in a year (so about 6-7k in total) and investing it into a brokerage account which I would continue to manage after the purchase. I’m looking to invest into ETFs with Vanguard. Is this a stupid idea? Are there others ways to save than a HYSA?",finance
energy,Recap and Thoughts After Installing Solar as a Homeowner (US),"Looks like r/RenewableEnergy has a no editorialized titles rule, so here I am. If anyone has a recommendation on a more apt place to post please let me know. 

I wanted to share a little about my rather frustrating experience installing solar on my home without going through a local solar installer, and [comment a bit about the state of the industry in the US](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solaredge-technologies-and-enphase-control-80-of-us-residential-solar-marke). 

As an interested layman, it's been pretty exciting watching the steady march of economic feasibility, availability, and increasing public push for renewable energy options over the last decade or so. Meanwhile, I, like many, also want to ""do my part"" by contributing in my own small way to help combat climate change. This story starts with a friend of mine who's an installer with a local solar company learning of a series of old panels being removed from a house in my area which was upgrading panels. He took the old panels and offered them to me as a jump start on my own system. 

My system is not big, and the old panels make it not especially efficient, but *dag gummit*, I am helping the environment in some small way and cutting a portion of my energy bill in the process. Win-win. But every step of the way it has been a mess of bureaucratic red tape and fighting through steps in the process clearly meant to discourage individuals from doing this on their own. The permit application for my city had required fields specific to the installing company, not to mention the ridiculous technical jargon and acronyms with no explanation as to their meaning. The application to my local energy company Xcel was also clearly designed to require a company do the work, with a required form to [prove NABCEP certification](https://www.nabcep.org/certifications/), and site plans and line drawings requiring company letterhead. Every question I had I had to fight to track down the answer for, many of them going to my installer friend who was constantly confused as to why the city or Xcel would need to know that and was forced to ask coworkers what the hell to do. Every time I talked to Xcel I was asked what installer company I was using and was confused and tripped up when I told them I didn't have one. Several times I had to have the city or Xcel make exceptions and manually move the application along since I was doing it all as a homeowner. Nonetheless, we eventually figured everything out, installed, and had an approved inspection yesterday. The whole process has taken 5 months, and I still have to wait for Xcel to come out and change out my meter *in a few more weeks*. Even then, I may not be able to monitor the efficiency and output of my panels because SolarEdge made my optimizers and you can only sign up through them if you're an installer. They literally say [""New System Owner? Contact your installer to set up your account.""](https://monitoring.solaredge.com/solaredge-web/p/login) So now I get to fight that. 

I understand the need to ""do it right"" and that codes and permits and engineering reviews exist for a reason. But the individual should be able to read up on all that and do the installation themselves if they want. This should be like adding a deck to your house - sure you could hire a contractor, but if you want to tackle it on your own you have the resources easily available to figure it out. Yes, obviously installing a full solar system on your house is more complicated than most home improvement projects, but the difference here is that the entire process was clearly designed from the ground up to basically force homeowners to go through a full service solar installation company. From what my installer friend says, the major manufacturers and distributors in the solar market are directly involved in the legislation being pushed through on a federal and state level, which isn't a surprise at all, but it would be naive to assume they wouldn't be writing the legislation to require installers use their products and individuals require installers. Keep the power away from the consumer and in the hands of the big players. **It is becoming increasingly inaccessible to the average homeowner to tackle on their own, even while costs plummet and availability skyrockets.** In my humble opinion this is a serious roadblock in a wider adoption among the general population, *which should be the goal of renewable energy options in the first place.* &lt;/rant&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Installed solar on my home with minimal help from a certified installer, had to fight every step of the way, system is clearly rigged against individuals doing it on their own. I'm sitting here frustrated and lamenting the process as a whole which I think will be a roadblock in having solar (and other renewable options if they follow the same path) being adopted by the general population.",energy

personalfinance,Explanation For Auto Loan Denial,"Looking for input from someone who may be a loan officer, or has potentially relevant experience. 

I recently applied for a $28,000/72mo used car loan through PedFed. For what it’s worth, they didn’t ask for any information on the car, just loan amount. I’m also not a member, but the application said I didn’t have to be one just to apply for the loan. I applied with my wife as a co-applicant.

We’re both in our mid to late 20s, credit scores over 750, combined income right at $150K before taxes, no existing auto loans. 

Current “debt” is as follows (rough numbers):
-$300K/30yr home loan (&lt;1 year old)
-$20K in student loans (her, been making payments for about 3 years)
-$8K misc loan (2-3 years old)
*no late payments on any 

We have multiple credit cards, don’t carry a balance on any of them, and have had the longest one for about 4 years.

Long story short, I was flat out rejected for the loan by PenFed (letter in the mail), and the sole reason was “lack of credit history”. Granted, that is probably the only thing they could ping me on, but it seems ridiculous to reject the loan completely. I know I can write them to “reconsider”, but I was really just trying to shop around for rates and now I’m frustrated that I not only don’t have a rate, but my credit report has been dinged. Seems like unfair practice from a lender to provide such an insignificant explanation for a formal loan application rejection.",finance

personalfinance,"Looking for a calculator to compute multiple student loans' ""Interest Amount"" simultaneously.","I know everyone is talking about Snowball and Avalanche Method, but mathematically it seems dumb. check this out

Loan #2        $30,000 X 6.84% = ($2,054 interest per year)

I can divide the numbers by 365.25 to get the daily amount of interest I pay. So it makes sense to pay Loan#1 than #2, because I'm paying more interest on Loan #1, but I don't know why nobody brings this up!?

Anyways!  I've been searching for days to find an online calculator that does this for as many loans as I have to see the results of tweaking the balance amount on each loan.  I have a chunk of many I want to distribute to the loans with the highest ""Interest Amount/ day"", and I want to find the best combination before I pay them off. Basically, my goal is to equalize all the interest amounts on all loans, then pay off the one with the highest interest rate.

investing,on Bitcoin ($BTC) - a question,"One argument for the use of Bitcoin going forward (or any crypto currency) is it will hold it's value much better vs. the fiat that the government prints and circulates. So essentially, one can foresee once Bitcoin becomes mainstream and widely held and used, that the governments, and governments around the world will be stripped of their powers over monetary policy etc. and somewhat the financial system.

**So the question is this** 1) Under what conditions will the governments around the world willingly and allowably let this happen? 2) If widespread popularity and use of Bitcoin is going to happen simply just due to sheer force: ""you can't stop us from using bitcoin"" heard mentality; then what is stopping any government from decreeing it illegal within their borders? Despite this, I do think that BTC could still operate under the decree under this hypothetical scenario, but it will have to be some sort of grey market currency.

personalfinance,Large tax refund deposit holding up mortgage commitment,"**Got things figured out and an ""out"" solution if needed.**  
**Thank you your help everyone!**  


Hi everyone,

Problem with a hold up on my mortgage commitment. I am in the process of buying a house and currently getting a mortgage commitment.

My mortgage processor asked for a verbal explanation about a large deposit, I submitted one explaining it was my tax refund from a investment property that was sold in 2019. They decided they wanted more documentation, so I gave them my tax returns. It clearly shows the exact refund amount for individual (a large refund) and federal (a small refund). They then explained it showed ONLY the small refund but not the large refund. Starting on page 1 it mentions the large refund, then mentions it on multiple other pages. I don't think they could miss that. They now want a copy of the fully signed closing disclosure from the sale and a copy of the check received for the proceeds which could take me days to get. I have a office handling getting me the paperwork since I'm out of state.

I checked my tax returns: it shows the exact amount overpaid/ refunded from the California Franchise Tax Board that the processor is asking about, and mentions the router/account number for the large deposit (also the same as the processor is asking about). It also shows in the description of the deposit ""FRANCHISE TAX BD CASTTAXRFD"" under bank deposits description.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting incredibly frustrated because I have a deadline to meet and I may miss it because of this. Any advice on what to do/how to handle this?

ethereum,Criticism of proof-of-stake,"**Hey, mods!** My previous post was removed without providing a reason, so just to let you know: This isn't my personal criticism of proof-of-stake, this is just a summary of the most popular criticism that has been acknowledged by Vitalik himself.

If you still think this post is not appropriate for this sub, please let me know how I can improve it.

\-------

Check out my previous post: [What is proof-of-stake?](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/kr6zd7/what_is_proofofstake/)

Even though proof-of-stake gathers a lot of enthusiasts because of its significantly lower operation costs and decreased risk of centralization compared with proof-of-work, it’s not completely without criticism.

***Nothing At Stake***: problem -&gt; solution -&gt; bigger problem?

Consensus is the defense mechanism of a blockchain. Every created block has to be approved by the majority of the network, otherwise it’s rejected. The next question that arises is: **how can we make sure that the majority won’t approve fraudulent blocks?**

Imagine you have two drivers and two identical cars that have no gas in them. Your task is to get one of those cars to a certain far distance as quickly as possible. The catch - you can only spend $20 on gas.

Your best bet is to choose one car and spend all $20 to fuel it up. Splitting the money between them will make sure none reach the finish line.

**Proof-of-work** requires a miner to use external resources (dedicated hardware and electricity) to participate, because of that they have to decide which of all possible forks to contribute to. They could in theory approve both fraudulent and correct blocks, but that *significantly* lowers their chance to be rewarded, making the effort non-profitable - just like splitting 20 bucks for gas for two cars.

If a blockchain were to use another consensus algorithm, it cannot simply allow participants cost free. Otherwise they’d approve any block they like while having nothing to lose.

*Solution*: validators have to deposit their coins in order to participate in the network. If they double-vote, they lose their money.

Problem solved, right? Well...

**Will the rich get richer?**

A valid concern is that since proof-of-stake favors those validators who have contributed the most, only the richest participants will be chosen and paid by the algorithm, making them even richer and more likely to be chosen again.

The man himself seems to dismiss this problem altogether:

&gt;the rewards in general \[...\] will be quite low; in eth2, we are expecting annual validator rewards to equal \~0.5-2% of the total ETH supply. And the more validators are staking, the lower interest rates get. ([source](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html))

One solution is coin age-based selection implemented by Peercoin: once a stake of coins has been used to validate a block, it must wait for a certain period of time before validating another block.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Short-term liquidity for down payment: Sell long-term capital gains, HELOC, or 401k loan?","Partner &amp; I are home shopping in a highly competitive market where contingent buyers lose. We’re looking at options for a large down payment and aren’t worried about coming up with the cash as much as we want to be as efficient as possible. We will sell our current home and are confident it will go quickly once it’s listed, so any lever we pull for a short-term down payment need would quickly be replenished with the home-sale profits. 

We may end up with a jumbo loan and not need to pursue any of these options, though I’m curious to hear what you think. I’m currently leaning toward wanting a conventional loan with a better interest rate. This also means PMI isn’t a concern as we’d put down at least 20% to hit the conventional criteria. Conventional limit in our area is $548,250 and our home-to-be may range as high as $950k. We have $100k in cash (set aside for this purpose) so would conceivably need an additional $300k from these options:

1. Sell long-term gains of ESPP. This is where my head is currently. It’s a conservative play as we have salary, options, and ESPP all tied up in our employer (we work at the same company). It essentially means we trade our ESPP for ETF/other stock when we sell our current house, though we pay 15% tax on ESPP sales. 

2. Combo of #1 plus $100k of 401k loans. I’m not worried about “losing on market gains” or needing to repay immediately if we lose our jobs. We’d just pull from ESPP to repay and we’re good to go. Plus we’d repay the $100k of 401k loan immediately upon sale of our current home, then reinvest the remainder in the stock market. 

3. Do what one lender suggested and take out a HELOC (at ~6% interest) on the new home in addition to the mortgage to cover the down payment. Same thing - we’d immediately repay the HELOC with profits from the sale of our current home. 

Thoughts on this? Option #1 seems the least complicated, and option #3 seems the least efficient as we would be paying any fees associated with setting up the HELOC. 

Should we just go with the jumbo loan? We were loosely quoted on a jumbo at 2.8%/30-year fixed, which is honestly better than I expected, but not as good as the 2.3% conventional quote from the same prospective lender.

EDIT: mocked up a couple scenarios and it seems crazy not to just go with the jumbo with this kind of purchase and such a low rate. On a 950k house, there’s a $212k difference in down payment needed between trying to get a conventional loan (402k DP) vs. paying 20% down and sticking with a jumbo (190k DP). Monthly payment difference between the two would be ~$1k/month. So... My gut is telling me that $212k could be better invested in the market vs. throwing at a 2-3% rate. We can be conservative and dollar-cost average over time in case the market dips.

Still leaves us to figure out potentially ~$90k for a down payment.",finance

personalfinance,Am i Safe? Need guidance MI - UIA,"Like many Americans I went on state and later federal unemployment March 2020 when I had my first temporary shutdown in Michigan. I went back to work in mid July 2020. I will try to include as much objective detail bc it truly is rich. I put due to covid 19. I put all information required. I even put in the automatic pto of 9 hours I got from work. Well anyway they come back in September saying I misrepresented my vacation pay and made me pay back $555. 

Luckily I save all my UIA pay and paid that back so just over broke even. Maybe saved $300. Fast forward to mid November I get another temporary shut down after a raise (I work in direct Care with persons with intellectual and physical disabilities, mainly transporting on outings in transit vans ans we follow the school and library policy, if they close we close). So I go on it again. I remember having a less than 30 second phone conversation with my more than kind manager wherein I said my dad has Compromised immunity from leukemia so I didn’t feel comfortable with any reassignment. 

But again I don’t remember if I even had an email backing that statement up or anything like that bc of how short it was. NEVER did I state i had a medical condition to her or disability. Little do I know my employer thought I had medical reasons not to be “reassigned” Which she never overtly offered mind you. So now I have to pay back $832.49 in state which is over a $100 more than they paid me and may face penalty (likely not with this corona stuff but that is where my anxious mind goes). I just put in a transfer to pay them. 

My question: Am I Safe? I did not intentionally put that and the state is too overwhelmed to see that it was a simple miscommunication. Please give me guidance as to what to do and where to go from here. I am very frightened",finance

stocks,America V China: Their leading stocks and predictions moving forward into 2021,"**China**

China is the world's second-biggest economy - it's big. As in 1.4 billion people big. I think it's highly likely that it will overtake the US within the next decade. It's the heavyweight of manufacturing, global exports, and it is the world's biggest food producer. Between 1977 and 2017, China's economy grew almost 10,000%. Let that sink in. The biggest banks are no longer Citi or JP Morgan; the top players are all Chinese. If you have heard or read about the ""Great Firewall"" you will know about the billionaires that own Tencent and Alibaba. There's been a lot of people speculating to sell Alibaba because Jack Ma has gone missing. Some are arguing that one should sell BABA because it is doomed and some - who I would have to side with - are saying buy the dip as it will rise back up once the politics have been resolved. Just today I saw that NYSE reversed their decision to de-list 3 Chinese telecom companies. Once the news broke, the firms’ stock prices surged. This is a good signal that international relations are improving - i.e., quite unlikely that China will liquidate BABA. There are a lot of US and EU investors in BABA, Tencent, and more to come. Also, if China did do that, imagine the trade-war that America would unleash. You also have to consider how China wants to keep growing and to do this, they need a free flow of money. 

China has a complicated relationship with global financial markets and is basically a communist country. You have state intervention that you would never see here in the West. Quick history lesson: Foreign investors not that far back were unable to buy any Chinese shares. However, since allowing it (*see: QFII program, circa 2002*), the flow of free money, Chinese stocks have grown. Ask yourself, are China now suddenly going to reverse this boom? Who really knows, but I highly doubt it. 

It is worth noting that foreign ownership is capped at 30%. If Chinese investors dumped a given stock, foreign investors (that's me and you) could find themselves inadvertently holding more than 30% and then be forced to sell at market price - which would probably be pennies. Under Xi Jinping, the Govt's control has been getting tighter - meaning that a stock's fortune could change suddenly. However, markets in China are used to benefit the Chinese people. In short, if the market moved in a way that was not beneficial to China's rise, the Chinese Govt would not hesitate to intervene. So, a good question to ask yourself when investing in companies like BABA and Tencent is: Do these stocks benefit the Chinese Govt?? To help answer this, look at Chinese Funds and Chinese Institutional Investment as well as knowing that they already own 70%. If the answers are yes, I think it unlikely that the Govt would put a grenade under their best-performing stocks. The biggest issue with Chinese stocks is their accounting and auditing - -this becomes less of an issue for large-cap stocks. 

The US-China trade war has taken its toll on China. Harsh tariffs on Chinese goods have reduced demand for their products as well as reduced profit margins. Because of this, their manufacturing industry shrank throughout 2019. Risk-averse investors will probably want to wait on the sidelines and wait for a resolution to be reached. However, as some famous guy once said 'Buy when others' are fearful'. China also has many other problems such as a shrinking population and the national debt is increasing, meaning they want their companies to be as successful as possible. They can't afford to simply write off companies - profitable ones at that - to simply ""show Jack Ma who's boss"". Granted they will give him a dressing down, strip him of his assets; or even put him in jail. But hurting their own companies?? This doesn't make sense. 

***Prediction:*** I am Bullish on both BABA and Tencent. I actually love Tencent because of their 40% holdings in Epic Games. Clue: Unreal Engine &gt; Mandalorian. 

**America**

Tech companies in the US have been getting bigger, and bigger (especially during the Coranavirus pandemic). Unless you've been asleep, you would have seen that Amazon wants to relocate its operations to Cyprus (link:[https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/amazon-buys-cyprus-08122020](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/amazon-buys-cyprus-08122020)). If this happens, their presence would be so immense they would literally be able to buy political influence across all levels and lobby for tax rebates. The Cyprian Govt would happily lobby for the company in the EU Parliament. The EU would not allow this and would enforce sanctions against Amazon as well as teaming up with the US Govt to fight such a monopoly. We live in a democracy and we've been quite successful for a few centuries now. If we suddenly had a superpower rising that would create an imbalance in the system. For instance, the profits of Amazon circa 2009 grew from less than $1BN to $10BN in 2019. However, the amount of federal tax it pays is close to zero. With the US Govt (and many others) short on cash due to printing/borrowing money, they will need large corps to start paying their fair share of tax (and then some). Meaning profits will go down moving forward. There is an active effort by the US and EU Govts to punish these kinds of monopolies. Many IBs and Strategists see all these tech giants - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook - being persecuted by the Govt. 

If you have been holding tech stocks for a long time like me, good for you. Keep your stocks. However, if you are new to the game of investing, I would consider personally ETFs in tech rather than the stock itself. For example, the QQQ tracks the Nasdaq-100 and has about 50% of its holdings in Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. 

***Prediction:*** After seeing Amazon &amp; Microsoft, trade sideways for 5months now, I do think they will reach another peak soon from Covid-related sales, however, I do think that will be short-lived. Apple and Google have seen massive rises over the last 6-months. Apple was because they are going to start making cars, which will take a long time. It took Tesla almost 17 years. I see the upside for these stocks being modest gains, while the downside will most likely be what's happened to me: ""Opportunity Cost"" - whereby your money will be tied for months on end doing nothing. Neither up nor down. 

Disclaimer: I have been holding both Alibaba and Amazon for years now. I even bought more shares during the most recent dip of BABA.

personalfinance,"Moving from private sector to federal government employment. Should I roll my current 401k funds into my existing IRAs, or into the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)?","31 years old here, and I'm very excited to be starting a promising job with the federal government in a few weeks. I've previously only worked in the private sector at a few different companies, so I've accumulated some retirement savings through 401ks at previous jobs and typically I would roll them over into my personal IRAs when I left and moved to a new company.

With my 401k at my current employer however, I'm wondering whether it makes sense to just roll it over into my existing IRAs, or to roll it over into the TSP since I'll be using the TSP anyhow as one of my main retirement savings vehicles. I've always heard that the TSP is one of the best retirement savings programs out there due to the low fees and expense ratios involved. That said, I currently have my IRAs at Charles Schwab, where my retirement savings are in total stock market Schwab index funds that have close-to-zero ERs to begin with.

I guess my question is whether there's any clear benefit to doing one or the other, or if it comes down to something as mechanical as ""just compare the ERs on TSP and Schwab funds and pick the lower one""? For what it's worth, while I can't predict the future with certainty, I imagine that I will plan to remain a federal employee for at least many years, if not the rest of my career until retirement. So I wonder if starting with a seed pot of money in the TSP that I roll over is somehow better than starting from zero in any way.

personalfinance,"I'm 48 and need help on where to put my money. Real state, retirement, stock market?","I have a big tangled mess in my head and need help trying to figure out where it is wisest to invest. My goal is to have my money make me the most money. I'm 48 and don't have much saved for retirement. Here's my situation/portfolio:

My salary is 87k a year. My wife makes 145k, but the only thing we have together is a joint account for groceries. However, we do file taxes jointly. I'm assuming our tax bracket is 24%. Last year our taxable income is $137 and tax rate 13%

I have about 12k in a savings account making peanuts for interest.

I have a mortgage on my condo (acquired before marriage) for $73k, it has a second mortgage for $84k (but it will be forgiven in 13 years provided I don't sell). The condo is worth about $300k. I just refinanced for 30 years and my interest rate is 2.67%.  Monthly payments are $292. Insurance is $600 a year. Taxes are about $5k per year. Assessments are $435p/m. My original idea was to make extra payments so the first mortgage will be paid in exactly 13 years. The question then becomes should I invest on an index fund instead of putting it towards paying down the mortgage earlier?

The next question becomes: I have a 403b (tiaa all going to VIIIX)) with about 240k. My employer matches me up to 5%, which is what I am putting towards it. There is also a voluntary pre-tax program where I am putting an extra 5%. I could put in an additional 14% on the voluntary and it would bring me down on the tax bracket, but it would be $1000 less on my paycheck. The question is should I not put anything extra on the 403b and put it monthly, after taxes, towards index funds?

The last question: My sister and I inherited a condo from my mom. We just refinanced and took cash out to remodel it and sell it. Mortgage is $150k at 3.1%. Worth about $350k. Taxes about $7k yearly. Insurance about $500 yearly, Assessments $275 p/m.  Currently we are paying the mortgage and future taxes out of the 50k cash out loan. Hope to sell in March/April. Questions here are: Would it be better to rent it or sell it? Renting would give us a steady income of about $1k per month after mortgage and taxes. I have thought about buying my sister out, which would mean taking out a loan for an additional 40k and letting her keep the 50k loan. This would allow me to remodel and rent. Or if we sell it then I would have about $75k after sale, on which I would have to pay taxes (unless the capital tax exemption is possible since this was an inheritance) and invest that money on an index fund? Or use that money to pay off my live-in condo mortgage and invest the $292 per month?

Other than this I have no other debt or savings. I pay my cc's off monthly.

Our property we got a 2.625% and our rental I am refinancing from a 4.1% to 3.1% (non primary residence). Is the 3.1% justifiable to put it all towards the mortgage? I suppose what I am actually asking is what interest rate do you take the guaranteed return on? This would of course be after building up a sum prepared to make repairs as necessary so we don’t have to touch our personal funds. 

Also, the renters have expressed interest In possibly purchasing the home at the end of their 15 month lease. I said I would be open to discussion a couple months before their lease was up but we did not add anything for lease-to-own in the current contract. If we had intentions to sell then, does that change the above answer? And is there anything out of the ordinary if we decided we did not care for being a landlord?

personalfinance,I need some advice on digging myself out of debt and asking my parents for some help.,"I apologize if this is all over the place, but I want to start out by saying this is a hole that I take full responsibility for:

I am currently 23 years old, working as a bank associate (which I am sure many of you will find ironic after reading this). I bring in anywhere from $2000-$2200 a month depending on incentives and such. I graduated in May of 2019 and have been employed and living on my own since then.

My parents always told me to never go into any debt and to always ask for help if I need it before I went out and lived on my own after graduating college. Of course, I wanted to prove to them that I could be self sufficient and handle everything on my own. That attitude alone has made me rack up a ton of debt. Me being a dumbass kid I fell into the trap of taking out personal loans/payday loans whenever I didn't have money to pay for whatever BS I wanted to buy. I had never budgeted for anything in my life, and when I started racking up debt I was too afraid to look at my budget because I didn't want to acknowledge what I had been doing to myself. For a long time when I took out these loans I didn't understand interest rates and how predatory payday loans were. It has gotten so bad to the point where these past few paychecks I check my bank balance and my balance will be anywhere from -$300 to -$700 because of all of the high interest payments I am paying on these loans.

I have within the last couple of weeks started to live within my means (started Dave Ramsey's program) and have been applying for second jobs to try to bring in some more income. I live with my girlfriend who has and makes more money than I do, and she has taken a lot more expenses recently after I told her about what I have been dealing with.

Altogether I have racked up about $9,000 in personal/payday loan debt and another $2,000 in credit card debt. When I entered in all of the payments through the EveryDollar app in my budget I am currently $1,630.66 over my budget. In fact, I am paying **$2200** a month in just loan payments **alone**. Seeing that today has made me so afraid. My credit score is a 601 and so I wouldn't be able to consolidate anywhere at all, plus I know more debt is not the answer at this point. I have no other option than to ask my dad for some help, I just am extremely fucking embarrassed that I have done this to myself and I had too big of an ego to ask for help and that I didn't listen to him before I got into all of this debt.

I guess I just am wondering if you guys have been at this point and have any advice on what to do to get out of this debt? Other than following the Dave Ramsey stuff.",finance
stocks,Why bullish on weed stocks?,"I keep seeing posts about now that democrats have the house and the presidency nows the time to buy. Looking at bidens policies, he is anti legalization for personal use and only supports it for medical use. Looking at his platform hes very status quo.

Seems congress isn't itching to pass legalization. Am i missing something? If there were solid legalization efforts id be a lot more of a bull. 

Currently i cannot buy weed stocks, as its federally illegal, and im a .gov employee. But, if it was legalized that prohibition would be dropped and id be able to compete in market. Who here knows a reason to be bullish?",finance

personalfinance,My mortgage company called and offered a streamline FHA refinance? Is this sketchy or trustworthy?,"Had a random number call me and say there were from my mortgage company. And they said I could basically refinance within the company by doing a streamline refinance. Where it’d only cost me a thousand bucks basically and that would cover every thing. No appraisal or closing cost thing. And I could get my interest rate a whole percent down. 

They sent me an email after the phone because I was hesitant, but it looks like a legit email from my mortgage company.

personalfinance,What sort of loan should I get for Solar? Is this a good rate I was given by my mortgager?,"Hi all. I’m working on getting Solar installed on the rooftop of my primary (and only) home which I’m 10+ years into a 30yr mortgage. 

I wasn’t sure what type of loan I should be looking for Solar to maximize incentives so any tips would be appreciated. 

Yesterday I applied for a Home Equity Loan through US Bank for a loan amount of $29,706.57. The interest rate I was given is 5.5% and a monthly payment of $204.18 a month for 20 years. Is this a fair offer? 

My credit score is not that great, about 670 and the only negative items on my credit are some medical bills. I owe $108,000 on the house and for some reason they estimated my property value at $172,584 even though I paid more than that in 2008. Zillow’s estimate of my home is $369,454. I think I read the bank will send someone to estimate the value of the house so if they update it closer to $350k will this adjust the all the loan numbers for the better or not?",finance
Bitcoin,Using Applied Economics to Bitcoin and why it matters.,"Let me first start out by thanking this subreddit, as it truly has changed my life. The information sharing and passion found in this community is something that is awe inspiring. 

Just a little background - I graduated with an applied economics degree and have been working in finance for over 10 years. I first heard about Bitcoin from a friend during the 2017 run up to the previous ATH and told him he was a fool to invest in it. I advised him to go read up about tulip mania and get back to me. I also felt pretty vindicated when it eventually “crashed” in 2018. The problem I had was that I only looked at Bitcoin and cryptos in general, from a very surface level perspective. I also was worried about no central authority, network security, and no regulations. Fast forward to 2020 and I’m now literally begging my friends and family to buy some before it’s too late. 

What changed? My fears about the global economy has been growing rapidly the last few years. We are at a time when an estimated 17 trillion dollars worth of debt is producing a negative yield (I don’t want to get too technical  here, but trust me this is insane). Meanwhile we have 28 trillion dollars in US debt alone - with that number growing rapidly ever year. We are getting to a point in which every dollar the government receives in a year will go to paying interest on that debt. The federal reserve can’t raise interest rates, basically ever at this point, because they will bankrupt the government with higher interest rates on those debt payments. So the only way for the fed to pay our debt is to print more money to meet those obligations. We are truly at a moment of no return (please don’t listen to the MMT crowd, as they are a bunch of ass hats). The dollar being used as the global reserve currency is where this massive problem comes into play. 

What does this have to do with Bitcoin? Since inflation is inevitable, where do you put your money to preserve it’s value? Of course there is gold, and that was my first thought. But then sometime in June I ran across an article about Bitcoin, that led me to this subreddit and then down a rabbit hole that I will never escape. Bitcoin is superior to gold in every way, so it truly is the most logical choice. But in economic terms Bitcoin is a pristine piece of collateral that honestly will become the new global base collateral for all of finance. In the financial world Bitcoin solves a ton of problems: everyone can audit it, it is immutable, no double spend of collateral (trust me this happens all the time with government bonds today), the entire system is deflationary, it has a fixed total amount, and a massive amount of value can be sent across the globe in minutes (try taking self custody of gold and sending 100 million dollars of it anywhere). 

Let me stop here because I could go on and on...but can hear my wife in my head right now saying just stop there and let them digest this post. If for some reason this post is worthy of your attention, then I would love to do a second one about how I see this space growing from an economic standpoint. 

You all are amazing and I really do hope my first post on Reddit is of value. I promised I wasn’t going to say it...To the Moon ladies and gents!!!!

Edit: I am definitely shocked and humbled at the response this generated. I promise to look over the comments and will address some of the more relevant topics. I will also work on the second post with a link back to this one.

* Vice President Mike Pence:

&gt;As we reconvene in this chamber, the world will again witness the resilience and strength of our democracy. For even in the wake of unprecedented violence and vandalism at this Capitol, the elected representatives of the people of the United States have assembled again on the very same day to support and defend the constitution of the United States.

* Sen. Mitch McConnell:

&gt;We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats. We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation.

* Sen. Lindsey Graham:

&gt;I don't buy this. Enough's enough. We've got to end it. Vice President Pence, what they are asking you to do you won't do because you can't ... If you're a conservative, this is the most offensive concept in the world, that a single person could disenfranchise 155 million people.

personalfinance,"Student Loans, Car Payment, Mortgage","Hey everyone, 

First time posting here and looking to make the best financial decision possible. I'm 24, with with a very stable job, making roughly 50K a year(before taxes) in FL. My debt right now is $20,000(4%) federal student loans, and $20,000(4.5%) in my truck loan. I have roughly $20,000 in stocks, cash, and other assets. My Credit score is around 750 and I'm getting pretty sick of renting and want to purchase a home as quickly as **realistically** possible. There are houses in the area for 150K-200K with no HOA and that is what I'm targeting. I currently pay $1,000 a month for rent/utilities and I have been paying extra on my truck at $1,000 a month. With my 20K of savings, I could pay off my student loans or truck entirely or have a 13%-10% down payment on a home. Luckily my parents are well off and told me they would always help with emergencies so I am not worried about spending my entire 20K of savings. With the current status of the country, there is a strong possibility of federal student loan forgiveness so I'm hesitant to pay extra there (minimum payment after covid would be $175). So it comes down to paying off my truck and freeing up $1,000 a month ($550 minimum payment) or using the money for a home loan, if I would even qualify. Also, as a side note, I fully realize that buying a new truck in 2019 was probably not the best decision, but I grew up with an unreliable car and my truck is covered in a bumper to bumper warranty until 2026 and I got over 10K discounted off the sticker price when I bought it. I appreciate anyone who actually reads this whole thing, whether or not you reply. 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing a small mortgage? $47K @ 5%,"Hey guys I was curious if anyone had information on refinancing a small home loan. I own a condo, purchased in 2018 for about $63,000. I put 20% down and currently owe $47,000 on the mortgage. The current property value based on similar units is $80,000 and my credit score is 807.

My interest rate on the loan is 5.0%, and was interested in getting this lowered, but was curious if it is even possible to refinance a loan this small. I have checked with a few companies and the smallest I have seen doable is $75,000.

Has anyone refinanced or heard of someone refinancing a home loan at under $50,000?

My current plan is to purchase a new (new to me) home and rent it for the next 3 years before selling this condo. My fear is that if I do refinance, the cost of the refinance would outweigh my savings over the next 3 years.",finance

stocks,Lets talk VSTO,"They are up 15% on the democrats winning Georgia. They own Federal ammunition, recently purchased Remington ammunition, and own a number of other sporting and clothing accessory chains like Bushnell, Camelback, etc.

They are basically broken into two segments, shooting sports and outdoor products. Shooting sports sales were up 26 percent to $380 million last quarter and outdoor products increased 35 percent to $195 million. Shooting sports contains the anmunition which has flown off the shelf since COVID and the CEO says they have over 1 billion in backlog orders. Equally exciting is the performance in outdoor products probably driven by COVID and people looking for outdoor activities.

They sold their gun business (Savage) in 2019 and paid down some debt so their balance sheet is improved. More importantly i think it reduces the risk of being regulated by the Biden administration as they will likely be focused on guns not ammunition. 

With the recent election results I suspect ammo sales to be strong for multiple years to come. With a market cap of only 1.67 billion it seems like a good value play to me and I expect a good 2-4 years of blow out sales. I own shares and may increase my position more in the coming weeks.

gaming,Are well polished games that appeal to fans a thing of the past?

personalfinance,Woth paying PMI when interest rates being low?,"My wife and I have been planning to move for awhile now and are a few months from being able to put 20% down. Now that we are close to that goal I'm wondering if it makes sense to put even that much down. 

We have excellent credit so I'm expecting the interest rate for the mortgage to be 3% or slightly lower. Worst case on PMI is 2.25% from what I understand so we are talking about 5.25% between interest and pmi.

Wouldn't it make more sense to put less than 20% down given those rates and invest the difference or am I misunderstanding something?

Our investments are nothing crazy. We keep about 6 months in saving on top of the money we've been setting aside for a down payment, then we max out our IRAs first, put a bit into our 403Bs each year, and a bit into a general investment account that is just a mix of international ETFs, emerging markets, and matching the s&amp;p I keep an eye on things every few months but don't try to play the market. If we put less down the first thing would be use the extra money to bump up or savings to adjust for the higher mortgage payment. Then then take whatever extra is left, plus the money from selling our current house to max out our 403Bs, and split the rest between or none retirment investments.

We are 35, so its not like we are retiring right away. Each of us has very stable jobs, it's unlikely either of us would loose our jobs without almost a years notice,  and we are looking at houses we could afford on a single income. So as far as risk goes I'm not to worried.",finance

personalfinance,Car loan refinance,Sorry about this guys but I'm woefully uneducated about how this works. I signed the loan in 2017 with my grandfather as the cosigner. 28k with an interest rate of 4%. I've made every payment on time and the remaining balance is about 10k. It was a 6 year loan and I'm hoping I can bring the monthly payment of 480 a month down. I now have three adopted children and I could really use any extra penny. Is it worth going to my bank and attempting to refinance?  What's my best option here? I can probably afford the payments for the foreseeable future but extra payments are out of question. If I could go back on time I would of bought a clunker cash but alas I was young and dumb. Any advice is welcome. Thank you very much,finance

I just accepted a 6 month contract from a recruiting firm. Turns out the client has warned me that there will be extensive travel and overnight stays. I'm now back at the table negotiating compensation from the resource agency. The original contract never mentioned this.

I've seen federal guidelines suggest 58c/mile, but I can't find anything about booking or overnight stays. My history always had a system or staff in place to take care of such things.

Should I be charging an up front per diem every time I'm deployed overnight? How would you suggest I structure this in case I need to counter?

Have a Roth IRA of 250k

I want to pay off of the house in the next five years while saving on the interest rate.

Currently owe 250k @ 3.5% for the next 20 years. Have the following scenarios that I need some guidance as to what would be the best approach.

1-keep interest rate as is but double payments and make a lump sum extra payment of 20k which would leave me  at 60k payoff  at the end of 5 years.  Which I can then payoff from my Roth 

2- refinance the house  to 2.5% and double the payments and put down 20k  and 5k would go to the closing . 5 year payoff is 52k

3- leave interest rate as is and put the 20k into a growth account and add 2k per month for the next 5 years into it 

Currently have a capital lost carry over of 60k from my mother’s estate.

stocks,Buy Cannabis Now!,"As soon as it is decriminalized federally (which it will be due to the massive upset in Georgia), interstate commerce can commence as well as international trade with our neighbors to the north and south, who have also legalized (Mexico recently). It will sky rocket and all the “conservatives” will wonder how all the potheads got so rich suddenly.

Biden and Harris have admitted to their error in voting against cannabis in the past. I also believe that Biden will tout legalizing cannabis as one of his major achievements for his first 100 days. Which means they will pressure all those around them to vote to pass.

Plus, why not legalize and tax it federally? We are kinda in the middle of a pandemic and the economy needs all the help it can get.

The only ones who don’t want it legalized are crusty old farts. Support is huge for the green.

personalfinance,"Planning Advice for Prospective Med Student $28,000 In Debt","Currently feeling a lot of stress about the federal loans I've taken out during undergrad and would appreciate any advice/feedback for this first generation student. In total, I have taken out 28k to pay for my undergrad using subsidized (20k) and unsubsidized loans (8k). I have 23k in my savings, but I do not know whether to pay the bulk of my loans now or later (and if now, how much?).

Looking ahead, my financial future does not look that bright. I am currently in my last semester of college and planning on taking 2 gap years before going to med school and working to save up for living expenses in medical school. In the fall, I am going to enroll in community college half time to improve my science GPA for med school and work part time ($13/hour scribing for 30 hours a week). I am not in a position to live with my parents during this time so I am estimating about $1000 in rent and utilities a month and $100 a month for a metro pass. Monthly, I would have only about $400 left over. In my second gap year, I am hoping to work full time to save up for the cost of living during medical school (I am assuming I'm going to take out loans for tuition) as well as about $4000 to apply to medical school. I was thinking of paying 8k off now so I can have a bit more of a manageable loan when I graduate. I currently have a work-study job that I will earn about $2000 from this semester and I am actively trying to apply to other part time research jobs.

I'm concerned about paying off this loan fast because I will not have any income for four years in med school and won't start making 60k for another 6 years. I don't have anyone in my personal life who could help me with such financial planning so any advice would be great. My question is, considering all this information, how much should I pay off of my student loans right now? How should I invest the rest of my money? Should I just put all my money into bitcoin right now and then sell in a couple of months so that I have extra money for these rough times ahead? Any input would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Is my mortgage company lowering my escrow to manipulate my refinance?,I received an offer to drop my mortgage interest rate through a refinance from 3.875 to 2.25% I have had the home 6 years. (Not happy about extending the term again but oh well.) I'm doing an fha streamline and the pmi is cut in half and it also allows the pmi to drop after 11 years whereas the old loan had pmi for the life of the loan. I feel like I would be a fool to not take the refinance but since I owe very little on the home \~70k there are not a lot of refinancing options at that rate. I'd rather invest than pay down early anyway. My savings would be about $200 a month according to my loan originator. The issue is they calculated my escrow payment to drop from $220 a month to $149 a month.  Nothing should be changing about my taxes or insurance correct? So why would the escrow go down through a refinance? They have already dropped the rate this year of my escrow from $250 to $200 This year as they had just recalculated my escrow account last month. Did they lower the escrow amount just to make the deal look sweeter?,finance

Bitcoin,Do not ignore this about inflation,"In a progressive healthy economy where production is constantly growing, all goods and services are represented by all the currency in the system. Therefore, the value of the total quantity of currency must be equal to the value of the total quantity of goods and services bought which are represented by the gross domestic product. Here is the equation that describes the relationship, being nominal GDP the multiplication between the average price and the quantity of products:

https://preview.redd.it/adv8u2a98w961.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a24b915eb49c6570c07bb2f10a6ed64c79e269

In the equation, velocity of currency “V”, indicates the number of transactions per amount of currency. For example, when someone uses 10$ to purchase some product and latter the seller of goods spends the same amount to buy other products, in this case velocity equals to 2 as the same amount is used in different transactions. To simplify complexity, we are going to suppose that velocity is constant and equal to one. Then equation shows that the value of currency unit must vary exactly and inversely with the amount put into circulation. Keeping in context, adding currency supply in an existing circulating amount through credit spending or fiscal stimulus, devalues all the existing currency against all goods and services.

https://preview.redd.it/lbxwekoc8w961.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14d4a71837a783ceb2514ec03b01311922600195

To understand how the process is carried out. Suppose, for example, that the Central Bank lows interest rates and many corporations and individuals reconsider to borrow to purchase real state. The first effect of this expenditures will be to raise the prices of housing as the demand increased, this is described in the second equation. Real state agencies and their employees, then, will have higher revenue and they will spend more for the goods and services they want. The sellers of this goods and services will be able to raise their prices because of this increased demand, here velocity starts to grow describing the first equation. Those who have increased currency income will be willing to pay higher prices rather than do without the goods, for them, a dollar will have a smaller subjective value than before.

Basically, this purchase-chain process spreads among the economy and assuming production of goods and services has not incremented, its prices will have increased correspondingly. However, the state is not richer than before. Credit used in a non-productive way, creates fake demand in the sector involved distorting its prices. Other sectors and people not related will basically see prices raising and their incomes will keep being the same but with less purchasing power. This is how inflation expands through the economy and it is not an average standard of 2% as we are told. Depending on the consumer goods and services purchased our currency value could be much more exposed.

For a better understanding let’s simulate the value of a dollar over time so it will be easier to realize the scope of an inflationary currency. At first, let’s simulate the historic US currency since 1913, more than a hundred years of currency devaluation:

https://preview.redd.it/rwts0gzg8w961.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fae4efa396bd681be1588c2b6ce7fb2ef48d160

Since then, the dollar has devalued 96% of its initial value. What people were able to buy in 1913 for 4¢ you can buy it now for one dollar, or what is the same, one dollar back then had the same purchasing power as 26.05$ today.

Remember that the dollar purchasing power is calculated using the inflation on consumer prices (CPI). Inflation generally caused by an increase on currency supply against production as it has been described before.

In the chart you can see how the dollar almost permanently goes down in value. During this century, specially since the federal reserve was created in 1913, monetary policies have been constantly manipulated to spend and add currency supply in the economy. In 1933 Roosevelt implemented the executive order 6102 which required all persons to deliver all but a small amount of gold coins to the Federal Reserve in exchange for 20.67$ per oz. Then the price of gold was fixed to 35$ per oz. This expanded gold reserves and as them grew and had more value, allowed commercial banks to expand currency supply through credit. Realize that the gold standard was a constrain for the government power because always limited credit.

In 1971, already in the dollar standard placed in 1944 after Bretton woods agreement, President Nixon detached the dollar from gold and currencies became fluctuant in the market . Basically, US was creating more dollars than gold reserves permitted and borrowing countries claimed the gold that was backing their dollars. This made significant change in the banking system as credit lending became not limited by the amount of gold hold as reserves but for the dollar reserves known as base money.

The main reason of not having a gold standard is to allow government and central banks to spend and print currency, limited only by monetary policies dictated by themselves. This can be used to stimulate the economy during a recession period, natural disaster, a pandemic or even to subsidize war. At the end, this gives control of the currency value to a centralized entity and power to choose which sector to expand.

So, as you can see in the chart below, it shows the commercial and industrial loans issued by commercial banks. Specially after monetary policies easing, commercial banks have brutally expanded their business:

https://preview.redd.it/cxylte9o8w961.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=150ca4e1b883be312cbe3a9cb3fa829d6fc37950

Back in the dollar devaluation simulations, here is the last 20 years of US chart inflation based on BLS data, which is an average of 2.35% inflation per year and is going to give us a first vision on how effects our savings:

https://preview.redd.it/94fki0rp8w961.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cc169d0bdf65bd1d5a1d4d0d573690af24296d8

 The amount of 0.64$ back in 2000 today have the purchase power of one dollar, for this 20-year period the dollar has devalued 36%. If some responsible person wants to save 100000$ in the early 2000, right now this 100k$ savings can buy only what they were able to afford 64000$ back in 2000. This last statement could sound a little complex at the beginning but its key to understand how the system shapes human behavior, as it shows how generations are susceptible to spend instead of saving because the system incentives for it. if you spend more right now you can consume more goods and services than in the next year, that’s the message behind. It’s a high time preference mindset that incites to spend and consume instead of saving and investing into something productive.

Now, it is important to analyze how CPI is measured. We mentioned before the standard inflation of around 2% does not apply to everyone as we consume different products and brands. The chart below is from shadowstats.com and measures the CPI as if it were calculated using the methodologies in place in 1980 (blue line) and right now by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (red line):

https://i.redd.it/tjytsjds8w961.gif

Back in that times inflation was determined comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time was changed to reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living. Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI) allowing the government to report a lower CPI.

A cost of living index basically measures the inflation on the *generic* goods and services that people consume, it reflexes the potential consumer substitution in response to relative price changes. For example, an ecologic orange juice priced 2$ which its price is incremented to 2.20$. The CPI should indicate a 10% inflation rate but being able the option to purchase a generic orange juice (with extra sugar) for 2$ which its price has not incremented, then the CPI is rated 0%. This is how a CPI based in a cost of living index rates inflation. Now, you may have a better idea on how inflation can affect your cost of living or at least influence to buy lower quality products.

Putting numbers in inflation rates above 2%, here is a table on how a dollar is devalued for 10 years in different constant rates, expressed in % and its actual purchasing power. Additionally, I encourage you to visit Chapwoodindex.com to see real inflation in the 50 largest cities in US.

stocks,"Stock Market News for Today | RUN, ENPH, TLRY, ACB, NIO, ROKU, CAT, F &amp; Other Stock News [01-07]","**Stocks go bonkers while the Dems take Georgia. The Capitol is breached. Is this the time to buy Solar, Pot &amp; Industrial stocks? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a mixed day with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/nsJ4qqL) leading the way up over 400points and closing at a new record high, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/kKxbFdQ) also finishing 0.57% up for the day, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/C7CdfX8) finished the day down 0.6%. All 3 of the big indexes were trading higher earlier in the day before the [VIX](https://ibb.co/4PR24Fc) saw a spike of more than 10% as rioters [STORMED](https://ibb.co/KjbQPkD) the US Capitol, before eventually getting back to certifying the electoral votes, which brought back some stability. This was a very bad incident but shouldn’t have long-lasting effects on the stock market.

Yesterday we saw almost 70% of [COMPANIES](https://ibb.co/Br0Y0hB) advancing with over 300 new highs as the volume also spiked up, as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/FmhD70s) finished in the green with Financials, Energy and Materials gaining more than 3%, while the biggest loser was by far the tech sectors, dropping 1.7%, as we saw Large-Cap Growth companies underperforming the [MARKET](https://ibb.co/XpbdM7p), while small &amp; mid-caps, especially the value plays, outperformed the market.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/WKhNSZh) from yesterday which  shows how Big tech companies suffered yesterday, as the perceived threat of increased [TAXES](https://ibb.co/D79SMMP) spooked the market, while the Industrials, Financials, Green Energy &amp; [POT](https://ibb.co/XZFHGvj) stocks flourished on the hope of a big stimulus with new &amp; improved regulations, as it is expected that there will be an improved legislation that will help the cannabis stocks soar and the possible big stimulus would be a huge boost to most of the [RETAIL](https://ibb.co/GfwgQ3Z) sector which saw names like Nordstrom, GameStop, Target and many others posting big moves to the upside. Joining them should be [COSTCO](https://ibb.co/pQdXm2H), which did lag yesterday, but posted terrific December numbers after hours, with comparable sales increasing more than 10% while e-commerce rose by more than 60% for the month.

Yesterday we also saw the [FED](https://ibb.co/mFgqXN4) deciding to continue the current QE pace, as they still see plenty of uncertainty around, especially in the first quarter of 2021. They will continue to buy $120B worth of securities every month, as well as possibly moving on to some lengthier term maturities, while being opened to even more monetary easing if necessary.

In some more good news, we saw the [Factory Orders](https://ibb.co/jRqfPf7) for November coming it at +1%, better than expected as shipments increased by 0.7%.

While in some other not so good numbers we saw the December [PMI](https://ibb.co/7XjyFjB) slowing to 55.3, less than the 55.7 expected and 58.6 in the previous month, but this is still an indicator of expanding business activity, while ADP [numbers](https://ibb.co/kJ6jjRx) came in worse than expected, as the US lost 123K nonfarm jobs, worse than the 130K addition of jobs expected and 304K jobs gained in the previous month, as we saw a big loss of jobs in large business especially in the leisure/hospitality [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/9sCLVqY). This was the first [month](https://ibb.co/3F8Q9j0) since April when we saw a lose of jobs in the nonfarm private business.

[TODAY](https://ibb.co/vsB6NM2) we have a loaded economic data calendar starting with jobless numbers early in the morning and finishing with the Fed Balance Sheet at the market close.

In some other stock market news, we saw a report that [ROBLOX](https://ibb.co/3yqfGFZ) is looking to go public via direct listing, rather the traditional IPO. The latest funding round at $45/share saw the company valued at almost $30B, which is very high but we have to see the latest books of the company before making a prediction if it will go higher or not. This may be a better opportunity for retail investors to get in at lower prices, rather than buying at 2-3 times the IPO price.

So, guys, due to the latest political developments we have seen a huge shift in the markets, as we saw yesterday the [SOLAR](https://ibb.co/KWH2wHh) stocks having spectacular gains with Sunrun, &amp; SunPower gaining more than 16% with many other companies like [ENPHASE](https://ibb.co/72jTgdq) also soring, while the hydrogen play Plug Power also [soared](https://ibb.co/xDxrq80) more than 20% in after-hours after agreeing to a collaboration with SK Group.

We also saw gambling names move up after with the Senate changing leadership and states like New York pushing for the legalization of [gambling](https://ibb.co/CPFdVpv) in most of the US.

We also saw other companies posting great numbers, with [T-Mobile](https://ibb.co/qC2rXQC) adding 5.5M customers, its best ever number as they lead the industry, while [ROKU](https://ibb.co/qxWCNg4) continued to be one of the best plays in the streaming business alongside Disney &amp; Netflix as they have surpassed 50M accounts.

And on the industrial side we saw companies like Caterpillar and US Steel posting big gains in anticipation of an infrastructure bill that would greatly benefit them.

[Ford](https://ibb.co/yNz7PjD) also beat expectations with a decline in sales of just under 10%, better than the 14% expected as the company continues to move towards more trucks, SUVs &amp; EVs.

On the other-hand we also saw [Chinese](https://ibb.co/rbRQwyq) tech and EV stocks fall, after more bad headlines like the US looking to ban even more big companies in the US like Alibaba &amp; Tencent. This is a continuing story which has peaked up steam in the recent year after the political tensions between the US and China have increased. This companies were also joined by the big tech which continued to face selloff pressure after the blue sweep in Georgia.

My opinion is that you should start buying some green energy, pot and industrial stocks but you shouldn’t go to heavy on the first day. You should wait for things to cool-off a little and not buy everything at the top. I think a bi-weekly split strategy or monthly strategy would be nice. Which would mean you should divide your investment money and buy especially on red days every couple of weeks or on a monthly basis, but I would avoid Chinese stocks for now at least.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/LCv8Dp1) markets are mixed while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wghkCJ1) seem to be pointing at a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way,  though in the last few days every single time the futures were up the stocks finished lower and vice-verse, when the futures were red the stocks finished higher, so you shouldn’t base your investment on this.

If you look at the difference between the 2017/2018 runup to this 2020/2021 is bitcoin dominance keeps increasing while 99 percent of shitcoins, no matter how promising the whitepaper, never regain their ATH's.

In my opinion, I don't think we're truly at Trillion Market Cap if we excluded tether (22.96b marketcap) and the lower 6100 shitcoins like centralized XRP (15.5b marketcap) and Tron (lol).

With BTC at 708b market cap, if only a quarter of all bitcoin holders tried to exchange BTC to USDT, tether would have to mint 154billion out of thin air to keep up, much like what the Federal Reserve and US Treasury have been doing for the past couple decades.

investing,QuantumScape Corporations Due Diligence!,"Greetings to all who read this,

today I am sharing some due-diligence I recently did on $QS. QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!

&amp;#x200B;

**QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE (5th Jan)**

Intro to QS: "" QuantumScape Corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. It focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles. The company was founded by Jagdeep Singh, Tim Holme, and Fritz B. Prinz in May 2010 and is headquartered in San Jose, CA. ""

&amp;#x200B;

*First I checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. Here is what I found:*

· Rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th Jan)

· Trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)

* “QS Stock Risk:

This stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be ""very high risk"". During the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.

Our recommended stop-loss: **We hold a sell evaluation for this stock. No stop-loss set.""**

· Volume has increased on the 4th (of January) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.

· Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.

&amp;#x200B;

*Next I checked Motley Fool (although I have no confidence in their analysis overall), to see what they had to say:*

· QuantumScape is several years from commercial production, and its current [market capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-is-market-cap/) is still over $18 billion. Investors who want to speculate on the potential of QuantumScape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market.

· Investors have jumped in, excited about the potential, but QuantumScape will soon have a lot more shares trading. The company updated an S-1 filing at end of December registering more than 300 million shares, with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

· More shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock. In this case it is existing holders, and not the company, selling shares, meaning QuantumScape would get no cash from the offering. But existing shares could feel some near-term downward pressure (which they have since mid-late December).

· We'll likely know when the registration becomes official (probably sometime January) when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares (likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) on the 4th). It's hard to read too much into options pricing, but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose $20 or more in the weeks to come.

· QuantumScape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its [reverse merger](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/why-kensington-capital-is-charging-higher-today/) with Kensington Acquisition Corp. in November.

· QuantumScape, in partnership with **Volkswagen**, expects to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt hour (GWh) pilot facility in 2021. If successful, QuantumScape will expand the project to a 20-GWh facility. To put this in perspective, consider that in mid-2018 Tesla reported that battery production of its Gigafactory in Nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 GWh.

· While management foresees the company reporting $275 million in revenue and $73 million in gross profit for 2026, QuantumScape estimates that the following year, the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Likewise, the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive [EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx) \-- approximately $808 million.

·  Since 2012, Volkswagen has provided more than $300 million in funding to QuantumScape, making it the company's largest investor -- though it maintains a minority stake. In 2018, Volkswagen and QuantumScape formed a 50/50 joint venture, one of the goals of which is to produce solid-state batteries for Volkswagen's EVs on a mass scale.

· Thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility, QuantumScape envisions that Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid-state batteries. But QuantumScape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full, stating that ""subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology.""

· While QuantumScape is singularly focused on developing its solid-state batteries for EVs, the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications, such as stationary storage, smartphones, and wearables. While the company may, in time, pursue the latter two markets, it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company's current focus; moreover, it's one that certainly represents a significant opportunity. According to Lux Research, the stationary storage market, which represented installations of 164 GWh in 2019, is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2035, when it will reach installations totaling 3,046 GWh.

· Apple has a [mountain of cash](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/cash-is-king/), and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology. QuantumScape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month. The solid-state technology charges to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes, has greater than a 300 mile range, has a long usage life, and is non-combustible.

· The company is notably backed by both **Volkswagen** ([OTC:VWAGY](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/volkswagen-aktiengesellschaft/vwagy/)) and Bill Gates. Whether investors are speculating about an Apple investment is anyone's guess. Moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with QuantumScape if they have to compete against an Apple EV.

&amp;#x200B;

*After this, I went to Simply Wall St. to get an overview of management and financials:*

## ·Shahmoon Keller PLLC Files Suit on Behalf of Holders of QuantumScape Corporation Warrants

· Shahmoon Keller PLLC announced that the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Manhattan has scheduled an injunction hearing for January 19, 2021 in a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of warrants to purchase stock of QuantumScape Corporation. QuantumScape, the successor to Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. by virtue of a business combination that closed on November 25, 2020, stated in its proxy statement and prospectus that the warrants “will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination. QuantumScape subsequently asserted that the warrants could not be exercised until June 30, 2021, at the earliest.

&amp;#x200B;

*Their management is excellently qualified and highly respected in their field of expertise, with many years experience and strong motivation. At the minimum this is evident in their Co-Founder:*

· Mr. Jagdeep Singh is a Co-Founder of QuantumScape Corporation since May 2010 and has been its Chief Executive Officer and Director since May 2010 and serves as its Chairman since November 2020. Prior to that, Mr. Singh served as the President and General Manager of CIENA Corporation's Core Switching Division. He co-founded Infinera Corporation in 2001 and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from January 2001 to December 31, 2009. He was the Founder of OnFiber and served as its Chief Executive Officer. He was the Founder of Lightera Networks and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer. He served as the Chairman of Onfiber Communications Inc. He served as Chairman of Infinera Corporation from March 2001 to October 14, 2010 and Executive Chairman from January 2010 to October 2010. He serves as a Member of Policy Board at EsNet, Inc. He serves as a Member of the Advisory Council at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He serves as a Member of Advisory Board of RWI Ventures. He served as a Director of Infinera until October 2010. He served as a Director of CIENA. Mr. Singh holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.

* Over 50% of current shares are held by either insiders, institutions, public companies or Venture Capitalist Firms.
* Top 15 shareholders own 57.19% of the companies shares. Among the top 15 include the likes of:

1. Porsche automobil Holding, with 19.56% ownership,
2. Khosla Ventures LLC, with 9.76%,
3. Capricorn Investment LLC, with 6.71%
4. L. Doerr , with 5.59% and
5. Jagdeep Singh with 4.84%.

&amp;#x200B;

*Next, I filtered through a Google search, focusing on news involving QS or its shareholders. This is what I found:*

&amp;#x200B;

* NEW YORK, Jan. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz LLP**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxinmXVVLrJDxKXZ51kUy069jt6KYCVWfxv-xmrrVleGnnjI41ZIjHtVkE7V1tBU-F7u6qoBkkbZq2k4sxaA3WGwbEZTD6Y14D4iXLD4nmgqDb) announces that it has commenced an investigation of QuantumScape Corporation (“QuantumScape” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: QS) on behalf of investors concerning the Company’s possible violations of federal securities laws.

&amp;#x200B;

* On January 4, 2021, *Seeking Alpha* published an article pointing to several risks with QuantumScape’s solid state batteries that make it *“completely unacceptable for real world field electric vehicles.”* Specifically, it stated that the battery’s power means it “*will only last for 260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving.”* As solid state batteries are temperature sensitive, *“the power and cycle tests at 30 and 45 degrees above would have been significantly worse if run even a few degrees lower.”*

On this news, the Company’s stock price fell almost 40% during intraday trading on January 4, 2021.

Click here to learn more about the investigation: [http://ademilaw.com/case/quantumscape-corporation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3025642-1&amp;h=1038669832&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fademilaw.com%2Fcase%2Fquantumscape-corporation).

The investigation focuses on whether QuantumScape properly disclosed the significant limitations of its solid-state battery products in order to be acceptable for real world field electric vehicle performance. Specifically, according to a Seeking Alpha research report, QuantumScape's solid state battery products (i) last only for ""260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving"", (ii) have a daily range of only about ""75-100 miles at full capacity in winter temperature conditions"", (iii) will charge only to 5% in 15 minutes rather than 80% at 15 minutes in winter conditions, and (iv) will have an energy density lower than competitors.

**Also of interest, I found a Bloomberg Article outlining all the key points from above, with bullish outlook:**

[https://archive.vn/Thdc8](https://archive.vn/Thdc8)

For anyone willing to dive deep enough, I recommend having a look through their patent applications on Google Patents here: [https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1](https://patents.google.com/?assignee=Quantumscape&amp;oq=Quantumscape&amp;sort=new&amp;page=1)

Also, a quick Google Scholar search on solid-state lithium batteries, should be enough to satisfy the battery nerds out there. Some really great articles, and research on this stuff, showing huge potential.

I also highly recommend everyone interested, to watch the following. It is the investors presentation, released on 8th December, on Youtube. It contains more information on their actual breakthrough btteries than I have above.

Lastly, check out r/QuantumScape for even more dd if you desire.

&amp;#x200B;

My Tl;dr:

* Overall bullish, the tech, if all data and results are true representations, is extremely advanced. It will be the future.
* But production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest. There have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated, fabricated or whatever else usually follows success. Ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though.
* Management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy. They are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do.
* There are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so. And with a huge run up already after happening, it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks/months again, minimum.
* People are comparing it to Tesla already. There are also some competitors, some of them Chinese, some of them just other car companies, such as Toyota and GM. Also EV stocks in general are hot/are getting bad rep because of valuations.
* In terms of technical analysis, I predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months.
* Long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. That would be extremely bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, as a side note, I want to give a special mention to CBAT, another battery maker. All the hype surrounding EV's and Battery companies could cause CBAT to go on a huge bullish run. For reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here, with a current price of only \~$9. I am personally going long both.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS, as much as I enjoyed putting it together! I hope to see big things from them in the future.

personalfinance,Created under 18 savings account with parent. I am now 18 and she will not transfer it to my name. Any way to transfer without parent present?,"I created an under 18 savings account with my mother a few years ago, as well as a teen checking account for when I got my first job. I have recently turned 18, and I would like to have complete control of those accounts, mainly my savings account; however, my mom is quite toxic and has different ideas. She will not allow me to put the account only under my name. I believe it’s because she fears I have plans to move out soon (which I do, but that’s a different story), but I also want to have access to my money for different reasons. For example, I want to start paying off my federal student aid, and I want to be able to tell when I'm good to do so without asking to see her phone every time I want to check the account. I’m also sick of arguing about why she should transfer certain amounts of money from the savings account to my checking account and vice versa when it’s my money in the first place. Venting about issues with my current situation aside, is there any way for me to go to the bank and transfer the accounts to my name without her present?

Here is my current mortgage information. It started March 2016 with the home valued at $179,000. We paid 3% down, so the initial principal was $173,630. The current loan balance is $157,733. My current monthly payment (mortgage + escrow + PMI) is $1,324 with $158 of it being PMI. The PMI will drop off December 2024. It's a 30 year loan and my interest rate is 4.25%. The loan is through Cenlar.

I have no idea how accurate Zillow is, but it says my home is currently worth $237,000 - $262,000. I don't know if the value could have really gone up that much in only 4 years, but we did add solar panels in 2019 which should increase the value some. So if the value of the home has increased enough, I might be able to drop the PMI too if I get a new appraisal.

I really have no idea how mortgages work, what I should be looking at, or how the refinancing process works, but I keep seeing ads for loans at half the interest rate. It seems like now would be an excellent time to refinance if it would help me. Where do I start?",finance
Trading,QuantumScape Corporations DD!,"Greetings to all who read this,

today I am sharing some due-diligence I recently did on $QS. QS has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. They also entered the market as a SPAC and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. So this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. I hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!

&amp;#x200B;

**QUANTUMSCAPES DUE DILIGENCE (5th Jan)**

Intro to QS: "" QuantumScape Corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. It focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles. The company was founded by Jagdeep Singh, Tim Holme, and Fritz B. Prinz in May 2010 and is headquartered in San Jose, CA. ""

&amp;#x200B;

*First I checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. Here is what I found:*

· Rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th Jan)

· Trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)

* “QS Stock Risk:

This stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the Bollinger Band this stock is considered to be ""very high risk"". During the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. For the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.

Our recommended stop-loss: **We hold a sell evaluation for this stock. No stop-loss set.""**

· Volume has increased on the 4th (of January) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.

· Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.

&amp;#x200B;

*Next I checked Motley Fool (although I have no confidence in their analysis overall), to see what they had to say:*

· QuantumScape is several years from commercial production, and its current [market capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-is-market-cap/) is still over $18 billion. Investors who want to speculate on the potential of QuantumScape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market.

· Investors have jumped in, excited about the potential, but QuantumScape will soon have a lot more shares trading. The company updated an S-1 filing at end of December registering more than 300 million shares, with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

· More shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock. In this case it is existing holders, and not the company, selling shares, meaning QuantumScape would get no cash from the offering. But existing shares could feel some near-term downward pressure (which they have since mid-late December).

· We'll likely know when the registration becomes official (probably sometime January) when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares (likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) on the 4th). It's hard to read too much into options pricing, but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose $20 or more in the weeks to come.

· QuantumScape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its [reverse merger](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/why-kensington-capital-is-charging-higher-today/) with Kensington Acquisition Corp. in November.

· QuantumScape, in partnership with **Volkswagen**, expects to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt hour (GWh) pilot facility in 2021. If successful, QuantumScape will expand the project to a 20-GWh facility. To put this in perspective, consider that in mid-2018 Tesla reported that battery production of its Gigafactory in Nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 GWh.

· While management foresees the company reporting $275 million in revenue and $73 million in gross profit for 2026, QuantumScape estimates that the following year, the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Likewise, the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive [EBITDA](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx) \-- approximately $808 million.

·  Since 2012, Volkswagen has provided more than $300 million in funding to QuantumScape, making it the company's largest investor -- though it maintains a minority stake. In 2018, Volkswagen and QuantumScape formed a 50/50 joint venture, one of the goals of which is to produce solid-state batteries for Volkswagen's EVs on a mass scale.

· Thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility, QuantumScape envisions that Volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid-state batteries. But QuantumScape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full, stating that ""subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive OEMs to commercialize our technology.""

· While QuantumScape is singularly focused on developing its solid-state batteries for EVs, the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications, such as stationary storage, smartphones, and wearables. While the company may, in time, pursue the latter two markets, it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company's current focus; moreover, it's one that certainly represents a significant opportunity. According to Lux Research, the stationary storage market, which represented installations of 164 GWh in 2019, is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2035, when it will reach installations totaling 3,046 GWh.

· Apple has a [mountain of cash](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/cash-is-king/), and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology. QuantumScape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month. The solid-state technology charges to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes, has greater than a 300 mile range, has a long usage life, and is non-combustible.

· The company is notably backed by both **Volkswagen** ([OTC:VWAGY](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/volkswagen-aktiengesellschaft/vwagy/)) and Bill Gates. Whether investors are speculating about an Apple investment is anyone's guess. Moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with QuantumScape if they have to compete against an Apple EV.

&amp;#x200B;

*After this, I went to Simply Wall St. to get an overview of management and financials:*

## ·Shahmoon Keller PLLC Files Suit on Behalf of Holders of QuantumScape Corporation Warrants

· Shahmoon Keller PLLC announced that the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Manhattan has scheduled an injunction hearing for January 19, 2021 in a class action lawsuit on behalf of holders of warrants to purchase stock of QuantumScape Corporation. QuantumScape, the successor to Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. by virtue of a business combination that closed on November 25, 2020, stated in its proxy statement and prospectus that the warrants “will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of the Business Combination. QuantumScape subsequently asserted that the warrants could not be exercised until June 30, 2021, at the earliest.

&amp;#x200B;

*Their management is excellently qualified and highly respected in their field of expertise, with many years experience and strong motivation. At the minimum this is evident in their Co-Founder:*

· Mr. Jagdeep Singh is a Co-Founder of QuantumScape Corporation since May 2010 and has been its Chief Executive Officer and Director since May 2010 and serves as its Chairman since November 2020. Prior to that, Mr. Singh served as the President and General Manager of CIENA Corporation's Core Switching Division. He co-founded Infinera Corporation in 2001 and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from January 2001 to December 31, 2009. He was the Founder of OnFiber and served as its Chief Executive Officer. He was the Founder of Lightera Networks and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer. He served as the Chairman of Onfiber Communications Inc. He served as Chairman of Infinera Corporation from March 2001 to October 14, 2010 and Executive Chairman from January 2010 to October 2010. He serves as a Member of Policy Board at EsNet, Inc. He serves as a Member of the Advisory Council at Stanford Graduate School of Business. He serves as a Member of Advisory Board of RWI Ventures. He served as a Director of Infinera until October 2010. He served as a Director of CIENA. Mr. Singh holds an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley, and a BS in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.

* Over 50% of current shares are held by either insiders, institutions, public companies or Venture Capitalist Firms.
* Top 15 shareholders own 57.19% of the companies shares. Among the top 15 include the likes of:

1. Porsche automobil Holding, with 19.56% ownership,
2. Khosla Ventures LLC, with 9.76%,
3. Capricorn Investment LLC, with 6.71%
4. L. Doerr , with 5.59% and
5. Jagdeep Singh with 4.84%.

&amp;#x200B;

*Next, I filtered through a Google search, focusing on news involving QS or its shareholders. This is what I found:*

&amp;#x200B;

* NEW YORK, Jan. 04, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman &amp; Herz LLP**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7DcVPN4nJvLQkcksRpxinmXVVLrJDxKXZ51kUy069jt6KYCVWfxv-xmrrVleGnnjI41ZIjHtVkE7V1tBU-F7u6qoBkkbZq2k4sxaA3WGwbEZTD6Y14D4iXLD4nmgqDb) announces that it has commenced an investigation of QuantumScape Corporation (“QuantumScape” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: QS) on behalf of investors concerning the Company’s possible violations of federal securities laws.

&amp;#x200B;

* On January 4, 2021, *Seeking Alpha* published an article pointing to several risks with QuantumScape’s solid state batteries that make it *“completely unacceptable for real world field electric vehicles.”* Specifically, it stated that the battery’s power means it “*will only last for 260 cycles or about 75,000 miles of aggressive driving.”* As solid state batteries are temperature sensitive, *“the power and cycle tests at 30 and 45 degrees above would have been significantly worse if run even a few degrees lower.”*

On this news, the Company’s stock price fell almost 40% during intraday trading on January 4, 2021.

**Also of interest, I found a Bloomberg Article outlining all the key points from above, with bullish outlook:**

* In terms of technical analysis, I predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months.
* Long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. That would be extremely bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, as a side note, I want to give a special mention to CBAT, another battery maker. All the hype surrounding EV's and Battery companies could cause CBAT to go on a huge bullish run. For reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here, with a current price of only \~$9. I am personally going long both.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you have all enjoyed my dd on QS, as much as I enjoyed putting it together! I hope to see big things from them in the future.

personalfinance,Pay off debt or save for downpayment,"Currently, we have been  on a strict budget for the last two years or so while using the snowball method (avalanche specifically) to pay off our debt.  Together we have around $18k in debt across two credit cards and some tax debt.  We've been making overpayments on our highest interest debt and the tax debt is on a payment plan with a relatively low interest rate (I believe the IRS rate is around 5%) once the cards are paid off the plan is to lump off the tax debt in a few large payments.

I live in an area where rent is obscene compared to what a mortgage payment is and we really don't want to re-up for another year while we keep saving for a downpayment.

I know the conventional wisdom is to allocate everything to paying off debt so you aren't losing so much money to interest but we are considering diverting our resources into hyperspeeding a downpayment a la: bringing debt payments to minimums for a few months and then throwing everything at savings before switching back after we get a home purchased.

It just seems like a more financially sound option to get into a house ASAP vs continuing paying rent for another year or so.  I've owned a home before so I understand the whole financial complexity of owning a home vs renting not being THAT much of a boon but we are tremendously sick of apartment living and getting along with our lives together (both of us are post divorce and in our mid 30s and very anxious to start getting our lives back together).

Thoughts?

If the incoming Treasury Secretary's suggestion of the Fed directly buying corporate equity comes into place, what really is going to cause any sort of healthy correction?

I just don't see it happening, not until the Fed needs to limit Quantitive Easing and actually raise interest rates. The valuations are already really high, but truthfully, what is preventing them from going ever higher until interest rates finally increase (at the earliest 2-3 years from now)? Investors seem to have full appetite for equities no matter the fundamentals, so I'm just not seeing it. 

I'm strongly considering increasing leverage and buying LEAPs on the market as a whole. There seems to be no risk with the rate of Fed expansion and potential for direct equity buying by the Fed in the near future.

personalfinance,"Is having my money in a savings account while rates are low (currently at 0.5 %) making me lose money? Where, then, should I keep my money? New to finance..","For context (because I feel like this is a dumb question): I am a 19-year-old student that has a good amount of money accumulated working and saving for the last three or so years. I saw in a video from one of my favorite finance YouTubers that keeping my money in a savings account is a bad thing because if the interest rates aren't keeping up with inflation I am essentially losing the worth of my money. 

I mean based on my little knowledge of inflation it makes sense that keeping it just saved is reducing my money's value. What can I do instead then? 

I made it a goal this year to invest $1000 dollars into the markets through index funds and ETFs through an M1 brokerage account I created last week. I have it all set up I'm just nervous since the liquidity of my money is lowered.

personalfinance,Would it be reasonable to pay off my private student loan with these savings?,"I've got around 50K in students loans, 18K of which is private, the rest federal. All the interest rates are in the 5-6% range. I've got 32K in the bank, and am debating paying off the private loan (18K) as a lump sum. 

I make 58K salary, and annual expenses are a little under 30K, give or take a few larger purchases. 2021 will be my first year paying for my own medical insurance, and my federal loan payments will increase (graduated payment plan that increases every 2 years), and my roommate moved out so I might have an extra 6K or so in rent this year.

I think I'm safe to pay it off, and should have enough savings to be comfortable, but its a big chunk of change, so just want other thoughts or reassurance. Is there any reason I shouldn't? My math says if I pay it all off now I'll save around 3.2K in interest payments, which sounds nice.",finance

Bitcoin,Cryptocurrencies Broker Touts Exotic Bitcoin Bet to Squeeze Income From Crypto By Viren Vaghela and Yakob Peterseil,"‘Autocallable’ structured product offered to wealthy clients
Marex Spectron product limits Bitcoin’s upside and downside
As cryptocurrency pushes into mainstream finance and attracts billionaire tycoons, one U.K. brokerage is offering the merely wealthy a potentially safer way to play Bitcoin. The price: giving up any hope of the kind of stratospheric gains the digital coin is famous for.

London-based Marex Spectron Group Ltd. is selling a structured product known as an autocallable to people with at least $200,000 to invest, according to a term sheet. If the cryptocurrency stays relatively stable for awhile, Marex claims investors could reap an annualized return of as much as 70% via monthly coupons.

If Bitcoin keeps multiplying in value, autocallable investors don’t get to participate in that upside: they’ll just get their capital back early, plus their coupons. And if Bitcoin crashes again -- as it did three years ago -- investors would lose, but less than they would by trading Bitcoin directly.

“The idea that you want to sell out all the upside in order to get a coupon and 30% downside protection seems pretty unintuitive -- but these kind of structures in general are wildly popular,” said Benn Eifert, chief investment officer of hedge fund QVR Advisors. “I imagine they’ll find demand.”

Marex Solutions began marketing the autocallables this week, according to Nilesh Jethwa, who heads the division. Marex Spectron, which is active in the commodity and energy markets, is owned by JRJ Group, the private-equity firm of former Lehman Brothers bankers Jeremy Isaacs and Roger Nagioff.

“Bitcoin is becoming mainstream,” said Jethwa. The Marex product is reserved for professional investors and is being distributed via private banks and family offices.

The popular autocallable structure gained notoriety about two years ago when Natixis SA lost $200 million on the products in Korea after mismanaging the risks of equity market turmoil. Still, the products are a mainstay of the structured products universe, and attract retail investors, especially in Asia, who have large piles of savings and seek regular income.

Bitcoin rose as much as 12% on Thursday -- surpassing $40,000 and setting a record high. It has more than quadrupled in the past year, with prominent money managers like Guggenheim Investments’ Scott Minerd predicting the gains have just started.

That kind of return far exceeds what Marex’s autocallable can provide. But that’s a reasonable trade-off for the reduced downside, Jethwa said.

“We are transforming the risk from a speculative investment,” he said. “Investors can decide how much appetite they have for a crash and the yield they want.”

The development highlights how Bitcoin’s months-long rally is luring new investors far from its roots in the tech community, day-traders and people of an ideological bent that sought an alternative to conventional currency. Last year, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange started offering options contracts on Bitcoin futures.

Hedge funders like Alan Howard are becoming involved in an asset class that was once too fringe for the mainstream, betting that crypto is a gold-like hedge against pandemic-driven loose fiscal and monetary policy debasing fiat currencies.

The reason to own Bitcoin is because things like this can always go up a lot more than they can go down,” QVR’s Eifert said. “They’re quite unlikely to remain stable over any material period of time.”",cryptocurrency
investment,What I think are the best penny stocks to buy right now! (Post and if you want the video),"Hi everyone Today I’m going to cover 4 penny stocks that are: 9 meter biopharma, orchad therapeutics and Sundial growers. This penny stock cost respectively and have a very high potential to double or even triple their value in the short term and to do even more in the long term. For each penny stock I’m going to cover 4 point: first a very quick company overview, second big news and the next catalyst and if you want  price prediction and  at what price I think you should buy each stock, you should watch the video! [https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E](https://youtu.be/tB90Kkvdg0E)

The first stock is 9 meter biopharma or NMTR on Nasdaq. The company takes aim at unmet needs for gastrointestinal patients. The company develops drug and in general solution to treat short bowel syndrome and siliac disease, two conditions that are both dangerous and difficult to treat. The two major catalyst , about which I’m going to talk in a second are very promising but they will have some impact only in the second half of 2021, so in my opinion considering the huge impact that they will have in future this is the right time to buy. The catalyst is larazotide, that is the company flagship product, is in phase 3 development for threatment of siliac disease, that affects about 1% of the population, my girlfriend is affected by that and it’s so annoying,  yet there are no approved therapies. Top-line data from the study is expected in the second half of 2021 as I said beofre. Also the company has announced an agreement with the European biomedical research institute of salerno to investigate larazotide as a potential treatment for respiratory complications due to covid-19. Investor said that they modeled a 700m unadjusted sales and an upside potential from 400-1600% if the phase 3 readout will be positive 

The second stock is orchad therapeutics or ortx on Nasdaq. The company is engaged in the development of gene therapies for rare, frequently terminal, diseases, including neurometabolic disorders, primary immune deficiencies, and blood disorders. The gene therapy approach uses blood stem cells to deliver corrected genetic information directly into the patient’s body. The company has 12 drug candidate in development, two of which will possibly be approved as therapies in the next 12 months and if both of these succeed in approval, the stock will literally explode. One of this treatment, actually already received its approval for medical use in the EU so this year they should start they’re commercial execution that could also be starting in the US by 2022, as soon as they get the approval, that is already on it’s way. 

# The third stock is sesen bio or sens on nasdaq. It is a biopharmaceutical company that focusses on one product that is vicineum. It is a very innovative, already in phase 3 product that they hope will change the treatment landscape for patient with bladder cancer, that is the 6th most common cancer with 80k cases every year, and as they stated in their site, the annual cost for it it’s 4 billion. So this is a very innovative company in a 4 billion market that basically has no other competitors with this product. The company has submitted  Complete Biologics License Application to the FDA for Vicineum™ and Has Requested Priority Review, that should arrive in around 1 month. Once it does, the stock should be going u a lot. 

The last  stock is sundial or sndl on Nasdaq. It is a licensed producer of cannabis using indoor facilities. As they stated “Their growing approach, award-winning genetics and experienced master growers set them apart” and with 448 thousand square foot they’re one of the biggest producer. The bull case it’s pretty simple and many investor think that the catalyst is on the way. That’s because of the election of joe biden and with what is happening right now in Georgia, democrats will take control of the senate and the house of rapresentatives. If he does what he said during the campaign promise, federal marijuana reform will be part of it’s program and it’s now more possible than ever! Also the company announced in December that it’s now debt free, so this could possibly be the start of a bull.",finance
personalfinance,"With interest rates so low, does a 15 year mortgage make sense?","Been talking with a few places about refinancing my mortgage. Currently it's 4.25% and my total monthly payment is about $1300 (includes mortgage, PMI, taxes, and insurance). I am getting estimates for about 2.69% for a 30 year loan, dropping the PMI, and the total goes down to about $950 - $1,000ish. I also got a few estimates for 15 year loans, but the interest rate doesn't really drop significantly. Only to about 2.5%. With half as many payments, the monthly payment will be just slightly higher than it is now at a little under $1,400 a month and will save me about $68,000 in interest over the course of the loan.

However, if I took the ~ $450 dollars per month and invested it, would it earn more than $68,000 over a 15 year period? Online calculators seem to say no. Assuming a 6% annual growth, if I invested $450 a month for 15 years, it would be worth $131,500. If I subtract out the investment (450 x 12 x 15) then I would have earned $50,000 over the course of 15 years.

I don't quite understand why this is though. Is it because of how interest on a mortgage isn't linear and you pay less of it as time goes on?

Despite the 15 year mortgage potentially saving more over 15 years than what an investment might earn, would it still be better to invest, given than I can have easy access to the money? I don't need an emergency fund and I'm already contributing to retirement. Or... if I pay off the house in 15 years then I'll have more financial freedom with no debt. I hate debt. Or maybe somewhere in between. Take the 30 year mortgage and make extra payments. Can always stop making extra payments if needed.",finance

personalfinance,"Backdoor Roth IRA Question: Re-characterized in 2020, Converting in 2021","This is my first time doing backdoor Roth IRA. I looked online and in the subreddit history, but I want to make sure I’m doing it correctly.

The beginning of 2020 I contributed the max amount to Roth IRA, and didn’t realize I don’t qualify for max contribution until the the end of the year. I was able to re-characterize my contribution and gains by December 31, 2020. The total amount is around $7,200. 

I chatted with Schwab customer support, and they said my conversion to Roth will be coded for 2021 since I missed the 2020. I had a few questions about the process related to my situation, but I’m still not 100% positive after the chat. My questions are:

1. Will I be able to convert all the $7,200 to Roth IRA for 2021 if the $1,200 gains was from 2020? **** [Schwab: You may be able to. Use the roth IRA conversion calculator to calculate the amount I am allowed to convert]

2. Since the $7200 is from 2020, and I will be contributing to 2021, do I still withhold taxes in the conversion form? **** [Schwab: Refer to your tax advisor to ensure the amount (I don't have a tax advisor)]

3. Do I only fill out IRS form 8606 for 2021 (on April 2022), but not for 2020 (on April 2021) since I missed the 2020 deadline? **** [Schwab: You may not have to. Double check with your tax advisor]

So my understanding is the steps I should take is:

1. Fill out the conversion to Roth IRA. In the form, I should say that I want to convert the entire funds in the trad IRA ($7,200) and I want to withhold tax. I should put 10% for federal income tax and 1% for state income tax (California).

2. On April 2021, I need to pay taxes on the $1,200 gains. How do I report this? I do not submit any IRS form 8606.

3. On April 2022, I will submit IRS form 8606 for non-deductible contribution to trad IRA, and another form 8606 for the conversion to Roth IRA.

4. Assuming step 2 is correct: Since I will pay the taxes on the $1,200 gains on April 2021, I will not need to pay taxes on the additional $1,200 contribution on April 2022?",finance

defi,DeFi Lending - Making your crypto work harder,"I thought I'd create a post comparing some DeFi lending options.

We all know DeFi has been a hot topic of 2020, maybe THE hot topic, but is that it? Are we done with DeFi? Mmm, I don’t think so, we’ve barely started.

Remember the whole crypto space is still early. We’re barely past geek stage!

DeFi is definitely here to stay. The whole decentralised space is going to continue to balloon, and as early adopters we need to make bank off it. Yeah, come on, don’t be shy, sure we love the tech, be we want to make MONEY (spoken like Ryan Gosling in The Big Short).

Part of your strategy should be how you grow your crypto collateral, not just buying crypto and waiting for it to increase in value, but using it to earn you more.

Enter stage left, DeFi lending. Decentralisation allows us to be our own banks. Already we have options to make it happen, and here are four different lending options currently available. Enter Aave, Compound, Celsius and Yield.

Alongside crypto purchases, staking, geysers and more, lending out your crypto is a profitable way to increase your wealth. Here is a brief run down comparing them side by side.

**Aave.** [aave.com](https://aave.com)

A decentralised money market platform where lenders post collateral on the platform, allowing them to lend in the form of an aToken like Compound and their cToken, however the aToken is pegged 1:1 to the collateralised asset allowing it to be used as if it were the deposited collateral. The lender then accrues interest tied to their deposits. Two interests rates are offered, stable or variable offering more or less volatility depending on the lender’s risk tolerance and lenders can switch between the two. They also offer flash loans using pooled funds without collateral.

Whilst on the other side the borrower posts collateral by purchasing DAI. The borrower can then borrow in ETH. This allows the borrower exposure to a diverse range of cryptos without the need to own them outright.

**Compound.** [compound.finance](https://compound.finance)

The original money market platform. Compound allows you to deposit your crypto to earn interest. They launched to a frenzy. Users rushed to deposit and earn. In return users would receive COMP for participating in the Compound ecosystem, both lenders and borrowers.

Lenders deposit assets in pools, and then receive cTokens to represent the underlying asset. Interest is based on the demand for the asset, the greater the demand. the more interest they earn, incentivising lenders to add to the pools.

Borrowers draw from the pooled funds but as the pool grows and interest increases, borrowers are deterred from over stretching themselves.

**Celsius.** [celsius.network](https://celsius.network)

Is basically a middleman. Lenders deposit crypto, which Celsius then distributes to borrowers. The lender is then paid interest on their collateral set by Celsius (minus they’re cut). Lenders and Borrowers can earn greater interest if CEL tokens are purchased.

**Yield.** [yield.credit](https://yield.credit)

DeFi lending with fixed guaranteed interest rates. Lending and borrowing on the platform is individualised, not pooled. Lenders earn guaranteed rates of interest, no longer having to worry about market dynamics causing the rates to trend to \~0%, while borrowers that maintain loans and repay on time earn YLD, the token native to the platform.

Now let’s look at some pros/cons of each platform:

**Aave.**

ProsExtensive collateral optionsInnovative DeFi products

ConsRates are dynamic and typically trend towards \~0%More complex platform to understand

**Compound.**

**ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (BATS: ARKG) -** Invests in companies advancing genomics. The companies held in ARKG may develop, produce or enable: CRISPR, Targeted Therapeutics, Bioinformatics, Molecular Diagnostics, Stem Cells, Agricultural Biology.

* Innovative industry. Since 2003 the cost to sequence a human genome has dropped from nearly $3bn to less than $1,000. ARK believes that as costs continue to drop, genomic sequencing will become a standard of care in oncology. It will introduce more science into  healthcare decision making, enable personalized medicine, and accelerate drug discovery. ARK estimates that genomic sequencing revenues will grow 43% at an annual rate, from $3.5bn last year to $21bn in 2024.
* Cathie Wood. She’s a beast stock picker. Out of all the  ETFs she runs, her closest competitor trailed by 60%. Her worst ETF still  doubled investors' money. Her strategy is to make investments into companies that she considers incredibly transformational and she has seen success doing it.

**CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) -** Cybersecurity technology company that provides endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyber attack response services. 

* Best in class technology. Remember about a week ago a bunch of Russian hackers breached SolarWinds? The same hackers also tried to hack CrowdSrike at the same time but were unsuccessful. I’ve wandered on to a bunch of cybersecurity forums, and the general consensus is CrowdStrike has developed the best cybersecurity solution by miles. CRWD is the undisputed leader in cybersecurity. 
* “Pick-and-shovel” investment into the world’s increasing digitization. Even in the absence of COVID, cybersecurity remains a key component of the world’s increasing digitization as cyberthreats have been an ongoing issue from the onset of the internet. In the last decade we have seen a bunch of hacks where companies have exposed sensitive customer information. It seems companies are just starting to realize the importance of cybersecurity.

**Disney (NYSE: DIS) -** Worldwide entertainment company that you all are probably familiar with.

* Reopening trade. In 2019, parks generated 45% of total operating income for DIS. Full reopening and attendance in parks will be slow, but certainly benefit DIS when it happens. The company has been executing on several other segments in the meantime (i.e. streaming). It has proved competitive, increasing the margin of safety if parks take longer to reopen.
* Fast-growing streaming division. DIS has proved agile as it successfully launched a streaming service, Disney+, that has already gained 86mn+ subscribers which was the company’s original 5 year target. This is promising as it shows management can adapt to rapidly changing technology trends.

**Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) -** Designs and manufactures software-driven home energy solutions that span solar generation, home energy storage and web-based monitoring and control.

* Shift to clean energy; ENPH emerging as market leader. Going into 2021, sentiments towards solar have been at an all time high. This trend is expected to continue, especially after the Georgia run-off results. Solar firms are expected to benefit from extended tax incentives on both the consumer and producer ends.
* Technological advantage. ENPH has developed the industry leading solution and is rapidly taking market share from its primary competitor, SolarEdge. Pricing reflects this, but it's expected to continue. Among key competitors, Enphase has been one of the lowest cost producers. Its low-cost structure is a major contributing factor to its improving margins.

**Evolution Gaming Group (OTC: EVVTY) -** Swedish company that develops, produces, markets and licenses integrated B2B live casino solutions for gaming operators. 

* Early mover advantage. Evolution’s lack of competition enables it to rapidly grow in new markets and create a loyal customer base, with high switching costs. The company has effectively grown EBITA margins from 41.6% in 1Q18 to 64.8% in 3Q20. Margin expansion is expected to continue.
* Massive untapped markets. Europe is estimated to be around $2.5bn (EVVTY has 50% market share), Asian market is \~15x the size of Europe (150% YoY growth for EVVTY in Asia). North America’s market is \~$210mn, a 42% increase YoY, with NJ and PA the only states currently operating (NY looks promising). Management thinks the US will be the largest in the long-term. 
* Undetected from Wall Street. Evolution has almost no analyst coverage in the US and very minimal coverage in Europe, presenting opportunity for additional growth as institutional money managers recognize this opportunity and draw attention to the stock. Additionally, Evolution has a founder-led management team that is highly aligned with shareholders (mgmt owns over 30% of the stock).

**Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) -** Enables people to connect through devices. It’s products include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus. 

* Zuck. It’s not a question of who is the next Jobs/Bezos/Gates/Zuck, because Zuck is super young. He has a history of being able to execute: IG acquisition / transition from desktop to mobile /  denying multiple acquisition opportunities in his twenties. 
* Undervalued. FB is the cheapest among the FAANG stocks, yet has some of the highest growth rates. This is mainly because of its continuous political scandals. With Trump out of office, I think FB has a chance to stay out of trouble and start to realize higher multiples.  The antitrust lawsuit is not a threat imo, it is actually an opportunity. If the govt forces FB to break up, we would get shares in the spin-offs, which would be valued at a higher multiple than FB. For example, if Instagram spun off from FB and traded at the same multiple as SNAP, Instagram’s market cap would be larger than FB’s.

**Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) -** Provides residential real estate brokerage services. 

* Digitization of Real Estate (i.e. “iBuying”). Technology in RE is moving from being informational to transactional. Redfin’s iBuying service is dubbed “RedfinNow.” The service basically buys homes from sellers looking for a quick and convenient sale (close deals within 10-30 days). This segment isn’t profitable yet as it is just getting started, but promising as the management adapts to technology trends.
* Inter-US Migration and housing outlook. People are moving out of the cities because of COVID / trying to avoid taxes / etc. which increases demand for Redfin’s services. With interest rates extremely low (and no expectation for them to increase), homebuying demand should continue to grow.
* RDFN most attractively valued compared to Z and OPEN, with the most upside potential given its market cap \~$7bn. Some are predicting RDFN might start offering rental services as well. RDFN has the best LT margin potential. 

**Teladoc Health (NYSE: TDOC) -** Provides virtual healthcare services on a B2B basis to its clients and provides services to consumers directly and through channel partners.

* Competitive positioning in industry ripe for disruption. Healthcare is a huge market yet to be significantly disrupted. COVID has accelerated this disruption. Providers who were once opposed to telemedicine now realize its benefits and several regulatory changes are promising for telemedicines growth potential. Medicare and other government-sponsored coverage is expected to include telemedicine benefits, increasing TDOC’s TAM.
* Livongo acquisition. From the consumer POV, this will increase access to healthcare at a lower cost. Teladoc will have access to a larger amount of data it can interpret to refine its services and monetization strategies. 

**Sea Ltd (NYSE: SE) -** Digital entertainment, electronic commerce, and digital financial services. The Company operates three business segments: Garena, Shopee, and SeaMonkey. The Company’s digital entertainment business, Garena, is a global game developer and publisher with a presence in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Latin America. Garena provides access to mobile and personal computer online games. Shopee provides users with a shopping environment that is supported by integrated payment, logistics, fulfillment, and other value-added services. SeaMonkey business is a digital financial services provider. SeaMonkey offers e-wallet services, payment processing, credit related digital financial offerings, and other financial products. 

* Diversified consumer internet company with market-leading position. Sea caters to Southeast Asia and Taiwan, providing its online gaming, e-commerce, and payment platforms. Shopee has overtaken competitors, it is widening its market share lead. ESports is a rapidly growing market (15.7% YoY to $1.1bn in 2020) and Sea is outpacing market growth.
* Pay for quality. The best companies keep going up for years in a row, and I think Sea is in the early stages of being classified as such a company. It’s worth $100bn but has effectively proved its ability to identify opportunities and expand business lines. 
* Still early stages of developing its consumer banking business, so we get the security of a bigger, established company with upside for an additional, lucrative business line such as fintech.

**Waste Connections Inc. (NYSE: WCN) -** Waste services company that provides non-hazardous waste collection, transfer, disposal and recycling services. 

* Recession resilient; re-opening trade. The waste management industry is recession resilient, it will always be around. 
* Non-hazardous waste collection. With a progressive government likely to push climate initiatives, recycling and non-hazardous waste collection are likely to benefit on the back end.
* WCN has a large moat; there isn’t much of a competitive threat the way the industry operates. Management’s strategy is to generally only spend what FCF is available. This enables the company to make acquisitions while handling its debt load. Great for stable growth.

gaming,Too much games and gaming,"Gaming used to be fun since I was a kid playing NES in the early 90's. Let's skip the part where I had few games to enjoy as kid. We all had that.

In my early 20's I had the time of my life partying and forgot playing until 2011 I got a PS3 and HUGE 42"" tv (back then it was so big and I was living in a single room apartment or is it studio apartment in English, I'm a bit confused by it, so freely correct me on that one).

At first it was fun and started collecting trophies. It felt good. I guess it was that feel of accomplishment which I didn't have in my real life. It got to a point maybe in 2015 that I got fed up with trophies because of Far Cry 2. Messed up a hit mission and didn't know about it. I literally got burnt out. I wanted to collect all those trophies when I started a game (Oh, forgot to tell you, I started to collect video games at some point. Not horde but games I wanted to play and still got them and trying to go through them if I like them or not.). Then and there, I got so angry and I was agitated all the time because of trophies, and also Anime (wanted to watch them all, I removed them all and never looked back. It was a huge relief. I don't remember when this happened but I guess before quitting collecting trophies).I picked PS3 game that didn't have trophies and that was a huge relief. After that I turned the notifications off. They just just ruin immersion if you play that sort of games and also so that I don't get hooked again. That is when I realized that I don't remember why I play video games.

I build my new computer in late 2015. In August 2017 I got into Humble Bundle. Got Humble Monthly then and occasionally bought bundles too and now I have accumulated around 1200+ games and also in GOG I have +400.

All that time from 2011 to today I've been unemployed and I have a 1,5 year old son. Before him I had nothing else and nothing else mattered. But now I'm addicted to the amount of games I have. I have this addiction to try them all out.

All this wall of text I ask: Do you have or have had this kind of addiction and is the only way out to just quit? And also, do you have doubts sometime why you play video games? I play so many games that I forgot why I like them. Any suggestions on how to figure it out?

Thank you for reading. I don't have an actual cookie for you, but I wish a better year that was the last year. It was a crappy one.

personalfinance,How can I (and should I) move out with no college degree or money saved,"Im about to turn 20. I dropped out of college on my first semester because of mental health and havent gone back since. Ive always had problems with being my own person and being around my family now has made he so apathetic and aloof. My life has become completely stagnant. I do nothing, have no money, and hate my situation. I feel like everyone in my family tries to keep me naive to use me as their sidekick (im the youngest.) My dad recently cut me off from my money, isnt paying for my college, and is trying to drag me into the family business. My home is a pretty toxic environment and it feels impossible to sort my shit out here with all the pressures from everyone in my family wanting me to be a certain way. 

So I want to move out. I’m thinking of working at fedex (they pay $18 an hour) until I have enough saved to move. Then I can move out, save for a trade school, then hopefully get a better job in a trade and save for college. But I’m worried of getting sucked into a job and not having enough time for trade school or college or doing anything else. So, how will I go about this? I have $10,000 in college savings to spend on school. Would it be better to just save for college and not learn a trade? Will I be too busy to study? How could I find a roommate? Is there anything i’m missing that could be a big problem. Is there any added problems with moving to a different state? And will I be throwing away my 20s?

personalfinance,"Small(ish) Windfall, Student Loans, and a Small House in a HCOL","I have read through the wiki on windfalls and I've read many, many articles about getting rid of higher interest debt first, but I think my situation is kind of an in-betweener and I'd love some of your thoughts and advice if you have a moment.  

The Basics:

I owe about 65K in student loans (at some stupid high interest rate 6.something%).  I have been paying them through IBR for 7ish years now.  I do work in a public interest job and theoretically I should be eligible for some (I think around half maybe) of those loans to be forgiven if I stay in my job for another 3 years.  

Due to the pandemic, I haven't had to pay anything on those loans for most of a year now, and it seems plausible to think that some additional student aid relief may be coming.  

My SO's parents recently gifted us a really generous amount of money (about 40K) that is theoretically for a home improvement project down the road - but the gift isn't tied to a specific use.  

I guess my questions are: 

1) Does it make sense to take some of that money and max out our IRA's for this year and next year and then invest the rest in a Vanguard fund?  The house project is probably years away and I think it makes sense to put that money into an IRA first and then if/when we need it, take it out of a non-advantaged account.  Does that make sense?

2) I'm sure there is a smarter approach to my student loans, but I'm really not sure what it is.  Through a combination of generosity, good timing, and savings, we've accumulated a decent nest egg (I think) and the idea of using a big chunk of it to wipe out a debt that may have some relief coming is hard to swallow.  

Other possibly relevant data:

I have a very stable (though deeply unenjoyable) job that doesn't pay a lot for the area (60K or so).  I will get a pension eventually.  

My SO also had a job that contributed another 25-35K a year, but they recently quit to stay home with our 2 kids during the pandemic (and has plans to continue to stay home for the foreseeable future).  

My SO and I (mid-30's) own a small house in a HCOL city (mortgage about 385K; equity about 300K - 3.375%).  I would love to refi this again - but now that we're down to 1 income, I'm not sure we'll qualify.

At our current rate of debt/income, we are losing a bit of money every month, but we have enough savings and investments that it feels manageable at this point.  

Investments: 290K (mostly Vanguard funds, we each have a Roth IRA included in that)

We have a 6ish month liquid emergency fund and we own two cars outright

We have a 8K loan for a home improvement project at 0% (special rate for first 4 years) for 3 more years (about 350 a month)

Our kids have 529 plans and we put some money into those monthly.

Any advice you have would be super appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Help with tackling debt (CA),"I'm well over 100K in debt and I'd like advice on how to tackle this thing since I'm not sure I'll ever be debt-free. I've tried the snowball method, but life happens and I can never get out of the loop.

Here's a break down of my debt:

Federal student loans: 88,000 (no interest - usually 2-6% - and no payments right now)

Private student loan: 16,000 (6%, monthly payment 130, last payment in 2038)

Car loan 1: 5389 (6.5%, $207 per month)

Car loan 2: 5916 (2.4%, 242/month)

Personal loan through credit union: 8882 (7.8%, 253/month)

No credit card debt (right now at least, but usually all my funds go to pay these off)

&amp;#x200B;

I make 85,000 annually before taxed as a school administrator in a high school, and I'm expected to have a 4% raise each year and I'm contributing to my retirement this way. I plan to stay in this profession and I'm hoping PSLF will help take care of my federal loans. My partner is a blue collar working with no degree or trade skills, so his jobs have mostly been stocking before the pandemic. He's also physically limited, but does not qualify for disability, so once he begins work after COVID, he will probably bring in around 40K before taxes per year.

I'd really, reallllly like to start saving for a house, investing, or looking at additonal retirement options, but I'm not sure if I can even think about those things until my debt is at least reduced to my federal student loans. My monthly income is about 4,500 and after bills I usually have about $1000 to spend on food, emergencies, etc. Currently have 2000 in savings. FYI I live in the Bay Area, so life ain't cheap.

Where should I put my extra money into? How can I start tackling my debt and mocing towards financial independence? Any advice is much appreciated, and I know I've made some mistakes with money but I'm trying to get it all together.

Based on how much I spent on previous months, I average about 2900 is expenses (gas, food, emergencies, entertainment, take out etc). I know I am spending way beyond my means but here we are, I'm trying to limit my expenses outside my bills to be 1000 so that I can put 500 towards debt payments.

Given these circumstances, is there any way to reduce my federal withholding for 2021 so that I’ll get a smaller refund?

personalfinance,"Just bought car, should I refinance?","I purchased a car in November that was \~$22,500 out the door.  I put $7,000 down, so the loan amount was for \~$15,500.  The loan started at the end of November, first payment was due at the beginning of January, so about a week ago.

Term: 60 months

Interest rate: 2.89%

Monthly payment: $278.48

I've put $840 toward it so far, and the amount showing left is $14,750. My credit score is 751, in case that's important.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the scenario is that when I bought the car they offered something like $1500 for me to trade in my then-current car. I knew I could get quite a bit more out of it than that so I said no, but I signed the loan for the new car that day.  A few weeks later I sold my old car for $4000.

Used $1500 of that for other stuff, put $2500 in my HYSA to use to help pay off this car, and have so far put $500 of that $2500 toward the car loan.  So now I have $2000 sitting in my HYSA and I'm trying to decide what to do with it.

Option #1: Put the $2000 toward the loan now, surely save on some interest

Option #2: Go to the bank with that $2000, use it to refinance the loan and lower my monthly payments.

&amp;#x200B;

I should mention that my main goal here is to lower the monthly payment, with saving on interest being a secondary goal (unless one of the options is substantially less in interest). I just don't know enough about loans, much less refinancing, to know if that is a good option or how much my payment would be lowered. My main thought is just that if worse comes to worse and I lose my job or something, I'd feel much more comfortable with a smaller monthly payment.

As my loan stands right now, I'm planning on at least paying double each month.  If I refinance and lower my monthly payment, **I'd still plan on paying the same dollar amount that I am right now (\~$560).**

dogecoin,Why Dogecoin is a Great Investment,"This is a real beginner's post, as I'm a beginner speaking to fellow beginners:

I've seen some questioning of the great Shiba on this here subreddit over the last few days, so I just want to come out and say it:

My retirement will be invested in Dogecoin.

Why?

Even though crypto is a 'currency', it's more like a product. It has cost of production, supply, and demand.  Fiat currencies do not necessarily follow these rules, as the USD definitely has unlimited supply (federal reserve \*loaning\* the money for these new stimulus checks), demand is government-mandated, and the ratio of value to cost of production is way out-of-whack (a penny costs $0.0199 to make, a dollar costs $0.045).

You've heard it before: ""ThE oNlY rEaSoN a DoLlAr Is wOrTh AnYtHiNg Is BeCaUsE pEoPlE bElIeVe In It!""

The same is true for stocks. This week I made $120 on QuantumScape, a company that won't produce a product for another 5 years- others lost a lot. You can't tell me they earned their multi-billon dollar valuation. The market is crazy- it'll probably grow, but it's really not a lot of growth for the risk.

So you can go find a bunch of articles that all say that, but let's agree: Bitcoin sucks. It's expensive, hard to mine, no fun, and a bunch of no-fun old people are ruining it for the rest of us. It's $38,000 right now. Why?

Two reasons (and you can find this elsewhere as well):

1. People think it's worth something
2. cost to produce.

If you look up bitcoin miners at current price, you'll find they make a decent profit per year, but at a lower bitcoin price, many could actually LOSE money vs the electrical costs to run them. Tie this in with the cost to acquire a bitcoin miner (+maintenance/upgrade fund), and you could either find yourself making either a slim profit or none at all. While bitcoin is valuable, everyone wants to mine it. When it's not worth as much, not as many people want to mine it. This helps it maintain value, as miners need to make a profit. Supply shouldn't exceed demand, and demand can easily exceed supply. In short: Crypto is cool! What happens when there's nothing, to mine, though?

I'm not going to get too far into mining (because many of us are robinhood investors) but in short the number of bitcoin entering the market is decreasing slowly, halving every 4 years until it eventually hits 0 bitcoin joining the market around 2040. There's a lot of theories about what happens when it hits zero, but there's a pretty good guess around town: things are gonna get BONKERS.

It'll basically be pulling one of the sources for value out from under bitcoin (and every other crypto that halves to zero), so bitcoin will be worth whatever people say its worth (probably a 100k+ at this rate), but that's going to fluctuate, and probably immediately drop. Everyone who'd been mining bitcoin and holding it will sell off to pay off the cost of their equipment and cash in on value. They might move to other currencies- but things are certainly bonkers.

So what makes Doge great?

1. Doge will never hit 0 new coins, so miners never leave
2. Ridiculously popular
3. Currently dirt cheap

Let's start with 1: Doge will never hit 0. Doge is currently adding 5,000,000,000 new coins per year, which is ludicrous, but it will never hit 0! At the end of its halving, Doge will be adding 10k new coins per year, enough to keep miners invested, especially if the price rises (Doge's price would HAVE to rise for the end to be met). Since miners can always make more doge, when it hits the end of its halving (which it will)

We'll smash the last two at once: Doge is ridulously popular and deservedly cheap. Doge is easily the most popular altcoin, and is the most accessible coin on many platforms (including robinhood). Our community is huge and ever-growing. Everyone on TikTok and Twitter love Doge, from Pornstars to Doge god ELON (who is now the richest man in the world). With Mr. Tesla (#1!) on our team, and cultlike popularity that has become shockingly widespread, doge is able to remain stable at $0.01 despite pumping out 5bil coins per year! That's INSANE! Doge is VIRAL with Gen z- who are all investing with the pocket change they get from their parents or their after-school job at Walmart! Soon, these young whippersnappers will be Doctors, Lawyers, Business(wo)men, and cryptominers... all with bigger wallets to dump into doge! While the number of doge is increasing, the number of available doge will probably decrease, as many of us (and there are a LOT  of us) are HODLING. Because of this, demand will increase. Doge is currently at $0.01, and this is just the very beginning. There's a lot of room to grow before bitcoin's demise in 2040. If Doge breaks $1 by 2040, the sky will be the limit as miners leave bitcoin to mine a coin that will never end.

If you invest $100 at $0.01 per Doge and it even hits $0.03, you've earned $200. Imagine if it hits $0.50 by 2040, your $100 will be $5,000.

I know what you're thinking, ""what if it drops to zero?"" It won't, here's why:

1. computers aren't going anywhere
2. if everyone at once thought doge and computers are worthless, it's the apocalypse. I don't think your Benjamins will work either.

IF Doge where to drop to zero, it will be a ""throw on your leather and eat your neighbor"" type of world. We're entering the 'real' space age, the computer age, and so much more. 2040 is going to look way different than the world currently does, so let's just accept it: crypto is going to grow! $1 is a real goal for Doge! I know I'm going to be here

Plus, if the cost of electricity goes up, either the cost per doge will increase, or people will stop mining as much! That's a win in the era of sustainability!

I'm trying to bring you back to 2016. When something that started off as a joke becomes wildly popular, it stops being a joke.

Idk I threw all my money in Doge and made this to convince myself that it in itself is infact a brilliant idea. Someone please point out the problems in my statement and help me make rational decisions.",cryptocurrency

First time posting but I've been learning for a few weeks. I make 62k a year and I'm wondering what the best way to go about saving a down payment on a condo. I currently am renting and have no immediate need for it, so I was thinking of the best way of saving for a down payment.  


I just started maxing out my Roth IRA through Schwab with the 2060 Target Date Index Fund (.08 ER) and contribute 275/month to my Roth 401k (best option there was the Vanguard 2060 target date fund with .15 ER). The options I'm looking for saving for a house are:  


A. Keep investing 15% of my income (500/month into roth ira and 275 into work 401k) as well as maxing HSA at 300 a month. Use all extra money to save for a 20% down payment on a condo within 4 years, then use all excess money to aggressively pay it off within 8-9 years, being done around 37-38. Then fully max out HSA/Roth IRA/401k.  


B. Pausing all Investments to save for a 20% down payment on a 200k condo in Phoenix within 2 years, then start contributing to roth ira/401k again and use all remaining money to pay off the condo within 7, have zero debt by 34 at the worst and then fully max roth ira/401k and hsa.  


C. My friend suggested that I keep doing 15% into retirement and then invest all excess cash into a total market fund (swtsx at Schwab) for 8-10 years and then use the funds to outright buy the condo and never be in debt.  


D. Same plan as option A but instead take a 30 year mortgage and use the extra money towards maxing HSA/401k/Roth IRA and any extra into a taxable account.  


E. Rent forever, never buy a home and invest all leftover money after retirement funding.

In normal times, I would consider this investment a low risk tax advantaged vehicle which we as a family of two with limited tax writeoffs consider valuable to our investment goals with a combined income in the 24% marginal tax bracket. Should I be considering this fund to be higher risk now given the environment of falling interest rates and state budgets being strained due to covid-19? Massachusetts is a well governed state that is setup to weather the storm of covid-19, but of course there is always the risk of default like with any other investment.  It just seems a bit too good to be true that this fund continues to pay such a high yield, while its price has climbed significantly as rates have fallen.  First question is - any theories as to why this fund has remained resillient in terms of yield and fund valuation? Second, should I be considering this asset a morre risky asset than it otherwise would be  outside the current situation that we are in?  Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,My parents want to buy a house in my name,"I'm currently a graduate student and I'll be in this city for the foreseeable future (6 years at least). My parents floated the idea of buying a house for me because interest rates are extremely low and they want to pass something down to me. They offered to pay for all expenses but they want everything in my name.

I've done enough research on house buying that I think I have an okay idea of the process so far, if I were to buy it myself. I haven't contacted any banks about loans yet as I wanted some input from others before I got really serious about it. My credit score is decent, but I don't make nearly enough to be seriously considered for a loan on my own, especially considering I already have pretty sizeable debt from school loans and that houses in this area are pretty expensive.

I would greatly appreciate any inputs, tips, advice, or resources on the best way to do this.

personalfinance,College student wanting to start investing long term in the S&amp;P 500,"I’ve heard everywhere that it is best to start investing as soon as possible, I am 19, in college, and willing to start investing, but I am scared of making a stupid mistake due to my limited knowledge of investing and the stock market. I’ve never invested anything before. 

I saw this video on youtube by Matt D’Avella where he talked about how if you were to put $10,000 into a 401k account with an annual interest rate of 10% that would compound to over 1 million dollars after 50 years. I saw that video a long time ago and that idea has really stuck with me, but the thing is I don’t know that much about investing. I am interesting in the s&amp;p 500 index fund, it seems like the best option to invest in from what I have heard. I don’t have $10,000 extra right now, so I was thinking of doing something similar to this but instead putting $4,000 as my initial investment and then adding $50 every month with a 10% interest rate (although I am a bit concerned because 10% is a super high rate).

I’ve heard that index funds are the best for people in this type of situation, but even so I am still a bit unsure. I would like to do more research on how to invest, but I don’t really have the time to be reading long books and spend extensive hours researching, everything I do know about investing is from investors like Graham Stephan on youtube.  
So basically does this sound like a good idea? Should I speak to a financial advisor about this? Should I first start off by experimenting by invest small amounts of money and seeing what happens?   
Also I was considering opening an account with fidelity because they have low rate and it’s the most user friendly, but I’ve heard that vanguard is better for long term investors, what would you recommend for someone like me?

I would like to do other, not as long term, investments in the future once I am out of college, but for now this the only one that I can afford to do until I actually start working full time.",finance

My current mortgage is $1,012 a month. But they offered me two options;


“1st option same term 29 years 1 months

New monthly payment $926.90 included taxes and insurance
Monthly savings $85.59

Interest savings $ 23,682

The only charge which is rolled into the loan balance $1021.00 which is not paid at closing is rolled into the balance of the loan.”






Would it be smarter to go with option two? Seeing as it’s a lower monthly. Or option one because I’d have only a 29 year term as opposed to a 30.

stocks,Stock Market News for Today | TSLA vs FB | LMND SPIKES | APPLE CAR &amp; other stock market news [01-08],"**Stocks finish at all-time highs as Tesla passes Facebook in market value. Lemonade rises by more than 20% again while reports continue to come in on the Apple Car. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a big rally in the stock market after the [Biden](https://ibb.co/QpPkkvg) confirmation and Trump called for a smooth transition with the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sw8bKdb) recovering the previous day losses and closing at over 13K. We also saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/MnjT8BH) gaining almost 1.5% and finishing over 3800 while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/ykPckZD) also posted a gain of over 200 points to close at just over 31k with all 3 of the big indexes finishing at new records. This broad rally pushed the [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MY0P1w) down, as the volatility index finished the day lower by more than 10% as 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/nmc7x8X) finished in the Green with Technology leading the way up 2.7%, while Utilities was the biggest laggard dropping by 1.3%.

Growth companies largely outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/XpHGdhb) with both small and large cap growth companies posting big gains across the board, while value plays lagged behind, as 2/3 of the companies were advancing [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/NLLMyLY) with over 300 new highs on average volume.

So, let’ take a look at the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ys6zg6M) from yesterday, as big tech companies flourished with the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Nvidia, Tesla and many more posting gains at least 2%, while most of the losses were concentrated in the Chinese stocks that are being delisted and the more value heavy utilities sector.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/10gRPgn), which saw a worrying move in the stock market, as bullish investors surpassed 50% of the total investors and is near the 1-year high from November. Most of this move to the bullish side came from neutral investors, which are way below the historical [average](https://ibb.co/XbyKxjB), which probably decided to get back in the market, rushing in the clean energy sector, the industrials and many others after the Democrats swept the Georgia election. I remind you that I usually use this survey as a contrarian indicator, when sentiment moves to this much greed in the market, I usually don’t like to add to my positions, as I await to buy stocks on red days.

We also received some economic data yesterday, as we saw December’s homes for [SALE](https://ibb.co/7Y3njz3) fall to an all-time low, below 700K as the housing market keeps on booming, with homes selling faster by about 2 weeks compared to last year while the national inventory dropped by almost 40% since last year, as the median listing price was $340K, up over 13% since 2019.

[Today](https://ibb.co/t4bS0wH) is a quieter economic day, with the biggest number coming in the early morning as we wait to see the non-farm payrolls.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Nikola](https://ibb.co/DLP8f1P) joining the broad rally in the EV [STOCKS](https://ibb.co/mJgVqwr) yesterday which pushed almost every single stock higher, while we also saw a report from JP Morgan on some possible good developments on their trucks. I don’t believe in this company, it’s bad history, bad management and reputation will hurt it in the long even if they manage to develop a decent product, which is still to be seen, as they haven’t really brought anything innovative to the market.

One other stock that rose yesterday was [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/FbZZ5Lz), as the stock spiked more than 27% yesterday, after the company was pitched by the Motley Fool yet again. I really like this company, and I think it has major disruption potential in the insurance world, so I agree with this report. The stock did suffer a slight pullback about a week ago after a report from The Friendly Bear but I don’t believe it will have a long-lasting effect, as I believe this stock has great growth potential.

[Apple](https://ibb.co/Xzscpk6) also seems to be confirming the previous reports and is in talks with Hyundai about a development of a self-driving EV, as we heard something about this from Hyundai before some confusion made them kind of back out of the previous statement. This report is pretty much as anticipated, as Apple would probably be looking to either collaborate on manufacturing with a traditional car manufacturer or actually just acquiring pretty much any one of them.

We also saw [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/vZ1v7yw) regain some momentum yesterday, rising by more than 13% despite the expiration period of another 38M shares. The latest IPOs and small-cap stocks have recently been able to raise a lot of capital as investors seem to be grabbing any share available at almost any price regarding valuations. This is a very dangerous thing yet again. This kind of stuff was happening in the last dot com bubble, though… I don’t really expect anything like that to happen with the overall stock market, but I think we might see some stocks have a big crash when valuations start to come back in the mind of investors.

Meanwhile we saw 2 big milestones for Tesla &amp; Elon Musk yesterday as the company [passed](https://ibb.co/yXnFsbp) Facebook as market value goes as Tesla is seeing huge trading volumes as yesterday, it [traded](https://ibb.co/6BYkLP9) more shares than the next 3 big movers Apple, Alibaba and Amazon, while Elon Musk [became](https://ibb.co/xS0G5Sk) the richest man in the world, on the back of a 16% increase in Tesla stock already in 2021.

And two last pieces of good news are that the it’s expected the [FED](https://ibb.co/6FTNrSF) will likely hold rates near zero until 2024 while [Pfizer's](https://ibb.co/6nGSdWR) vaccine seems to be working as expected on multiple mutations, especially the latest highly transmissible one.

So, let’s hope for a good day as the European [markets](https://ibb.co/LdhPq9P) and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wSTgstr) are up to start off the day, with the Nasdaq Leading the way up over half a percent.

investing,"Tap Analogy - Inflation, QE and QT dynamic","Sorry if this is a bit begginer but might help some people. 
Im trying to understand the dynamic between Inflation, Interest rates and QE/QT to better understand what is likely to happen in 2021. 

Please correct me if the following analogy is wrong. 

--


TAP ANALOGY

Demand is Water pressure

Inflation is Water flow 

Interest rates are the tap handle

QE/QT is a pump under the sink



INFLATION

The ideal flow rate of this tap is 2% per year. I.e. the target inflation rate.


INTEREST RATES

If the flow rate goes below 2% then the tap handle can be loosened to increase the flow. I.e. lower interest rates. 
Or if the flow rate goes above 2% then the tap can be tightened to reduce the flow. I.e. raise interest rates.


QE/QT

If the tap handle is fully open but still no water pressure then we can use the pump (QE) to artificially increase the pressure more. 
Alternatively if tap was really tight and still the pressure was so high we could in theory reverse the pump to reduce the flow (QT).


APPLYING ANALOGY TO CURRENT SITUATION 

Right now the tap handle is fully open and the undersink pump is at full power. Yet the water pressure (demand/pending) is still very low. 

Therefore a high flow rate (high inflation) shouldn't be a concern. If the pressure rises above 2% the bank can reverse the pump with QT or turn off interest rates with the handle.  Therefore the dollar may inflate but can be controlled in that direction.

The real problem is if we start getting deflation. There are no tools left to reign it back. Which could decline the economy into a depression (no demand/water pressure). A dead economy.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing/Deferment,"Hi all, I'm curious about refinancing and how it affects loan deferment, as well as whether it would be a good idea. 
Details: I'm a graduate student in a STEM PhD program (so my loans are deferred for ~3-4 more years) and I live on a good (~31K) stipend.
My parents weren't able to help pay for my undergrad, but have been generous enough to pay for interest on my loans as long as I'm in school. I have ~86K in private loans (highest rate 4.5%) and ~27K in federal loans (highest rate 5.05%). I'm able to comfortably sock away $500 a month on these loans while in school, and expect to make at least double my current income when I find a job.
However, I've been getting a lot of mail lately about refinancing lately that boasts low rates after refinancing (one of them, Earnest, estimates my starting interest rate could be 3.00 - 3.50%).
I'm wondering if this is a good idea, given the circumstances. If I can save both my parents and myself some money, it would be worthwhile. However, if I refinance with a 10-year repayment term as I have now, is it still deferred until I graduate? Alternatively, should I just wait to refinance until I have more income/could likely get a better rate? Any advice would be greatly appreciated (including general advice on paying down this debt asap)",finance

The Federal Reserve has stated that they are closely monitoring the situation, and have plans to relax the already liberal money supply in attempt to fight the fall.  Fed chair Jerome Powell stated Wednesday that although this is an unprecedented fall, he feels confident that increasing the supply of dollars will do the trick.

personalfinance,Question about merging existing auto loan with a new one,"EDIT: ANSWERED

I own a car that is currently in an auto shop. I owe about $4k on the car, the shop has done about $500 worth of diagnostic work, and the remaining cost to repair would be about $4k. So I’ve decided to get rid of the car and buy a new one. (I’ve gotten second and third opinions on the repairs and the suggested repairs seem legit.)

The shop owner has agreed to keep the car in exchange for the $500 I owe him (a pretty fair deal based on the car’s KBB value considering I’d have to spend $4k on repairs before selling). 

I also plan on financing about $20k on a new car. Ideally, I’d like to roll my $4k loan from the financial institution that has it now into the same loan for the new vehicle that I purchase. I’ve called two auto loan servicers (cap one and penfed), and both said they can’t do that. 

Does anyone know of a financial institution that could do something like that, or is it outside the realm of possibility? If it’s not possible, what are my best options? It seems counterproductive, but maybe trading in my car with the dealer (even for basically nothing) so I can wrap that $4k loan into the new car loan while paying the auto shop the $500 I owe is my best option?

Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Need Tax Advice on Early withdrawals in Roth IRA and 401k,"Hello,

I am currently working in USA but not a US citizen. I am planning to return to my home country in 2-3 years. My company has a generous 5% 401k match which I have been using over the past many years and my 401k has grown pretty well.

Can someone guide me what should I do with my 401k once I leave the country. I know that there will be early withdrawal penalties and taxes with the 401k withdrawal. But I was told that if I withdraw the 401k after 2-3 years of leaving USA I will face significantly lower taxes. At that time my income in USA will be ZERO and so I will hit the lowest Federal and state income tax brackets + 10% penalty. That will bring me under 30% tax rate.

Since, I am going to leave in 2 years, should I continue putting money in my Roth or should I just do a 401k match?",finance

investing,Are long-term bonds really that bad?,"I have some money to invest in fixed income and got interested in long-term bonds, due their great returns.

People keep saying interest rates are low, so long-term bonds look bad. That makes sense on paper, but then interest rates have been low for the past 10 years, and the return of long-term bonds have been pretty great nonetheless. For example, the [Vanguard Long-Term Bond ETF](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/performance/blv) has delivered on average more than 8%. Meanwhile, interest rates were near-zero for most of that period, rising slowly over the most recent several years (which should have been bad for the fund).

personalfinance,Need help considering tax deductions. I'm terrible at taxes.,"As someone who has owed the IRS thousands of dollars in the past (completely my own fault), I'm terrified of ever owing them money again. In my opinion, taxes are far too complicated. Ideally, I want them to take out EXACTLY what I will end up owing at the end of the year, or MORE than I will owe so I get a refund of some kind.

A bit of backstory - I'm married, file as 0. No kids. Income is $129k/year. No complicated tax situations - just a W2 employee paying taxes. No other income sources, no investment properties, etc.

If it's okay, here's my paystub info. Compared to an online calculator, it seems like I'm having ~$100 less in Federal and ~$20 from State. I'm failing to understand why these numbers don't match up. I'm also voluntarily contributing an additional $75 per bi-weekly check to Federal tax just to make sure I won't owe anything. I never want to have to make a payment to the IRS.

Pay Period: 12/21/2020 to 01/03/2021  
Gross pay: $5186.54  
Pre-tax deductions: $7.74  
Employee Taxes: $1420.45  
Post-tax deductions: $9.42  
Net Pay: $3748.93

Witholdings:
OASDI: $321.28  
Medicare: $75.14  
Federal: $784.75  
State (MA): $239.28  

According to Bankrate's Payroll Deductions calc (https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/tax-planning/payroll-tax-deductions-calculator.aspx), numbers should be:
Net Pay: $3643.32  
OASDI: $321.78
Medicare: $75.26
Federal: $884.54
State: $259.10

Now Bankrate is rounding the pre and post tax deductions, but IMO that shouldn't make a $100 difference in Federal tax. Maybe my check is right, maybe Bankrate is right. Either way, I'm **CONSTANTLY** worried that I'll end up having to make an IRS payment. I know, even a $100 lack per paycheck only adds up to $2800 owed, but I don't want to have to deal with it. Having owed the IRS money previously has left me terrified of it happening again, even if it's only $2800.

Is there an easy online calculator that is 100% accurate and I can use to gain some peace of mind?

EDIT: Also, looking at my previous payslip (same rate of pay), Federal taxes were only $740.98 and state $247.85. Why would this change between checks? With a predictable 28 pay periods per year, shouldn't I end up owing *x* amount based off my salary, and then our payroll system deduct (*x* / 28), so it would be the same amount per check no matter what?

investing,Is interest rate going higher?,"Over the past few weeks, interest rates have begun to increase faster than expected. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen from 0.93% at the beginning of December to above 1%. That means that since August of last year, when the 10-year yield hit 0.5%, interest rates have more than doubled.

I have been looking at the 30y treasury bill rate and it seems like it is getting close to 2%

I think there are a few reasons why this is important for investors. Firstly, it means debt is more expensive. For both the U.S. government and corporate borrowers, the cost of borrowing money is rising.

Many analysts expect interest rates to continue to increase over the next year as a normal part of the economic cycle. When the economy is improving, it is essential to increase interest rates in order to avoid inflation spiralling out of control.

Increased economic stimulus and borrowing could drive rates higher, and while this would be positive for many companies on a fundamental level, it is bound to hit equity valuations.


This is one of the risks investors need to be aware of as interest rates continue to grind higher. In past market downturns, it wasn't as much of a concern, but this time around we have seen the rather unique phenomenon of a stock market bull run during a major global economic recession, which puts quite a different spin on things.


The financial markets often do what we least expect as the highest probability scenarios are already priced in, and that's where I believe we stand today, with a majority of investors pricing in lower for longer on the interest rate front, which is evidenced by the euphoric price action in the large-cap growth stocks, including recent heavily oversubscribed shares of initial public offerings.

Against this backdrop, commodity prices are signaling that we are on the cusp of higher than expected future inflationary pressures. This could very well lead to the specter of a burst broader equity market bubble and a burst bond market bubble that potentially casts a pall over the broader investment landscape?

What are your thoughts about where is this going? I have been under the impression that the Fed will keep the interest rate low for many years but this seems contradict to what’s happening. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Please Assess My Family's Situation,"Hey guys, long time lurker and occasional poster, throwaway for obvious reasons.

I will try to keep this as concise as possible. My father bought a NYC taxi medallion years ago. For those who don't know this is something that allows you to drive yellow cabs in NYC. Since Uber and Lyft came into existence, the value of what once grown to a million dollar asset has become much less than [that](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-how-nyc-created-the-medallion-crisis-20201122-7fvm4nxhffdl3p7uwemuumsbdi-story.html) (less than $200,000). My father has currently stopped working due to the pandemic and collects unemployment.

The original purchase price of the medallion was $195,000, where my dad obviously took a loan for through a credit union that works with a lender (Forgive me as I'm in the process of gathering little details). Unfortunately over the years, my father took loans against this initial loan, including for the vehicles he needed to drive the taxi, a $110,000 loan to fully pay off our home, a $50,000 loan to a friend for a business. Yes I know it all sounds ridiculous. In terms of payments, because of COVID, everything is halted.

Right now, with interest and all, the total amount is about $393,000.  The lender is forgiving $68,000. $25,000 is what we would have to pay upfront. And then approximately $300,000, we would get a loan of 5 years, 5% interest rate. $1750 monthly for 5 years.

The other option would be to surrender the medallion (what I'm leaning towards) pay $100,000 one time plus some fees, and they will take medallion away and resolve all debt. I would likely need a personal loan, however I do not want to take it under my name however I would likely help pay it off with my 2 other siblings since it's my dad and he raised us and all that jazz. 

So what do you think I should do? My parents have great credit scores because they do have some other debt on credit cards and such, but they always make on time payments.

stocks,Excessive “Bubble” Talk,"Recently have been considering all the speculation regarding whether we are in a bubble. I flip back and forth on whether or not we actually are in the midst. Prices are obviously high, probably overvalued in some obvious cases, but interest rates are low, the Fed keeps on buying, stimulus keeps pumping, and major companies do seem to indeed be making decent piles of money. But on a purely psychological-level, when everyone is saying we are in a bubble makes me think we aren’t actually – historically bubbles happen when everyone turns a blind-eye to excessive rises in asset prices. People aren’t turning a blind-eye yet, in fact everyone keeps making claims and saying be cautious. So I think in a contrarian sense prices will continue to rise for the short- and medium- term at least until sentiment shifts and everyone begins to think that this is all normal and BAU again. We aren’t there yet. There’s possibility of external factors coming into play: shutdown risk (I personally believe this risk is low), no future stimulus (low again), etc. Then again, I may be the one making that BAU case, only time will tell...

Hi, I’m 23 and currently have $68K in private student loans through Sallie Mae from undergrad (I initially borrowed $48K)

These loans are split into 4 separate loans; one for $10K, $12K, $21K and $23K. These loans have fixed interest rates between 8% and 10.8%. I have no consolidated them.

I applied to refinance through SoFi but was rejected and invited to reapply with a co-signer which I may do.

I have thought about taking a hit on my credit and paying around $1000/mo on the lowest loan ($10K) first, pay it off in a year and then work my way up to the second smallest loan and so forth.

I have about $3K in investments that I contribute $200/mo to and also around $7K in savings.

I also have a credit card which I pay monthly just to build my credit.

personalfinance,"23 new grad, new job at 60K, living with parents","Apologies in advance for long and disorganized rant. Kind of indecisive about my next step with my living situation and what to do with my money. Recently acquired a full time job and before this, I was earning minimum wage. Wanted to know if I'm not being opportunistic here with my situation. It's of overwhelming because my money managing skills are poor and I associate anxiety &amp; guilt with managing personal finances. 

I'm in a pretty fortunate situation and privileged with my parents wanting me to live with them. They believe its good idea that I save money and pay off debt, which I agree with. They house another sibling of mine who's unemployed, and my mother makes all of our meals. I don't pay a dime to live here. My work company also provides insurance, which I plan on waiving, because my father pays a default premium for a family plan. I can stay on the plan til I'm 26. So the only thing I'm paying for right now are gas (I never drive) and student loans.

My job doesn't require me to be onsite, I've been hired remotely. I've been deliberating on moving out and living in a one bedroom apartment for $700, as the independence and thought of having my own place is nice. But I worry that I may regret this financially. I have around $15K in student loans ($6K being private with a 7% interest rate). My father strongly encourages to continue to live with them and pay off my debt (especially my private loans). He thinks I should really save my money. He's also kind of obsessed with saving money. The idea of living in a spacious one bedroom with no roommates sounds so nice, however. I also have the choice to live in a spare bedroom with roommates for $550/month (which I don't prefer). 

From calculating, I can still afford paying my debt off within 1.5 years while sustaining myself renting an apartment, buying my necessities, etc. But am I being impractical for not taking the opportunity to save my money living at my parents? Since I'll have little to no expenses here except for my debt and gas, I would be saving A LOT of money. I'm afraid that I'm swapping a too-good-to-be-true safety net for luxury--a nice apartment and lots of space. Would I regret it? 

In terms of saving, I have started an account with robo investing apps (Betterment and Acorns), where I have monthly payments set up for general investment, retirement, vacation, and a safety net fund. So (I think) I'm on some kind of saving track. 

The thing is, I'm okay with either situation. I'm fine with living with my family and living by myself. I don't know whether to treat myself, or stick to living like a student since I'm so young and I fortunately have a safety net.

Right now I'm on an IBR student loan plan (I didn't make much right out of college) and about 4 years of payments into the 10 required to get the public student loan forgiveness. However, that will probably be near a wash as my IBR payments continue to increase and I'll likely be close to paying off the loans after a full 10 years anyway, regardless of the public student loan forgiveness program. I have good credit and no other financial burdens (newer car that's also paid off). 

I'd like to stay in Pittsburgh for a while, perhaps even the length of my career. House prices in the neighborhood I'm looking at are currently in the 200-300 range, with 250 appearing to be the common number for comps to what I desire. With the right house, I'd probably be living there for a long, long time. The market in my desired neighborhood will certainly get hotter and pricier with each year.

My initial plan was to immediately pay off my student loans and then save over the next few years for a solid 20% down payment on the house I desire. However, I also feel like the 900/mo I'm paying in rent every month feels like a complete waste. 

So fellow redditors and finance gurus, I need your advice.   
Do I...  
\- Stick to my original plan. Pay off student loans now, save for probably 3 years or so and buy the house I desire. And if this, should I put my remaining 20-25k in something like an ETF? 

\-Buy a house and keep paying student loans (500/mo now and will probably increase to 700/mo in the next few years by my estimates). 

\-Do both? If I pay off my student loans, I'll have 20-25k for a down payment. Obviously that's not 20% for 250k, so I'll certainly be feeling higher payments and probably get smacked with PMI. 

Also, it seems there may be at least 10,000 in loan forgiveness looming with the new admin. Does this change any of that?   
Any help is appreciated. Thank you.",finance

btc,Fallacious arguments from a Tether apologist,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM96shsOiZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM96shsOiZo&amp;feature=youtu.be)

This Coin Bureau chap spends a solid 20 minutes praising stablecoins like Tether.  I notice on the fishy-looking Coin Bureau website, every top ten crypto *EXCEPT BCH* is mentioned. 

Highlights of the video are:

* ""When Bitcoin price drops, demand for stablecoins increases"" (utterly incorrect, stablecoins are the last thing anyone would buy if Bitcoin is losing buying power, default risk will be higher then)
* stablecoins can burn supply while the Fed cannot (completely false, Fed does reverse repo operations several times per year, while Tether continually prints and *never* burns)
* ""Whether Bitfinex used Tether to manipulate Bitcoin price in 2017 is for the lawyers to decide, and even if they did, it wasn't very effective"" (ridiculous, the correlation between Tether printing and BTC pumps has been clearly shown by many academics, and total daily trade volume with Tethers exceeds the total Tether supply by 5x!)
* ""Stablecoin supply is fundamentally an indicator of demand for cryptocurrencies as a whole, and not an indicator of market manipulation"" (100% false and opposite of the truth, Tether is creating fake demand and liquidity, with a resulting huge  buy side asymmetry.)
* ""Stablecoin default is not an issue because reserves are much higher than mainstream banking reserve requirements"" (2 wrongs don't make a right)",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Accidentally deposited $2000 into Capital One Savings IRA,"Hey, guys so I goofed up and seek council lol.  


Back on July 10th, I deposited $2000 into a Capital One 360 Savings IRA account which is essentially just a savings account with crappy interest but has the benefits of an IRA. I honestly thought this was just your standard Roth IRA but now I know better.  


Capital One gives me 3 options to transfer the money. I'm just not quite sure what they mean.  


1. Transfer or Roll Over Money:  
Move money from an IRA, 401(k), 403(b), or qualified pension plan to your 360 IRA Savings account.   


2. Recharacterize a Contribution:  
Move previous contributions between your Traditional and Roth 360 IRA Savings accounts.   


 3. Convert a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA:  
 Move all or some of the money in your Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.   


I really want to move this money to a place where I can better put it to use. Is there any way I could move this into my Charles Schwab Roth IRA and if so where can I go to find the steps or forms on how to do it?

investing,Is a housing market crash and stock pullback inevitable?,"Every day I come across an article in the FT or Bloomberg saying that as soon as interest rates are raised, Govt's will have to stop the stimulus / furlough payments and Banks will not be able to continue handing out mortgage payment holidays. If this happens, I feel it would be likely that banks will have to start collecting on interest and capital owed and as a result there will be defaults and then a domino effect whereby lenders cant pay their lenders and etc. All this residential debt is also packaged up with commercial debt (which we know is extremely bad due to commercial shops refusing to pay rent during lockdowns)


As for stocks companies wont be able to borrow money as easily and will have to pay more on the debt currently taken out, meaning there should be a pullback.

worldpolitics,What is a Huge PITA?,"What is a Huge Pain in the Ass?

\*Anyone who disagrees with a liberal.

\*Anyone who dares challenge there hypocrocies and double standards.

\*Anyone who dares challenge their world point of view.

\*Basically, a huge pain in the ass is anyone who points out the flaws, lies and deceit of liberalism. 

\*Anyone who asks a liberal to offer even a minuscule piece of evidence to support their argument..

Because to question a liberal, forces him to substantiate his point of view.

Forces him to create an argument for his ideas.

Very simply, a liberal can not support his views because modern liberalism is a philosophy based on emotion, not any knowledge of the facts, or at the least, an even moderate understanding of human history.

Peace cannot be accomplished with PEACE bumper stickers.

Treaties only give the enemy time to regroup and rearm themselves.

The one thing all treaties have in common is they have all been broken.

The two accomplishments of liberalism they wear like a badge of honor are Roe vs. Wade and Affirmative Action.

Ironic their pride rests in legalized murder and institutionalized racism.

Liberal are an angry, bitter and stubborn lot.

They refer to conservatives as hate mongers, yet know one hates more than a good modern liberal.

There hatreds run long and deep.

They hate the rich

They hate corporations

They hate capitalism

They hate the family structure.

They hate God

They hate religion.

They hate the military

They hate patriotism

They hate America

They hate guns

They hate the automobile

They hate conservatism 

They hate capitalism

They hate First Class on an airplane

—and the list goes on.

When they call conservatives hate mongers, they are merely looking in the mirror. It is Liberalism that is the philosophy of hatred and intolerance.

The modern definition of a Nazi is anyone winning an argument with a liberal. Which is almost effortless.

Conservatism is the intellectual pursuit of a certain philosophical bent on the way the world has been, is now, and forever will be.

Liberalism is the art of being uninformed with the best intentions.

The facts and a rudimentary knowledge of history are the biggest enemy of modern liberalism. The proof of liberal failures is available to anyone who takes the time to look.

The dangerous aspect of modern liberalism is the arrogance they harbor. This arrogance allows them to blindly repeat the mistakes of the past because they feel they are smarter and more compassionate than the others who have tried this kind of thing before.

Ask any liberal who proudly proclaims his love for communism to tell you how many Russian citizens were killed to make way for what was to become the Soviet Union.

They either won’t know or will be too ashamed to say it outloud. 

Best estimates are around seventy million. That’s 70,000,000 Russians.

Most of them starving to death in concentration camps.

They rounded up all your individualists. Painters, sculptors, writers, poets, anyone with a flair for individuality.

Because a free thinker has no place in the collective mainframe of a

communist regime. They can only be a threat to it’s success.

After all, Lenin was a philosopher and a gentle man. He had envisioned a utopia void of any separation by class. There would be no rich and no poor. All would be equal, whether you were a farmer or physician. The new Soviet economy would eventually lead to the natural withering away of the central government all together, leaving the republic in the hands of the people.

Sounds great on paper. But as with all things, the human factor must be included, which it wasn’t. The Soviet Union went the way of others before it. Corruption among the politburo. 

Another road to hell paved with the best intentions.

And so it is with almost every great idea like that. Liberalism is a spoken world view where the end result is a school of excuses. 

No great nation or great empire has ever fallen due to the onslaught of conservatism.

A liberal decay of standards has always been a hallmark of a society in the throws of destruction.

Liberalism embraces big government and high taxes. When they say they want to only tax the rich, they are lying. Which is also a hallmark of modern liberalism.

The lies and deceit. For instance, a true liberal cannot win an election if he was truly honest of his intentions.

They will redefine the English language to make their ideas more palatable.

Bill and Hillary Clinton brought this to an art form.

For instance, Hillary changed her last name from Rodham to Clinton during his run for the White House in 1992. 

Taxes are now called *contributions*. Try telling the IRS you won’t be contributing this year.

Socialism is now called *Economic Democracy*.

Government spending your money is called *Investment.*

You spending your own money is called *consumption.*

Lies are called *spin*, or *disinformation.*

Bill said he was never alone with Monica. Because no one is ever really alone on a planet with five billion people.

All conservatives are called *right wing extremists.* Yet a liberal would be hard pressed to come up with just one person they would define as a *left-wing extremist*.

Liberals believe in the freedom of speech, as long as you are politically correct.

And it’s not Freedom of Religion. It’s Freedom FROM religion.

Hate Crimes Legislation is a bill of laws specifically applied to straight white males of European decent. You will never see a black, Mexican, Asian, gay or lesbian, or a woman charged with a federal hate crime.

Liberals will dump red paint on a woman’s mink coat while wearing their leather Burkenstocks.

They will tear down the Ten Commandments, yet applaud a crucifix soaking in a jar of urine as meaningful art.

Liberalism is the for doing what feels good today.

Conservatism delves into the long term societal implications.

There are always exceptions, but more often than not, a liberal is an atheist. Which helps explain their stellar erogance.

They are usually chronic dope smokers, symbolic of the intoxication they have with their own virtue.

What a liberal says, or how he feels, is far more important than what is actually done. 

Liberalism is not a philosophy, It’s a mental disorder.

It is a mind removed from the reality of life on earth, and stuck in a land of cotton candy swirls and pepper cream dreams.

The liberal mind set is almost that of a twelve year old. A hippie who hasn’t left the sixties.

Modern liberalism is the brainchild of the baby boomer generation. Possibly the most spoiled and misguided generation the planet has ever produced.

I enjoy the struggle baby boomers have in telling youngsters not to do drugs or have casual unsafe sex.

From the generation that glorified the use of both.

Their belief in big government comes from the distrust they have for ordinary citizens. They don’t trust people to do the right thing. Because any one who isn’t a liberal is a fascist Nazi sexist racist homophobic hate monger.

They hate guns because it empowers the people. And how are they going to impose their will with the right of the people to keep and bear arms.

Gun control as an issue of public safety is a big lie.

You could show a liberal the evidence of a reduction of violent crime in states with concealed carry laws, and it would matter very little to them. Because saving lives is not their aim or concern.

They want to eliminate ALL guns. Including your grandfathers shotgun.

The liberal biased Star Tribune and CNN won’t tell you about the 400% increase in violent crime since the round up of ALL weapons five years ago.

Liberals will be against the death penalty, yet embrace After Birth Abortion. A surgical procedure that sucks the brain out of an infant in the middle of it’s delivery.

If you are a liberal politician, you can do no wrong. Because as a liberal, there is no such thing as right and wrong or good and evil.

A younger inner city gang member didn’t do anything wrong when he shot a rival gang member. He merely made some inappropriate choices.

The words *right* and *wrong* have been changed to *appropriate* or *inappropriate.*

Diversity is only about the diversity of illegal aliens. Not about the diversity of opinions.

A liberals idea of compassion is how many people they can get on Welfare, forever dependent on liberals and their government give-away .

A conservatives idea of compassion is how many they can get off Welfare, and on the road to rewards that are earned.

Liberals believe minorities can only succeed with their help. Because America is a country of racism brought about by an oppressive white male dominated society. And without liberals they would never find success.

To a liberal elites there is nothing worse than a successful conservative minority.

Clarance Thomas was reviled by the left because he owed them nothing. His success was one he earned through hard works.

The is intolerable to liberals because it removes their power and whole reason for existing.

They will intentionally fan the flames off racism to maintain their hold on a class of people.

Liberalism is Machiavellianism. The end will always justify the means. No matter how severe the actions for the cause are.

This is why Clarence Thomas was almost lynched for saying “Who put a pubic hair on my Coke can?” all the while Bill Clinton’s accusations of rape by Waneeda Broderick, sexual assault by Kathline Willey, sexual harassment by Paula Jones, the bombing of the Sudan the day before his impeachment. The bombing of Baghdad the day before the grand jury testimony of Monica Lewinski and an endless list of other wrong doings and lies.

All is forgiven because Bill Clinton is Pro-Abortion. And this is the simple truth.

You can’t blame it on too many other aspects of liberalism, because not everyone is aware of all the aspects of modern liberalism.

When all is said and done, it’s Bill’s stand on Abortion.

Pro-Abortion supporter? You can now kill the pope without fear of any criticism.

I’m convinced beyond all doubt Bill Clinton could be video taped shooting a man in the head. And within twenty four hours, all the talking heads and political pundits would be asking who was the man he killed? Was he possibly an evil republican? And when they learn the man shot was Rush Limbaugh, all would be forgiven and all the liberals would be popping corks saluting their commander and chief for his long overdue act of bravery.

Al Gore is forgiven for flooding a river from a drought stricken town for a photo shoot. They didn’t want Al to have to get out and drag the canoe about 7 feet to deeper water.

Al is Pro-Abortion.

I know a chronic wife beater who stopped his evil ways because he saw a “Hatred is Not a Family Value” bumper sticker. He wished he could have seen one during his formative years.

Saddam stopped his war with Iran because he saw the “We are the World” video on MTV.

Remember, it’s not what you do, that makes a good liberal. It’s what you say. And how much you’re feeling when you are saying it.

Bill Clinton bites his lower lip, and half the world swoons.

Want Peace on Earth? Just put a peace sign out on the lawn. If everyone did this, peace would spread across the world like a runaway vegetable garden.

The mountain lion that killed the mother of two while jogging in California received far more money from liberal groups than the two children left motherless. Because every good liberal understands that human beings are merely an infestation on our Mother the Earth.

A good liberal will demonize SUV’s while they drive an old piece of junk that gets half the gas mileage.

They will insist you don’t wear leather while condoning clothing produced with petroleum products by companies they demonize also.

They insist on forests being left alone, creating unstable and dangerous conditions for human inhabitants. Trees are much more important that humans will ever be.

Two of my favorite Liberal results.

1) The liberals in Colorado were the first to try the Free Condom Distribution Program on a high school in Denver.

Baskets of free Trojans in every hallway to put and end to the embarrassment of buying them at a Super America.

All in the name of Safe Sex.

Four years later, the same high school had claim to another noteworthy distinction. 

Highest per capita teen pregnancy.

Liberal brilliance at work.

2) The “Don’t ask, don’t tell”policy concerning gays and lesbians in the military instituted in 1994 by Bill Clinton.

At the time of it’s inception, approximately 200 homosexuals were Less Than Honorably Discharged for their alternative affinities each year.

After the “Don’t ask, don’t tell”, the number was up to approximately 500 discharges a year.

More liberal brilliance.

And believe it not, Clinton was still applauded for being the first president to have the guts to step up and broach the subject.

Even though it failed miserably.

Again, it’s not what gets done. It’s about saying the right things. This is success within the Liberal lexicon of ideas.

It’s this way of thinking that gives liberalism it’s biggest road block. Ineptitude. The incredible inability to actually get anything of merit done for the good of the people. Which is supposed to be the aim. Right?

You could offer example after example of failed liberal policy, yet these little trivial matters called success matter little. Good thing too. Otherwise they’d have to go home with their tail between their legs and get a real job.

Liberals fear the Christian Right. They fear these bible thumpers will invade their homes and take away their pot and porno tapes.

Tell you what. If you were to ask me, I’d say the real threat to our freedoms can and will come from the left.

From shredding the Constitution to smoking bans to assaults on the combustion engine and freedom of speech due to political correctness, liberals are constantly trying to impede on our freedoms and our American way of life.

It’s my hope they are as successful with these daily intrusions as they are with everything else they try.",energy

stocks,"Why We Are at the Major Late-Stage Bubble, Possibly the Biggest in History","Before I begin, I came across this article written by Jeremey Grantham, who is a British investor and co-founder and chief investment strategist of GMO, also regarded as a highly knowledgeable investor particularly due to his prediction of various historic stock market bubbles.

In his article titled ""Waiting for the Last Dance"", he outlines multiple points why he thinks we are in a major late-stage bubble. I will summarize below the key points discussed, but will also leave a link to the article in case you want to read the full version.

[https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/)

\- The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble, and he believes this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000.

\- The single most dependable feature of the late stages of the great bubbles of history has been really crazy investor behaviour, especially on the part of individuals. For the first 10 years of this bull market, we lacked such wild speculation. But now we have it. (he provides examples such as Hertz, K\*d\*k, Nikola, and especially, Tesla)

\- The ""Buffett indicator,"" total stock market capitalization to GDP, broke through its all-time-high 2000 record. In 2020, there were 480 IPOs (including an incredible 248 SPACs) – more new listings than the 406 IPOs in 2000. There are 150 non-micro-cap companies (market cap of over $250 million) that have more than tripled in the year, which is over 3 times as many as any year in the previous decade. The volume of small retail purchases, of less than 10 contracts, of call options on U.S. equities has increased 8-fold compared to 2019, and 2019 was already well above long-run average.

\- This time, more than in any previous bubble, investors are relying on accommodative monetary conditions and zero real rates extrapolated indefinitely ... Now once again the high prices this time will hold because…interest rates will be kept around nil forever, in the ultimate statement of moral hazard – the asymmetrical market risk we have come to know and depend on. The mantra of late 2020 was that engineered low rates can prevent a decline in asset prices. Forever! But of course, it was a fallacy in 2000 and it is a fallacy now. In the end, moral hazard did not stop the Tech bubble decline, with the NASDAQ falling 82%. Yes, 82%!

\-Nothing in investing perfectly repeats. Certainly not investment bubbles. Each form of irrational exuberance is different; we are just looking for what you might call spiritual similarities. Even now, I know that this market can soar upwards for a few more weeks or even months – it feels like we could be anywhere between July 1999 and February 2000. Which is to say it is entitled to break any day, having checked all the boxes, but could keep roaring upwards for a few months longer.

\- My best guess as to the longest this bubble might survive is the late spring or early summer, coinciding with the broad rollout of the COVID vaccine. At that moment, the most pressing issue facing the world economy will have been solved. Market participants will breathe a sigh of relief, look around, and immediately realize that the economy is still in poor shape, stimulus will shortly be cut back with the end of the COVID crisis, and valuations are absurd. “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” But remember that timing the bursting of bubbles has a long history of disappointment.

\- Even with hindsight, it is seldom easy to point to the pin that burst the bubble. The main reason for this lack of clarity is that the great bull markets did not break when they were presented with a major unexpected negative. The great bull markets typically turn down when the market conditions are very favorable, just subtly less favorable than they were yesterday. And that is why they are always missed.

\-The combination of timing uncertainty and rapidly accelerating regret on the part of clients means that the career and business risk of fighting the bubble is too great for large commercial enterprises. So, don't wait for the Goldmans and Morgan Stanleys to become bearish: it can never happen. For them it is a horribly non-commercial bet. Perhaps it is for anyone. Profitable and risk-reducing for the clients, yes, but commercially impractical for advisors. Their best policy is clear and simple: always be extremely bullish. It is good for business and intellectually undemanding. It is appealing to most investors who much prefer optimism to realistic appraisal, as witnessed so vividly with COVID. And when it all ends, you will as a persistent bull have overwhelming company. This is why you have always had bullish advice in a bubble and always will.

If you are interested to see more of his arguments, I strongly advise you to go and read the full article. I am currently 100% on equities, and very bullish for stocks as all of you probably are. But I think it's also important to have a balanced perspective, especially when everyone around you is extremely bullish. Ultimately, we are investing for the long run for our retirement. Everyone is a fucking genius in a bull market, and I think a lot of people in the sub, whether a newcomer or an experienced investor, should listen to bearish predictions and advices and not become a victim of confirmation bias.",finance

personalfinance,Using Qualified HSA Withdrawals To Fund Roth IRA,"# Conventional Wisdom

If you are fortunate to have an HSA, the conventional wisdom is to pay for medical expenses out of pocket and reimburse yourself later after it has been allowed to grow.  For those who may not be aware of how an HSA works:

* Qualified expenses are triple tax advantaged (goes in pre-tax, grows tax free and comes out tax free).
* If contributions are made as part of your payroll deductions, they are not only exempt from federal and state taxes, they are also exempt from Social Security (6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%). Note:  I believe there are two states that do not exempt HSA contributions from state income taxes.
* Once you reach age 65, the HSA turns more into a conventional IRA.  There is no penalty for withdrawals for any reason and non-qualified withdrawals are treated as ordinary income.
* There currently is no policy, regulation or rule that indicates when you are allowed to reimburse yourself for qualified expenses

# Using Qualified HSA Withdrawals To Fund A Roth IRA

Assuming you re-invest your qualified withdrawal from the HSA into the Roth IRA immediately, nothing has functionally changed.

* It remains triple tax advantaged
* You can take out the money any time you want

# Why Would You Want To Do This?

The above doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.  Regardless if the money is sitting in the Roth IRA as a contribution or in the HSA as a qualified expense, it grows tax free and comes out tax free so why bother?

In my situation, I am trying to increase the amount of money I have to invest in a taxable brokerage account.  I am already maxing out my 401(k), Roth IRA and HSA so there isn't a whole lot of extra money to work with.  Since money is fungible, the idea is:

* Reimburse myself for the money that has already been spent in the past from the HSA which would normally ruin its growth potential
* Invest the amount from the first step in a Roth IRA to preserve the growth potential
* Use the money that was previously funding the Roth IRA to increase the amount in the taxable brokerage account


# Does This Make Sense?

Based on all my receipts since I started the HSA, I should average around $2,000 a year this way.  I can't really see a down side to it.   It may actually even have an upside (I can't convince myself this is the case).

* HSA: Earnings can be withdrawn at any age tax free for qualified reasons but after 65 for any reason as normal income
* Roth IRA:  Earnings can be withdrawn at 59.5 tax free for any reason

It seems like in addition to freeing up money to invest in a taxable brokerage account, it is also superior to leaving it in the HSA.",finance

personalfinance,Help me figure out if this is a good plan after college,"I hope this is the right subreddit to ask something like this. If not, please guide me to a better place to ask.

To begin, I am currently a senior in college that has one semester left. I wanted to take initiative and plan out my future so I don’t go broke. I have been spending a lot of time doing research on investing, retirement funds, student loans, taxes. I wish schools offered a class in this 😢

Anyways, I have looked through all of my private/government loans and I have:
Private loan: $17,000 (6.75%)
Government: 
Subsidized: $19,000 
Unsubsidized: $8,300
Perkins Lon: $1,600
Total: $46,000

That’s a lot of money! Luckily, I was able to land myself a full time offer that starts right when I graduate in May, making $85,000 a year.

I’m not sure if I calculated the taxes right, but assuming I file single and don’t put any into a retirement fund, I will be taxed approximately $24,800. Taking my take-home income to be ~$60,000. After an estimated monthly bill of ~$2000/month, I should have $36,000. This means that I should be able to pay off my student loans in approximately two years as long as I don’t overspend money. 

I have looked into retirement funds like Roth IRA and 401k. And although these are both very beneficial, I have decided to hold off on these until I pay off all of my student loans, especially the private loan that has an interest rate of 6.75%. 

Now, I don’t really have any specific questions to ask, but from a quick glance at my numbers and plan. Does my plan look fine, is there anything that you guys would recommend or suggest that I don’t know of? Please, any tips would be extremely helpful to me.",finance

personalfinance,The Saver's Credit - A Quirky Income Problem,"Hi, everyone. I'll get right into it and try to keep this relatively short.

For tax year 2020, the maximum saver's credit I can get is $200 (10% of a maximum contribution to a qualified retirement account of $2,000), subject to an AGI limit of $33,000. In 2020, I will have made about $31,000 in earned income (wages). However, I also performed a Roth conversion in March. The total distribution was just over $4,000 and I have no other deductions, apart from paltry student loan interest (which I didn't even really get this year since all my loans have been in forbearance). My traditional IRA is now empty. 

So... My AGI is a few thousand over the limit for earning the saver's credit. However, I was wondering if I could (or if it would be prudent to) make a backdoor Roth contribution. I am in a somewhat unique situation here where my income allows me to make fully deductible IRA contributions and also contribute to a Roth IRA. However... I made too much to earn the saver's credit, which is essentially a free $200. And this will likely be the last year I can earn it.

So my thinking is that I would make a contribution of approximately $2,000-2,500 to my traditional IRA with after-tax dollars, deduct that on my taxes so that I would meet the AGI limit for the saver's credit, and then convert the monies to my Roth IRA. I should be able to deduct the traditional contribution because the money going in is after-tax... The only issue (and it's a big issue that might make this whole thing untenable or at least stupid to begin with) is that if I did this, because I deducted my contributions to lower my AGI, I would have to turn right around and pay tax again on the conversion. On $2,000, effective federal and state taxes in my bracket would probably come to something like 15% or $300. That would mean my net ""profit"" from this whole exercise would be negative one hundred dollars. Of course, I realize that not qualifying for the saver's credit is a good thing because eit means I made more money. But that $4,000 conversion wasn't really usable, earned wages. So I'll feel a bit cheated if I can't get it. 

So... Let me know. Am I thinking about this correctly? Thanks for all your help! 

P.S. I am studying to become a CFP® Professional. I'm taking the exam in March, so this is an especially good exercise for me.",finance

Bought a house 15 years .  Paid it off several years ago with inheritance, gifts, bonuses and such through the years to get more cash flow (no mortgage payment).   Bought the house for 300k, it’s maybe worth 600k.  

Now I’m like.... I should have listened to people... the market is returning more than interest rates.... if I held back those 200k payments I could have invested it.  And I’d be getting the tax write off for mortgage payments.   But I emotionally liked the idea of no debt... so anyway.....

Now I’m older and talk to my financial advisor more regularly (yeah I should ask him this too)....

At some point we’ll buy a house in the next couple years for maybe 700k-800k.

Now I’m more comfortable with investing the money and taking a draw to pay the mortgage. 

Can I refinance my paid-off home and get a home loan for like 300k and invest it and write off the interest on the new mortgage?

— edit:

It looks like 250k-500k of profit on the sale might not be taxable.   So in the event we buy a new house, it seems we could sell for 600k, use, say, 300k for the new house, invest the other ~300k (after expenses).  Take a loan for the remaining difference in the house and be able to write off the interest on that loan.

-- second edit:
I didn't realize standard deductions got so high (starting in 2018) - a ""married, filing jointly deduction"" is like $24,800.  We won't have itemized deductions and interest payments that hit that, so looking for a tax write off on the interest is probably not going to happen.",finance

In 2010 there was talk of overvaluation in certain sectors, but still positivity in the news. This continued until 2011, where the aforementioned Debt Crisis “hiccuped” the market. Fear and uncertainty persisted into 2012, but the market continued pushing forward. It is mainly in 2013 where we start to see more talk and certainty about bubbles.

What does this prove? Well, nothing really. But it gives us some insight into markets and narratives.

The debt crisis was felt two years after the big stimulus packages, while investors were cautiously optimistic about the markets. But there was still a lot of negative sentiment the whole way through. 

The market was clearly labelled a bubble by 2013 and heading into 2014, but that never came to fruition. Markets definitely ""frothed"" in 2016 onwards. What we saw in March 2020 was an unprecedented level of global stimulus, which has and will continue to have an upward effect on asset prices.

I currently have a 2011 Hyundai Elantra Touring GLS 5 Speed Manual. I also do not have my own permanent housing situation, more pressing if my relationship with my boyfriend ends. 

So I’m stuck at a cross roads. My credit is floating around a 650 rn, less than 2 years old. 

In CT I qualify for the CHFA program for first time home buyers (state covers down payment and closing costs and secures your interest rate). 

I also need a new car. I currently owe about 5,000 on my current loan, so I would need to roll negative equity onto the new car should I even qualify to finance one. In my mind, that doesn’t bother me due to wanting to purchase a 2020 or 2021 crossover to last me a long time, more specifically when I’m ready to have kids. 

So: what do y’all think? House or new car? 

NOTE: the reason a new car is even an option is because the trans and the clutch are starting to go out on my current one, and i’m not about to drop a couple grand to fix a car that’s worth less than 2K. I have a 40 ish min drive to RI from where I live, and I need a vehicle that’s AUTOMATIC and ALL WHEEL DRIVE for new england weather.

My situation is that my family has to pay $100,000 upfront, for which I'm thinking the best bet is to get something along the lines of a HELOC to get a lower interest rate and help pay for it. Our house is valued anywhere from 600k-700k and our mortgage is already paid off. My goal, with the help of my family, is to pay as a little ""money"" as possible within our means. 

What this means is, if we were to get a HELOC we would make not only interest payments but payments towards the principal. However, we don't need the active line of credit that a HELOC offers and I doubt we would keep it past the draw period either. Ideally I'd want to pay any loan we take out in under 5 years.

Which is what brought my attention to the home equity loan, which is a lump sum, one time payment with a fixed interest rate. Besides slightly higher rates, I can't think of a reason why this doesn't make sense.

economy,"People should be talking about the Cantillon Effect, not Divide and Conquer Politics","Have you heard of the Cantillon effect?

Wealth inequality is a well documented problem in the United States, and more broadly across the world.

This rise in wealth inequality over the past 30 years has to a significant extent been the product of monetary policy fuelling a series of asset price bubbles.

Whenever the market booms, the share of wealth going to those at the very top increases.

When the boom goes bust, that share drops somewhat - but then comes roaring back even higher with the next asset bubble.

Also, those the very top are often diversified, so even if their wealth as a group technically goes down due to a stock market crash, as individuals they are generally fine and it is the middle class that bear the brunt of the damage.

The redistributive effects of money creation were called Cantillon effects by Mark Blaug after the Franco-Irish economist Richard Cantillon who experienced the effect of inflation under the paper money system of John Law at the beginning of the 18th century.

**Cantillon explained that the first ones to receive the newly created money see their incomes rise whereas the last ones to receive the newly created money see their purchasing power decline as consumer price inflation comes about**.

In accordance with the Cantillon effect, inflation can increase inequality depending on the route it takes, but increasing inequality is not a necessary consequence of inflation. If it happened that the poorest in society were the first receivers of the newly created money, then inflation could very well be the cause of decreasing inequality since they get the money first.

Under modern central banking however, money is created and injected into the economy through the credit route and first affects financial markets.

Under this system, commercial banks and other financial institutions are not only the first receivers of the newly created money but are also the main producers of credit money.

This is because banks can grant loans unbacked by base money.

In a free-banking system, this credit creation power of banks is strictly limited by competition and the clearing process.

Under central banking however, the need for reserves is relaxed as banks can either sell financial assets to the central bank in open market operations, or the central bank can grant loans to banks at relatively low interest rates.

In both cases, central banks remove the limits of credit expansion by determining the total reserves in the banking system. In other words, commercial banks and other financial institutions are credited with so-called base money that has not existed before.

Thus, the economics of Cantillon effects tells us that financial institutions benefit disproportionately from money creation, since they can purchase more goods, services, and assets for still relatively low prices. This conclusion is backed by numerous empirical illustrations.

For instance, the financial sector contributed massively to the growth of billionaire’s wealth.

One of the most visible consequences of this growth of financial markets triggered by monetary expansion is asset price inflation.

In a completely sound money system where credit only depends on the amount of saving rather than on fiduciary credit, there is very little room for generalized and persistent asset-price inflation as the amount of funds which can be used to purchase assets is strictly limited. In other words, the phenomenon of **asset-price inflation is a child of credit inflation**.

Asset price inflation predominately benefits the richest in society for several reasons.

1. First of all, the wealthy tend to own more financial assets than the poor in proportion to income.
2. Secondly, it is easier for the richest individuals to contract debt in order to buy shares that can be sold later at a profit. Since credit easing lowers the interest rate and therefore funding costs, the profits made by selling inflated assets bought at credit will be even greater.
3. Finally, asset price inflation coming with the growth of financial markets will benefit those working in the financial sector. It will also benefit the CEO's of the publicly traded companies who will be paid more as the market cap of their company increases.

Hence, the correlation between asset prices and income inequality has been, as expected, very strong.

Despite this, many economists have failed to see asset-price inflation as a consequence of an inflated money supply.

**The conclusion is: our monetary system itself increases inequality**.

personalfinance,Bonds vs Bond ETFs - what's the difference?,"Hi all, 

bit of a request for help here, as I've always struggled to fully understand this concept and the information out there is fragmented at best. 

I've got a bit of cash I would like to park somewhere safe, and I am eyeing bond ETFs as a potentially safe option. Nevertheless, there are a few questions I've got left at this stage. 

It is my understanding that with bonds you literally cannot lose money, as in a worst case scenario (meaning: interest rates go up above what your bond can offer and thereforethe value of your bond plummets, as no one would ever want to buy the thing from you) you could just hold on to it until maturity - so you would walk out of this with your initial investment + the promised interest. 

I also understand the concept of bond ETFs. As they obviously hold a porfolio of bonds with individual maturity dates (usually within a specified range), the ETFs itself usually won't have a pre-set maturity date, and therefore they are more of a rolling investment.

Nevertheless, there are two points I remain unclear about

1. What does the price of a bonded ETF depend on? I am asking because a lot of those seemingly safe investments took a nosedive when COVID hit back in march. On what basis do ETFs reinvest their money? Do they buy the same bonds over and over again? Or does it depend on the ETF? If they did that, they should obviously have some kind of guarantee that your money will be repaid. Nevertheless, a lot of them crashed. Was this just investors being anxious and selling their ETFs because ""OMG society is going to collapse and all the underlying securities are going to default""? And who's to say the same thing won't happen again, e.g. if interest rates go up? How safe is my money with a bond ETF, really? 
2. I know there are a few bond ETFs with pre-set maturity dates (so they just hold their bonds until maturity and then pay out to investors). Would they be any different in terms of the issues above? And if so, do you know of any such ETFs in the Eurozone? I am looking at 1-3 year maturity dates, preferably investing into municipal or blue chip company bonds. 

If anyone could clarify the above two points + add anything on I might have missed, that would be greatly appreciated. At the moment I feel like bond ETFs are marketed as being exactly equivalent to bonds, which clearly they are not. Nevertheless, having my money just sitting on the bank is rubbing me on the wrong spot. 

Also it'd be appreciated it we could restrict the discussion to bonded ETFs as opposed to stocks / index ETFs. I am also investing into the market, but I am asking this question with the purpose of gaining a better understanding + hopefully leaving some valuable breadcrumbs for the next person wondering.

CryptoMarkets,Bitcoin was not the first,"(Please note this is speculation and not a case to buy or sell)

Bitcoin has seen massive growth due to institutions buying, a hedge against inflation, money making opportunity etc.

A quick summary as you will. Its essentially been treated as a safe haven.

Historically Safe havens don't last very long and  institutions are more of a mix between profit maximisers and hodlers of various assets.

In the 70s gold and silver saw impressive rallies due to runaway inflation. These rallies were fueled mostly by institutions and big players. However the prices of assets crashed soon after.

Since the USA government managed to get a hold of things by raising intrest rates to 20%. 

2011 saw another impressive gold and silver rally due to  US hesitation to raise the debt ceiling. Usually raising the debt ceiling happens automatically and quickly. There was a real possibility that the USA wouldn't be able to pay its debts.

Once the US raised the debt ceiling safe havens such as Gold and Silver tanked.

Who remembers ww3? When Trump assassinated Soleimani?

Panic ensued and people thought a USA-Iran war would lead to a world war though other global powers siding with Iran.

During this this time Bitcoin had a impressive rally, however cooler heads managed to prevail and the crisis was averted.

Would have bitcoin continued rise without covid 19? unlikely due to assets such as oil dropped after ww3 was averted.

Finally we have Covid 19 where bitcoin crashed with the rest of the financial markets. The crash was so great there weren't any buy orders on exchange order books.

Ironically Bitcoin and other financial markets were saved by the federal reserve. The very thing the crypto community despises. If they didn't print money this rally would be impossible.

I can confidently say we would see a multi year bear market in every financial asset, if money wasn't printed.

If Bitcoin was a safe haven why did it tank?

Moving forward today, the global governments are in crisis, however I doubt it will last long because we have had major crisises before and things have recovered just fine.

If bitcoin is a safe haven, I think it will tank if and when things go back to normal. Just like any other safe haven in history.

Anyhow everyone in the crypto community should be thanking and kissing the feet of the federal reserve. If it weren't for the money printer the market rallies would have been impossible.",cryptocurrency

investing,Thoughts on an income mutual fund for secondary savings (after emergency fund is established)?,"It’s pretty clear that your emergency fund should be created first, stored in HYSA, MMA etc. But after that it gets hazy. Sure, long term investments can go into various index funds, individual stocks and what not. But what about the medium term, 2-5 year timeframe. 

Income funds like SWLRX, FASIX, and VASIX seem like solid options. You will have the tax liability like you would with HYSA interest. You also have the chance for higher returns than current HYSA (something something past returns don’t guarantee future results). 

For instance, SWLRX’s TTM is 2.07%, even with interest rates being nil the past ~10 months. Downside capture is only 18 and max drawdown is just north of 3.5%.

personalfinance,Buy a house with an unmarried partner?,"Short story:

Have an opportunity to buy the home I’m renting from my landlord. Appraised at $380,000. They’re willing to pass the savings from not using real estate brokers on to me, so it’ll be somewhere around $357,000.

The house is a 2b-1ba with great bones and just needs some mild updating. 3 miles from downtown. Bikeable. The neighborhood has seen a lot of investment with restaurants, outdoor markets, etc. I rent it for $1,300/mo but all the similar houses on my block rent for $2,000 or so a month. We have a special deal!

It’s in a very hot housing market, where things go for way over asking price and things fly off the market. So I’m also saving myself from entering that world. I don’t think I could compete in that reality.

My girlfriend and I are considering having a baby. Have very little debt. Make a combined $125,000 a year. Her parents are willing to give her about $40,000 for a down payment. I have about $5k cash and can get a $21,000 retirement loan. Still puts our mortgage payment a little above what we pay in rent because we’ll have mortgage insurance for a while.

Seems to make sense financially. We love the ‘hood. The neighbors. Etc. If we lost this rental, we’d have to pay about $700-1000 more a month to maintain living in a house near the city, or get an apartment to keep costs the same.

Here’s the kickers: 

1) not married. Need to work up some sort of financial agreement on how to split the purchase. Or just elope! We want to get married sometime anyway but it’s not important to us. 

2) taking a retirement loan sucks. But it helps us stay in this house and keeps us from paying more in rent when this house is inevitably no longer available at this price. Landlords are very old get getting sicker.

3) I have a job with the Feds in a different state but am able to work remotely. If that changes and I had to move, we’d have to rent this place out. But I could rent it for more than the mortgage so doesn’t seem too risky.

Any thoughts on why I shouldn’t pull the trigger on this?",finance

investing,Pent Up Demand: Debunking the Narrative (long post using data),"We've heard countless times that there is going to be an immense wave of pent up demand that is going to cause a boom in the economy once we are fully vaccinated. I try to keep an eye on economic data reports that come through because if you know how to read them, they can provide a lot of insight that can cut through popular narratives.

Recently, I've been noticing more and more data points that lead me to doubt the idea that we are going to see an immense wave of consumer demand leading to a new surge in the economy. That is 100% subject to change, so I'm just going off what I am seeing ***right now.*** These things are dynamic, and changes in policy and income (aka stimulus or mass-rehiring of workers) can completely affect consumer's ability to spend... at least for a period of time.

[Courtesy of the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-deliver-89-point-5-million-economic-impact-payments-in-first-three-weeks-release-state-by-state-economic-impact-payment-figures), after the first stimulus check was sent, a total of $160.4 billion went to 89.5 million individuals. so how was this used? And what may this indicate for current and future demand?

**So... Analyzing the Data...**

# Personal Savings Rate Does Not Equate To Consumer Demand

To start, it's important to understand the savings rate at both a personal level and a macro level.

Lets take a minute to understand how the savings rate is generally defined (on a personal level).

&gt;A savings rate is the amount of money, expressed as a percentage or ratio, that a person deducts from his disposable personal income to set aside as a nest egg or for retirement.

On an individual level, the most important thing to note here is that investing = savings. And in general, people don't tend to spend their investments in the near future, so savings that get allocated towards longer term investments typically will ***not*** count towards ""pent up demand"". For the individuals who choose to invest their money, they typically do so with the understanding that they do not have any needs or demands they can anticipate in the near future, and instead choose to save for the future via investment. This goes counter to the idea that savings are a precursor to spending. 

On a macro level, when taken as a cross-section of a country as a whole, savings rates reflect aggregate savings, but this is highly skewed to the extremely wealthy. Savings rate naturally skews towards a wealthier subset of any society because lower income individuals need to spend $ on day-to-day items just to stay above water, whereas the wealthy have an excess of income relative to their individual demands, which means they tend to invest the excess $ since they only have so much they can spend it on (unless you're a baller who *needs* that 5th Yacht from their WSB calls).

For example, read this excerpt from a study done on stimulus spending ([https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/stimulus-checks-spending-data-2020-coronavirus-covid](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/stimulus-checks-spending-data-2020-coronavirus-covid))

&gt;Those in the lowest income group, who earned less than $1,000 per month, spent about 40 percent of the checks in the first ten days. That was twice as much as the highest income group (those making over $5,000 a month), who spent closer to 20 percent in that brief period. 

**\*\*Key Takeaways on Savings Rate\*\***

1. Savings rate tends to reflect investment more than cash saved for future discretionary needs.
2. Savings rate skews towards wealthy individuals who generally do not account for a meaningful amount of consumer demand relative to their overall savings.
3. In other words, higher savings is not by itself a good barometer for gauging pent-up demand.

# Consumer Spending &amp; Income In the Pandemic

First off, [**lets take a look at real personal spending and real personal income**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=zGMK) *^((please do click the link to see the chart)**)*. We can all see the gigantic surge in income (via stimulus) and drop in spending (via lockdowns) that occurred in April 2020. This is the primary item that lead most to believe the idea that we'll have a surge of consumer spending once we're away from the pandemic via pent-up demand. It makes total sense, especially with the context of lockdowns which literally prevented people from spending their money on what they were originally planning to.

From the federal reserve, here is a breakdown of how stimulus money was spent (from October). Read more at [https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/10/how-have-households-used-their-stimulus-payments-and-how-would-they-spend-the-next.html](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/10/how-have-households-used-their-stimulus-payments-and-how-would-they-spend-the-next.html)

&amp;#x200B;

||Average percent saved|Average percent spent on essentials|Average percent spent on non-essentials|Average percent donated|Average percent used to pay down debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Percentage of total|36.4%|18.2%|7.7%|3.2%|34.5%|
|$ value based on IRS 160 billion sent| 58.24 billion|29.1 billion|12.3 billion|5.1 billion|55.2 billion|

My general theory is that the majority of that pent up demand has already been worn off, or was simply allocated elsewhere, and this money is not likely to cause an excessive surge in consumer spending when we're all vaccinated.

Looking at the above table, lets consider how much of this $ could potentially represent savings that are waiting to be used as pent up demand vs. savings as investments. In all likelihood, there is a fraction of that 58.24 billion waiting to be spent upon reopening. The majority of it is likely going to be stuck in investments or kept in savings.

On investment - note the below data point relative to the 89.5 million stimulus checks sent out. A huge portion of new trading accounts were opened relative to the amount of stimulus accounts sent - and that only represents one month, ignores those who already had trading accounts, and ignores the people who were not able to save $ from their stimulus check.

&gt;At E\*Trade Financial Corp. , investors opened roughly 260,500 retail accounts just in March, more than any full year on record. Newer rival Robinhood Markets Inc., maker of a wildly popular trading app, logged a record three million new accounts in the first quarter.

Unfortunately, I can't dig up more precise data on how much of people's savings went to buying stocks and other financial products vs. being stashed in bank accounts for later use. With that said, clearly a shit ton of ""savings"" is what propped up markets in 2020 and caused the wild disparities in valuation of the financial markets vs. the real economy. 

**\*\*Key Takeaways On Consumer Spending From Stimulus\*\***

* Of the money from stimulus, the majority of excess savings was not saved for later use for when the pandemic is over.
* Most of the excess savings rotated into investments, paying down debts, and ""keeping the lights on"". 
* While there may be some excess $ saved for the pandemic being over, the wide majority of the excess money earned during covid lockdowns will not be used on pent up demand spending. 

**The Great Consumer Spending Rotation of 2020**

When consumers realized they couldn't go on their vacations or meet up with their friends at the local pub, they decided to spend their income in other ways instead of just stashing it in a bank account and letting it sit there to be later use for 2021's vacation or restaurant trips.

Just like a sector rotation in the stock market, I think we got a gigantic sector rotation in consumer spending habits that will likely reverse a bit when the pandemic is over. Here is the evidence.

To be 100% clear, I DO think there ***was*** pent up demand after the big lockdown, but the portion of the savings glut that was ***not*** allocated towards investments for the most part did not get saved for later use in 2021. It just got repurposed and spent on other items. Lets take a look under the hood at some of the data of this rotation. To start - [take a look at real personal consumption expenditures](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCEC96) as a baseline.  


* [**Durable Goods Saw a Huge Surge in the Summer**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCEDG)**:** This is part of why I say that there 100% was a lot of pent-up demand, but it simply has already been utilized. Relative to overall personal expenditures, people spent a ton of money on goods. Notably, this was dominated by auto purchases and other big purchases of physical items.
   * [**Purchases of Food are Way Up:**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFXARC1M027SBEA) I'm assuming restaurant visits do not count under this statistic, so this would explain a rotation from $ spent at restaurants to $ spent buying groceries instead. Basically a simple rotation / distortion that should eventually revert towards the baseline.
   * [**Furniture &amp; Home Improvement Products Surged Enormously:**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DHLCRC1Q027SBEA) Being in lockdown, people bought tons of new items for home-improvement due to spending more time in their homes. 
   * [**Auto Purchases Went Through the Roof:**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DMOTRC1Q027SBEA) As mentioned, a lot of people used their stimulus $ to buy big ticket goods (homes, autos, etc). This was also encouraged strongly by lower interest rates.
* [**Meanwhile, Services Lagged**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ND000350Q)**:** This shouldn't be too surprising since a lot of services account for the leisure sector of the economy that was hit hardest by lockdowns and continues to be affected.
   * [**Healthcare Services are Down Overall:**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DHLCRC1Q027SBEA) Covid scared a lot of people away from getting medical care, so a lot of people stopped getting non-mandatory healthcare. Also, for a while, hospitals suspended non-essential services, preventing a lot of healthcare from being administered.
   * [**Recreation Services Fell off a Cliff:**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCARC1Q027SBEA) Probably not a huge surprise here similar to restaurants.
   * [**Food Service Got Hammered:**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFSARC1Q027SBEA) This is probably the least surprising item on here for most people. Basically, restaurants got killed. 

To be honest, most of this is pretty obvious. Many people have been aware that there were these huge shifts in consumer behavior, but despite this, I still see a ton of linear extrapolation of these trends into the distant future. There are some strong implications and considerations that need to be taken from this rotation with regard to the pent up demand narrative. 

**\*\*For all the items that we have been anticipating pent-up demand, we also need to consider the whiplash effects from the other types of goods that saw excess demand pulled forward.\*\***

* Most of the services that got killed during 2020 are not the type of goods that you would anticipate tons of excess demand coming out in 2021. 
   * For example, if you didn't go on a vacation in 2020 due to Covid, that doesn't mean you're likely to take an extra vacation in 2021. 
   * The full-year of avoiding restaurants may have a modest impact in people wanting to get out in 2021, but I don't think the rebound will make up for all the $ lost by any means. 
   * People are not likely going to be going to ***excess*** sporting events, movies, or amusement parks in 2021 simply because they didn't go to these events in 2020. More likely, we'll just return close to the baseline of where we were previously.
   * Healthcare services likely ***will*** see a surge in pent-up demand due to the necessity of healthcare overall. 
* **Durable Goods Purchases Likely Brought Forward Future Demand.**
   * If you're one of the many people who bought a car during 2020, odds are, you aren't going to purchase another car in 2021. This is a big deal to be honest - the amount of autos purchased far exceeded the well-discussed cash for clunkers program that was popular after the 08' financial crisis.
   * While it's harder to say where demand will or won't be on this, I would take a guess that home-improvement type items will drop back to the baseline level or perhaps go even lower. This will show up as a big drop due to base effects year over year.
   * Groceries and food purchases will likely start to rotate back towards being spent on the food service category.

**\*\*Key Takeaways From the Great Consumer Rotation\*\***

* There will likely be a slight amount of pent-up demand that comes out upon opening up, but just like when lockdowns began, there will likely be quite a few losers as a result of this in addition to the winners.
* Pay attention to base effects and whether demand is likely to be carried forward. At least, if you're looking at earnings an profitability to determine the direction of a company, this is a good way to get a decent read on sector allocation. 
* If you're staying super-long in one of the lockdown winner stocks that shot up 5x in the past year, I would take some serious consideration into at least rebalancing and not allowing your risk exposure to be stuck entirely in a sector that is going to have impossible earnings comps to beat.

# Putting it All Together + Looking to The Future

**So what are the actionable takeaways here? (Just sharing some of my personal opinions - take them FWIW**

1. I don't really think that the idea of pent-up demand is going to be nearly as strong as some think, and in some instances, it will be the opposite since we're looking at excess demand pulled forward via stimulus and consumer rotation. This is 100% subject to change via new stimulus measures however. Regardless, as an example, I wouldn't want to be invested in the auto sector as we come further into 2020, especially the legacy automakers who can't see their stock rise simply off of narrative. On the other hand, there may be value looking into things like healthcare services.
2. We did have a shit ton of excess savings, especially in the spring and summer of 2020. But most of those savings were either used, or went into paying down debt or investing in the future. While these are all good, none of these things indicate the idea that consumers have a glut of $ they're waiting to spend on post-covid consumption. I think there will be some savings &amp; pent up demand, and people surely will want to spend money on the things they couldn't do in 2020. But I'm not sure if it would exceed the long term baseline levels and I think it'll only occur in select sectors.
3. We are looking at some of the biggest economic whiplashes we've ever seen in markets as base effects come into play. The post-covid base-effect whiplashes likely won't be as big as the initial shocks, but I personally think they are going to catch many by surprise - especially because they aren't all going to be positive. Most of this likely won't start to become apparent until the 2nd half of 2021. The question is whether investors will care about these with such a stark detachment from having a care about present earnings right now.
4. If people were hypothetically going to use a lot of that 36% chunk of savings from the past stimulus for consumption in 2021, they would likely have to liquidate a lot of $ from equity holdings. So any thought of the idea that making use of that big chunk of savings is going to be positive for equity markets may not be so sound. It all hinges on the misconceived notion that the savings rate is all just money people have sitting in bank accounts waiting to be spent. The reality is, most of that huge savings rate glut is the very thing that propped markets up throughout 2020. Remove that and markets probably start to deflate a bit.
5. We are likely going to see more stimulus in the future with a dem majority now. While a lot of people don't like to talk politics on here (understandably), we're in a time where politics matter more than almost any other time to markets since ww2. More stimulus will possibly keep a lot of the effects going we've seen this year, although there IS a limit to this. The question of how that $ goes to consumers matters a lot - especially for markets. For example, continuing stimulus check spending will affect markets and the economy far differently than investing in a major infrastructure renewal program. 
6. There still is no free lunch in markets, even if it may seem like it right now. Stimulus was 100% necessary, and will likely continue to be necessary to try to come out of the hole we're all in. With that said, if inflation rises and yields don't, inflation itself will cause a lot of problems in the economy. On the other hand, if yields rise higher than inflation itself, that will cause direct financial tightening. This is the main constraint on the ability to keep stimulating, and inflation doesn't necessarily need to go that high to cause problems in the economy. Remember that in 2018, interest rates at 3% forced the fed to lower their rates due to markets starting to throw fits and threatening recession, and that was a much less indebted and much healthier economy. The more indebted an economy is, the less it can tolerate increases in inflation before causing things to break (and subsequently reverting back to deflation). This is especially true when facing cost-push inflation which we are more likely to see vs. demand pull inflation.
7. So long as stimulus and market support is on the table, I would expect volatile markets that can keep going up. There is a feedback loop in this belief structure that can keep markets going higher and provide a floor on selloffs. With that said, what I mention in point 6 is what will cause the clock to eventually strike midnight in my opinion, and markets ***may*** start to price this in somewhat in advance (whenever that is). With the new year just starting, I would suggest people take stock of their risk tolerance, goals, and time frame just to be aware of how they're positioned. Either way, I would personally expect intense periods of volatility both up and down followed by quiet grinding higher, frustrating people who are bearish.
8. Looking through consumer spending data, we've more or less come back to the base already, which makes sense when looking at income and savings levels also going back to the baseline. Some of this of course is a result of the winter Covid surge. With that said, I do not think $600 stimulus checks are going to be enough to make a huge dent in consumer spending unlike previous stimulus packages, but they should at least help keep some of the lights on. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far - this took a while to put together, but I  at least had a good bit of the information in here already saved. I'll probably be slow to respond to this thread over the next day or two.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off unsubsidized loans while in college?,"Hello,

I'm currently a senior entering my last semester. At this time, I have approximately $22,000 in outstanding federal student loan debt, and will finish with around $24,000 after this semester's aid is disbursed. I've signed a full time offer for a good job that will start at the beginning of 2022. 

Approximately $6,000 of that $22,000 is unsubsidized and is currently accruing interest. I have around $15,000 of liquid capital currently and I want to go ahead and pay off those unsubsidized loans while still in school. Before I do so, I wanted to check and make sure that I wasn't missing anything significant. From everything I've read, this is the most prudent thing to do since I don't want to try to outpace the interest rate on these loans by investing or anything. 

Ultimately I just wanted to confirm that I'm making the right choice here and not missing anything obvious. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Student Loan Advice,"Hello, seeking some advice on how to approach my student loans.

Government load. I have $25k in principal left on the loan. Variable interest rates among them. Monthly payment is usually around 500. 

Recently moved back with parents like so many others during COVID so my monthly expenses are way down (used to rent a 2br in NYC). The $500/month wasn’t a strain before this, though. I’m really looking to optimize the best use of the money.

Right now all interest is 0 and no payments at least until Jan 31 (Biden says he’s going to extend this)

Options as I see it:
1) Keep paying the minimum once the COVID help runs out and invest income elsewhere.
2) Pay the entire balance once the COVID help runs out (I have enough in liquid assets), or some structured repayment of full principal of each loans starting with highest interest rates.
3) Try to refinance and negotiate a much lower rate after COVID
4) some hybrid or other option that i’m missing?

Basically should I be getting financially free now or wait a bit to invest and out earn interest? 

Thanks in advance everyone! I don’t really post on reddit so if i messed up please excuse me, this has just been stuck in my head a while.

personalfinance,I have student loans and a car loan worth roughly the same with very similar interests rates. Which one does it make sense to refinance first?,"The last hit on my credit was roughly a year ago when I purchased a new car. Since then I've seen my credit score increase and I feel like its time to think about refinancing some of my debt. 

First off, my car loan has about 13k left with an 8.533% interest rate on a 72 month term.(loan was for 15.5k) Its a loan with Ally and the cost of it includes an added warranty I've put on the car. Not sure if that effects refinancing in any way but I felt it could be important to mention. 

I've got a loan with Sallie Mae with a balance of roughly 9.5k (original loan for 12k) with an 8.375% interest rate. This one was for 84 months and I'm about 2 years in.
My other student loan is with discover and has about 3k left on a 7.215% rate. (Originally for 4k) This one is also an 84 month loan but since it was a significantly smaller loan I've been paying this off faster and I'm on schedule to pay it off in about 1.5-2 years.

Can I refinance all of them without tanking my credit? Can I consolidate my student loans? If I should only do one, which one should be my priority? In my mind the car loan makes most sense because it has the highest balance and rate. Although, my knowledge on this is super limited as this will be my first time trying this so if there's a reason to focus on student loans please educate me!
Also if anyone knows trustworthy sites for shopping around for different rates that would be useful. I tried looking around last night and now my phones flooded with loan ads so im not sure what to trust now",finance

personalfinance,"With current interest rates, does a 30 year mortgage make more sense (and cents) than a 15?","Looked through the PF Wiki (thanks for that btw) and didn't see this answered, so I'll post and let the mods decide if it's relevant. 

## Background:

Talked to my lender on Friday and, as many are aware, rates are really low right now. We refinanced last May to a 2.75% on a 30 year VA Loan. Could lock in at a 1.99% for a 30 or a 1.74% for a 15 as of Friday. The payment on the 15 year is actually less than what the payment on the initial 30 year was when we purchased the house, so we can comfortably make the payments for the 15 if we go that route. 

### Rough Numbers:
1. Difference between payments is roughly $650
1. Total interest on the 15 year mortgage is roughly $33,000
1. Total interest on the 30 year mortgage is roughly $80,000
1. Difference between the two is $47,000
 1. This is strictly the difference between the interest amounts and does not include any differences in fees, taxes, insurance, etc., etc. 
 1. Essentially, this is saying that once the house is paid for, it would be $47,000 cheaper if I went with the 15 year loan, right?
1. If I went with the 30 year loan, took the $650 difference and put that in a brokerage account (or something) with an average 2% compounding interest rate (pretty conservative by my understanding, just used to illustrate), after 30 years 
 1. I'd have contributed $234,000
 1. The account would be valued at $316,400
 1. $316,000 - $234,000 = $82,000
 1. $82,000 &gt; $47,000 (by $35,000)
1. I'm in my 30's, so I won't be retiring anytime soon

## Question:

With interest rates this low, isn't it cheaper to borrower money for 30 years and reallocate what would be going towards a 15 year payment to another investment? 

I understand that there's risk involved with investments and some may think the housing market is the safer ""bet"" here, but running quick numbers I'm struggling to see why the 30 year path isn't the more ""profitable"" path. What am I missing?

stocks,Clean Energy Fuels Corp. ($CLNE) - DD Inside.,"Before I get started, this is my first full-DD post, so please be nice in the comments and please provide me feedback on what I should/should not include! Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks &lt;3. 

**What and who is Clean Energy Fuels Corp?**

The company is THE leading provide of the cleanest fuel, Natural Gas, for the transportation market in the United States and Canada. They primarily focus in on:

1. Regional Fleets of Trucks 
2. Heavy Duty Trucking
3. Airport Transit 
4. Public Transit 
5. Construction Vehicles
6. Waste Management Vehicles (Dump trucks) 

It’s products consist of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). One of its leading products is something called Redeem, which is a form of renewable natural gas (RNG), won’t bother getting into how it’s composed, but know that it provides up to 70% reduction in greenhouse gasses versus diesel and gasoline. Redeem itself is made from organic waste from landfills and farms. 

**Natural Gas** 

There has been a lot of stigma around what it really means to be “clean” or “green” when it comes to transportation; most of us think that Electric Vehicles seem to be the most green product for transportation out there. EV’s are definitely the future, I just want to state that before getting started spewing out more information, but RNG has huge demand and can definitely lead the way for clean energy. The company itself reduced 745,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions and more than 401,000,000 gallons were sold in 2019. 

This may come as a surprise, but how clean is natural gas? Based only minimal research, it looks to be cleaner than the “electric truck” provided by companies like $HYLN. 

**Emission Comparison:** 

1. Natural Gas Truck - Produces 0.02g/bhp/hr of NO

2. Electric Truck - Produces 0.07g/bhp/hr of NO

3. Diesel Truck - Produces 0.2g/bhp/hr of NO

**Financials &amp; Valuations (as of 9/30/2020):** 

* Current Market Capitalization (as of 1/8/2021) - $2.032B
* Total Revenue (3 months): $70,886,000
* Total Revenue (9 months): $216,766,000
* Net Profit (Loss) – 3 months: ($2,539,000) – Down from ($5,375,000)
* Net Profit (Loss) – 9 months: ($8,677,000) – Down from ($25,964,000)
* Cash on Hand: $91,605,000

The financials of Clean Energy are not very special, yes they have a high PE ratio, but in this market, really anything is possible. The point is the opportunity, with Biden supplementing a lot of stimulus into the clean energy market, Clean Energy Fuels Corp is poised to get a large piece with it being such a staple within the Natural Gas industry. 

**Partnerships &amp; Programs:**

**1.** **Chevron** 

Chevron partnered with CLNE on July 8th, 2020 with the announcement of the **Adopt-a-Port program**. This will allow fleets across North America to subsidize costs transitioning into a greener product for transportation with cost advantages. Chevron will provide funding for Adopt-a-Port and supply RNG to Clean Energy stations near the ports. Chevron’s funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new RNG-powered trucks. Clean Energy, meanwhile, will manage the program, including offering fueling services for qualified truck operators.

**2.** **Total SE**

Total is a very large company focusing in refining petroleum. They are the largest shareholder of CLNE @ 26% of outstanding shares. Again, a large company partnering with CLNE to produce revenues in the current year and future years. With Total SE, they’ve partnered with CLNE in a joint venture (valued at around $145 million) to launch the Zero Now Program. The **Zero Now Program** allows companies to purchase a natural gas truck for the same price as they could buy a diesel truck; in the combined deal, they would also offer a discount for fuel up until an agreed time to help persuade the companies to go greener. 

**3.** **BP** 

The third partner is BP, CLNE recently announced that it will work with BP to develop, own, and operate RNG facilities at dairies and other agriculture facilities that will produce Redeem. The deal is quite small but could mean big things if the partnership were to be progressed through time. 

**4.** **Waste Connections** 

Waste connections is the 3rd largest waste collections company in North America, based on market cap, they’re currently worth around $40B. They’ve been a partner with CLNE for years, and have recently promoted one of their regional fleets of dump trucks to RNG vehicles, and will begin operating with Redeem as soon as possible. The fleet consists of 110 trucks in the San Jose area. The deal itself isn’t that great, I must admit, but this could mean big things as if the trial goes well in the San Jose area, this could mean upgrades to their regional fleets across the United States and possibly into Canada. 

**5.** **Republic Services** 

Another large company with a long partnership history with Clean Energy Fuels Corp. In February 2019, they announced that they will utilize increasing amounts of Redeem fuel across 21 states over the next 5 years, and this is in process. This transition to cleaner fuel will represent 250,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emission reduction each year, which translates to around 53,000 passenger vehicles to be taken off the road. 

**Summary of Partnerships &amp; Programs** 

These partnerships will continue to provide Clean Energy Fuels Corp. with recurring revenues to drive growth across North America. Their recent and past partnerships continue to give rise to increasing demand of natural gas in one of the largest industries that demands fuel of this nature. The programs in place: Zero Now &amp; Adopt-a-Port program were introduced and will drive growth in the industry by providing incentives to adopting RNG vehicles instead of gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. There are a lot of advantages to adopting Redeem: 

* 70% reudction in greenhouse gases
* Cost efficient - offered at $1.00/gallon. 
* Renewable 
* Domestic - Moving North America towards energy independence. 

**Growth &amp; Opportunities** 

With most of the world in lockdown, and the rise of eCommerce and the need for shipping and delivery services, this will drive the demand for their Redeem product. Companies like UPS, Kroger, FedEx and Republic Services have already signed up for large deals to use the product as a substantially lower cost then Diesel or Gas. The cost of Redeem is $1.00/gallon to give you perspective. Volume growth for their Redeem Product in the past 3 years averaged 34.67% growth; and this was before the Pandemic. 

The Heavy-Duty Truck industry is one of the largest markets for fuel consumption, and so the opportunities are endless to gain more market share as governments are demanding for greener transportation. The Heavy-Duty trucing industry demands 35 billion gallons of fuel, 30 billion over any other market in the big-rig industries. 

There are a lot of opportunities for future advancement throughout the space by making partnerships that will be mutually beneficial for both the world, CLNE, and the company involved. Companies that currently use Natural Gas for their national fleets include: Honda, FritoLay, FedEx, Anheuser Busch, Verizon, Bimbo, J&amp;J, Waste Management, Republic Services, Home Depot, Lowes, AT&amp;TT, Costco, Colgate-Palmolive, PepsiCo, UPS, HP, Unilever, Starbucks, Amazon, Kraft, Kroger, and McDonalds. These companies are large, and there is huge potential for future partnerships with them. 

**Other Notes** 

You may be asking yourself: “that’s not really that impressive, why should I invest?” Well, the recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. Government’s are transitioning to non-gas related vehicles and this will continue to be progressed for years to come. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation. 

The CEO owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company! 

**Price Targets**

Some people may be curious of my price targets for CLNE. It’s been on an absolute tear recently, so I apologize for the late post, but this is just the beginning! My conservative price target is $20 by June 2021, $40 by end of 2022; this is pretty much guessing lol, so take it with a grain of salt. 

**Disclosure:** 

Do your own due diligence before investing, this is just my personal opinion on the company, and this is not financial advice of any kind! I’m not liable for any losses that you guys might incur! But I do believe in this company!",finance
vet,Please help,My family growing up has always fed some outside cats. We recently moved last year but still own our old house. Once everyday we go to feed the outside cats and then come back. For the past month there has been a cat outside that comes up to me and is really affectionate. I fell in love with it and planned to maybe take it home. I should probably mention that many of these cats have diseases and are normally a little sick. But a week ago I went to go feed the cats and the affectionate cat was gone. I kept searching and it randomly appeared a few days after being gone. I was relieved until I saw that it had a hard time keeping its balance. I immediately freaked out and went to tell my mom. She told me it would pass and it’s fine. The next day she went to feed the cats and told me that the cat was doing really good and not tipping over at all. We had hopes that it was just getting better until today. My mother said it started to tip again and couldn’t keep its balance. After it ate food and drank water it seemed to be a little stronger but still tipping over a little. My mom thought that it had maybe been hit by a car. I would believe that but it makes no sense to how it was miraculously better a day ago. I don’t know what to do. Do I just let the sickness pass and hope for the best?I really wanna take it to the vet but it’s not open til tomorrow and an emergency call in is too much money.

Bitcoin,Stop Making Cents,"As money printing rolls back into fashion, we can either suspend our belief on what stable value is, or, unhinge our reality and watch fiscal fantasies flow forth in the form of unchecked money creation. If the solution to preventing another financial crisis, is a carbon copy of the previous, which served only to magnify the problem, then eventually the methodology reaches saturation, and cannot sustain its own weight. Printing money in order to paste over the systemic cracks, means instability is likely to increase in proportion to the insufficiencies of the patch-up job. Historically, money printing has lead to runaway inflation, and to pretend this time around will be any different is fanciful at best. The money makers who are desperately hoping to keep it under control are colluding in pathological delusion, delicately formulating partial truths in order to evade detection in their perpetual misrepresentation. The printed money sifts through the fingers of the ruling elite who take their cut, before the remaining slivers eventually reach the desperate hands of the commoner. Those who, in a post covid land, will be wondering why bother going to work at all if the government can just rain down dollars as required? The banality of chasing dollars via the daily grind will lose its’ appeal, if the big brother will pay all the bills. 

Somewhere between these extremes there will need to be a reality check, possibly coming in the form of cryptocurrencies, and the frontrunner, Bitcoin. However, whilst its’ volatility remains high, the perceived price instability will not fit in with the supposed rigidity of our contemporary currency landscape. Seen as a seed project, Bitcoin is still in the nursery phase, it has taken root, it has broken ground and sprouted shoots, now it must reach for the light beyond the canopy above. In order to reach its greatest potential, it must grow substantially, and its the battle between long-term potential and short-term realisation which fuels the conjecture over value. If the value per coin in 2030 is to be millions of dollars in todays terms, the potential upside to investment is a no-brainer, but how does the price move from thousands, to millions, and what will be the fluctuations along the way? 

What is the utility of Bitcoin, why is its’ price increasing, and why does it have such fluctuation in value? One argument against the utility of the cryptocurrency is that, while the nominal value is fluctuating to any great degree, it will not be accepted as a global mechanism of currency. It makes a fairly good point in this world where we can reasonably expect to know on any given day what a dollar will buy, be it a US dollar, Kiwi dollar, or an Argentinian peso? The value is in the denomination, and the belief that the structured group behind it, i.e. that government, is trustworthy enough to support the value of that denomination in the future. It follows from this to ask where the solid ground is within contemporary currencies, and what is the fluctuation or stability in our contemporary monetary system?

Firstly consider the way most of the largest successful companies have grown. Google’s rise from a small company in the mid-late 90s can provide an example of monetary value exploding into being. With two rounds of start-up funding to the tune of $100k and $1m respectively, Google then launched an IPO reaching a value in 2004 of $22bn, and went on to todays value at $600bn. The company’s monetary value leapt due to belief in its future potential. Jeff Bezos staked $250k of the initial $1m, and if he still held that shareholding today, its value would be around $1.5bn. Peter Theil was an early investor in Facebook with a $500k stake in 2004, and chose to sell much of his shares soon after their 2012 IPO, netting him some $400mn, yet if he was still holding those shares today, they would be valued over $5bn. These are high-end examples of where financial value is conjured up from broadly held belief in a product or service, even if Elon Musk (co-founder of PayPal with Theil) correctly states that Tesla shares are horrendously over valued, yet the share value continues to skyrocket. The value is carried on the belief in the projection of future growth, and future earnings, then formalised into value by wrapping it up in a ‘shares’ structure. The huge gains are speculative, and if you back the right horse, the gains are spectacular. 

All of that is to say, this is one way money is ‘created’ in modern economies. Speculation, investment, being ‘in the know’, or, in the right social group, all open doors to wealth creation opportunities which make money appear like magic. In recent times, finance has become a majority revenue source, even for primary producers. The worlds largest companies have a finance wing which can make money, …from money. Tesla, General Electric, and Caterpillar all gain more from their finance or investment divisions, than from their core business or product sales. Similarly, the banking sector creates money by charging interest, in a multi-level distribution racket which starts at the reserve bank level, then filters down to the smaller institutions who all take a cut along the way. 

Couple all of these money creation mechanisms, then add in the derivatives market (the covert mass grave of banker created debt, speculated value to be somewhere between $12tn, and anywhere up to $1quadrillion) and it becomes obvious that money really is able to make more money, that is, if you have lots of it, or are part of the system which enables it. High speed trading is yet another example, whereby computer algorithms do all the work, every billionth of a second. It is independent of human input, as mortal tinkering is too slow, and susceptible to error, and/or emotion. “Making money” is not something which is done at a 9-5 job, thats earning a wage. “Making money” is now the plutocratic lovechild spawned by the tech era, mobilised by the banking system, and pardoned by political manipulation. These benevolent money creation strategies are revered as the framework which is driving humanity forward, but there is a sleight of hand which is benefitting those holding the cards, syphoning a little from the lot, with the potential downside that all the cards coming crashing down. 

Underlying all this money creation, is the money itself. Modern currencies have stolen a march on the perception of stability, insofar as the perceptual units passed around are tangibly constant, i.e. a dollar note is a dollar, same as it was last year, same as it will be tomorrow. A worthy currency has many key attributes, which must include being durable, fungible, portable, divisible, cognisable, of stable value, and formerly, malleable. However, inflation, wealth creation, corporate creativity, banks creating interest, and money printing, means the number of dollar units on the planet right now is eternally increasing, watering down the value of that dollar unit. Perhaps the quality of malleability which was a function of precious metals has been hijacked by money printing. The sudden addition of $4.1tn to the balance sheet of the US Federal Reserve in April 2020, an instantaneous increase of 18% divined out of the ether by government fiat, should, in theory, devalue the US dollar. However, all nations have pulled the same lever, so whilst other countries are watering down their currencies simultaneously, the relative value holds up. Foreign exchange rates fluctuate with the fortunes of a nation, or can command a premium if that nation is powerful militarily. And all of this during a period of ‘stagflation’ where global growth is grinding to a halt. Many economies are under immense pressure as the effects of the pandemic force entire industries to shut down, removing income streams which were formerly seen as essential to the commonweal. The strained spokes on the wobbly wheel of fiat currency, are stretched beyond belief, so an alternative has been created which has the potential to diminish centralised tyrannical control, and distribute standardised value across the globe.  

The alternative to rampant extension of unit supply, is to fix the number of units, yet allow the units greater divisibility. Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million units (coins) which will be available, of which 18.6 million are already in circulation today, with the remaining 2.4 million to be earned by the validators (miners) over the upcoming 120 years. Bitcoin is divisible down to the 8th decimal point, so the smallest unit is equivalent to less than cents in todays money. Units below one bitcoin are known as satoshis, or sats, and there are one hundred million sats per bitcoin. A basic food item, say a burger, at 15USD today, will cost you 75000 sats if bitcoin is at 20,000USD. When Bitcoin is at USD500k, that will become 3000 sats, and at USD1mn, 1500 sats. If, at that point, the value of bitcoin was to fluctuate by USD5000, the value of that burger will change by 7.5 sats, or the equivalent of 0.0015 cents in todays money. More likely tho, once global adoption has taken place over the coming years, fluctuation will decrease, and stability will the norm. Whilst Bitcoin is finding its feet, the price remains speculative, particularly as parasitic day traders look to skim profits off the price variations, creating in turn, further volatility. As the price moves higher, more hodlers will be committed to the asset class, allowing a steady state price increase which will reflect its ongoing value. 

If the complaint levelled at Bitcoin lays in the large swings in value, sometimes 10-15% in a day, a better understanding of scarcity as a key market force is required. True scarcity, a key driver behind the value of gold, is derived by supply and demand forces, and the core belief of worth which that asset holds. If more people want to hold that asset, and supply is limited, the value appreciates accordingly. Bitcoin cannot be extended, added to, printed, watered down, or altered… the number of units is set. As the world wakes up to this, in parallel with realising the falsehood of fiat currencies, the demand to be holding an asset with an appreciating value, where all other currencies are fading, is going to rise. The choice will be simple, hold an asset with an infinite supply of a devaluing unit, or an asset with a finite supply of an increasingly valuable unit.

For the doubters who swallow the distortion that energy consumed by crypto is some degree of magnitude out of whack with its utility, think for a moment about the resources going into keeping the lights on within the incumbent system. The energy used to run the computers, the lighting, air conditioning, security, cash movement, marketing programs, commuting of staff, and slush funds for executives, across entire countries, at the retail branch, secondary lender, merchant bank, shadow banking, and reserve bank levels, are too large to attempt to equate. That is without mention of the financial cost required to keep those lights on, and the multi-layered wealth syphoning which occurs at each level of the fiscal system. Cryptocurrencies have no staff, no management, very little real estate, and no cooking the books to benefit a privileged few.

Bitcoin represents an evolution in the capacity of humanity to raise the standard of fairness across all people. The removal of tampering with the value of currencies for the benefit of the wealthy elite may be about to end. A non-corruptible currency heralds an honest approach to monetary policy which will not favour debt creation as a means of stimulating economic growth. Currency wars have been historically used as a means to an end for dominant nations to subjugate less powerful economies, fuelling the frictions which lead to hot-wars. A decentralised currency removes borders from economic dominance battles, allowing better market flows which are outside of governmental manipulations, leading to true market price discovery for goods. In turn, this will heavily disturb the global marketplace in the short term, as various sectors adjust to life free from subsidies and sanctions, but eventually the new standard will raise the bar for nationstate equality. 

At the personal level, it’s the paradigm shift from the incumbent monetary system, to a decentralised sovereign digital asset which will be most difficult for newcomers to accomodate. Moving from a trusted third party (banks) to facilitate the security of one’s wealth, to a trust-less network where one assumes full responsibility for one’s assets, represents a seismic shift in mental approach. Renouncing long held reliance and trust in a banking system, is as significant a shift as that of a religious awakening, or a religious denunciation, or any other shift in ones’ core beliefs. The switch to crypto requires a monumental leap of faith, from the lazy reliance on our contemporary banking practices, to a new self-responsible approach with a product which manages financial security as a core feature of its’ system. As global bankings’ internal frauds are exposed by the integrity of a more equitable system, the eventual realisation will compel the incumbent to review it’s policies, and scramble to adjust to a less self-serving model. 

Finally, it must also be understood that the Bitcoin future is as a store of wealth, rather than a transactional cryptocurrency. There are many other cryptocurrencies which will cater to the varying needs of payment systems, smart contracts, lending, derivatives, and possibly also, governance. The technology has emerged and is proliferating, the inevitable change is happening, all that remains is to decide at which level you can no longer delay your entry to it. The greatest challenge will be the mental shift away from nanny state monetary management, to a self responsible and trust-less one. This leap of faith will be most difficult for entities or individuals entrenched in the status quo, as the mere idea of sovereign security is diametrically opposed to the well heeled. Starting now, adventurous investors are buying in, which will be followed by alert companies, then banks, and finally each nationstate will need to adopt a position by purchasing Bitcoin to anchor their reserve currencies in a solid store of wealth. At each step will be larger investment sectors, with increasingly permanent retention plans, whilst simultaneously the quantity of Bitcoin sellers will be tapering off, leading to significant demand and decreasing supply, adding further price jumps at each stage. Bitcoin is set to become the standard unit of account against which all other currencies will be valued, along the way holding the fiat system to account for its inequity.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinancing mortgage,"Hi. 
I bought a house for the first time in 2019. Due to the pandemic and economic crisis, interest rates have dropped and I’ve been intermittently receiving pamphlets and emails from the mortgage company about refinancing at a lower rate. I’ve always ignored them because I don’t wish to pay closing costs and would rather just make the monthly payments. 
Recently I’ve received mail that offers refinance with no closing costs for me to pay, the bank pays. This offer is attractive to me. 
My question is is there a known catch to this? I’m planning to call the bank and talk to them this week and ask more questions. 
Are there any pitfalls I should avoid and any specific questions I should ask? 
Thanks very much.",finance

stocks,Suggestions on what do with my covered calls?,"Hello folks,

I would like to have some advice on what do with my ITM Covered Calls. Last year, at the height of the pandemic, I sold some AAPL covered calls expires 01/15/21 for a good premium. Of course, I did not anticipate the &gt;80% run AAPL had last year after the stock split. My CCs are deep in the money now.

I believe AAPL might have more to run in the near term with blockbuster iPhone 12 sales etc., But I don't think it can sustain $2T+ valuation when the interest rates eventually go up.

I see 3 options:

1. Sell 50% my AAPL position and buy back the CCs taking the loss. This means I get to keep the upside of my remaining 50% AAPL shares.
2. Let the shares be called, keep the premium and reinvest the money in some ETFs.
3. Roll out the option further. This means I hold the bags but wait for a dip opportunity to buy back the calls at much cheaper price, while I keep collecting dividends.

Any thoughts? I am leaning towards options #1 and #2 - It helps me take advantage in case 2021 has a insane run like 2020.",finance
personalfinance,"Ex Ran Up Credit Card, Worried Sick","My wife was divorced in 2017. Her and her ex-husband had a joint credit card, which he told her he closed. The divorce decree said that there was no debt at time of divorce, and any future debt will be the responsibility of the party incurring that debt.

Today we submitted a pre-approval mortgage loan application and it came up that my wife has $12k outstanding debt from that “closed” credit card. She ran a credit report and found out that a large purchase was made with this credit card in 2018, a year after the divorce. 

We’re worried that this will interfere with the mortgage process, and increase the interest rate we need to pay. Her ex-husband has completely severed ties and she has no way of getting in contact with him.

personalfinance,I want to pay off a credit card that someone else opened for me in their name.,"I am a student and when I started school my very supportive partner of many years (we are not married) opened a credit card for me to use for school expenses. Their income and credit score are both much higher than mine, so I had no options and they had many. This credit card is entirely in their name (not co-signed or anything) and has a balance of almost $10,000. I have been making monthly payments to them, but if possible I would like to get a loan to pay off their balance because it is starting to affect their debt-to-income ratio and be a strain on our relationship. I would like to pay off the balance to their bank so that I can take the debt elsewhere in my name and make monthly payments to someone else. What are my options? Do I have any?

My credit score is low (around 600) and my main income is low ($15,000/year). I am also self-employed and sometimes I sell work or get commissions, so I also occasionally make larger sums of money at various points in the year (several hundred-several thousand dollars depending on the project). I may be able to pay off a loan early when this happens next, but it is not guaranteed and I don't want to wait any longer to pay back my partner. 

Because of my credit score and finances, I receive a lot of predatory loan offers and I am hesitant to take any of them. I am ok with paying a high interest rate and paying more over time if it means taking this debt away from my partner. I feel confident that at some point in the next few years I would be able to pay off this debt early when I receive payment for a gig so that I why I don't really mind the high interest rate. I am able to pay a max of $300/month. All I have been able to find online are predatory options that I don't trust or options that deny me because of my poor credit. Is what I am wanting to do even an option for me? Who can I trust? 

I really, truly appreciate any help with this matter. It is weighing very heavily on me. Please do not criticize my and my partner's choices. We are aware of our mistakes. I am just asking for help with solving the predicament we are currently in. Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Is it better to invest than pay off debt if the ROI is only marginally higher than interest rate?,"Financial theory recommends that if your after-tax return on investments is greater than your after-tax cost of debt then you should invest. 

I can see why this would be the case if the ROI is significantly higher (ex: 7% vs 2.5%), but I was looking at an example where the difference was much lower, and it appeared to me that paying off the debt immediately was better. Can someone explain if/why I'm wrong? Here's the example:

* ROI = 3% APY
* Interest Rate = 2.5% APR
* Debt = $15,000
* Term = 15 years

You suddenly have $15,000. You can either:

1. invest the $15,000 at an ROI of 3% while making the minimum monthly payment on your loan ($100/month)
2. pay off your debt and begin investing the $100/month payments at an ROI 0f 3%

My calculations in this scenario say that at the end of the 15 years:

1. You have paid $18,000 on your loan and now have $23,511 invested, so you netted $5,511
2. You have paid $15,000 on your loan and now have $22,697 invested, so you netted $7,697

You make out better in case 2, where you pay off the loan first.

Am I thinking about this wrong, or is there actually some point where the difference between ROI and interest is small enough that it is better to pay off the loan?",finance
Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Bull run Over? NO, It's just starting!!","First and foremost, I am not a financial advisor. Do what you want with your money, I couldn't care less. I look at facts and base predictions around those facts. If you see flaws in my logic, feel free to comment, I always am looking for different perspectives that I may have not thought of. At the end of the day, you proving me wrong is ultimately going to save me money.  

I am hearing a lot of talk from people believing that this bull run is coming to an end. From my experience in the traditional and crypto markets I do not find that to be the case. Here are the reasons that I believe that bitcoin (and altcoins) are just getting started. 

1.) **Liquidity = Gains:** There has been a lot of liquidity being added both into the traditional and crypto markets over the last few months. From federal stimulus to Tether printing more USDT, both are creating massive amounts of liquidly to the market. With Biden expecting to push a multi-trillion dollar [Stimulus plan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/08/biden-stimulus-plan/), this will only continue to push asset prices up. Also, with USDT continuing to print more tether, I do not see this stopping any time soon even with the the NY attorney General down there throats. Court cases are long and drawn out. Even after they receive all documents they requested, it is highly unlikely that Tether will be deemed a security that same day. I am no attorney or law expert, so correct me if I am wrong, but I believe this process could take at least a few more months before tether is deemed a security. During this waiting period I believe tether will operate as usual and keep on printing USDT before they get the hammer. 

2.) **US Inflation and currency debasement:** Those who believe that inflation is currently happening are wrong. Inflation has not even started yet. The [Inflation Rate](https://usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/#:~:text=The%20annual%20inflation%20rate%20for,at%208%3A30%20a.m.%20ET) for the 12 month year ending in November 2020 was only 1.2%. Considering that the feds previous goal was to keep the inflation rate at 2% and we were below that even after printing trillions into existence is astonishing. I believe that the reasoning for this is most likely because not enough people are spending their stimulus money on goods or services. All this money is going to assets which is causing asset prices to increase and keeping inflation low. Inflation occurs when volatility of money increases which in turns increases the CPI (inflation of goods and services). Currently there is a lot of pent up demand for people to go out and start spending money again on goods and services. I do not expect this to start happening until the spring and until then I expect Biden to push for as much stimulus as possible. Once the U.S. starts lightening up on their COVID restrictions, all that free money that was printed will be spent in the real economy. This will shoot up the volatility of money, causing inflation to rise faster than expected, making the dollar go down in value faster than expected. I do not think this will lead to hyper inflation but I do believe this will cause many people to push more money into assets pushing stocks, real estate and crypto even higher. 

3.) **Low interest rates and zero reserve requirements**: Currently interest rates are at zero and that incentivizes people to take out loans. With every loan that is created, that is more money hitting the real economy which in-turn leads to more inflation. Majority of the money that is created comes from bank loans. Even if Biden's stimulus plans get rejected, zero interest rates will be enough of a catalyst for inflation to start to rise as restrictions ease up. In addition, I expect more loans to be provided in years past because the Feds also lowered the reserve requirements to 0%. This means that a bank needs to hold NO MONEY in reserves for them to create a loan. Historically reserve requirements were around 10%, but now with them being zero, we can expect inflation from loans to be a lot higher than normal because banks are no longer required to withhold money from society. 

4.) **Bitcoin cycles:** Bitcoin is programmed to move in 4 year cycles that is centered around the havening event. These cycles usually consist of 2 years of a bull market after the havening and 2 years of a bear market after the  supply shock of bitcoin is realized. Currently there is much demand for bitcoin and sentiment is high, but not at its peak. Personally, I think we just passed the ""Hope"" stage of the ""wall street cheat sheet"". There are still countless skeptics expecting bitcoin to crash and fail. Bitcoin is officially here to stay. Hedge funds, and financial institutions would not be paying billions to create bitcoin products if they believed this was still a fad. The baby boomers are still thinking that bitcoin has no intrinsic value as they don't understand the value of being able to move billions of dollars in a matter of minutes to anyone in the world without a central authority. Once we see these skeptics finally ""understand"" why bitcoin is valuable, I will be looking for this cycle to end.

&amp;#x200B;

I Understand that bitcoin has already went from $3,500 - 40k in only a few months and it is obvious that a correction is coming. But understand that the incoming dip will be short term and I am expecting to see a 6 figure bitcoin before the end of this cycle. 

Again, all this is what I believe what will happen based off what I see, but DYOR. I do not have a crystal ball, no one does. All I know are the facts I listed above and everything else is my personal opinion. Good luck and go make gains.",cryptocurrency

My parents have made the decision to sell their house to me for 500k, as they see it as a good opportunity as the interest rates are low at the moment. The market price for the house is 620k, located in a great area near a major city. My parents and I are willing to pool our money to put down payment for the lowest rate (around 150k/max 200k). I am loaning money from my parents and will be paying them as well. I am extremely blessed and I do not want to miss this opportunity.

I currently make 65k a year, excluding bonus. I am currently actively working towards a position that will increase to salary to around 90-100k and I hope to achieve this this year or maybe next year. I have no passive income. I used to be a huge spender, but have drastically changed my spending habits recently. I do not have much in savings, no other asset apart from a bit of money in 401k, and no extensive credit history (only 3 years) but a good credit score (730). I am around 11k in debt (student loan, credit card) but am very slowly paying this off. 

My main concern is whether or not I am eligible for the low interest rate. I don't think I'm the most ideal candidate for the banks but I believe the down payment can help a bit. But is it enough? What are some of the factors that the banks will consider? Will they look at my savings/assets? I am worried since it's not the strongest at the moment.

MachineLearning,[D] How(when) do you compare two training sessions most fairly ?,"I will give a simple example for context: Say we have a network and we want to try a new cost function.   

Normally, for every training session, validation is done every (lets say) 1000 iterations and a new model is saved. We also save a ""best"" model, whenever the validation cost is at a new  minimum. 

Now, to compare the old and new cost function, we start two training sessions, saving a new model at every 1000 iterations, and saving their ""best"" model, too. 

Say we train them both for 100 epochs (technically, these are not epochs, but 1000 iteration cycles). 

Do we compare the 100th model for each ? Do we compare their ""best"" model ( the model with the absolute lowest validation loss ) or is there a better way ? Because none of the above seem especially fair.

Given the randomness of how data is fed to the network, the weight initialization, dropout layers, etc, even two identical networks might perform differently at the 100 ""epoch"" mark.

stocks,Bearish about current market - looking for strategies,"Hi,

I've been a bull for pretty much all my investment life. However, I can't stop the feeling that we're heading at full speed towards the next dot-com crash. Several reasons for this:

1. A lot of the CARES money went into the stock exchange. There is a statistic that investing into stocks increased by 90% compared to the pre-CARES period for that group of people. 
2. The only thing that can be took from #1 is that, when CARES stops and lockdowns lifted, wouldn't people start pulling that money out? The market normally produces a couple of percent gains per month, I'm seeing a lot of people here who expect 5-10% increases every day. And it makes sense, few people would spend energy in the stock exchange without it being life changing. And that can only happen if you're either investing with a very long term in mind or if you have a small portfolio and need big gains. 
3. Money will come out of the stock exchange and go into the economy, essentially confirming what a lot of people are afraid of: inflation. You can't add 50% to M1 (essentially currency in circulation) in just a year, decrease production because of Covid and not get inflation when everything comes back to normal. Inflation will then trigger all kinds of mechanisms, FED has confirmed that they don't plan to increase interest rates in the next couple of years, but they will need to do something about inflation and I think that will be the end of it.

Now, I know this topic is sensitive to a lot of people and might get downvoted. The best thing that can come out of this is that we debunk all my concerns above which should only strengthen the bulls' investment thesis. I'd very much like to be wrong about this.

For those that share my concerns, what strategies are you looking at? My first thought was long puts on the key hype stocks, but that's quite an expensive bet to make.",finance

Bitcoin,Market dips are healthy: purging dead-weight,"Bitcoin is a healthy asset.

It has corrections and dips.

You know what doesn't correct or dip?

A bubble.

Like the current stock and real estate markets.

Stocks and Real Estate prices have been in a 12 year bubble that only survives while the FED blows hot-air (prints new money in the trillions).

The FED intervention has prevented the stock and real estate markets from doing what they need to PURGE inefficiency and failed ventures.

Usually these corrections happen when failed business goes bankrupt, and their remaining resources get consolidated into new companies. 

Employees that lost jobs get re-distributed to new better performing companies, start new businesses, or shift industries altogether.

Free-markets are the most efficient form of distributing business resources.

But the FED has not allowed this to happen for over 12 years now, by interfering with the free-market corrections.

This created a huge backlog of companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy, and home owners on the verge of losing their property. They only survive with interest-free government loans, like ""mortgage deferrals"".

But these businesses and homeowners cannot produce enough value to survive on their own. This is the crux of the issue.

Because of FED intervention, the bubble burst is going to be 100x worse than it would have been in 2008, had it been left to free-market forces to consolidate the losses.

Bitcoin can't be manipulated.

The price you see is the *fair market price*.

Bitcoin is the truest representation of a fair-market we have on this planet today.

We take our dips and corrections as they happen, we don't postpone them for the future.

But as a result, you know that the price you pay is accurate, that this is a healthy market, it isn't FULL of worthless garbage companies and real estate that are under-water.

Just pure value.

You're buying into pure value without any of the waste.

The stock and real estate bubbles will pop, there's no choice, they have to. Just a matter of when and how it will unfold. Or the inefficiencies will bring down the entire system.

When the FED refuses to allow the market to correct, it is saying to big cap companies: ""you're allowed to fail, and we'll print infinite amounts of money to swallow your losses."" So then the executives are like ""great, so that means you can afford to pay me a $500 million bonus!"" Without restrictions on the money supply, the corruption will only get worse and worse.

Bitcoin cannot be corrupted. Bitcoin is safe from that non-sense.

HODL strong!

Make them pry the Bitcoin out of your cold dead hands! ☃️",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Stock Market News for Today | NIO Stock News | DKNG, PENN &amp; other Stock Market News [01-11]","**Stocks finish at all time highs to close out the first trading week of 2021. What is my opinion on the NIO stock after their latest event? DraftKings &amp; PENN soar after the latest New York developments, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zr3x08Q) leading the way up over 1% and finished the week 2.4% up, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/9ghJQfk) also gaining more than half a percent on Friday and 1.8% for the week while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/w4Xrnvk) rose by 56 points and finished 1.6% higher in the first week of 2021, with all 3 big indexes finishing at new all-time highs. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/vdYffjm) dropping below 22 again, despite a mid-day spike, as the volatility index dropped more than 23% since the high on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/C8xQvsN).

We saw an average [DAY](https://ibb.co/VTPKM80) of trading to close out the week, with average volume and an almost equal number of companies that were advancing compared to the declining ones, as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/gDFHxLf) finished in the green, with consumer Discretionary &amp; Real Estate Leading the way, while the more value heavy industries lagged. For the week though, Energy outperformed, rising by more than 9%, Technology finished flat despite a very bad start to the week after the Georgia election and Real Estate lagged behind, losing 2.5% for the week, as we saw Large-Cap growth companies outperform on [Friday](https://ibb.co/b24dvCn), but in this fresh 2021, small &amp; mid-caps have outperformed.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/G0YW732) from Friday, with big gainers coming mostly in the consumer cyclicals, with Tesla, Alibaba &amp; MercadoLibre posting big gains, while the biggest losers were in the gold industry.

In [THIS](https://ibb.co/MBH11mV) short year though, we can see the huge outperformance of the Energy Sector, the Banks and some other names like Tesla &amp; TSM.

We also got some economic data, with the latest Redfin report showing a 13% increase in home sale [PRICES](https://ibb.co/HV9CqQg) over 2020, as [ACTIVE](https://ibb.co/5nwRLMB) listings of homes for sales keeps on dropping. The listings have seen a 32% decrease since last year to a new all-time low, though, the average sale to list [PRICE](https://ibb.co/vcX1Jpw) ratio finally declined to 99.3%, as the housing market was red hot since June.

While December nonfarm payroll [declined](https://ibb.co/GT72GvR) by 140K, worse than then 75k gains expected and is the first month since April that brings jobs losses with most of the [JOBS](https://ibb.co/hKwgGqN) losses coming from the leisure and hospitality business which has been hit hard again, losing almost half a million jobs, while the unemployment rate did inch lower to 6.7%.

So, this week pretty much starts of the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/7GPMmkJ) season again, with the most interesting ones for me being, Aphria as a read on the cannabis sector, Delta Airlines for a read on how the Airlines are recovering and JP Morgan on Friday, while on the economic front we will see a lot of interesting [DATA](https://ibb.co/X5FVfBB), mostly starting on Wednesday with the Consumer price index and the Federal Budget, while we continue these with the jobless claims on Thursday and more numbers about the economy on Friday.

This week we will also have some [IPOs](https://ibb.co/HKJXY8K) with the most interesting coming from Affirm Holdings, while I really expect to see what Biden [SAYS](https://ibb.co/rpTRtKN) on Thursday as this may be key to a further stimulus or fiscal package.

So, NIO [DAY](https://ibb.co/MBB053y) came and left me with rather somewhat of a disappointment, though I don’t expect most investors to really look at this, so they will probably jump on the stock again this week, so here is a quick recap of what they announced and what is my opinion on NIO:

They announced the first flagship sedan mode, the ET7 which will be [AVAILABLE](https://ibb.co/0jkgfTm) in 2 trim levels with 70 or 100KW battery starting from around $70K and $78K, but the good thing about NIO, and their main competitive advantage is the battery as a service. So, they will make this new sedan available for the same price with either battery pack if you do use the BAAS model at a price of $58K.

They also announced the next gen battery swap stations that can do over 300swaps/day, more than 3x the capability of the current one, as they also plan to build another 400 stations that would bring them to a total of almost 600 by the end of the year.

The “new battery technology” that they announced was the actual thing that disappointed me. So, they announced a 150KW battery with a claimed range of over 600miles, but that should be in perfect conditions, so expect the actual range to be somewhere in 400mile range, pretty much in line with Tesla’s current capabilities. The Launch [DATE](https://ibb.co/9WK8dJW) for the car is still only Q1 2022 while for the “New Solid-State battery” the timeline is for it to be available by the end of 2022. So, the bad thing is that everything is still at least 1 year away and we have to see if the claimed range for the new battery is real.

And there are a couple of big warning signs here with the new battery technology, they actually avoided saying they designed, created or engineered this new tech battery, by saying they will [ADOPT](https://ibb.co/dDDpkm5) this new technology. So, it seems they will adopt this new technology from their current battery supplier CATL. This is an issue as this battery will be available to other manufacturers like Hyundai, Mercedes BMW will get their hands on, so this will not actually be something innovative, ground-breaking or a proprietary solution.

Also, I don’t know how big this new Sedan thing is, because the Sedan market is really dying around the world. This new ET7 isn’t competition for TESLA 3, it’s targeted for competition against the model S, which is already a dying segment as you can see from Tesla’s [SALES](https://ibb.co/smr7vNN).

But on some more positive news, they did announce something better in my opinion, with their Self-Driving Feature, [INCLUDING](https://ibb.co/ss65yw6)11 8megapixel cameras, as their collaboration with [Nvidia](https://ibb.co/C5bNBGK) will produce a super-computer that will generate up to 8Gigabyte/s of data, with the Nvidia CORE estimated to be 7x better than Tesla’s current computer. Though [THIS](https://ibb.co/M61cLRm) doesn’t have an official release date and will probably come with the ET7 next year, so, another disappointment as this comp against Tesla will not be a huge advantage once Tesla does upgrade their computers as well.

So, for short the main competitive advantages that [NIO](https://ibb.co/3c5Q80j) has right now are that they use the subscription model for both the battery swap technology and for the full-self driving feature which costs around $100/month. This is are very good and smart recurring revenue streams, as they make the entry price for the car much lower and also provide a stable flow of revenues. But… I am disappointed in the “new battery technology” and have to wait for more developments. If this is a common technology that will be used by other car manufacturers, this is effectively not that big of a deal, but if somehow this is their own technology, that would possibly have better implications for the company. So, guys, I own both Tesla &amp; NIO, and I think I might hold off right now on buying any more due to different factors. I think that Tesla has a good future, but this huge run-up has made it a good target for 10-20% correction at any point in the short-term future, while for NIO I expect this to rise in the next couple of days, and I am waiting for it to cool off a little before adding any more to my position. So, yeah, short-term I think both of them have some downside risk, but in the long run, I expect Tesla to trade at over $1000 and NIO to trade over $100.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zJwMGgq), we saw gambling stocks like DraftKings and PENN rising on Friday after New York filed bills to legalize online betting in the state. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/N2sDnH6) also just announced they will bring new stuff like drone racing betting, which is mind-blowing, that they are extending into such things. This is a continuing trend in the US and should be watched for future developments, as gambling will be legalized pretty much all over the US in the near future I believe, and I also expect this sector to be joined by the pot [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/Sf97NmW), even if it’s really hard to believe there will be a nationwide bill to legalize it, I expect there will be some improvements for the sector, and companies like Aphria which are closer to profitability should benefit from this.

On some more sad new, we also saw a 27-year-old Boeing plane [crash](https://ibb.co/dg9yW5j) in Indonesia, this is very sad news, but as the stock market goes, this issue seems to be unrelated to [Boeing](https://ibb.co/bJwt3Lt) right now. Indonesia has seen the most deaths in the past decades, with over 104 accidents, as this country is known for bad maintenance, pilot training and air-traffic controls problems.

And don’t forget, as I said in my earlier posts, don’t jump on these high-flying small cap stocks at all-time highs, this is a very good moment for this companies to raise cheap capital by issuing shares, with the latest example being [BLNK](https://ibb.co/pbG62F6).

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/f9RV9NM) are pointing to a bad open right now, with all 3 big index futures down, as the DOW futures are down over 200 points

personalfinance,Should I re-fi my mortgage to release equity or overpay my existing mortgage?,"Hi,

Background: 

Property purchased late 2019 for £145,000, with a down payment of £60,000 for 22 years at 2.04%.  Paid about £5000 down on the principle so far, plus interest payments.  This is my sole home.  Monthly income is £2200.  Other investments come to around £20,000.  Rainy day fund is at £6600.

My next goal is to get a buy-to-let to create another income source.  Obviously the aim is to generate a larger return by investing in a rental than simply putting that money into the existing mortgage.  Also to diversify away from purely stocks.  The rate on my mortgage is currently very low, and I think most people would be confident they could make a greater return if they invested that money in the stock market.  I understand buy-to-let mortgages often have higher interest rates.

Three options... 

Continue to pay the minimum monthly payment on the mortgage and put all other disposable into stocks, to then overpay at the end of this term with capital taken from stock investments.  I have the ability to pay an unlimited amount in the last 3 months of this term (3 years).

Refinance the mortgage to pull capital out of the mortgage and use as a down payment on a rental.

Refinance the mortgage to a longer term, lower payment, and invest difference in stocks to further build a down payment for a rental.

Thank you in advance for your advise.  I will likely consult a financial advisor but this will hopefully point out any obvious flaws in my plan.",finance
CryptoCurrency,DD: My dumbass theory on this dip (US biased),"It seems like everyone has an opinion on why there's a dip. I'll give you my 2 gwei (as an Etherean).

Crypto prices have been going absolutely bonkers the past few weeks. Everything, and I mean everything doubled in price, and over the 3 month period, tripled in price. Then for some reason, we see a 20% pullback. What are the necessary conditions to cause something like this? Well let's start ruling stuff out that I've seen so far on twitter and following Ockhams Razor:

**Possibility 1: The FED is drafting a bill to make cryptocurrency even highly scrutinized and labeled as terrorist activity.**

I saw this on twitter, and while it's certainly possible, it's certainly more complex than other possibilities. For example, the necessary conditions for this to happen and us not know about it are hilariously impossible. If you live in the U.S., people are extremely divided to follow the administration at this point and time. It seems very clear Pence is running the show now, and I highly doubt anyone is doing anything drastic. The government is in a bit of a standstill at the moment until Biden comes into office on the 20th. Do I believe cryptocurrency regulation is on the agenda? Sure, but is there some secret plot being brewed to throw everyone in prison who ever touched bitcoin? I'm pretty sure the government is worried about other things, and just taking a pause before the new administration comes in, and possibly doing a bit of a song and dance for Trump Wars: The Impeachement Strikes back.

**Possibility 2: People are moving into a risk off scenario like Black Thursday.**

Ok, this has more legs. Many countries haven't contained the virus well. With a new strain, I'm sure many people are thinking about going risk-off and locking in some gains for potential sell offs. I'll show you a single picture though: [https://imgur.com/a/BHOiths](https://imgur.com/a/BHOiths)

This is the net flows of ETH to exchanges for the past year. The last risk off scenario sees a level signal that is really obvious. The last week, can we actually say everyone is selling? At least here in the US, there's some confidence that Grandpa Joe will come in and start printing money. I love Grandpa Joe. He's going to make everyone rich here, and we all know it. Are any of you all selling? I highly doubt the money printer will stop going BRR, and I don't think any of you are selling. I'm going to write this one off.

**Possibility 3: Bank manipulation via Naked Short Selling.**

I think this one has more legs than 1 and 2, but I don't necessarily believe this is what's going on. We all have heard how banks manipulate gold prices. Bitcoin would be an absolute dream for banks to manipulate. We all know they could go out and tank this market with no survivors if they wanted to, but it seems so goofy and hard to coordinate, and it would also seem like everyone would catch on and immediately buy the dip. Not only that, we're a pretty close knit group. Someone would spill alpha saying they're getting calls from Jamie Dixon, and before the hour, there would be 80 videos on Youtube talking about it. While I think this is technically possible, I doubt it. I also don't believe banks can touch crypto assets yet. Many of them simply can't mess with it due to Charter rules. How many large market cap companies have the ability and legal authority to actually mess with crypto markets? Probably only a few. Many companies have also threw in price targets of over $100K for Bitcoin. I mean, why manipulate at that point. It seems easier just to buy.

**My Take: Miners locking in Prices.**

So, exchange netflows aren't a strong signal, the governments are in disarray, and banks aren't that secret. This really only leaves miners to be the culprits. Miners have a pretty intensive business operation. They have energy overhead that is generally a fixed monthly cost, rent, and employees to pay. In terms of profits, they have previous reserves of coins, and transaction fees. At least on the Ethereum side, transaction fees have been extremely profitable. On chain interactions have boomed in the past 3 months. So let's put ourselves in their shoes.

You're a miner, and you're doing the math. Your operating costs are generally fixed. Energy has been extremely cheap because no one is commuting to work. Gas prices are at a general low, and this also is given the past year, energy costs completely bottomed out. It's January of this year. All the coins have tripled in price over the past 3 weeks, and you tally this up and realize a really good thing: ""I can sell off a 10th of my reserves, and cover all operating expenses for the next year.""

Ding ding ding! Bitcoin is at all time highs. This is a significant event. In their models, we are in the ""black swan"" moment where they probably put a run like this as an extremely low probability event. They didn't plan for this much price action, and they're looking at their reserves and locking in operating costs for probably the next 2-3 years. Their rationale must love this situation. They paid their bills for the next year, chain data isn't stopping and adoption is growing, and they can essentially mine every coin from now on and place it in reserves. They don't need to sell any more Bitcoin. Why? They paid their rent for the year. This seems like a far simpler explanation. Miners know exactly how much money they need to operate, and they generally follow the same formulas based on their energy and rent costs versus coin flows and price. Taking some coin off the table just makes sense, and I don't doubt many of them reached that conclusion, which further triggered some stop loss sales.

**What I think it means: Big boom incoming. $60K BTC by end of February.**

I'm betting we'll shake this dip off. More stimulus is incoming from the U.S. FED.

Bitcoin,Kids college fund savings account,So I recently had my first child and I am going to start saving toward her future education. Initially I was just going to put aside a set amount from my monthly paycheck in to a separate longterm savings account (currently with a very poor interest rate). I was thinking around €200 per month. I am now reconsidering and might split it between savings account and bitcoin investment. Is it worth buying in at such a small amount frequently like that over the long term. I have a small bitcoin amount from about 8 years ago that I was fortunate enough to hold on to but have been inactive with trading since then. I plan to use Coinbase due to ease of use. Any recommendations here. I appreciate that there are probably already many posts similar to this over the years but my google skills have let me down on finding a useful response.,cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I need car advice,"So I have been driving 2008 Dodge Charger since March 2020. It just broke down a week ago and this is a big one. There is a leak inside the engine, and the mechanic, who is a friend, says that the best thing is to either do engine replacement or get another car. 

I am a grad student, I don’t make much and I have student loans, no other debt. This year, I made a booboo and accepted all the loans I was offered. So I have $10,000 right now in a savings account left over from the student loans. I am thinking of holding on to it while the interest rates are 0%, just in case a big expense comes along. 

Would it make sense to use that money to buy a more reliable car for about $8k to $10k. I know this is exactly like borrowing to buy a liability, but if I don’t, I will be forced to either finance, or buy another piece of crap that may broke down in a couple of months.

personalfinance,Wells Fargo Using Incredibly Inexperienced Mortgage Loan Consultants,"I'm currently in the process of financing the purchase of a home through Wells Fargo. After a few phone conversations with my mortgage loan consultant, who is tasked with walking me through the entire process, I began to suspect that he wasn't really experienced in this arena when I corrected him on interest rate terms a couple times. When I received a loan estimate summary, I noticed there were several lines that were questionable so I took a screenshot and sent it to him. He responded back and thanked me for bringing this to his attention and said that he would ""escalate it to his internal team."" After this, I began to snoop.

I found his LinkedIn page and it looks like he has a bachelor's in marketing and this seems to be his first real job post-college. Not knocking a marketing degree but it is definitely unrelated to the mortgage process. He's a nice guy and all, and I'm in finance so I'm confident in my ability to catch errors and oversights, but I'm getting a little nervous that something could slip through the cracks and end up throwing a wrench in the process.

Anyone have a similar experience working with Wells Fargo or other banks on a mortgage and receiving someone with questionable qualifications? Should I take any action to try to work with someone a little more experienced?

* Shopping/spending: \~$5,500 total/\~$460 monthly (Amazon, shopping, gifts, money spent to be my friend's bridesmaid, haircuts, books, etc.)
* Travel: \~$11,000 total/\~$915 monthly (a big expense but it's my passion—a couple of pre-covid trips, a socially distanced summer road trip, a few more local hiking trips)
* Transportation: \~$1,300 total/\~$110 monthly (much lower than normal but I've been working from home and barely go anywhere due to covid)
* Wedding planning: \~$3,600 total/\~$300 monthly (I got engaged a few months before covid and we've put the planning on hold until it's safe, so these are just some initial deposits)
* Donations: \~$500 total/\~$42 monthly

Bitcoin,How do those that lose Bitcoin cope?,"I’ll keep this brief but I wasn’t sure where else to ask.  Throwaway account obviously.

Several years ago I had 24 Bitcoin.  I sold at the wrong time and spent roughly the same money I got (about $5k USD) to buy back 10 coins.

Then MTGox got hacked and I lost the 10 coins, I also failed to fill out the claim form as I didn’t see it worth it and thought Bitcoin would peter out and the legal action at MTGox would take forever.

So now I’m kicking myself, those 10 coins would clear my mortgage fully and give me a bit of extra cash.

I feel I’ve really stuffed up.  And I know there’ll be people a lot worse off than me.

So, how do people who have gone through similar cope?  I’m not interested in comments telling me where I went wrong, I know I did.  I’m interested in what people tell themselves to feel better.

Bitcoin,Learn from my mistakes - I sold in 2013,"It was 2013, I was a young software engineer and I got hooked into Bitcoin, I was reading about the technology and the vision, I was reading the source code of Bitcoin and I saw the amazing potential here. So I took a small loan (I didn't have too much money back than) and bought around 100 bitcoins for around $10K... I was looking daily at the amazing gains and dreaming of being rich, and it was going really well until it didn't, I still remember the day that I was at work and Bitcoin crashed by 30%, I was shocked, it was the first time in my life that I lost so much money in a few hours, I saw my dreams crashing and all of my friends laughing at me, I even imagined the discussions that I'll had to do with my GF ( now wife) about it..

So, I couldn't work, I was too anxious, I drove back home and sold all the bitcoins that I had in the span of the next couple of days in a loss. I hated bitcoin and convinced myself that it was a scam and the scalability issues of it will be a major issue and will kill the technology.

Boy I was wrong, at the end of the year the price was already 10X more (I think, honestly I don't remember), and I was frustrated for years about it, at the peak I almost had 150 bitcoins.

Why am I telling you this story? well because I've learned from my mistakes. Some of the lessons:

1. Never do all-in at anything, unless you have balls of steal, it's just not worth it.
2. Don't panic sell, it's never a good idea
3. If you truly believe in the technology / idea, don't sell if everyone are selling and convince yourself that it's crap.

After years of hiding and avoiding bitcoins, I've finally bought me bitcoins in mid 2020. My portfolio is very diversified and I've put into Bitcoin around 10% of my portfolio.

I'm a huge believer that Bitcoin will be a massive thing in 10-20 years, and this is why I will not sell in the next couple of years, I'm actually going to buy the dips (let's go under 25K)

Some of the reasons of why I'm such a huge believer in Bitcoin:

1. All of the known reasons... (FED money printing problem, decentralized, cool...)
2. People will diversify their portfolio like I did so more and more folks will put money into bitcoin as Gold 2.0
3. Miners have a lot of incentive to increase bitcoin price. Let's not forget that, it's a massive industry.
4. There is a need for a world currency for all the folks that live in those 3rd world countries with a crazy inflation
5. Second layer / off chain /  virtual bitcoins / sharding / other.  solution will hopefully unblock the scalability issues in 5-10 years and change how we think about Bitcoin from Gold 2.0 to Money 2.0. Too many people are involved in Bitcoin at this time, so I'll be shocked if we won't find a solution here in the next couple of years.

It might be the time of a Crypto-Winter, be prepared and buy the dips :)

personalfinance,Looking for advice about a car I own + insurance policy,"Hello! I'm 18F living in VT. In October last year I purchased a car and got insurance. I know barely anything about the semantics of financing or insurance, and honestly when they sold it to me I didn't understand anything they were saying, but my interest rate is 19% and over a 6 year term I will be paying more in interest than I will pay for the car itself. Is it possible to bring this interest rate down over time? I heard something about credit unions being able to help with this? It's called ""refinancing"" right? My credit score right now is only ""bad"" because of the lack of history, everything else is perfect, I've never missed a payment and have a good revolving utilization percentage and didn't apply for too many cards. How would refinancing the car work? And is it possible to sell the car or get a new one before the 6 year term is over or did I sell my soul?

Also, my insurance is $350 a month and I was told that that's ""a crazy amount"" and that I should switch to Geico, but Geico is only offering a rate that's even more than what I pay with Progressive lol. Is $350 a month normal for someone my age? I got licensed shortly after I bought my car (to extreme suspicion of the DMV worker seeing the insurance policy+car ownership completely in my name lmfao) so again, is it just a lack of history thing? I wanted a nice car, but I didn't consider exactly how taxing owning a nice car would be just because of my age. The idea that someone only four years older than me with the same car pays only $300 combined in monthly payments and insurance vs the $700 I pay really stings.

personalfinance,"Crunching the numbers around purchasing a single or multi-family home (HCOL area). Could use some advice, and can offer pizza in exchange!","Hi PF,

I've been spending the better part of 2021 looking into my financial situation with the hopes that it's time for me to pull the trigger on buying as opposed to renting in a HCOL city (and yes, I've stared for too many hours at the NYtimes buy v. rent calculator so understand the financial tradeoffs). I'm looking for either a single-family or multi-family and have been putting together an analysis of the numbers (including a fancy little sensitivity analysis on home value appreciation/depreciation) and wanted to see if I'm being reasonable to talking out of my butt here. Some details about my current situation:

* Demographics
   * HCOL Northeast US
   * 28 yo. Software Engineer
   * Single
* Income $295k / year ($192k after taxes, $16k monthly)
   * $182k salary
   * \~$110k in RSUs / year, vesting quarterly
* Net worth $250k
   * $115k in 401k
   * $100k stocks
   * $32k cash
   * $15k Car (maybe shouldn't include this?)
   * \-$12k in student loans at 2% (I only pay min. due to interest rate)
* Credit score 830
* Currently monthly expenses (w/o rent): $3000k
   * This is purely discretionary and not debt
* I currently max out 401k each year and throw the rest into stocks

Regarding the mortgage, I'm trying to understand a few things as a first-time home-buyer:

1. For a single-family home, roughly how much could I get approved for? RSUs make things a bit tricky here, but they're vesting quarterly and my past two years of tax returns were $240k for last year and $350k for the year before that (had some side income).
2. For a multi-family home in which I would do as an owner-occupied rental with 1-2 other units being rented, I'm trying to assess what would be approved and what's reasonable. I'd like to try to find a place around $1.2 - 1.5M, in which I would take one unit and rent out the remainder for \~$2400 each per month (so $4800 for two of units with me living in the third). Would I get approved for this as a first-time renter? I know some banks will allow you to contribute a portion of expected rent if you demonstrate that you know what you're talking about (I don't, but maybe can fake it). This would still result in negative cash-flow each month but between equity and appreciation, I believe this still makes financial sense for me. More details in my spreadsheet below if you're interested / bored.
3. In my models, I'm assuming around a \~4% home value appreciation in my HCOL area. I know without revealing the city, Reddit can't provide advice here but would be curious to know if this assumption is dangerous. I've done sensitivity analysis around it so I understand the upside and downside, but have a hard time measuring volatility in a world of COVID.

With that last assumption in mind, here is the analysis that I conducted for the multi-family rental, in case anyone wants to get into the weeds. I'm sure I got a number of things wrong in here, so would appreciate if anyone pointed those out (I can offer pizza in exchange for valuable insight!). My expected plan here would be to occupy the unit for 2 years and then rent it out for another 3-7 years: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IJ4ENVax3ZiPxpqvCKw-Y8KC3vzX6ZrNJYytzaAqoiY/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IJ4ENVax3ZiPxpqvCKw-Y8KC3vzX6ZrNJYytzaAqoiY/edit#gid=0)

I like the idea of a multi-family owner-occupied rental a bit more because it gives me slightly more flexibility to up and move to a different place after a few years and continue to rent out the additional unit, as opposed to either selling a single-family or attempting to rent it out (renting out single-family homes is a bit difficult where I live). But to be transparent I only understand at a high-level the complexities of becoming a landlord but feel that the lifestyle could suit me, especially if I live at the property as well.

personalfinance,Transfer balance card for credit card debt,"Hi everyone. 1.5 years ago I wanted to get ahead on my credit card balance. It was about 9k and I was able to pay it off by transfers to a 0%interest 2nd credit card. My current credit card debt left is about 4.5k (Woohoo to getting halfway to debt free). I was only able to transfer 1.5k over on that 0% at a time. 

That 0% interest card is no longer 0% and now a whopping 25% interest. Which is a tad higher than my original credit card of 22.5% interest rate. Still feels like a high rate. 

Based on my budget I can put $350-500 towards my balance a month. The minimum payment is $111. 

My question is should I close the 2nd card that I used for balance transfers now that the interest rate is higher? And should I open another 0% card to pay off the remaining debt without having to worry about interest charges?

Also welcoming any out of the box ideas! Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,Debt is cheap? Question...,"True or false:  
Debt is cheap therefore someone who has taken on more debt to acquire an (appreciating) asset is making a better financial decision than someone who is saving for a bigger down payment on the same asset. IE debt is cheaper than saving.

I would assume this depends on the interest rate of the debt on the lower down payment (x), the rate of appreciation (y), how long until asset can be purchased (e divided by rate of saving) (z), size of down payment (e), interest rate after the larger down payment (f).

My question is if we know x, z, and e, and we use y and f as variables, can we determine who will be financially ahead after some (g) amount of time? My goal would be to figure out for various values of y and f, at what point would the two scenarios cross each other (from one being better to the other being better)?

For example, if person A puts down $20k for a $300k home at 3% fixed interest rate.

Person B waits 1.5 years and puts down $60k for the same home at f% fixed interest rate.

  
If we assume (y) the home appreciated to $320k after the 1.5 years and the interest rate was now 3.2%  


Who would be financially green compared to the other after 5 years?

&amp;#x200B;

This questions stems from a more basic question that a lot of people are asking - buy now with a lower down payment or buy later with a higher down payment? Usually BUY NOW is better if the home will continue appreciating and BUY LATER if the home stays flat or depreciates. But doesn't it depend on how much its appreciating and how much later you will be buying with the larger down payment? That's why I would like to see it visually/mathematically. 

We dont know what the market will do but seeing this visually would help me weight which decision is best based on what I think the market is likely to do. For example, if scenario A is better than scenario B unless home prices appreciate at a rate of 30%/year then I would be pretty comfortable with A because 30% appreciation per year is unlikely in my area. 

I know there are other variables but I figured those are some of the most important ones. Ideally this would factor in inflation and the benefit of increased equity with larger down payment.",finance

Now that interest rates are so low we are thinking of buying our forever home. We moved to this house knowing it was not going to be the one we stayed in. Hindsight we should have not refinanced and purchased our home.

Reasons we want to move. My commute to work is about an hour, hers little more then 30 minutes and it's taking a toll on me (and the vehicles). 
The internet is also very poor where we are and something as simple as streaming a movie at full quality can strain my internet.

We live in a rural area with low taxes outside of a medium size City.

The houses we are looking to buy are right under $300k. That would more than double our payment but because rates are so low I feel like it's the best time to grab our ""dream"" house. Wife makes a good point that house prices might go down when rates go up but I'm Not sure about that.

We can definitely afford to do this move but is it a good decision? Should I suffer with bad internet and long drive and a small (though nice) house? And just keep saving the difference between the current mortgage and what a new one would be. 

Or do we jump on the low rates and buy our ""Dream house""?

personalfinance,How to fight an incorrect “charge off” entry posted on my credit report,"Hi all, I am new to Reddit, made an account because my son recommended I get some help here. 

Recently, I learned that on December 22, a “charge-off” entry was posted on my credit file in all 3 credit bureaus. I was trying to apply for a home loan and noticed my score had dropped by over 100 points and the interest rate was significantly out of my budget.

To give a bit of context on the situation: I have been having an ongoing dispute with a company regarding an incorrect charge on my (now completed) car lease. This company pushed additional charges that I was not responsible for and I have been trying to get adjusted for the past 4 months. I disputed a charge (through a formal letter) on my final lease balance letter that I received after the termination of my lease. I never received a formal collection letter or communication indicating this transaction was being sent to “charge-off”. Originally, nobody responded to my dispute and I kept getting phone calls for a collection of the balance that was due. After talking to the call center folks (who expressed their inability to help with any disputes), I was finally able to contact a supervisor who asked me to provide additional documentation via email. I promptly sent them the information but again there was no response. 

Once again these calls continued and one day I picked up the phone and asked to be connected to a supervisor and after waiting for 30 minutes, the call got disconnected. Finally I was able to find an online complaint form, which I filed on December 30, but there has been no response thus far.

Today, I decided to call the company regarding the “charge off” and talk directly to the manager in charge of the charge-offs. I explained the whole situation, including my multiple attempts to talk to a representative or get an update. The manager agreed with all my steps, but they claimed they were unable to delete the “charge off” entry and suggested I pay the full amount (including the amount I don’t owe) and close the account. 

From what I understand, paying this account in full will not help my damaged credit score and the mark stays for 7 years. This has drastically impacted my interest rates on the loan and therefore my ability to purchase a home. What path should I take to optimally handle this mess?

I live in the state of California, please let me know if any other information is needed. Thanks in advance for your help.",finance

Up until now, the main focus has been 'pay off home mortgage' but now that we almost have, I don't know where / how I should broaden (or focus!) our finances.

Our details: Myself (F44) Husband (48M) and 4 children (ages 18,15,14,13).

Assets:   
Family Home - valued approx $700k with $25k mortgage remaining  
Investment property - approx $430k with $320K mortgage (roughly income neutral, negatively gears to approx $5k max a year)  
Business - we own a business that we draw salary from.  Assets of business approx $150k  
Superannuation - $140k (between us)  
Shares - barely any, around $1500  
Savings/Emergency fund - $20k

No other debts/loans/credit card debt.  We draw a salary from our business each and after all household outgoings (including mortgage repayments) we have approx $500/week spare.  This extra money has been previously used to clear debts/to stock the emergency savings account and to pay off home loan.  We are committed to supporting our children through university (not the tuition, the living expenses) so I see the $500/week remaining stable for another 5-10 years (when presumably some of the kids will start to leave home and our household expenses will drop!)

Our home loan currently has $200k available in offset account and we have a line of credit from bank of $140k.  So effectively with a few clicks I can access $340k (interest rate on home loan 2.8% and line of credit 6%)

economy,Why aren't we seriously considering permanently removing interest rates as a solution to student loans?,"It seems like a really simple and effective solution for student loans would be to set all interest rates for all federal student loans to 0%. You would then have a rule like the following: you are charged 0% interest as long as you're paying at least like 2% of your income towards the debt, with exceptions for disability, medical, etc. This way everyone would start gradually working off their debt, and people who are down on their luck won't get abused by interest rates too much.

&amp;#x200B;

In conjunction with this you'd want to implement stricter requirements on who can get student loans, but if they meet those requirements, then they will also receive student loans with no interest rates . This seems like a much better and more fair plan instead of writing people a check for their student debt. This won't punish those individuals who paid off student loans or who decided not to go to college. Additionally, inflation will gradually reduce the value of the loan, so small payments + inflation will probably cut student debt in half after 10 years.

personalfinance,Shared Equity Finance Agreement vs. Personal Loan,"Hey r/personalfinance!

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to buy a home in Oregon. I own 1.5% of a rather successful company which represents the majority of my net worth. My share is valued somewhere between 300k to 400k and our goal is to sell the company in three to four years. This is relevant because my parents have offered to provide a significant amount of cash to my down payment via a personal loan with my stake in the company as collateral. 

This makes me nervous for several reasons. It's not clear when the company will sell or what it will be valued at when a buyer is found. So there exists a real possibility that I take this personal loan on top of the mortgage and the company will flop. Then I would be left paying back my parents and my mortgage. I could afford to do that, but it would put a really serious damper on the rate which I'm saving money. 

I have been doing some research on how other parents help their children with down payments without gifting or personal loans and I think a shared equity finance agreement makes sense in our situation. Instead of holding my stake in the company as collateral they will instead have a vested interest in the home and I can buy them out of the agreement if the company sells.

So I've made myself a spreadsheet and I'm trying to determine the cost to me and my parents over three years for both a personal loan and shared equity agreement. The personal loan was easy to figure out my monthly due associated with the interest. The equity agreement is a lot harder. Following are a list of questions I could really use some help with.

1. From all the reading I've just drowned myself in confusion. Some websites propose that the resident pays for the entire mortgage and others suggest the investor pays a portion of the mortgage, home insurance, and taxes relative to their portion of the house. In either case the tenant is required to pay rent to the investor for use of their portion of the house at at least the 40th percentile of fair market value. My question is, if you pay for the whole mortgage how do you decide what rent is paid to the investor? 
2.  How do you decide what portion of the house the investor owns? In my case renting a home is roughly 25% more expensive than owning (#collegetown). So it will almost always be cheaper for me to take on a larger portion of the mortgage payment and avoid paying rent. 
3. What are the tax implications of me buying my parents out of a shared equity finance agreement with the money I receive when the company is sold?
4. Is a shared equity finance agreement even where I should be studying? Is there a better option?

I really appreciate any help you guys can provide! Any resources for further learning on how we can make this process the most cost effective for both parties would be amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Parents offered to help me cover a down payment while my lumpsum of money is tied up in a business. They proposed a conventional loan with the lowest interest rate possible. Is a shared equity finance agreement a better option for us? If so, what are the optimal conditions of the agreement so both parties benefit?",finance

personalfinance,"Cancelled car ordered from online dealer, but loan from bank already taken out. I never took delivery of car. Dealer sent check back to bank. Will this affect/stay on my credit report?","So I ordered a car from Carvana and financed through my personal bank which is one of the big chains. They wouldn't even ship the car till receiving funds from the bank, which is understandable. After multiple annoying setbacks delays and excuses I got sick of them and told them to just cancel the order. Turns out, per one of their delivery people who claimed the car got damaged, the car wasn't even as advertised anyways and I'd have to start the whole process over again in order to get a different one. They have a 7 day ""no questions asked"" return policy that can be used after taking delivery of the car, but I never took delivery or even got to see the car in person. I ended up buying a new car from a different dealer and taking out a loan through a different bank. 

It's been about 2 weeks now and even though they provided me a tracking number to prove they fedexed a check back to my bank the loan still shows as an active account and hasn't been paid off yet. The first payment shows as due in 10 days. My credit report is now showing two different car loans. I already called my bank to notify them that I never received the car and that Carvana is paying back the funds, but they said all they could do was make a note of it. 

So, once my bank finally closes the account, how will this affect my credit report? Is it possible to have it removed since I never even took delivery of the car or does it even matter? Could this possibly help my credit by showing I had a large account that was paid off quickly? I'll leave it intact if that's the case. My other fear is I don't want it to show a late payment if it isn't closed off before the first payment is due, because I don't have any intention of paying a loan for a car that I never received. I'll definitely be calling the bank again before the first payment is due to make sure this is smoothed out but it's still a concern in the back of my mind. I understand I'll probably have to pay whatever interest has accrued so far, which really annoys me but I'll accept it.

personalfinance,Need a plan to get out of dept,"I'll try to keep things brief, essentially my poor financial habits and undisciplined spending have led me to take on a massive amount of debt. Here is a rough breakdown:

- 50k spread out over about 5 different credit cards 
- 30k in student loan debt (interest rates between 3-5%) 
- 280k mortgage 

I am married, my wife also has a bit of CC debt but not much compared to myself. She is aware of the situation, but I'd like to take care of my debt issue using my income only.

My take home pay is $2250 every other week, and my major monthly expenses look like this:

- CC Min Payments $1300
- Student Loan Min Payment: $700
- Mortgage: $1,000 (my portion)
- Utilities (electricity/internet): $200
- Cell Phone: $50
- Transportation: $150
- Groceries / Eating out / Misc: $500

I am getting killed by minimum payments on my CC totaling rough $1300 a month and I feel like it will take me forever to get this debt paid down while paying a massive mount of interest. I usually end up throwing any other money I have left at the end of the month towards the CC but it just doesn't seem like it's going to get me anywhere. I've consulted a debt settlement company and was given a plan that would pay off the cards in about 4 years paying $700 a month.  I am aware this plan would involve me having to tank my credit and be potentially sued as a result of not paying the CC companies. I have not really considered bankruptcy, and I'm not sure what that option would entail for me.

My wife and I would like to have a child within the next two years, so it'd be nice to get this debt somewhat taken care of before that point. 

Any suggestions for my situation would be greatly appreciated ,thank you!",finance
cybersecurity,InfoSec - Entry (An Introduction),"Morning OR Afternoon, you lovely people of this subreddit!  
/r/cybersecurity tends to receive a lot of ""What can I do to get into security?"" questions of all different flavors and walks of life. Some people are transitioning from other careers and some are simply trying to get a start in a career. Regardless barrier to entry in security is different and no singular path is for everyone. On my team at work I have a lady straight out of college who is our pentester and a gentleman who has a background in investigating fraud (no real IT background). Both of them have proven time and time again that they are extremely competent in their subject matter, even after being on the job for less than 2 years.  


Hiring Process: (Quick Talk)  
The hiring process is for lack of a better word, shit. You will receive far more rejections (silent or notified) than you will have interviews or calls. Hiring process are subjective as hell, what the hiring manager may see as a great candidate the recruiter / HR may toss to the side. Some management are willing to look at a candidates soft skills and overall skill set and say this person could do the job with a bit of training, others however may simply say this person is not fit for the job. It's an absolute soup sandwich and is highly dependent upon the people and mindset. Do not let the rejections get you down. Here are some resume tips I've given to quite a few people and it has helped them at the very least get some interviews and make their ""paper presence"" a bit more.  


1. Do not use the word ""Assist"" or anything that implies you helped as it says you are not ""Batman."" Nobody aspires to be Robin, aim to be Batman and let your ""paper presence"" show that. 
2. Depending on the job you are attempting to get - you should tailor your resume/bullets to draw that picture. Again paint the picture that you are Batman for this job and have the skills. Wordsmithing / verbiage to attain this goal can be difficult.
3. If you are not good at making picking up a pencil sound like you saved the world, then do not recreate the wheel or spin your wheels to do it. Go out and look at job postings for the position you want, copy the bullets, adapt them to you. 
4. Is your resume fluffed? Do you still have your Windows 2000 certification listed? Remove it. If the certification / class is not pertinent to the job, remove it. Now this can be misconstrued, if you are starting out or transitioning this can be fine to do. However a caveat is if your certification/class is really old, remove it. 
5. While looking at jobs if you meet 50% of the requirements, apply. Most job postings have ridiculous requirements and are looking for some magical unicorn. Years of experience is kind of a garbage way to request experience, but it's easily measured in the companies eyes. Though someone with 1 year of experience compared to someone with two can differ heavily depending on environment and how deep the product was explored. 

&amp;#x200B;

General Entry Suggestions: (Broad Suggestions)  
Gaining entry into Security in general is a pain. For me it took about 1.5 years of searching and I turned down a few jobs because of them being contract jobs and also red flags during the interview process. Your results will vary though, but be aware of some of the wording in job postings and reading between those lines. In general here are a few things to help you get hired.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do you have a homelab? It doesn't have to be /r/datahoarder levels of sophistication. An old desktop with a hypervisor and a few VMs for testing things will provide you with an excellent amount of continuing education.
2. Have a goal in mind! Do you simply want to enter security or do you have a goal for your next 5-10 years? Tailor your certification choices and homelab experiments to work toward that goal.
3. Start reading some news sources about recent security events. This will help you stay up-to-date on the ongoing struggles in the industry.
4. If you are already working in IT,  then start applying security practices to your day to day. Think about some of the low hanging fruit; strong passwords, administrative privileges where not needed, best ways of setting up permissions, is that web-app only using http but contains PII of your users? This will help you start developing your security mindset and getting in that motion. Ready to answer all those tough interview questions, because now you have been thinking about it daily and possible outcomes.
5. Have friends who do IT security? Ask questions! Ask about their experiences and what they think of the current events you read about. If you have technical questions you cannot explore yourself, ask. 
6. Realize that not all security issues are ""OVER 9000!"" issues, everything is risk based. There is a calculated risk for patching, not-patching, exposing services, allowing traffic into the network, and so forth. Sometimes you have to accept the risk and other times you can come up with mitigating factors. It's all about being adaptive to the business needs.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this helps some of you looking to transition from your current role and into a new shiny job. Remember the grass is not always greener and there are times where this job can be extremely stressful. If you are choosing security because it's the new shiny in your view, keep in mind that security is not all sunshine and buttercups. This field is just much about security as it is communication with the business. Remember, you are there to assist the business to move forward while reducing risk doing it.   


  
Note: This is all pretty general for the field of InfoSec / CyberSecurity. This is not meant to be an ""end-all-be-all"" list but general enough. Will some people have contradictory things to say to the bullets, more than likely. There are always outlying cases and this simply comes from my experience.",technology
CryptoCurrency,Can I send any crypto I own from Coinbase to Blockfi?,"Hello,

I was wondering — can I send crypto I own from Coinbase to Blockfi?  I heard about Blockfi and thought it was a great idea due to the fact it has like a 6% interest rate.  So realistically my crypto would just earn more interest on it which would be nice.  But is it even possible to move it from Coinbase to Blockfi?  And if so, does my crypto continue to move up and down in Blockfi? For instance, if I put 1 BTC Into blockfi, does it continue to move up and down or does it stay at 35k, and earn interest?

Any experts at this?

personalfinance,How do I refinance my car?,"In 2019 I bought a new Chevy Trax and financed it through the dealership. At the time I didn't have much of a credit history so I decided to bite the bullet and get a higher interest rate on the car to help build credit. I had just graduated college and needed a vehicle and I knew I could handle anything under $400/month for a car payment. Now it's about a year and half later and I'm starting to building up a credit history as well as some savings and I'm ready to refinance this car. 

Currently the payoff value of the car is $14,057.37. The original amount financed was $18,555.45. The loan is for 60 months and the interest rate is 8.05% APR and the monthly payment is $376.68. I can afford to pay the monthly payment as is I just feel like I could save a lot of money if I lowered that interest rate through a refinance.

Do I need a down payment to refinance this loan and how large of a down payment would you suggest? I have about $2000 saved up outside of my emergency fund that I'm willing to use but I could save up more over the next few months if necessary.

Do I go to the dealer to refinance or research local credit unions and banks and see what rates they offer? According to mint my credit score is ~764. Is this high enough to get a better interest rate through refinancing or am I better off just paying extra on the monthly payments and paying of the car ASAP?

I really don't know much about this process and any help or suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Need help searching for a private student loan,"I am 30 and going back to school for a teaching degree in TX.

Bitcoin,We've known about the dangers of fiat for centuries,"""The extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity. The loss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man, on the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and morals of the people, and on the character of republican government, constitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this unadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice, of the power which has been the instrument of it. In addition to these persuasive considerations, it may be observed, that the same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States, and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded; retrospective alterations in its value might be made, and thus the citizens of other States be injured, and animosities be kindled among the States themselves. The subjects of foreign powers  might suffer from the same cause, and hence the Union be discredited and embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member. No one of these mischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper money,  than to coin gold or silver. The power to make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts, is withdrawn from the States, on the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency.""

economy,What a Biden Economy looks ike,"One effect of illegal immigrants is to reduce wages in the U.S., as  many will work for as little as $5 per hour. What’s financially  attractive for employers is sub-optimal for the economy as a whole.

This  dynamic favors large employers, and creates a deflationary bias in the  economy that hurts aggregate demand for consumer goods and services.

Part  of the reason real wages rose for blacks and Hispanics during the Trump  years was his aggressive polices to halt illegal immigration. That  dynamic will now go in reverse.

Taxation is another policy area where Biden may implement major changes to Trump’s policies.

Biden’s  tax proposals call for raising the top individual tax rate from 35% to  39.6% and increasing the long-term capital gains tax rate from 20% to  39.6% on incomes over $1 million.

Other hidden tax increases will  be implemented by eliminating or capping tax deductions. This has the  effect of increasing the effective tax rate without actually changing  the statutory tax rate. Taxpayers pay more not because rates are higher  but because deductions are fewer.

 

Other likely Biden initiatives will be mostly for show with little  practical impact. The U.S. may rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement as a  show of international cooperation on climate change.

However, the  Trump administration already lowered CO2 emissions from the U.S. by more  than the Paris agreement required, so the immediate impact of rejoining  the agreement will be nil.

The greater danger is that Biden’s  “climate czar” John Kerry and others will use climate change as an  excuse to drive a globalist agenda including carbon taxes, limitations  on fracking and offshore drilling, higher gasoline taxes and greater  subsidies to unprofitable wind and solar initiatives.

These  initiatives will have the effect of hurting high-paying energy related  jobs, increasing costs to consumers and increasing budget deficits. On  the whole, this climate change agenda will hurt economic growth even in  the absence of the more radical Green New Deal.

But many Trump policies will remain untouched. For example, here will not be a sudden reversal in the U.S.– China trade war.

This  is one of the few issues where Democrats and Republicans agree on goals  even if their tactics vary slightly. The rhetoric will be dialed-down  on both sides. Tariffs may be eased slightly but not eliminated.

On  balance, Biden will ease restrictions on Chinese investment in the U.S.  in exchange for new investment opportunities in China.

(Biden is  probably heavily compromised by Chinese intelligence and the Communist  Party of China because of his family kickback schemes involving Chinese  energy companies and investment funds).

The trade war will continue, but the financial war and the emerging Cold War 2 scenarios will be scaled back.

Added all up, it means not much of substance will get done outside of immigration, energy and possibly tax policy.

Yet,  those three areas are enough to put a substantial drag on economic  growth through higher costs, higher taxes and lower wages. With that as  background, we turn specifically to fiscal and monetary policy and the  likely shape of the Biden economy.

cybersecurity,Possible email server attacked? Maybe i'm just crazy,"Hey all - I'm the lone cyber guy for my company. Recently we've been getting some intense phishing emails, all stopped by outlook malware filter thankfully, but spooky nonetheless


These emails recently have been referencing some incredibly detailed information about the company

Example, one was caught that was talking about setting up a new contract, that referenced a contact we've previously talked to, it looked incredibly real apart from the fucked email address


Today we've gotten 3 asking about a payment that was never sent for a service we use, we actually use the service, and already paid the invoice in October. Weird part is, it was setup to look like it was forwarded, and had the actual emails that were sent back in October, just a forward with ""Hey we're still waiting for you to pay this invoice"" and the attached invoice tripped the malware filter. Rescan shows positive malware. The emails are not being sent from a users email, they're all spoofed names, but I'm wondering how they have the real emails that were sent. I figured the company we were emailing was attacked, and their emails stolen, but we've got two different companies that this is happening with so it leads me to believe we are compromised.


I'm a bit new to cybersec so I wanted to check here and cover my bases. Is this just super advanced or is it possible we are being targeted because someone has access to our email server? Is my thinking correct here? Too much thinking? Thanks

personalfinance,Paying off my student loan,"Hey there! First post on here so sorry if I don't include enough info. One of my goals for 2021 is to become more financially literate and to start banking more for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have $14,834 in student loans to pay off. My interest rate is 6.74% and is fixed.

I have just over $13,000 in savings right now and I am managing to put about $400-500 a month in my savings.

I have a job at a restaurant that has managed to keep a steady flow of business via takeout and outdoor dining throughout the pandemic. My monthly earnings there took a huge hit when the shutdown happened and will only go up as things begin to open back up whenever that happens.

I am also about to start working as a volunteer firefighter which should bring me in an extra $700-800 a month.

I am lucky enough to live at home for now and not pay any rent or utilities. I own my own car and my insurance is low.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: should I be paying off bigger chunks of my student loan? I hate going to see the progress of my loan and seeing that $250 of it was paid off and then I accrued $100 of interest. I was thinking of making a one time big payment to get it under $10k, is that a bad idea?

My reasoning for this is that I don't have a ton of bills right now and I would like to reduce this debt as much as possible while still maintaining some of my savings. I just don't want to make a big payment and lose a bunch of my savings and end up regretting it.",finance

personalfinance,Should I Pay off my car?,"I owe 6,454  on my car. I currently pay 275 a month and my loan doesn’t end until Sep 2023.

I got this car when I didn’t  have any credit and have been paying it since Oct 2017. So I’m sure a lot of that went into the high interest rate (idk what it is). 

I figure if I pay it off now I’d save around $2,200 (7-8 months of payment). 

And having/ saving that 275 a month would give me 3,300 back (yearly) in my savings so I’d get the money I spent on paying it off back within  2 years.

personalfinance,Does it make sense to get a secured loan to improve credit for a car loan?,"I am thinking of buying a vehicle, and would like to finance it with a car loan. I have a fairly short credit history (~3 years), and only have credit cards on my file. That being said, my utilization is low, and I have a flawless repayment history.

Does it make sense to get a secured loan to improve my credit mix? I'm hoping that it would improve my credit score and because of that get me access to car loans with a lower rate.

My credit union offers savings secured loans as small as $500, with no prepayment penalties. The interest rate is advertised as ""as low as 3%"". I haven't gone through the application process yet, so don't know what my actual rate would be.

Would opening a secured loan like that have a significant impact on the car loan rate? Or would it not matter much? Maybe a score of 750 already qualifies me for the best rates?",finance

This is what happened in the end, to the railway bubble:

 

## The end of the mania[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Railway_Mania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2)]

📷[George Hudson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hudson)

As with other [bubbles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble), the Railway Mania became a self-promoting cycle based purely on over-optimistic speculation. As the dozens of companies formed began to operate and the simple unviability of many of them became clear, investors began to realise that railways were not all as lucrative and as easy to build as they had been led to believe. Coupled to this, in late 1845 the Bank of England put up interest rates. As banks began to re-invest in bonds, the money began to flow out of railways, under-cutting the boom.

The share prices of railways slowed in their rise, then leveled out. As they began to fall, investment stopped virtually overnight, leaving numerous companies without funding and numerous investors with no prospect of any return on their investment.",finance

personalfinance,Paying down debt vs investing,"Hey pf, I'd like help on addressing my current student debt. Throwaway for reasons

I recently graduated with a lot of debt, \~2x my gross income. Let's say for convenience my income is 100k and my debt is 200k. It's all federal, with an avg interest rate of 6%. The CARES act has helped a ton over the past \~yr, but that's about to end and my interest is going to start accruing again at the end of the month. As of now, I could pay down 75k of my loans by drawing out all of my savings (34k) and selling my stocks (41k; 50% profit, long term cap gains tax). That leaves 125k of debt, which I can pay off in apprx 4.5 yrs (28k avg annual payment). This represents the fastest I can pay off the debt.

However, in this scenario, I am saving almost nothing for the 4.5 yrs. I max my employer contribution 401k, but I contribute nothing to my roth IRA. Some alternatives I've thought about:

* Save 12.5k for my emergency fund. Dump the rest of my cash+assets at the loan. Follow the same payment plan. This gets me clear in 5 yrs. 
* Save 12.5k cash and don't sell the assets. Dump only remaining cash. Follow the same payment plan. This gets me clear in 7 yrs, but my assets keep accruing.
* Save 12.5k cash, don't sell assets, and max out roth IRA each year. This gets me clear in 9 years.

I could apply a blanket 10% expected gain to my assets, which would make this question easy.. but of course market returns aren't guaranteed. Reducing my loans that have a 6% rate, however, is guaranteed.

personalfinance,$10k Student Loan due Friday,"I ended up dropping out of grad school after taking a $10,000 loan out. Initially it was a federal loan, but because I dropped out that semester the loan came from the school (I guess). This was two years ago. I used the money at the start of the semester to pay off my credit card debt after being underemployed for a couple years, so I couldn’t just give the loan back. 

Fast forward 6 months, I called the school asking what I can do to pay it back. Their only two options were
- Pay it in full
- $1,000 a month for 10 months
I was substitute teaching and making a few hundred dollars a paycheck so I couldn’t do that. 

Two years later..... I’m a teacher with an actual income now, but I don’t have $10,000 to give them even if I decimate all of my savings. I have $5,000 in savings now, but the thought of dumping that into the student loan in the middle of this pandemic where nothing is certain and I’m only JUST having savings for the first time in my life makes me want to puke. 

So what are my options? A coworker suggested I call SallyMae/Freddy Mae/whatever the loan servicer for the government is and ask if they can buyout this student loan. Is this a thing? Has anyone done it? Can a bank buy a student loan or should I ask for a loan to payoff this one??  

EDIT: It looks like my two options are get a loan from a bank to pay it off or let it go to collections and negotiate a lower amount I can afford.

Im looking for lien release specifically or certificate of satisfaction (or cancelled promissory note) since it's paid by another lender but how long does it often take? Most likely I'll have to reach out to them asking more documents? (It's not deed of trust but just mortgage since i didnt have any deed of trust document with old lender) 

2) once i have lien release or certificate of satisfaction, do i need to file to county's recorder office? I'm not sure if it's required but wanted to ask what to do with it. 

3) out of curiosity, upon completion of this refinance, i notice the refinance was documented as deed of trust. I look over and understood some differences but if i am interested in doing refinance in the future, can i ask future lender specifically i am looking for mortgage, not deed of trust? This is where im confused the most part. I know basically both mortgage and deed of trust entitle the lender to be the owner of the property until mortgage is paid off but it seems that deed of trust is more stringent and easily enforceable.

&gt;  
&gt;The company said the decision to end the merger was mutual.  
&gt;  
&gt;**About a year ago, on Jan. 13, 2020, Visa announced that it planned on acquiring Plaid in a deal worth** [**$5.3 billion**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/13/visa-to-acquire-plaid-the-fintech-powering-venmo-and-other-banking-apps-for-5point3-billion.html) **— roughly double the start-up’s last private valuation. The company’s API software, often referred to as the “plumbing” behind fintech companies, lets start-ups connect to users’ bank accounts. The company says it integrates with more than 11,000 banks.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Plaid CEO Zach Perret said in a statement the company will work with Visa as an investor and partner going forward.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The deal hit a snag late last year after the DOJ pointed out Visa’s acquisition could eliminate a nascent competitive threat. The DOJ cited Visa CEO Al Kelly’s description of the deal as an “insurance policy” to neutralize a “threat to our important US debit business.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;**The department argued at the time there was potential for the deal to extend a Visa “monopoly” on debit transactions, adding that it “must be stopped.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;The DOJ said in a statement Tuesday that termination of the merger was “a victory for American consumers and small businesses.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The lawsuit symbolized a step that many tech critics say should have been taken by the Federal Trade Commission back when it was approving [Facebook](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB)’s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, those mergers are re-entering public discussion. Late last year, the FTC and several states filed antitrust lawsuits against Facebook, alleging it used its market power to squash competitors before they could become true rivals to Facebook’s empire. The suits suggest remedies that could include requiring Facebook to spin off those two businesses.

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market posting small gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/V2Yn5xJ) leading the way, up .28%, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/hMpFmmF) gaining 60 points and the [SP500](https://ibb.co/YLYfs4V) finishing flat for the day, just about 3800, while the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sgR88nB) posted a 3% decline, though it seemed it was going to go back into higher volatility territory in the middle of the day

We also saw almost 70% of [companies](https://ibb.co/vHBQThL) advancing with 260 new highs on about average volume as 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/7pwD88M) finished in the green, with Energy leading the way yet again &amp; continuing to outperform in 2021, while Health Care and Communications lost more than 1%, with Large-Cap Growth Companies being the biggest laggard, also continuing the huge underperformance compared to all other factors, as small &amp; mid-caps have largely [outperformed](https://ibb.co/QH694Vc) since the start of the year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/2Kt4ChR) from yesterday, with most big tech companies losing ground, though Tesla did recover after an 8% plunge on Monday and was also joined by the Banks, the Semiconductors and the Oil &amp; Gas companies.

Yesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more &amp; more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it’s one of the best for long-term investing.

[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED’s Beige Book.

While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it’s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&amp;A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production &amp; airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it’s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.

We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell &amp; hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell &amp; hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It’s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services &amp; selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It’s seems a good &amp; interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.

In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK’s Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren’t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan &amp; others.

We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.

In the past I have paid extra principal to the amount of 3 extra payments per year, but I recently refinanced to a 30 year at 2.5% and am thinking with this rate so low and given then tax deduction lowers the realized rate even further, I am shifting towards putting the extra payments into stocks and making a lump sum payment down the line. Curious if others like me who would traditionally lean towards paying extra principal are shifting their position?",finance
personalfinance,Withholding for US job while officially living in the UK?,"I'm a US citizen living in the UK with my partner who's on a Tier 2 visa, so I'm on a dependent visa. I've not found a job here yet so I'm planning to travel to the US to continue teaching (I'm a university lecturer). For the purposes future settlement I'm going to try to use sick days and virtual lecturing in order to spend less than 180 days/year outside of the UK. This may last a number of years, since academic jobs are hard enough to come by in a good year.

I'm planning to find an international tax accountant (and I'd love advice about how to find one--just Google?), certainly before I file in 2022, but in the meantime I'm wondering if I should (and honestly whether or not I can) change my W-4 to have $0 withheld. As a UK resident I will owe UK taxes first, and I won't make anywhere near $100k so I don't plan to owe anything in US federal income tax. I will, of course, still file.

I assume I will still have to pay state income tax in the state where I'm working and living temporarily. But I'm also curious whether my US medical insurance premiums and 403(b) contributions count as deductions for my UK tax liability. I'm in Scotland, in case that matters.

personalfinance,Precious metals instead of savings account?,"I am in the United States, my currency is USD.

Hi all, I first invested in physical precious metals back in 2017, primarily silver, purchasing at an average of $13/oz. with silver currently hovering around $25/oz, I was wondering just how lucrative (or if it would even be a good idea) it would be to transition my savings accounts into physical precious metals that I would hold in multiple locations (around my home, safe deposit boxes, etc) instead of a regular savings account. I am thinking this due to the incredibly low interest rate paid on most savings accounts, plus the fact that the market automatically adjusts for inflation with the price of precious metals, meaning that my USD would be protected in a physical, easily liquid, intrinsically valuable, and stable asset while increasing at a higher rate than a savings account would.(As an added bonus, it’ll be useful in the apocalypse!) 

The majority of my money exists in retirement and brokerage accounts rather than savings accounts, so this would turn out to be roughly 1/4th of my liquid assets in precious metals.

Bad idea?",finance

personalfinance,What steps do I need to take regarding taxes and the IRS after pulling money from an IRA-BDA,"I don’t want to say the exact amount but I assume it could be important to this.

I inherited a large sum of money from a lost family relative recently. It was put into a financial institutions account with my name. 

I decided to pull a decent sum of money ($11,000 dollars before taxes) from the account just to help kick start my life and leave the rest to sit. 

Requested a paper check to be sent by mail with my money I’m pulling out and I plan to cash it once it comes in.
The federal government took its 10% from my $11,000 withdrawal so I wouldn’t have to worry about paying them later, and I tried researching the percentage I needed to pay for state taxes (in South Carolina it’s optional and you can opt out of paying state taxes upon withdrawing money) and opted to pay 6% (which I was pretty sure is the correct rate I need to pay.)

Now that I’ve done all of this, what forms do I need to fill out (if any) when I file my taxes and how do I go about doing it? 
While I am frugal with spending and I consider myself reasonably responsible with money I honestly don’t have much experience with taxes and the IRS.  

My father usually has someone do my taxes for me but I’d like to actually understand what I need to do since I can’t have him do it for me forever.

Significant invests and won a lot of contracts. Continued investment in 2021 and accelerate in 2022 as these mature to production.

**Primary Areas** - Target drones – very high in demand. Lots of contacts are for target drones. Leading high-performance jet target drones. Drones get shot down and then replaced, looking to expand domestically and internationally as new drone requirements are needed.

o Skyborg contract awarded. LCAAT contract awarded, government announced the Valkyrie flew with the F22 and F35 showing they have drones performing missions.

Next gen engines for drones and cruise missiles – important announcement made to have another contract for Kratos next gen engine for cruise missiles and drones.

**Unmanned drones** – Gremlin is reusable, only company with a family of these drones (low cost, 400k to 3m). Force multiplies and they’re the market leaders.

o Gremlin – govt announced they have multiple customers for the gremlin drones for when it transitions from research team at DARPA. Likely moved to 2022/2023 due to covid and earthquake. Nothing else in the Gremlin, Valkyrie class line aside from Kratos.

**Space and satellite communication**

o Biggest business in kratos, leading the industry, supporting ~80% space missions.

o Thousands of LEO and MEO satellites planned including HBTSS () and TITAN (Tactical Interface Tracking Application Node) program.

o Microsoft partnered with musk and starlink, AND kratos. Large, new 5G GSaaS beginning. Very low latency and very integral to this. Doing military and commercial, leveraging scale of having both military and commercial, making them competitive as they drive costs down. Very high expectations. High profitability 2022/2023.

**Microwave electronics** 

o Largest independent microwave companies internationally, in support of C5ISR programs.

o Industry seeing increased funding.

o Kratos typically only provider

**Strategic deterrence** 

o GBSD 
 180m contract including significant development systems needed for customer.

 New facility with new equipment for this program, production multiple times larger than dev piece, so expect massive investment. 2nd half of 2021, big step up in revenue in 2022. Big growth driver.

**Turbine tech and engines**

 Won a number of classified contracts.

o 2021 will be last year of increased internal investments. Heavy investment, but lots of growth after.

o Ground based strategic deterrent – multi hundred million contract, significant expenditure on machinery, tools and equipment. In 2021, as they won the contract in 2020, it’ll be a significant CapEx.

o Lots of IP movements on engines.

o Not taking govt funding for the next gen engines, they’ll eat the costs.

 Will need secure facility with classified environment. Most employees have very high security clearance.

o 2021 solid growth year, no questions about it. Primary dial on how good this will be is going to be a recompete. If not successful in the recompete, it’s a 35m hole to fill. VERY strong if they get it. If not, the growth won’t be as strong due to this hole. 2022 and 2023 look like step function growth years with lots of contracts maturing to production.

o LEO constellations from SpaceX will benefit Kratos. CEO isn’t sure about STARSHIP.

Ripple,Who is Gary Gensler - the likely new Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission?,"I've done some basic and high level background reading on the new SEC chariman - **Gary Gensler**. Of course this is basic and easy stuff to do. Wiki checks, reading about some of his roles in organisations he's part of, or has been part of.

How many of us are really doing this besides reading ""he's supportive of cryptocurrencies""?! I thought exploring who this man is, may be worthwhile, as he will be a leading voice in deciding if XRP shall be killed off, or not:

**Here is his Wiki introduction:**

Gary Gensler (born October 18, 1957) is Professor of the Practice of Global Economics and Management, MIT Sloan School of Management, Co-Director of MIT’s Fintech@CSAIL and Senior Advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative.\[1\] He also is an American public official and currently leads the Biden-Harris transition agency review team responsible for the Federal Reserve, Banking and Securities Regulators group.\[2\]

Gensler previously served as the 11th chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Barack Obama from May 26, 2009, to January 3, 2014. He was the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance (1999-2001), and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Markets (1997-1999). Prior to his public service career, Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs, where his last position was that of Co-head of Finance. He was the chief financial officer for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\[3\]

While serving as chairman of the CFTC, Gensler reorganized the watchdog efforts of the 700-person agency. Gensler led the effort to pass and implement comprehensive oversight of the $400 trillion swaps market, a form of over-the-counter derivative that was at the center of the 2008 financial crisis.

On January 12, 2021, it was reported that Joe Biden will nominate Gensler to serve as 33rd Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to deep dive into part of the above.  Senior Advisor to the **MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative**. But, what is this organisation? - [https://dci.mit.edu/about](https://dci.mit.edu/about)

Mr Gensler is the Senior Advisor to this organisation which has the following Goals and Values:

**Goals:**

1. Conduct research on blockchain and digital currency, broadly defined within two categories:
2. Core software and infrastructure development that addresses questions about security, stability, scalability, privacy, and the internal economics of these systems
3. Pilot projects and other research initiatives aimed at exploring and testing applications and use cases for the technology within business, government and society at large.
4. Be a neutral convener for governments, nonprofits, and the private sector to research and test concepts with high social impact.
5. Foster diversity and inclusion in the development and adoption of this technology by promoting access to educational resources among a wider body of students inside and outside MIT.
6. Equip students with skills to drive innovation in blockchain technology

**Values:**

\- Serve the public good

\- Have real-world impact

\- Act with integrity and rigor

\- Have the courage to rethink everything from the ground up

\- Challenge everything and be fearless

**Why does blockchain technology matter today?**

Many observers have compared the potential of blockchain technology with that of the Internet. The Internet enabled people to easily call each other without a phone company, send a document without a mail carrier, or publish an article without a newspaper. As a result, today more than 2.9 billion people depend on that decentralized communications protocol to more efficiently communicate with one another.

Similarly, a blockchain is a decentralized public ledger of debits and credits built on the principle that no one person or company owns or controls it. The intent is that users control their data directly. This new system promises to let people transfer money without a bank, write simple, enforceable contracts without a lawyer, or perhaps even turn personal property such as real estate, digital music, or a household’s rights to locally generated solar energy into digital assets that can be transferred or pledged with near-zero transaction fees. Many are projecting that the impact from the Internet of Value will be similar to that of the Internet of Information: Disrupting traditional industries, challenging existing regulations, and significantly increasing the volume of commerce by both dramatically lowering the cost to transact and allowing parties to enter into exchanges without having to trust each other.

For comparison, the Internet had more than 20 years to mature in academia and government before its tremendous impact on mainstream commercial and personal use was realized. The first bitcoin was created in January 2009. While it shows enormous promise, it’s clear that much work still needs to be done before this technology can become truly safe, secure, and ready for billions of users. At the DCI we believe we can make important contributions to its technical safety, security, and reliability through rigorous academic research.

&amp;#x200B;

**Brief Conclusion:**

It's fair to assume from the above that Mr Gensler is highly supportive of Cryptocurrency generally, he is clearly an absolute expert in the field of Cryptocurrency. I would assume and hope this is good news for XRP not being considered a security. It certainly feels better having read this about his background.  There's much more reading can be done around organisations he's work within or advised. But going over this briefly, has made me feel happier about recent developments.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Tax withholdings HELP,"I have been looking through this sub at tax withholding posts and googling and trying to figure this out but I just don’t understand it. I’m not even sure where to begin. My husband and I got married near the end of 2019 and filed our taxes in 2020 “married filing jointly”, we got a pretty large refund back. $1844 from federal and $1128 from state (AZ). We would like to start getting smaller refunds, we’re fine with getting a refund because we definitely don’t want to have to pay anything come tax time but we also want to be able to use more of our money throughout the year for debt and stuff. 

Ok. So, this year I expect to make $27,000, and my husband expects to make about $18,000 this year. Both only have one job each and expect to keep it the entire year. Fairly certain we both have the most amount coming out for taxes that we can right now. On our pay stubs it says that fed withholdings come out as single not married. Is that because we’ve never changed our w-4s before? Should we change that?

I’ve tried using the irs withholding calculator but I’m not sure where to find fed withholdings per pay period on my paystub and my husbands pay stubs don’t include his fed withholdings year to date either. Since we are paid hourly will per pay period be different each check? The calculator also tells you in a $ amount how much to withhold but I’ve seen a lot of people talking about withholdings in a number like 0,1,2 etc. am I getting two different things confused as the same thing??

And last question that I can think of now is, when I go on to my employer website to change my w-4, it asks for marital status, number of jobs including spouse’s, number of dependents (0), income other than from jobs (none), deductions, and extra withholdings. Would I put what I want taken out under “extra withholdings”? The word extra makes me think it’ll take out more on top of what’s already being taken out.

Last year was rough: lost family members, lost my job, my husband stopped working, and we barely got by. Unemployment was very unpredictable as I tried to find work. So we got heavy into debt.

By some miracle, the debt is paid off now (long story). We put away our credit cards. We're both getting on the same page with Dave Ramsey's system and saving for our emergency fund. We're also using YNAB / budgeting apps. Things are finally getting under control.

And then I got my bill.. My company just didn't bill me at all last year and sent me a year's worth of bills today. It's basically $1000. I called and asked if they have a payment plan option, if there's a collection agency to worry about or any interest rates. They answered no to all those questions. ""Just pay whatever whenever you can"". It was extremely vague and lackadaisical. I think they don't really care about me paying because really, they get paid by insurance more than anything. 

So... there are no real consequences in not paying right? I guess this is a real shady, low character option to consider. I just feel so desperate to not be in debt ever again and we're just barely getting back on our feet. I'm not sure if I make my own payment plan to pay it off in a year if I'll ever get ahead.

personalfinance,Confused about IRA transfer rules...,"Hi All!

I had an old employer's 401k that I'd like to consolidate into a Schwab IRA (where the rest of my investments are). I completed step 1 below, rolling my Fidelity 401k into a Fidelity Rollover IRA. I went this route so I didn't have to deal with the 60 day rule that can be kind of a pain. The rollover was all electronic since the money stayed with Fidelity. I'd like to do step 2 now but have a couple questions.

1. Fidelity 401k --&gt; Fidelity Rollover IRA (Completed last week)
2. Fidelity Rollover IRA --&gt; Schwab Traditional IRA

What I'm confused about is if I am able to immediately transfer that Fidelity Rollover IRA to a Traditional IRA with Schwab. Some articles online mention there is a 12 month waiting period before you can transfer an IRA again.

[Here.](https://finance.zacks.com/can-transfer-rollover-ira-traditional-ira-penalty-7776.html)

&gt;You can transfer a rollover IRA to another traditional IRA but you can't do it immediately. Federal IRA rules say that once you roll over assets from account A to account B, you cannot transfer the money from account B for another 12 months.

However, [The IRS website says the following:](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-one-rollover-per-year-rule)

&gt;This change won’t affect your ability to transfer funds from one IRA trustee directly to another, because this type of transfer isn’t a rollover (Revenue Ruling 78-406, 1978-2 C.B. 157). The one-rollover-per-year rule of Internal Revenue Code Section 408(d)(3)(B) applies only to rollovers.

At this point I'm just super confused... How is a rollover different from a transfer? What is an example of something that is subject to the ""one per year rule"" and something that is not?

Late last year, I transferred a Roth IRA directly from Vanguard to Schwab - is that subject to this rule? Does that impact my ability to transfer my Fidelity Rollover IRA to Schwab?

Thanks for any help... and apologies if some of this is simple... Just feels like there are a lot of similar terms being used and vague rules that don't totally make sense.",finance

I’m just about to sell my old car for around 6K and was wondering if it would be a good idea to put that money straight towards my student loan payment or max out my Roth IRA / invest it first because the interest in the loan payment is pretty low. 

Thoughts on paying off a relatively low interest rate student loan or should I invest my money?

personalfinance,Coming into money soon — investments or pay off student loans?,"My wife and I have a good safety net in our savings (covering about 6 months). Between the two of us, we have about 50k in student loans. I’m going to come into some money (also about 50k) from a cash out at a company I helped start. If it matters, half of those funds will disperse at the end of this month. The other half in July.

Our student loans are a mash up of subsidized and unsubsidized, ranging in interest rates from 6% to 9%ish.

Should we aim to get rid of student loans first, or invest in something that earns? Or is there a combination in the middle worth exploring (e.g., pay off higher amounts, higher interest rate loans only)?

MachineLearning,[N] The White House Launches the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office,"*What do you think of the logo?*

*From the [press release](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/white-house-launches-national-artificial-intelligence-initiative-office/):*

https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/white-house-launches-national-artificial-intelligence-initiative-office/

&amp;#x200B;

The National AI Initiative Office is established in accordance with  the recently passed National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of  2020. Demonstrating strong bipartisan support for the Administration’s  longstanding effort, the Act also codified into law and expanded many  existing AI policies and initiatives at the White House and throughout  the Federal Government:

* The [American AI Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/American-AI-Initiative-One-Year-Annual-Report.pdf), which was established via [Executive Order 13859](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-maintaining-american-leadership-artificial-intelligence/),  identified five key lines of effort that are now codified into law.  These efforts include increasing AI research investment, unleashing  Federal AI computing and data resources, setting AI technical standards,  building America’s AI workforce, and engaging with our international  allies.
* The [Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Charter-Select-Committee-on-AI-Jan-2021-posted.pdf),  launched by the White House in 2018 to coordinate Federal AI efforts,  is being expanded and made permanent, and will serve as the senior  interagency body referenced in the Act that is responsible for  overseeing the National AI Initiative.
* The [National AI Research Institutes](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/trump-administration-investing-1-billion-research-institutes-advance-industries-future/)  announced by the White House and the National Science Foundation in  2020 were codified into law. These collaborative research and education  institutes will focus on a range of AI R&amp;D areas, such as machine  learning, synthetic manufacturing, precision agriculture, and extreme  weather prediction.
* Regular updates to the national [AI R&amp;D strategic plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/National-AI-Research-and-Development-Strategic-Plan-2019-Update-June-2019.pdf), which were initiated by the White House in 2019, are codified into law.
* Critical [AI technical standards](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/08/10/ai_standards_fedengagement_plan_9aug2019.pdf) activities directed by the White House in 2019 are expanded to include an AI risk assessment framework.
* The [prioritization of AI related data, cloud, and high-performance computing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/accelerating-americas-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/)  directed by the White House in 2019 are expanded to include a plan for a  National AI Research Resource providing compute resources and datasets  for AI research.
* An [annual AI budget rollup](https://www.nitrd.gov/pubs/FY2020-NITRD-Supplement.pdf#page=17)  of Federal AI R&amp;D investments directed as part of the American AI  Initiative is codified and made permanent to ensure that the balance of  AI funding is sufficient to meet the goals and priorities of the  National AI Initiative.",technology
business,S Corp closure due to the pandemic,"Hi. I ran a small S Corp medical billing company. I worked for a doctor who decided to terminate my service due to closure of his office caused by Covid19. The company did not make a lot of money but it has at least $1200-1500 per month before any deductions in early 2020 and $4000 per month in 2019. It received last payment in March 2020. I did not receive a W2 or 1099, I only had a K-1. I am now filing a final return and closing the company since I was not able to get that client back. 

Now I am wondering if I or the company is eligible for any federal or state funds since it stopped prospering because of Covid19. 

Also, what is the best way to close it, just file a final return or declare bankruptcy?

Thank you!",finance
business,"Bad experience when trying to start my first business, just wanted to share...","On New Years Eve, I paid a company to form my first LLC and provide RA services.  I wanted some privacy from my personal address becoming public record and receiving a bunch of junk mail as a result.  I also didn't fully understand the implications of having my place of business be my home, because that seems like it would count as co-mingling, invalidating the liability protections I wanted in the first place.  So I did what was suggested on the Secretary of State website, and tons of seemingly credible sources found on Google, I signed up for a virtual mailbox service.  That went fine, they gave me the address so I used it for my formation.

Shortly afterwards, I discovered that to actually receive mail at the provided address, I had to get a USPS Form notarized.  Normally, that wouldn't be an issue.  But I had to move to a new apartment unit due to renovations on the previous one, so my CA ID's address doesn't match the proof of address document for my current unit.  Going to the DMV in my county is dangerous, daily cases of coronavirus have been climbing majorly since November.  We are the strictest state lockdown as a result.

I quickly reached out to the company and explained the issue.  Unfortunately, customer service was out of the office for 3 days.  Someone still submitted the documents to the Secretary of State.

I then filed a Short Form of Cancellation as soon as it was Active.  That was submitted yesterday.  Now I have to file my initial/final tax return (Form 568), even though I did no business with the LLC.  I am intimidated by this form, so I might now have to contact an (expensive) professional to help guide through it.  I forgot to mention, I'm low income.  So low, in fact, that I don't typically have to file both my personal federal/state taxes.  I survive by basically being a caretaker for my elderly, disabled father, while enrolled in college for computer science.  I wanted this LLC to have some liability protections for internet marketing of affiliate products.  I can probably do this as a sole proprietor as long as I follow FTC guidelines.

I feel discouraged from ever having my own business.  It's hard to get going for someone that is trying to escape their circumstances by starting a successful business, and have the benefits of an LLC.  Does that mean I will give up?  No, but this experience sucked.  Maybe one day I will look back and be glad my first try was perilous, but for now I'm just frustrated.",finance

1. When I opened my brokerage account (yesterday), I transferred $1000 from my bank. This $1000 is showing up under total credits &amp; debits.

And then once it's fully transferred, this $1000 will go to my Federal Money Market Fund which is when I can start buying stocks and ETFs - is that correct?
2. To transfer more money into my brokerage account (so that I can buy more stocks/ETFs), do I set up the transfer into the Federal Money Market Fund, and is it easy to move money out of this fund and back into my bank account without penalties? How many days does this usually take?
3. General question about buying ETFs - is it better to buy a lump amount of shares at one time or should I buy a few amount of shares a few times out of the month? I'm a set it and forget it kind of person that just wants to see their money grow, but not sure if there's any advantages to buying a few shares at a time on a more frequent basis.
4. Is it easy to transfer a Vanguard brokerage account to another one (like Robinhood) without having to sell all your shares or face any penalties?

personalfinance,Solar panel rental company charged me without statement,"So Vivint came with the new house. The agent made the mistake of your settlement wrong by a month so we didn't have to pay for the first month. The previous owner refuted so it was brought on our account on 2nd month but without the revision in previous month. I kept telling them to check on it and put it on but they played dumb and says it's correct and tell me to run the number myself. The guy from the production gave me a different number than the online monitoring each day so it technically should be lower, but no one ever does it so I can call on it. The accountant doesn't get to see the online statements I see so they keep hang up on me and customer service says it's fine. Finally, with one customer service on the phone calling the accountant and finally we have the rework on it. Many months later, I find that they overcharged me and the accountant on the phone searched forever when I also told her about the unauthorized auto charge on my credit card for it and concluded that they reworked on it and I owe them 8 bucks so that's why this month is overcharged. I asked for the updated or transition statement but got hang up. Call 2nd time, took forever to explain the problems and she told me there's nothing she can do. She finally reached the other accountant and said the same thing and when I asked for supervisor I was told busy. I even threatened to contact state attorney on this problem she says the supervisor will call later. I waited until late in the night including 3 hours difference, no one bothered to call when their shifted supposedly ends at 9 west coast which is midnight my time. No one bothered calling me many days later. I guess I could let it go. With 2 months November and December of no production, I paid 0 so I can put up with it. Now in the middle of January, 3 days ago saying I owe $80 when I visited online and no production whatsoever and no statement. I'm stopping bank auto deduction and won't pay until they give me statement. And I'm also stuck on this 20 year bogus contract at which the damn ex owner signed up for in 2019. 18 years more to go.

ethereum,"Ethereum, The internet for Markets. (An easy guide for newbies)","What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a platform built using blockchain that allows digital assets to be traded without a middle man. It uses this by using something called smart contracts. An easy way of explaining it would be the ""Internet for Financial Markets"". 

Just how the Internet connects computers so information can be transacted freely, Ethereum connects Buyers and sellers so they can also transact easy. On Ethereum, anyone can make a token to represent anything, from a house title, a car title, a State currency, gold, stocks, commodities, ect. When a token is built on Ethereum, it can then be traded easily with out a middle man; just like information travels through the internet without a middle man. Since Ethereum is an internet of markets, not only can you trade anything on Ethereum, you can trade any asset for any other asset. 

Hypothetically lets say you have the deed to your house on the Ethereum blockchain and you want to sell that house for Tesla stock. Well with Ethereum this is possible. Even if no one wants to buy your house with Tesla stock, Ethereum can automatically sell your house for US dollars, then in the same transaction use those dollars to buy tesla stock for the price you requested. These type of transactions are possible for for any asset that is built on Ethereum. The significance of this is that it makes a liquid market for any asset. 

The purpose of Ether, the native token for the Ethereum blockchain, is that Ether is what is used as the transaction fee for the network. Any transaction that happens on the network has to pay a small fee in Ether for the transaction to go through. This is what makes Ethereum so attractive as an investment. If everyone needs to use this coin to transact on the network, then the demand for the coin will be high. 

Currently there are hundreds of applications on Ethereum that allow you to buy, sell, loan, or borrow thousands of different tokens. If you decide to loan your USDC (Ethereum's bank backed stable coin) on an Ethereum application, you could make around a 4% variable interest rate on your money (Try to get that from a savings account). Other applications allow you to participate in lotteries where losing tickets don't lose value and prediction markets to bet on real world event. With Ethereum, possibilities are endless. 

**Potential Risk:** Like any investment, there are some risk for this coin. First, Ethereum can only handle around 15 transactions per second. This means that the more people that try to use Ethereum, the less efficient it will be. Over the last few weeks, users of Ethereum saw transaction fees go up to $50+ for a single smart contract transaction. Although there are plans to make Ethereum more scalable in the future, accomplishing this goal will take a few years at best.

Smart contract hacks are another risk of Ethereum. Smart contracts are the programs on Ethereum that give instructions to what you want the transaction to do. Sometimes these contracts get hacked taking all the assets that the contracts can hold. Although that is usually the fault of the smart contract programmer, it is still something that is not uncommon on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Currently Ethereum is the most used and trusted smart contract blockchain. Although it has its flaws, developers are working around the clock to fix these issues and make the best product they can.",cryptocurrency

\- buying mortgage discount points to reduce the amount of interest I owe to $0 per month.

personalfinance,Emergency life safety repairs for HOA community,"My HOA is voting on upgrading emergency life safety issues around our co-op community. Each condo owner is allotted a certain amount of shares in the community. The HOA has told us the project will cost $3.5 million to complete. Unfortunately the structures haven't been brought up to code since the 70s and things are falling apart. My individual cost based on my shares will be $25k for my one bedroom. Other owners have 1, 2, or 3 bedroom places and their costs go higher based on their shares. 

The community has voted not to get an association loan with interest rate of 4.5% over 15 years. This would leave us all needing to secure individual loans for our portions. The HOA is in talks of doing another vote because individual loans will cause hardships for some. Actually there were more yes votes for the association loan but the no votes had more shares thus tipping the vote to no. 

If the association loan is approved is it best to go in on the 4.5% 15 year loan? my share with interest is $35k.

I have $50k in company stock I could sell and cover taxes to pay my share which would be $25k without the association loan interest tacked on. 

Do I get a personal loan for $25k and hope for a decent interest rate. I just finished refinancing with 2.875% but didn't have enough equity to cover the repairs costs.

last but not least, my boyfriend proposed and though we aren't planning a wedding anytime soon, eventually we will buy a home together. When I sell my place I could bundle the remaining emergency repairs cost into my sale price and pay it off that way.

On the 7th of March, the population of Switzerland votes on the so-called E-ID law.

Here are the most important things in brief:

The state should only review the legislation and compliance. Private individuals should develop the solution. 

Federal Councilor Karin Keller-Sutter recommends the population to put a yes in the urn.

The E-ID is necessary if Switzerland wants to keep pace with technical developments. It is about being able to compete with verification offers like Facebook and Apple. “We need an officially recognized Swiss solution,” says Keller-Sutter.

In order to be able to take the progress into account, a recognition must be renewed every three years.

The use of the E-ID is voluntary by law.

Yesterday we saw 6 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/wJH4B8C) finish in the green with Real Estate and Utilities posting gains of more than 1% while the laggards were Energy, Industrials and Materials, as we saw large-cap growth companies finally [OUTPERFORMED](https://ibb.co/kKtRY96) for once in 2021, with small &amp; mid-caps giving up some of the big gains they have posted in this short year, though, Large-Cap Growth companies are still underperforming by 3% compared to the next factor group in 2021.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Ms0qkCh) from yesterday, which shows pretty mixed results as expected, with most of the big tech companies posting small gains like Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix and the rest of the bunch, with Alibaba posting a 4% gain after some EV news popped up and Intel also gaining almost 7% and pushed the rest of the Semiconductors down with TSM and AMD both down over 3%.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday as the US [DEFICIT](https://ibb.co/QXXDBrc) fell by $2B to $143B in December compared to the previous month, but is up 10 fold from the $13B deficit from the same period in 2019, and this doesn’t even include any of the $900B stimulus packaged that passed late in December, while the December consumer price [INDEX](https://ibb.co/n1Jr9G2) increased by 0.4% m/m and Core CPI also increase by 0.1%, coming in-line with expectations, as the Atlanta FED business inflation expectations [ROSE](https://ibb.co/t2v98jw) to 2.2% in January compared to December, though sales and profit margins compared to normal, decreased since the last month, while one of the FED’s Vice Chairs [RESTATED](https://ibb.co/WtNxQKM) that the FED won’t raise rates until the average long-term inflation stands at 2% for a year.

[Today](https://ibb.co/C79879d) we get lots of important economic data with Jobless numbers in the early morning, which are expected to come around the same numbers as the previous week and end with the Money Supply and FED Balance Sheet while the stock market will also turn its eyes to see what the FED Leader Powell announces in terms of the FED keeping the money printer going, and of course to see what Biden announces about a further stimulus packaged that is expected to be as big as $2T.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/9bHNxrx) spiking yesterday after the company decided on a change in leadership, this move put some selling pressure on rival companies like TSM, AMD &amp; others, but I think this is more of a “hype move” right now. Intel has still fallen behind it’s competition and it will take massive Capex and R&amp;D investments to catch up, so the selloff in other players should rather be a buying point, especially for AMD.

We also saw [Target](https://ibb.co/Phk4N4s) reporting huge comp sale increases with a 4.3% increase in traffic and a massive 12.3% increase in the average ticket, as comparable digital sales more than doubled.

We also saw, their same-day services post an impressive growth of almost 200%, as they remain one of the best plays in the consumer discretionary sector, as 95% of their sales were fulfilled by their 1600 store that are within 10miles of ¾ of the US population.

Also, guys, these small cap companies keep on giving me reasons to come back to the same points I have been making in the past weeks, with company after company issuing shares, with the latest ones being [Nano](https://ibb.co/qDRKJ7Y) Dimension which are diluting their shares by about 20% while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/27StT0c) has also increased their stock offering by another 300.000 shares.

While in another kind of news we saw [GameStop](https://ibb.co/pLMSXrb) soar yesterday finishing the day up over 57%, after a huge short squeeze pushed the stock up as high as 90% at one point. This has happened after GameStop has [PUSHED](https://ibb.co/F3S2XTT) for a change in leadership with plenty of experience in the e-commerce and online marketing world, with 3 veterans from Chewy, which has been an impressive performer in the online e-commerce business. The [STOCK](https://ibb.co/y8XVnd7) Is up another 20% in pre-market right now as the short squeeze keeps increasing the pressure on the bears.

We also saw [Alibaba](https://ibb.co/vjKdwKW) making a couple of headlines yesterday, which helped push the stocks 4% higher, after the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is expected to continue to allow investments in Alibaba, Baidu &amp; Tencent, while also continuing their charge into the [EV](https://ibb.co/0tVsJSS) world, with a new electric sedan that features wireless charging in cooperation with China’s state owned SAIC Motor. This is their latest push into the EV world, as Alibaba is also an investor in Xpeng. This news, might help the stock see a recovery, that could be boosted if Jack Ma finally appears and the Ant Group IPO eventually receives the green light.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/Z8RSWQL) is that Affirm went public yesterday and started trading at just over 90$, more than 80% above the IPO price, as the IPO mania keeps on pushing any recent IPO to big pops on the first day of trading, but unfortunately, retail investors do not benefit from this, as the actual return for people who manage to buy right at the open price, is under 10% while also risking a severe drop in the next days. Hopefully more companies will move to direct listings IPOs which will allow retail investors to get part of the action, which will benefit most of the people, not just the “big players” who get in at much lower prices.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/T8wRNxc) Markets are in the green while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/LkrrWtc) are also pointing to a good open.

personalfinance,Pay off student loans or hold cash?,"**Short version:**

Student loan = \~$31,000 at 3.375%...38 months left with minimum payments, costing a bit less than $1,800 in interest over that time.

Available cash = \~$36,000...

Married: me (31M) and wife (32F, stay-at-home mother) and 2.5yo daughter...currently working with fertility to hopefully continue to grow our family

Pay off the student loans over the next few months, or ""hold"" the cash?

&amp;#x200B;

**Long version:**

I have just over $31,000 in student loans at 3.375% left (only debt other than mortgage), and have essentially $36,000 in available cash.  For quite some time my wife (32F) and I (31M) placed a major focus on paying off my student loans, and have done well bringing the total from $125,000 down to current in 4 years.  But, the pandemic got me worried so we have been hoarding cash for the past year.  (I will add that I would not pay it ALL today, only leaving us with \~$5k in emergency fund.  It would be a process throughout the year.  While the pandemic has not hit us hard financially since my job seems to be pretty secure (healthcare...), it is 100% still ongoing so want a healthy e-fund.)

The wife and I always review our finances at the end of the year, and decided to change gears somewhat by opening and funding a 529 for our 2.5yo daughter in December 2020.  We always had felt that we should pay off my student loans before saving for our daughter's education, but decided to change plans slightly in knowing that we had the cash to pay off my loans.  This was also decided since the student loans ""cost"" such a relatively small amount of interest over the remaining term of the loan.

Basically, the loan has 38 months left with minimum payments of \~$875/mo.  That will cost us a bit under $1,800 in interest over 3+ years.  I will add that the student loans stress me out.  Nothing crazy, but I do pick up pretty significant overtime because technically we don't make our budget on just my base salary.  The calculation puts us $142 short each month, but we don't give as much to our church as I would like to make up the shortcoming.  But, we also never ""fall short"" because I worked \~60 extra shifts last year for an extra \~$25k in income, so it's never really been a problem.

So, does it make sense to hold onto cash (minus the $10k we put into our daughter's 529) and just pay the minimum with such a small interest rate, or get rid of the student loans? (Note: we are already fully funding HSA, IRAs, and my work 401k.)

Bottom line, wife and I made a plan, but now I'm second guessing and strongly considering changing the 529 beneficiary to me and using it to pay down student loans and continuing to do so until they're gone in 2021.  I know this is a personal decision, I'm just hoping to get some good advice..and of course I will discuss this at length with my wife if I do think a change should be made, but generally speaking I handle the finances so she pretty much goes with my recommendations.

(Last thing...there are two upcoming expenses that I guess stress me out.  First...I am planning on purchasing a pellet smoker/grill this spring.  This may cost a bit over $2,000, but am picking up extra shifts in January and February that will more than cover that expense.  Second...as I said we are trying to grow our family.  Based on some info we got yesterday there is a decent chance we will end up with twins.  Which would be super exciting, but also really stresses me out financially.)",finance
personalfinance,Does buying a house right now make sense?,"Long story short: is upgrading to a larger house a good idea, or should we focus on keeping our excess income?


We are looking at upgrading to a larger home in our current town. We currently live in a 3bed/2bath 1300 sq ft rancher with our two young girls. My husband works from home a lot, so we have built a makeshift garage office, which means we had to rent a storage unit for all of our extra things (camping gear, bikes, seasonal items, etc). However, we LOVE our neighborhood. It is a newer area with a lot of young families and tons of bike paths and parks, and easy bike access to restaurants, beaches, and shopping. We are an active family, and take advantage of all of these often with our young girls (2 and 5). 

We recently sold a bunch of stocks and we were able to pay of all of our debt, gaining us about $2000 extra a month, and we are now essentially debt free aside from student loans. 

We have been looking at purchasing a larger home, and this new financial situation along with interest rates has allowed it to be possible. 

We have found a house we love. It is 2300 sq for, and would provide the extra space we need. It is completely remodeled, and it is beautiful. However, it requires leaving our neighborhood, and moving into an older one. There are not trails and parks in this neighborhood, and not even sidewalks. It would take away our ability to walk anywhere, even just neighborhood walks as I would worry about my toddler running into the street without clear sidewalk boundaries. The road is also the main one through the neighborhood, so we will be getting a lot of traffic going by. However, the area is gorgeous, tons of wildlife, and lakeviews. We also would be walking distance to a very nice beach, if we felt safe doing so. However, we would be taking on $1300 extra in a mortgage every month (we pay $1500 now, this new house would be $2800). 

While we love the house, I have been going back and forth on whether or not we want to give up our neighborhood. A house of similar size in our current neighborhood is very expensive, and very sought after. It is likely if we held out for one here, it would be out of our price range. 

If we didn’t move, we would have a lot of extra cash each month. It would allow us to do a lot of things we have no been able to in the past (purchase new furniture, travel, start a good savings account, contribute more to retirement and our girls’ college funds). However, we are concerned that we will get trapped in our current house for years if the market crashes (and we lose equity) or interest rates go way up. My husband is also considering becoming self employed at some point, so that would make things more challenging to purchase.",finance
personalfinance,How to roughly calculate future funds in an Index Fund I’m consistently contributing to,"I have an S&amp;P500 index fund with negligible management cost.

personalfinance,Wife’s car totaled,"Right before Christmas someone pulled out of their driveway and hit the passengers side of my wife’s car (she’s okay, no injuries). Insurance decided to total the car and pay us out for the total loss of the vehicle. 

We are getting $11k for the loss of the car plus some insurance premium and warranty costs returned to us as well. Wanted to gauge this subs opinions on what may be the next best step. 

Currently, we have a second car that up until recently has been primarily sitting in the garage as I have been exclusively working from home since last March. This car has about $13k left to pay from when we purchased it in 2018. Given that I am working from home I feel that we would be able to make one car work for the foreseeable future. 

I am considering a few options and again would like to gauge other’s opinions for next steps:

1) use insurance payout to pay off current car and begin saving our monthly car payment for the next car, 
2) payoff current car and lease a new car as the totaled car was only driven about 8k miles / yr,
3) purchase a new to us car that would not be more than the insurance payout received from the totaling of old car,
4) invest the insurance payout until we are ready to purchase a new car. 

Thanks everyone for your help and input!

personalfinance,Just refinanced my car and now it's totaled,"So like the title says a few weeks ago I refinanced my car loan. Before refinancing I had about $3000 left on the loan at 3.5% interest. I was set to pay it off in a year just making the regular monthly payment. I also had credit card debt of about $5400 at 25% interest. I applied for a debt consolidation loan at the credit union my car loan is through. They said I didn't qualify initially but could refinance the auto loan to get $8400 ($5400 to pay off the credit cards and $3000 for the existing car loan) at 5%. This seemed like a good deal so I went ahead with the refinance. I didn't get the gap insurance because the value of the car is $8000, so a difference of $400 didn't seem worth it. Kind of kicking myself about that now.

Getting to my situation now, last week someone t-boned me and totaled my car. The other driver is at fault and their insurance will have to pay the value of the car. I've already made one payment on the loan so the total is actually only $8050. My question is, would it be better to pay off the loan and try to get another loan to buy a new car or to use the $8000 cash to buy a car outright and keep paying on the loan as planned? Or is there a third option I'm not seeing? When they ran my credit score for the refinance it was at 691, so I don't know if I'll be able to get as good of an interest rate on a new loan. My mom cosigned on the initial car loan, which is why the rate was lower (she was taken off the loan with the refinance). At the same time, I don't know if I'll be able to get as good of a car for $8000 since I paid $12000 for mine, but that was also 3 years ago. Any advice is appreciated.",finance

**Story** Wife and I live in a small home that has appreciated in value a lot since buying. We're looking at moving IN AT LEAST A YEAR (I think this is important), but absolutely less than 2.5 years. We also have a down payment fund that already has a little over $100k in it for the next house.

If we're keeping the first house long term as a rental, should we refinance it now before we move? Can anyone give me an estimate for how long til we'd recoup the closing costs.

Bitcoin,To those wondering about governments banning Bitcoin,"I just want to start with saying it is not impossible for a government to ban Bitcoin, but it is a bit more complicated than people generally think it is. I am not an expert but I just wanted to give some food for thought. 

It comes down to this. What sort of justification can the government come up with to stop people from spending their hard earned money the way they want to. They will certainly come up with something to vilify Bitcoin and justify some sort of ban.

I feel people tend to fail to understand how governments work (at least the ones trying not to look authoritarian). Even a government can't just wave a magic wand and simply declare something illegal and call it a day. They have to work within the publics interest, if the public has no interest in complying then the government has very little they can do apart from calling the troops to march on the streets, which has it's own consequences. 

A good example would be j-walking, even the lock downs right now, most people are honoring them but in some areas people just don't give a damn. Case in point the massive gatherings in Alabama to celebrate their team winning, the police an only stand there, watch and hope they go home soon. Sure they can throw some fines here and there and even send some to jail but by the next day most people have already forgotten and go on to do what they want anyways. 

Another big example is prohibition, the government literally signed it into the constitution and yet you had people looking for every loophole in the law. A lot of people suddenly became rabbis to skirt the law. Churches had a sudden spike in alcohol usage, doctors were giving alchohol prescriptions left and right. Private clubs hoarded the alcohol they already had (manufacture and sale was illegal but not cosumption). People, even state officials were brewing in their homes and on mountains, anywhere they thought they can't be caught. Speakeasys opened up all over secretly serving alcohol and bribing local officials to keep quite. 

Then the crime syndicates got wind that there is a new illegal industry they can make big profits from and swept right in to the point they were becoming nearly as powerful and influential as the government itself (at least domestically). Ultimately the president lost his reelection (by a land slide) mainly because we was not willing to repeal prohibition (which will also make the criminals no longer profitable enough to run the cities in the shadows) and his counterpart was. 

Another massive thing to keep in mind is that governments are not always as uniform as we tend to think they are. There are federal, state level, municipal, and local level officials all with their own agendas which often conflict. This is what made prohibition fail so spectacularly, local officials were often paid off or did not want to see their own friends and family behind bars. The feds then had much less human capital to actually enforce their law not to mention they also had their own re-election to worry about. 

To wrap it up. If people don't like your laws then they'll simply elect someone else who shares their interest. There is always someone else who wants your chair! 

Tldr: Making something illegal is a complicated thing and you have to make sure that everyone under you including the people share your view. Otherwise they will simply replace you with someone else and move on.

Note; I am not an expert on this stuff but there is a great oversimplified video on prohibition that I would recommend you take a look at.

personalfinance,Student Loans are frozen and likely to stay that way for some time. What do I do with the money I'm saving to pay them off?,"I'm 23 with a good tech job with \~$20K saved up(this includes a liquid emergency fund but I also have a credit card that I keep paid off). My monthly budget leaves \~$3K as well to put toward savings/student loans/buying a house maybe.

What should I be doing with that money instead of leaving it in the bank? 0.3% interest in the bank isn't great and most conservative estimates say student loan interest will continue to be frozen until at least April but possibly September for the pandemic. I know I need to pay into the loans aggressively once they're back because some are Parent PLUS (\~7% interest rate) but until then I feel like it's a waste to just let the money sit.

I know people pass off the graphs that suggest placing money in an IRA/401K but I feel like this is a fairly novel scenario where the money needs to be ready to be spent on student loans in a few months. Or maybe it doesn't need to all be ready to be spent down the line and I'm just overthinking it.",finance

personalfinance,OMG Mortgage Interest Rates,"Everyone is going nuts saying buy a home now, interest rates are at an all time low, there has never been a better time to buy. However, I am not sure this is the best time to buy and I want to get others perspectives from a purely mathematical standpoint (leaving emotions and FOMO out of it). 

The way I see it, housing demand is so high and housing supply is so low that as soon as interest rates drop the price of homes seems to jump up because people can all of a sudden afford more, and the limiting factor is what people can afford right now. Another point I would like to make is that if the price of the asset is inversely related to interest rates wouldn’t a rise in interest rates ultimately mean a fall in asset prices (even if sticky prices slows the fall). If both those two theories hold true it would make sense to me that now is a bad time to buy? With purchasing a home at a low interest rate you will essentially be locking in your mortgage payment at what price you agree to now without any chance to refinance in the future at a lower rate (lowering your payments).

Here is an example using made up numbers (that don’t actually add up), but should illustrate my point:

Option A: $200,000(principal) x 6%(interest) = $1500mo

Option B: $350,000(principal) x 2.5%(interest) = $1500mo

$1500 a month over 30 years is the same no matter how much of the payment goes to the principal vs the interest. 

In my opinion the higher interest is the better deal because if interest rates drop in the future you can refinance at a lower rate ultimately lowering your monthly payments and the total amount you pay for the home. Also, I am not sure it is still a thing anymore, but if you are able to deduct the interest from your taxes, paying more in interest and less on the principal (Option A)  would be beneficial there. 

Obviously there is a lot more to this, and I am probably missing some things, but I would like to know what others think of this. Obviously you buy when its time to buy and don't try to time the market, but I an questioning these interest rates are so low arguments. Again, from a mathematical standpoint, and removing feelings from the equation.",finance

If it increased my score by 10 points, the interest rate could theoretically go down, but I'm unsure if it matters above 750 FICO or so.

investing,A question regarding the bond market,"Hello r/investing,

Good morning, I have a question about the bond market. The following paragraph is from a book I was reading and I would be thankful if someone could please help me understand it.

The paragraph 

The major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on first-grade bonds to record high levels, although there has since been a considerable recovery from the lowest prices of 1970. The obtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 71⁄2% and even more against 41⁄2% in 1964. In the meantime the dividend return on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the market decline of 1969–70, but as we write (with “the Dow” at 900) it is less than 3.5% against 3.2% at the end of 1964. The change in going interest rates produced a maximum decline of about 38% in the market price of medium-term (say 20-year) bonds during this period. 

Question

Wouldn’t the price of a bond go up if the going interest rates go up? An investor would make more money by owning the bond, so I assume the demand for that bond would go up thus the price will rise. However, in the last sentence on the paragraph above, it says the interest rates went up and the bond price went down. I’m confused and any explanation on this would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you, 감사합니다

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinancing Help,"Hello, this is my first time submitting a post so I hope I've read the guidelines correctly.

My mom is looking to refinance our home. Currently our mortgage is about 163k with a 3.875% interest rate and a monthly payment of $1,028. The appraisal report listed the house at $358,000 and we were offered an interest rate of 2.65% with a monthly payment of $893 for a 30 year loan with closing costs of about $7,000 ($5,000 for the home and $2,000 for the person doing it). I've gone tried a couple mortgage calculators and they outputted numbers that don't really match up with the current information we've been provided (Like Nerdwallet saying our current payments should be 768 with the new payments being 533 and other sites also providing off numbers).

Does it make sense to refinance under these circumstances? I know that in the long run having low interest rates are better, but my mom was looking to have a lower monthly payment so she could put more into the principal but found that the $135 wasn't as large as a difference as she would have liked.

Any and all responses would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"I had some late scholarship money given directly to me, how should I best apply it to my student debt?","I'm a (2 weeks from graduating) college student who just received ~6k from my college as they found an internal scholarship for me after my account was settled, and then issued me a refund for that amount.

I want to use this to make a dent in my sizeable amount of student loans (before I start my Master's in the Fall), and I'm looking for advice on how to do that.

Here's a list of all the loans I could apply it towards:
Federal Subsidized, payoff $4,500, rate 5.05%
Fed Unsub (a), payoff $1,926, rate 5.05%
Fed Unsub (b), payoff $7,614, rate 4.53%
Fed Unsub (c), payoff $5,312, rate 2.75%
Private, payoff $16,546, rate 5.750%
Institutional, payoff $1,000, rate 4%
(I believe all rates are fixed)

My thoughts are split between A) Dumping the whole thing into my private loan as it has the highest interest rate and payoff B) Getting rid of as many of the smaller payoff loans as I can right away to reduce the number of accounts I'm managing C) Paying off a few small loans and dumping the rest into my private loan.

To me it feels that option C is the best, paying off my institutional loan and fed unsub (a) and then dumping the rest in my private loan. That being said, this is a sizeable amount of money that I want to be sure I'm using properly and would gladly take advice on. What's the best way to apply this money to my student debt?",finance

personalfinance,What's the best way to pay back my student debt?,"Some background info: I'm a May 2020 graduate in the U.S. With all the COVID extensions, my student debt repayments are still in their grace period.

I have loans totaling almost $14,100. One loan is ""Group AA"" which has an outstanding balance of about $5,800 at 3.760% interest rate. The second is ""Group AB"" (I don't actually know what these groups mean on Nelnet) with a balance of about $8,300 at 4.450%. They're both Direct Unsub loans. They're both set to the standard repayment plan, with 120 payments remaining as I haven't started paying back yet. Nelnet shows that the due date isn't till April. I haven't consolidated or paid anything to them, I'm just trying to plan out how to handle them.

I'm fortunate enough to have found a part-time job despite COVID and I live with family so I have very few costs at the moment. Even though my paychecks are small (I get $15/hour and I'm only part-time due to covid), I've saved up most of it except to help buy things for the house/family. I intend to go back to school (graduate level) either this Fall or the next depending on acceptances/scholarship opportunities/COVID. So I'm just looking for some advice on how to handle these loans in the meantime in the midst of the pandemic.

Should I start repaying now with what I'm earning or would it be better to wait until the due dates to start? Should I keep saving for grad school next year and try to get my payments deferred until I finish school?

personalfinance,Pay Off Credit Card With Financial Aid Money?,"I've always had very complicated tex situations. As a result, I've been holding onto anually disbursed FAFSA money for years in case I need it to pay for school tuition. This year however is different. My FAFSA came through sooner than expected. There's enough money to not only pay my tuition this semester but a surplus for a refund as well.

No matter where I look on my FAFSA profile, I can't find out what my expected interest rate on the loans I've already taken out is. Right now it's 0% because I'm still in school. I'm looking at $5,200 as of this year and it would be amazing if we could keep it that way. I have 2 semesters left to complete my degree. I've calculated that I'll be needing $5,800 to cover the rest of my required credits.

I have a credit card balance of about $2,700 that I'm making payments on at 2-3x the minimum payment biweekly. I expected to continue that trend for the rest of 2021 until I paid it off. With this windfall, however, I'm thinking I can pay it off outright. The interest rate is between 14%-16% if I recall.

It also seems like I will actually get enough money to cover school costs for my remaining 2 semesters. I guess I have CPTSD because of my checkered past of not being able to afford school. Holding back money is almost second nature.

What is the most logical move? Pay my credit card off with FAFSA money or hold it back for an unforeseen event (can't pay tuition, rainy day fund, etc.)?

Bitcoin,"Exchange-traded products abound, but crypto is still waiting for an ETF","Helen PartzJan 14, 2021 • 3 min read

Swiss SIX Exchange, Switzerland’s principal stock exchange, continues to expand its crypto products with a new Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded product, or ETP.

On Jan. 13, SIX launched trading of the BTCetc Bitcoin ETP (BTCE), a new crypto ETP product issued by London-based investment firm ETC Group. The newly listed ETP tracks the price of Bitcoin, providing investors with a new way to get exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Each BTCE unit provides holders with a claim on a predefined amount of BTC.

ETC Group specializes in building new digital asset-backed securities and is backed by shareholders like XTX Markets’s venture capital arm XTX Ventures and financial services firm ITI Capital.

SIX is one of the world’s biggest ETP trading platforms, listing a wide number of crypto investment products. After listing the world’s first crypto ETP in late 2018, SIX has been actively introducing diverse ETPs including several products backed by 21Shares. In July 2020, SIX listed the Bitcoin Capital Active ETP, an actively managed ETP trading BTC against 14 top altcoins like Ether (ETH).

An ETP is a type of security that is priced derivatively and trades based on investment tools such as a commodity, a currency, a share price, or an interest rate. Opposed to crypto exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, crypto ETPs are always 100% backed by the assets they are tracking. 

However, while crypto ETPs increasingly pop up on exchanges, especially in Europe, the digital asset industry is still waiting for the first crypto ETF.

The crypto community has made numerous attempts to launch a crypto ETF in recent years, with investment management firm VanEck becoming the first company to file for a Bitcoin ETF in July 2018. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission pulled back many ETF efforts, including two applications by Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

In the end, these applications were eventually dismissed by regulators, many of whom still believed that the crypto industry hadn't sufficiently matured in order to support an ETF. The United States Securities Exchange has also expressed concern over the volatility of crypto assets and the issue of custody vis-a-vis a Bitcoin ETF. 

Despite many failed attempts, the crypto industry continues its efforts to list a Bitcoin ETF on a major exchange. On Jan. 11, Canadian investment fund manager Arxnovum Investments filed a prospectus for a Bitcoin ETF with Canadian securities regulators.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Use a preselected Capital One card offer if I just got a credit card?,"I'm 23 and just got my first credit card about a month ago with Discover. When I was researching which credit card to get, I actually had picked out a different one because it had a $200 reward for spending a certain amount in the first few months. Applied for it and got rejected because I didn't have enough credit history (no credit card history obviously, so the only thing showing up on my credit reports was my federal student loans. I'd always paid on time since I set it to autopay, but I've only made less than 6 months worth of payments that were actually ""due"" since the pandemic suspended them). 

Well I just got one of those preselected credit card offers in the mail for Capital One Quicksilver. Tbh I can't remember for sure, but I'm pretty sure it was the same card I had applied to before and been rejected for based on the sign-on reward. 

Anyway I have two questions:

1. Assuming I was rejected for this same card previously, will I be accepted this time around if I use the link and code in this letter? Or is it pointless since I was already rejected so recently?
2. I know applying/getting multiple credit cards in a short period of time can adversely affect your credit score. Does this really matter if I personally don't mind a temporary dip in my score and don't have any plans to like buy a house or car anytime within the next 3-5 years?

Right now governments around the world are doing what we call ""expectation setting"", and telling the public that we will achieve herd immunity by the fall. I believe, based on what I have seen, that this is a conservative estimate. Remember when they told us a vaccine would take 12-18 months minimum to develop? It took nine months, and  that was for multiple vaccines. I think it's very likely we will see a similar situation with vaccine distribution, and by June it will pretty much be flowing freely in most developed countries.

This is going to lead to complete euphoria in all parts of our lives, including the market. Restaurants will be so full you won't be able to get a table. Good luck getting a seat on an airplane or a room on a cruise ship. All of those service workers who lost their jobs are going to be working overtime.

Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 are going to be absolutely insane. I bet SPY tests 500 by this time next year.

And then we arrive at the ejection point. All of that money governments spent propping up the economy? We need to pay that back. Interest rates will rise. Significant tax increases will be announced starting in fiscal 2022, and likely this is where the ship starts to fall back to earth and it's time to bail.

I'm not hubristic enough to think I can't be wrong. I could be, but I am confident enough in this play that I'm all in and the only thing I am thinking about right now is trying to time that ejection button in 2022 as best as I can.",finance

I'm looking for some advice on an issue with a puppy I had six months ago.

 I took her to the vet because she was in an extreme amount of pain. When there they told me to bottle feed her and give her a warm bath to help her belly. After taking her home that night and doing this she then had to go back the next day as she was getting worse. When we got there my mother took her in and they said that it was my fault the puppy was in so much pain because I fed her bottled milk which caused her to have constipation (The day prior someone sat with me and explained the best milk to give her and how many times a day so, I done what they said).  The receptionist was extremely rude and spoke to my mother terribly. When she was in the waiting room the puppy started being sick and wouldn't stop crying. As this was getting worse my mother went to the receptionist and told her there's an emergency and the puppy needs to be seen, which the receptionist replied with ""its because the blanket is wet shes  cold"" and left them there for 15 minutes waiting. 

When she was eventually seen the vet said the puppy had to stay in for an examination, but they did not want to keep the puppies mother there for the milk they would give her bottle milk. The same milk they told me caused her bloating! A few hours later they told me that the puppy had twisted intestines among other issues so it was best to put her to sleep with all the pain she was in.  I wrote a complaint twice to the vet and to this day I have not had a response from this complaint. I was told the bill would come a couple of days later, but it never turned up the only thing I had was a ""sorry for your loss"" card. 

As they have another branch which is where we normally go (due to covid we had to go to the other one)   we had to take one of the dogs for an injection to which I was informed that I have a £140 balance on my account from 6 months ago which I was never informed of. Personally (it might sound stupid) but due to the incident and them not replying to my complaint I thought that the bill had been cleared as I had no contact or payment requests from the vet. 

My question is do I have to pay this or can I refuse due to what happened and the way we were treated? Its been 6 months and no contact from them at all about the bill, only to say about how my dog is due a booster.

btc,"A ""Pay to Post"" app (Twetch) already exists for BSV, are there any out there for BCH?","As with everything, that ""really cool unique idea"" that I had turned out to not be so unique after all.

I absolutely abhor the peverse economics that got us in the situation that we are now with the big tech companies. For example: ""If the product is free, then you are the product"". And ""we can just raise funding for a product that operates at a loss indefinitely, as long as we acquire _users_"". It incentivizes a ton of bad behavior, not just on the part of the company, but by the users as well.

There's a lot of... _spam_ out there on socials, simply because the posters aren't the ones who have to put their money where their mouth is. There's just simply nothing invested on the creator's end that makes them invested in whether a post is good or bad. And this could be anything from picking the proper forum to post in, using the proper media type, and following common decency rules.

That is to say nothing of the replies. Oh, the replies! We all know that the youtube comment section is a cesspool, and at times, Reddit is not much better. Many naysayers like to chalk this up to ""being anonymous on the internet"", but I would say that since you don't invest in what you post, there's no reason to be thoughtful, or even civil. Except for (of course) magic internet points.

The way I see it, Twetch proposes a couple of things. The not only propose a cost to posting _anything_, but also an incentive system. The incentive system ensures that part of the cost of replying goes to the OP as a reward - and straight to their wallet too. This can be expanded to likes, upvotes, or even a little padding for the server operators to pay for storage space.

This is the antidote to the Steemit pyramid scheme. It's not that you get rewarded ""out of the ether"", and have some type of hierarchy. However, you can even make it so the cost to reply to a comment several levels deep includes outputs to all of the posters leading back up to the OP. This is REAL PEOPLE spending REAL MONEY and staking it on the fact that the OC that they come up with is good enough for other people to care enough to pay as well.

There are a couple things I don't like about Twetch though:

1. BSV-only (as far as I can tell)
2. Posts EVERYTHING to the blockchain (hence the need for ginormous blocks)
3. Twitter-like (I prefer a link aggregator for social, but that's just my opinion)
4. Centralized (I prefer federated systems)

I think the economics to Twetch are more sound that any other system that I have yet seen, however there appear to be a couple of insurmountable downsides that prevent me from throwing my weight behind them. Are there any projects that are powered by BCH that take the same economic principles and apply them with the above points in mind?

P.S. I am aware of memo.cash, and as far as I can tell, it _could_ implement this type of system, but does not right now. The only type of monetization for OC would be tips.

personalfinance,Need help figuring out when is AMT due I bought the stock options in Oct,"Hi everyone,

I  bought the stocks in Oct 20 and I didn't pay any AMT on it. I assumed  the quarterly payments would be due at the end of each quarter so I  thought on 15 Jan 2021, only 25% would be due. At least that's what I  thought and after some research I found out that I owe the whole AMT by  15th Jan and if I miss it I'll have to pay penalty on it. So, I just  want to confirm how is this actually divided into quarters and when is  the first payment due?

I have  another question, since my W-2 is not generated yet how do I go about  calculating my AMT? I tried looking up a lot of tutorials but all of  them show a different result. How do I calculate my 401K deductions with  respect to AMT. Does anyone have any simple example please? I believe  it is much easier to learn from an example. When I am done with this, I  will build an excel sheet calculator for future redditors based on my  learnings.

For easy calculation let's say I bought 10,000 stocks at 0.50 cents with an FMV of 10$

My salary is 120K and my federal deductions are 20K.  So, how much AMT do I owe?

personalfinance,I think I have a plan to pay down my student loans...would love additional eyes on it.,"Hi /r/personalfinance! Between increasing my salary almost twofold in the past 2 years and paying off my car in 2019 and credit card debt in 2020 (about $5k), I have been thinking a lot about how to pay off my student debt. I was on an income based repayment plan at my old salary and only paying $30-$100/month. Because my salary was so low (net about $22k/year) and because I file my taxes married but separate so that my husbands income doesn’t count against me, I was able to keep my payments very very low.

I did this with the hope of taking advantage of the PSLF program or having loans forgiven by the federal government someday. But I am 31, just had a baby, and feel really financially healthy so I just feel I need to get rid of these ASAP. I dont see any path forward for loan forgiveness at this point. I haven’t done anything with the loan while in COVID forbearance as of yet.

A few details: 

- Total outstanding balance is about $33,400

- Principal accounts for about $25,000

- There are 7 individual loans in the package ranging from 4.5% APR to 6.8% APR, and I’d pay the 6.8% ones in lump first to reduce future interest 

- Available discretionary income is about $1750/month until daycare begins in September and then will be about $900/month after that

- My budget takes into account modest automatic savings into my retirement/savings/baby’s 529 account/etc. and discretionary spending on things like Christmas gifts, takeout, happy hours during non-COVID times, birthday cards, and entertainment/hobbies as well as anticipated maintenance on my 8 year old car. 

Here’s the plan:

33,372.12 Balance

(8000)      Large principal payment using $3k from checking and $5k from savings, immediate

25,372.12 Balance

(1400)       Stimulus check, whenever arrives 

23,972.12 Balance

(14,008)   50% of paycheck at $1751/mo for 8 months

9,964.12 Balance

(9900)    $900/mo for 11 months

64.12 Balance

(64.12) pay it down

0 Balance

My only concern is I am reducing my liquidity a bit but infusing so much of my savings/checking cash into it right away but I just feel an urgency. To me this seems like a very aggressive plan and I could basically be done with these loans in a year and a half. My savings will be reduced by over half if I do the lump sum at the beginning, leaving me with only about 2-3 months in case of emergency but I think I am comfortable with that level of risk right bow, especially because my budget already includes automatic saving set-asides. 

So two questions:

1) Does this plan make sense to the more mathematically inclined? 
2) Does this aggressive of a plan make sense in the current unstable/uncertain environment in the USA with regard to wanting some liquidity?

Would love any input, expertise, words of caution, etc.

Edit: just read through the “helpful comment” post suggested by the bot below posted by /u/the_bagel_warmonger and it seems that Stafford Loans aren’t eligible for PSLF anyway, so that rules out about $20,000 in being forgiven regardless.",finance

personalfinance,Sell my stock to pay of CC debt,"Hey everyone, I’ve seen this kind of question posted before. But considering how each situation is pretty unique of its own, I wanted to give my particular situation and see what everyone has to say.  Obligatory I am posting this on mobile. 

March of last year, I came home from a military deployment during peak COVID; because of this, I couldn’t find any civilian employment and had burned through all my deployment savings + racked up ~8k in credit card debt (between two credit cards, both at around 25% interest rate) to keep my roof over my head and pay other bills and expenses until I was able to secure a job.

I’ve been debating on the idea of selling my stock, which totals about $6,500, along with my tax return that is close to $1000. It would put me close to knocking out that debt. But the growth of my stock has been a deterring factor as I’ve held onto this stock for many years and have had relatively significant growth from my initial investment, which over a one year return has been 30.72%.

I’m in a position now with solid budgeting I *could* knock out this debt without selling my stock but that would be a multi year endeavor, that would forgo any savings building/emergencies funds and I’m concerned of any of kind of COVID like emergencies that might put me back in this position again.

Curious as to everyone’s thoughts on this.

solar,any experience with Tesla solarroof tiles?,"my 90 year old home is due for a replacement roof soon anyway, and I stumbled on tesla's webpage for their solar roof, and to be honest the numbers they spat out looked pretty attractive - I have a south facing roof that's about 1.5k sq ft, and with a big enough system on the roof seems like I could generate about 10-13kwh / yr - and the incentives currently offered by federal, state, and local utility deals, seems like they're offering to buy power from us at 2-3x retail locked in for 10 years!?

**Gross income**: $250,000

**Monthly mortgage**: $3,500

* Principle: $1,000
* Property taxes: $500
* Mortgage interest: $2,000

&amp;#x200B;

Total interest paid over one year: $24,000

Total property taxes (SALT) over one year: $6,000

Total that can be deducted from taxable income: $30,000

Federal taxable income: $250,000 - $30,000 = $220,000

**Federal income tax bracket (highest)**: 35%: applied to income from $209,426 - $250,000

Amazon.com Inc. is opening warehouses and shipping hubs in the U.S. at the rate of about one every 24 hours. The ultimate aim is to ensure that virtually every product the company sells is a van ride—and eventually a drone flight—away from customers’ homes. And yet, last week Amazon announced it was buying 11 Boeing 767-300 jets for its air-cargo division, mostly to get products to Prime subscribers.

The expanded air-cargo operation will add billions of dollars to already hefty shipping costs that amounted to $52 billion in the 12 months ended in September. Though Amazon is one of the wealthiest and most valuable companies in the world, it has historically operated on razor-thin margins and plowed cash back into the business, sometimes to the consternation of investors who’d rather see the company focus on profitability.

Even as Amazon expands its air-cargo division, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos remains fixated on his ultimate dream: building a network so sophisticated it can get just about anything to a customer’s doorstep in 30 minutes or less. One day his vision will bring another air carrier to life, the Prime Now drone fleet, that along with autonomous vehicles and electric vans could make it less necessary to fly stuffed giraffes across the country.

personalfinance,Need Advice: Should I Payoff Student Loan Quickly or Refi So I Can Buy a Condo?,"I live in a large U.S. City with reasonable housing prices compared to places like NYC or SF. I've been interested in buying a two bed room condo between $300k and $400k, but it's still expensive to live here and housing prices are stable and not really growing like other parts of the country. The area I want to live isn't the best for investment, but it's you know, where I want to live.

That said, my student loan payment has prevented me from affording anything in that range at this time due to a high Debt to Income Ratio.

My student loan is $50k remaining at 4.1% fixed interest rate after refi 3 years ago on what was then a five year loan (originally $140k in 2012). I've been paying it down pretty quickly (aiming for 11 years from date of graduation) up to $1,800/month. But given the low interest rate (4.1), and the current low rates available I've been wondering if I should refi again and look to buy a condo.

My best option appears to be a ten year 4.3% interest fixed rate loan, which will drop my monthly student loan payment from $1,800 down to $500. I will pay approx. $12,000 more on the loan over the additional seven years compared to my current payoff schedule. And rather than be debt free in my 30s, I'll be paying off a student loan into my 40s.

Math has never been my strong suit and I don't know if I'm looking at this right. But it looks like I'll have an extra $1,300 every month to invest or utilize in a home purchase. The drawback is the extra $12k I'll be spending on the loan. But $1,300 over ten years is a lot more than the $12,000 I would save if I stayed with my current payoff schedule, but again I don't know if I'm looking at this right.

My concerns originally were buying a place and having a student loan hanging over my head. But that might not be rational.

I'm in a good field making $9k/month with job security. What do you folks recommend? Refi and buy a condo in the next few months or payoff my loan in ~2 years and wait on the condo.",finance
personalfinance,Choosing between Two Cashback Credit Cards,"I recently got married and bought a house that needs a lot of work.  My spouse and I plan to pay cash for the remodeling expenses, but we’d like to put the home improvement purchases (+ other joint expenses) on a cash-back credit card to earn a little money (we will pay the card off each month, so we’re not concerned about the interest rate).

We have two options for a credit card:

**OPTION 1: Use my current Bank of America Cashback Preferred Rewards Card, spouse signs on as authorized user.**

-	Pros: It has a high cash back reward rate (3.75 for preferred categories, 1.25 for all purchases)

-	Cons: I would need to get another credit card for my separate expenses, which would lower my credit score (it’s currently at ~770, but adding a new card would reduce the average age of my credit history, which is the only factor currently dragging down my score.  I also assume my credit score will decrease once the new house appears on my credit)

**OPTION 2: Spouse opens new Citibank Double Rewards Card (2% cashback, any category, no limits), I sign on as authorized user.**

-	Pros: My spouse  has higher credit score (810) and older credit history, so opening a card would not impact his credit as much

-	Cons: Less cash-back than BOA’s card

We plan to spend at least $3k a month on the card.  Given this information, which option would you choose?  Do we risk a temporary drop in my credit score to increase potential earnings, or do we play it safe and get a card with a lower cashback rate? 

Please let me know if more info is needed to make an informed recommendation.",finance

personalfinance,Getting started with investing?,"I've been wanting to start investing my money for a little under a year now but kept shying away for various reasons.

I started a robinhood account a bit back to track stocks and was given 1 share of SRNE. Thought about buying more of that stock when it was less than 2 a share only to watch it explode after covid and kick myself for not doing so. I keep watching all of these stocks and seeing them do well but being too worried over the risk.

I finally started putting money into my company's 401k plan at the start of this year to at least meet the maximum employer match. I should've done that 2.5 years ago when I started but I've only just finally started feeling financially secure in the last 6 months.

I got promoted about 7 months ago and am already looking at getting promoted again the next few months.

I was able to pay off my car this year and started taking a serious look at my budgeting to improve my non bills spending and finally build up my savings account, especially with some of the rough times I had over the last few years where I found myself with almost nothing.

I'm now sitting with 25k in my savings account that has a pointless interest rate. I owe 15k in a private student loans at 2.5% and another 38k in government student loans at 3.4% for 10k and the other 28k at 6.8%.

I finally got my credit score fixed as it was at 720 with a delinquency from a wrongly filled medical bill for years so now I sit at 800 with no negative reports. I'm hoping this means I can finally get approved to refinance my government student loans at a better rate through a private company as I've always been denied. I'm holding off for now till the coronavirus forbearance expires and also to see if the new presidential administration will adjust rates or forgive any amount.

I'm planning on moving in with my girlfriend soon once we find a decent place. My budgeting had for the past half year plus included expenses for rent, utilities, and once full student loan repayment begins again so I know I'll be able to comfortably afford those going forward, I just won't be bulking up my savings account nearly as much as I've been doing this past year which I'm okay with.

I'd like my savings to be able to sustain me should I end up out of work for a whole year but for now it's definitely good for more than 6 months which is quite comfortable.

I just learned about indexes for the first time after browsing reddit. I still don't know much about them or stocks in general (I still can't comprehend what options, puts, etc are). Indexes though seem like the safe low risk form of investing I've been searching for. I have a Fidelity account through work that I was just searching and I realized it includes an individual account aside from my RSU and 401k account that I can use for trading stocks.

I'm contemplating taking 10k out of my savings to buy into VOO or SPY and just let sit. Looks like the rate of return on these is better than any interest I'm paying and that they seem like fairly low risk choices for investing to help my make my money work for me and not just sit and devalue like they are currently doing in my savings. And unless I'm missing something, God forbid something happens and I need to heavily dip into my savings, I can just sell some of my holdings without any penalty aside from short term versus long term capital gains to get that money back?

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans. Need help selecting which interest rate is best with peace of mind as well.,"Sorry for the lengthy title. I am planning to refinance my student loans amassing $65840.55. I am refinancing with earnest which has a sliding scale of minimum payments which obviously impact the interest rate. I am planning to pay $845 a month in total payments, whether that be the minimum payment or if adding extra to the other payment amounts. My options are as follows:

$845 minimum payment @ 3.4% interest

$745 minimum payment +100 extra @ 3.44% interest

$645 minimum payment + 200 extra @ 3.53% interest. 

Cleary the benefit of the smaller payment is if for some reason things go wrong I have  $200 or $100 extra cash a month. Mind you I have a total savings of about $18,000 but I am a scared skeptic and fear everything going wrong financially lol

economy,How we got here,"We can start with the fact that America,s economy has been struggling for a few decades. Much of this happened because of the “ cost of goods sold “ was much cheaper in China and other countries, but mostly China. Now most of the explanations are related to their cheap labor. This is a major factor, however, two other factors of significance are way too many regulations and our tax rates and structure! Another factor is or was some time ago. Union negotiated contracts that helped drive these costs up higher, contracts that drove up labor costs to high without incentives for increased efficiency and increased production. Contracts that could not be lived up to ever blue to the defined benefit for their pensions that were calculated using models that were the markets best years, but could never be delivered without bankrupting them. The private sector gradually weened out the unions, but now they are bankrupting the public sector.
Now you add in, actually this has been a fact for awhile, that to get to positions of power in the public sector and in the most powerful companies you have to be a graduate of an elite school. These people have all the connections and all the control of the money and the power to do almost whatever they want. 
Prior to COVID-19 we were already seeing many companies downsizing on a large scale or going into bankruptcy. For the average person the most visible were “retailers”, but many others were in the same position. I believe this goes to fiat money and leverage/debt that was taught in the business schools. When you use these levels of debt/leverage to expand and grow you make your business vulnerable when recessions come. Normal recessions are generally not a problem for most of them, but, for some the level of leverage was massive. Then you add in the other factors I mentioned previously you get the bankruptcies. 
Then looking on the national and international level all the elite educated power brokers were taught about money using a very faulty theory. Keynesian economics. Imagine you borrow $300,000 to buy a house, then,a couple years later you get laid off and you are struggling to pay the loan. You get a new job but you are making 20% less, and your family has increased its credit card debt and you bought a car in addition. Now what do you do, well the banks offer a low interest loan for another $150000-$200000. You take it so you don’t lose your house. Now your debt may be $350,000-$400,000 or more. Think about our government before COVID. More than $25,000,000,000,000. And that does not include SS and Medicare and Medicaid, which may be more than $60,000,000,000,000. Our currency is not backed by anything, and our dollar has lost 90% of its value since the early 1970’s.
So what I’m getting at is our elite leaders from the elite schools maybe aren’t as smart as they lead us to believe. They seem to think that those at the top of both government and the “CRONY” capitalists are the only ones smart enough to make our country and our world great. They don’t think the private sector generally has the smarts to make America prosper, or they just want to control us. All this censoring and canceling shows the power that they seek. If you don’t teach the young critical thinking skills it is much easier to indoctrinate them with memorization.
Going back to the economy, when the fed prints money and lower interest rates it changes the risk model. Since money is so much cheaper companies will make more risky decisions and down the road it will often come back to bite them.",finance

personalfinance,Best way to help sibling buy a home that benefits us both?,"I'm in a fortunate position to be able to contribute to my brother's down payment on a house. I'm not looking to get the money back any time soon, my primary goal is to help drive down my brother's monthly mortgage and use the house as a long-term investment.

Here's the options I've thought of so far.

**1)** Invest with agreement that I receive my share back as a portion of profits whenever he sells the home.

ie. he puts down $20k, I put down $40k on $400k home. He pays all mortgage payments, so my only contribution is $40k. In future, he eventually sells the house for $500k, I would get back my initial investment and using these example numbers, 10% of the profits.

**2)** Give money as a loan and he pays me back with very low interest rate.

I'm not really interested in this option as I'm not looking to get the money back asap and I don't want to be making money off my brother. Also current interest rates are crazy low, so I'm not doing him any huge favors.

Surely there must be several other options I'm not considering. Curious what I'm completely unaware of. Thanks!",finance

2) Prepay $X of taxes to the IRS by paying with your new credit card. You would incur a 1% fee here (2% IRS fee - 1% cash back)

3) Adjust your tax withholdings with your employer so that no federal taxes are withheld

As long as you’re on top of your finances, this sounds like a great way to get a cheap 1% “interest” loan for $X. The only downside is that $X is paid out in cash over a few months and that you have to be able to pay off the entire balance before the 0% promo credit card APR ends

personalfinance,Taking advantage of business discounts as an individual,"This may be a bit of a spit ball but I think it's valid. A lot of companies have perks and discounts for b2b transactions and business customers. FedEx for example has cheaper shipping rates for businesses even if you don't ship a lot of items. FedEx also requires nothing more than a business name and some info you can make up to allow you to make a business account with them. Lots of others companies require a bit more legitimacy. Most rich people have either a shell company or a legit company they can play with. 

My thought is, would it be worth it to set up a ""small business"" or incorporate like contractors do just to reap the perks. If you set up a company when you are young you could slowly build it into a catch all. Open a company bank account and corporate credit card with a $500 limit and use it here and there to built the company a credit history. Banks give special treatment to businesses to some extent especially with bank accounts. After a few years your ""company"" would have the history necessary to get all the rewards. Business accounts have no minimum balance, company cards look baller and give better rewards. Side work could go through your ""company"" to give more legitimacy and potentially tax credits. You could get business rates on shipping, insurance, travel, phone and internet, and better customer service everywhere. You could also take out business loans at lower interest than a line of credit and if your ""business"" has any income or assets you could write expenses off against it. 

TLDR Many companies have discounts for b2b customers. Would it be worth it to have a legitimate business just to utilize those rates.",finance

*****
&gt; President-elect Joe Biden moves into the White House in the coming week with the biggest stock market tailwind since a presidential Election Day going back to at least 1952.
*****
&gt; According to CFRA data that begins that year, the near 13% gain since Nov. 3 would be the biggest increase in the S&amp;P 500 between the election and inauguration if the gains hold. President John F. Kennedy’s 8.8% gain had been the best, followed by President Dwight Eisenhower, with 6.3%, and President Donald Trump, with 6.2%.
*****
&gt; Biden’s promise of the $1.9 trillion relief package he announced Thursday is one of the reasons for the stock market’s surge, and it will be a big focus of markets in the week ahead as investors handicap its chances of winning congressional approval.
*****
&gt; The Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday starts off the week, and over the next four days several dozen S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, IBM, Intel and Procter &amp; Gamble are among the companies reporting.
*****
&gt; # Biden will have no honeymoon
The $1.9 trillion stimulus package is at the top of the agenda. But there is also significant focus on whether his administration will be better at controlling the pandemic and rolling out the vaccine, as he has promised.
*****
&gt; “This is the number he came in at. Where do negotiations go from here?” Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, said of the $1.9 trillion package. She pointed to worries about a weakening economy, evident in December’s retail sales data, down a surprising 0.7%, and weekly jobless claims, at the worst level since August.
*****
&gt; “You could argue this is Covid-related and therefore what is most important going forward is to see the logistics of the vaccines, inoculations gain orderly momentum. That is crucial for the market,” she said.
*****
&gt; Krosby said the market is focused on the inauguration.

&gt; “They want to see it go smoothly, and that there’s not any security lapse. The market absorbed the events of Jan. 6. The market looked ahead and figured out that at this point it was a one-off, and the market ended higher on Jan. 6,” she said. “But always the market becomes much more defensive if what we considered an isolated event suddenly broadens out.”

&gt; There will be heightened security surrounding the inauguration after a mob of Trump supporters assaulted the Capitol while Congress was in the process of confirming the Electoral College vote. The House last week voted to impeach Trump for inciting the mob, and now there is concern about further incidents in Washington or at state capitals.
*****
&gt; # Stimulus and stocks
Markets are also watching carefully to see whether Biden can bridge some of the deep divide between Republicans and Democrats, who now hold a thin majority in Congress.
*****
&gt; “We’re getting stimulus, and now the question is ‘OK, you’re supposed to be this great compromiser,’” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Political strategists expect Biden will get his stimulus package but it will be trimmed down. Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, said the package could be cut to about $1 trillion based on the size previously discussed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and outgoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
*****
&gt; “Does Congress want to have a bipartisan show of support after what has been an extraordinarily tenuous beginning of this year, to put it mildly?” Mills said. He said the stock market should continue to do well because it is going to get stimulus spending.
*****
&gt; “D.C. is going to be there with more spending, or consumers are going to be there with more spending if they have the ability to get to a post-vaccine world sooner,” he said.
*****
&gt; Stovall said that if history is a guide, the stock market should do well with Biden. The average gain of the S&amp;P 500 in the first 100 days for Democratic presidents is 3.5%, going back to 1952. For Republicans in the same period, it’s been an average 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has also gained an average 11.3% in the first year of a Democratic president, but just 5.7% for Republicans, going back to World War II.
*****
&gt; The stock market will continue to monitor the bond market, after the 10-year Treasury yield reached a high of 1.18% this past week, the highest since March. It since slid back to about 1.08% Friday after the weak data.
*****
&gt; “Other things are going on in the back room. Bond yields have moved up of late, and it was a change. It gave you a sense of how fast rates can move,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “It might be a preview of what you can expect this year.”

&gt; # Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Week Trading: Leans Bearish

&gt; Although Martin Luther King Jr. Day was a holiday in many states and cities throughout the U.S. beginning in 1971, it did not become a federal holiday until 1986. Even then it was not observed by the NYSE until 1998. In the 23 years since, the market’s performance during this four-trading-day week has been somewhat lackluster with average weekly performance negative for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. Average losses range from 0.81% by DJIA to 0.16% by NASDAQ. Of the five indexes, not one has a record better than 50/50. However, since 2012 performance has shown signs of improving. DJIA, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have risen in six of the last nine years. S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have climbed in five of the last eight.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/67df4ce1594bee9748fb885a5316ff07/b5f21cb74511d020-c9/s500x750/218ed920ea1a67d95ff97fd05a5b9bbdf2454805.jpg))**

&gt; # Seasonal Soft Patch Ahead Starting Next Week

&gt; With nine trading sessions of the New Year complete, January and 2021 are off to a solid start. DJIA is up 1.26% as of today’s close, S&amp;P 500 stands at 1.05%, NASDAQ 1.74% and small caps, measured by the Russell 2000 are up a whopping 9.14%. These gains all point to and confirm the return of seasonality that we have recently noted.

&gt; Last September was weak as it has historically been, then October exhibited it historical tendency toward volatility while November and December were both positive, in line with typical seasonal patterns. A positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days are also encouraging indications that seasonal forces are once again tracking. We expect seasonality will continue to present itself going forward as extraordinary efforts are made to quell the pandemic and return to a pre-Covid, open-for-business, way of life.

&gt; Due to the reemergence of seasonality, we would not be surprised to see some market weakness in the second half of January next week that could persist throughout the rest of January and possible spill over into February. In the following seasonal pattern chart of January, the last 21 years of data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been plotted with January 2021 through today’s close plotted on the right vertical axis.

&gt; Over the last 21 years, it has been NASDAQ leading at the halfway point, this year it is Russell 2000. Other than that, the major indexes have been tracking their historical patterns fairly well. There was strength early on, followed by sideways action. Should the current trend follow historical patterns then weakness after the eleventh trading day (January 18) is possible.

&gt; # 5 Charts on the Democratic Blue Wave

&gt; One of the top questions we’ve received recently has been what a blue wave may mean for investments. After the Democrats won the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia, they will now control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Our January 11 Market Policy Projections for 2021 gave some of the immediate and longer-term policy impacts of the Democratic “blue wave,” and here we surf the blue wave with some interesting charts.

&gt; First off, blue waves have not been bearish for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 Index higher 6 of the past 7 times and up a respectable 9.1% on average since 1950.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog-1.15.21-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We shared this chart in 2020, and it shows that historically, stocks do better if an incumbent president wins versus a new president in office. This makes sense, as a new president will bring in new policies and likely question marks—while you know what you will get with a re-elected president. Remember, markets hate uncertainty and surprises.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Make it all nine new Democratic presidents since 1900 to bring with them both the House and the Senate. In fact, stocks do quite well that first year under such circumstances, up nearly 12% on average,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Maybe investors shouldn’t fear a blue wave after all.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when a new Democratic president has brought with them the House and Senate, stocks gained that first year of their new presidency 6 of 8 times. What stands out to us for 2021, though, is the House majority is only 11—the smallest for a new Democratic president since 1900.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blog-1.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Looking at all of the times the Democrats controlled the House (since the 35th Congress when it was Democrats and Republicans), the 11-seat majority is the lowest since 9 seats in 1879. Yes, the Democrats are in power, but this small majority will make it very tough for any of the more extreme policies to pass.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Econ-blog-1.15.21-4.png?ssl=1)**

&gt; Lastly, the Senate is split a perfect 50/50, which is again extremely rare. In the chart below we share the seat difference between the two parties. “A 50/50 Senate coupled with only an 11-seat majority in the House, and it is safe to say we have about as close to a perfectly divided government as we’ve ever seen,” said Detrick.

&gt; # Rest of the World Catching Up

&gt; Over the past year, US equities—proxied by the S&amp;P 500 (SPY)—have consistently outperformed global equities more broadly. As shown below, over the past year the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has risen just over 16%. That compares to 11.26% for the rest of the world as proxied by the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex US ETF (VEU). Breaking that down a bit further by developed and emerging markets, US equities have outpaced both emerging and other developed markets. While emerging markets (SPEM) are right on the heels of the US with just under a 14.78% gain, developed markets (SPDW) have lagged with just a 10.56% gain. So far in 2021, though, the rest of the world has been outperforming the US. Whereas SPY has risen around 1% YTD, VEU is up almost 3 times that. Emerging markets in particular have shown the greatest degree of strength currently having risen 3.87%. Meanwhile, SPDW has gained less (2.7%), though, it is still outperforming the US.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-ETFs.png))**

&gt; In the charts below, we show the ratio of SPY to these other ETFs. A rising line would indicate that the US is outperforming these other measures of global equities while a downward trending line indicates underperformance of SPY. As shown, the longer-term trend has pretty consistently been US outperformance over the past decade but that has faltered at the tail end of 2020 and into 2021. In the case of emerging markets, the line has been on the decline throughout the second half of 2020 as the ratio has hit its lowest level in a year in the past week. The S&amp;P 500's underperformance relative to other developed markets (SPDW) has been more recent as that line peaked in early September but the trend remains the same over the past few months with SPY weaker than global equities more broadly. That is further exemplified by the recent downtrend of SPY versus the All World ex US ETF (VEU).

&gt; # Small Business Owners Didn't Like the Election Results

&gt; Today's release of the December Small Business Optimism Index from the NFIB saw a large drop as the index dropped from 101.4 to 95.9. After a sharp drop in the wake of the COVID outbreak, the index bounced back nicely but now looks like it's really rolling over.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/011221-NFIB-Small-Business-Chart.png))**

&gt; Not only was this month's headline index weak, but it caught economists completely off guard. While the index fell to 95.9, economists were expecting a drop to 100.2. That 4.3 spread between the actual and expected reading was the biggest miss relative to expectations in more than five years (July 2015) and was the third weakest reading relative to expectations since the December 2012 report.

&gt; Given the big drop in the headline index and the fact that it was so weak relative to expectations, should we be concerned about a double-dip? As an investor, we should always be worried about what could go wrong, but in the case of this report, you can probably wait for further confirmation from other data. The reason for the skepticism is that you could argue that politics plays a role in this report. To illustrate this, we would note that going back to 2010 (as far back as we have data) and right up through Election Day 2016, the NFIB only topped expectations 42% of the time. Following Trump's election in 2016, though, this index surged and has since topped expectations 63% of the time. Since Election Day 2020, though, the headline index has now missed expectations three times.

&gt; From a longer-term perspective, dating back to 1974, the average reading of the NFIB Small Business Index during Republican administrations has been 100.1 while the average level under Democratic Presidents has been 96.2. Now, that would make sense if the economy was also in a recession more often in those periods, but over that same span, even though the percentages are low for both political parties (&lt;20%), the economy has actually been in a recession a higher percentage of the time during Republican administrations than it has in Democratic administrations.

&gt; The lesson to take from all this is that even if it's often hard to separate when it comes to business or investing (or a lot of other aspects of our lives for that matter), it's usually best to leave politics outside.

personalfinance,Does it make sense to refinance motage mortgage?,"Just like the title says, I'm trying to figure out if refinancing makes sense for me. I'm currently 29yo and I bought a house back on December of 2017. My mortgage is just a little over 2k a month with insurance and escrow included. It's a multifamily home and I owe around 277k on it and my fixed rate is 3.875 for 30 years.

I'm wondering if it makes sense to refinance seeing how low interest rates are right now. I'd hate to miss out on the opportunity as long as it makes financial sense.

investing,"If: Interest rates increase, 10 year bond hits 1.5, etc., should we be worried?","Was watching some talking heads today in the news and the general message was: if bond yields get towards 1.5 or so, that will make bonds attractive enough to cause a pullback in stocks. Add to that some other things ""flashing yellow"" and stocks might suffer, etc etc.

Of course we hear this a lot, and in a sense yes, if there were other places to put money then some people might do that. 1.5 on a 10 year note does not seem that impressive however. Is this just nonsense? IMHO we should be more worried about civil unrest, late car/mortgage payments, and maxed credit cards.

personalfinance,"Fed Student Loans Changed, Don't Understand Why","I recently got a letter from my loan provider saying the repayment schedule of my loan has changed. Due what I'm assuming is either the interest rate change (going from 0 to what it was normal?) or a change to the repayment plan (I'm assuming this is an option cause I recently paid all the principal balance on one of my loans that had about $80 left on it).

When I look at the details of each of the loans I have and what changed, most of the monthly payment amounts have decreased (except one that increased a little), however they have two lines, one is the principal balance, and the other is the repayment amount. The repayment amount is higher than the principal amount and the installment schedule they show me is reflecting the total amount to the repayment amount, not the principal amount. It says the anticipated interest to be capitalized is not applicable, so I'm wondering why are they increasing my overall repayment by $1,200 across my loans, even though I've made every single payment on time, even through the pandemic when we weren't required to and paid extra on each bill as well. Another weird thing is on the installment schedule it's saying the due date starts 4/12/2021. 

Am I being silly is that just like... anticipated interest or something? Like, theoretically if interest rates never came up from zero for the rest of my loans, would I need to pay the total repayment amount, or would my last couple of payments be zero cause I paid off the principal balance? Is this just recalculating because they are anticipating interest rates to start back up in April? Hence the change in due date? 

I plan on calling Monday, I'm just trying to see what I'm getting myself into before then cause I don't want to worry about it all weekend. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Savings or student loans?,"Savings or pay student loans?

Here’s the breakdown, I have $92,000 in student loans. The interest rates are incredibly high (6-7.5%). I’ve taken advantage of the “no interest till” benefit that the government set forth and paid some off with my savings. 
I have about $42,000 combined in my various bank accounts. After I graduate in February 2021, I will have to start paying back these loans while paying NYC rent with only a per diem job (will find a second when I get my license to practice as an occupational therapist).

personalfinance,Interest Rates Change During Refinance Application Process -- question,"In early Nov. 2020, I learned I can have a reduced interest rate and get away from the FHA mortgage. I have been patiently waiting for them to process what should be a relatively easy refi-- they are my current mortgage holder, with a recent appraisal. My credit is excellent. The cost of the refi puts additional cash in my pocket in 18 months (after recouping closing costs).

Mortgage rates have steadily dropped since then. On January 4, I finally started to ask why this was taking so long and miracle of miracles, they finally approved the loan yesterday.

I think I should be able to get a lower interest rate. Is this lender required to reflect market at this time? If I leave for another lender, it means wading through another set of paperwork and perhaps paying for another appraisal, so I'm hesitant.

personalfinance,Question for Fidelity HSA holders: how clear are their statements?,"For anyone who has an HSA with Fidelity, is it clear on your statement when there are re-invested capital gains and/or dividends? 

I'm considering investing HSA money in a Fidelity HSA, and I live in California. This means I need to report taxable events within the HSA (capital gains and dividends) for state tax purposes. The double federal advantage means this is still a better deal than putting the money into a 401(k) (I think), but I'd like to get a sense for how complicated the process will be.

On a related note, does the CA tax situation mean that a Target Date Fund is *not* smart, since it will be periodically selling off the stock positions and converting to bonds?

I don't think I want to go with one of the tax free bond investments just for the convenience, since the returns will be lower. If convenience were most important I'd just treat it as a savings account and not invest at all.",finance

Of course the downside is my 30-year loan starts back over and there were around $5,000 in closing costs rolled back into the loan.

personalfinance,How to report part-year New York income with FreeTaxUSA,"In 2020 I moved from WI to NY. After the move I've retained my WI job remotely. I'm filing with FreeTaxUSA and I'm not quite sure how to fill everything out. On my W2 (Box 1) I have wages of 65,000. Then further down in Box 16 I have two lines, one for each state.

WI = 30,000

NY = 65,000

I know that this is how NY does things so the W2 is correct. So I filled in my W2 information exactly as it appears on the W2. Later I'm asked to put in the income I earned while I was a part-year resident of NY. So I look at my W2, subtract WI from Federal, and put in 35,000. However at the end of the process I'm getting the following warning saying that the discrepancy between reporting 65,000 and 30,000 is unexpected for my NY information and I should double check:

&gt; The amount of New York wages shown on your Form W-2(s) is $65,000, but you entered $35,000 of wages on your New York return. There are times that your part-year or nonresident wages will be different from what is shown on your Form W-2. For example, if your wages were from military service or you need to allocate wages on the **New York Wage Allocation** screen, your wages could be different. You can go back to the **New York Part-Year Resident Income** screen to change the amount you entered. If the amount is correct, click Continue.

Because of that I go to the **New York Wage Allocation** screen. This lets me enter my out of state income (30,000) and I do. When I get back to the **New York Part-Year Resident Income** page it looks the same and I report (35,000) as before. However when I get near the end again the warning from before is still there, and when I go back to the **New York Wage Allocation** screen none of the new data I entered is present. So it seems as though the data is not saving and may be messing up my returns. 

Does anyone have any experience with this and know what's going on/what I should do? Thanks

**EDIT**

I never did get an answer for this. I was able to submit my return, but FreeTaxUSA never did stop giving me a warning nor did it ever seem to save the **New York Wage Allocation** information. In any case when filling out the state tax returns I left my wage as only what was earned in NY (e.g. from the example above I input 35,000) and ignored the warning.",finance
personalfinance,"With rates so low, does it make sense to refinance then sell home within a year?","As the topic states, if one's interest rate was 4.75%, and was able to refinance to 2.75% with closing costs at $1000 and is on their 5th year of their 30 year mortgage with no increase to the original loan amount, is it worth it to refinance back to a 30 year to reduce the monthly payment just to sell the home 6 months later? A friend of mine was thinking of doing this and I usually tell them it's not wise to refinance unless your staying in the home for a couple of years to recoup closing costs, but apparently he is getting some lender credits that make it so his closing appears to be really cheap and thinks he will be able to reduce his mortgage such that he can save $600 each month so that would be money he could use for an extra downpayment each month he pays that smaller mortgage payment. 

Is this a good reason to refinance for this purpose? I have never recommended anyone to refinance in this case, but I wonder if this is an exception.",finance
stocks,My portfolio for the next 10 years,"Here’s my current breakdown after recent rebalancing. I used to be 40% in clean energy etfs at the March lows and just sold alot of them. Ive been trading in and out of ICLN, QCLN and PBW since 2009. This is the 3rd multiyear swing trade I’ve been involved with them resulting in 100% or more gains. Right now i think alt energy needs a 30% drop to shake out alot of new late money coming from hype posts on reddit and elsewhere. All of a sudden everyone knows they’re a great bet after 300% up but very few here were saying buy them in March and NOBODY on CNBC was saying buy them at any time between March and now. Only last month have i been hearing CNBC heads talking about them. Great timing!
I know everyone here loves shit like VT but i don’t waste my time(or my opportunities) with it as i do not trade China/HK, India or Russia stocks and don’t want to invest directly in their entire market aside from the stocks from China that are in some of my etfs below like for example NIO is in a few of my etfs

I trade around a core position in all of these as they outperform i move money to underperformers every few weeks or months.

21% - EWC and BBCA - Canada - Canada has a 1.5% annual population growth rate. That is 3x the US rate of 0.5%. Nobody on CNBC talks about Canada or Australia which is my next biggest holding. They will all be hyping them eventually when they look for growth and “suddenly” realize theres 2 continent sized countries with stable governments and educated people rich in natural resources and rich in natural beauty with a currently small population with massive growth potential. They also have excellent immigration systems of bringing in people based on merit, education and skills required.
Canada in particular is gaining new previously mostly frozen land as the world warms. Endless amounts of land for actual humans to live on and  land with nat resources.

17% - EWA - Australia - also a 1.5% population growth rate that is scheduled to continue at that pace for the next 10 years at least.

Only downside to my Canada and Australia etfs is they are 33% financials which i hate but i like the rest of the sector weights they have and that weighting can change if their industrials and  tech cos become bigger just like financials in the SP500 became a way smaller % weight since 2008. 

22% - Technology etfs listed in order from biggest position to smallest. I believe alot of money will come out of bloated big tech like Facebook and at the same time big tech will continue to buy small tech cos. Facebook bought 80 companies in the last few years. When boomer morons on CNBC are saying sell tech to buy banks i know i should buy more tech. With tech to me valuations are often meaningless. You are investing in groups of smart brains/thinktanks. You are actually betting on 1 or more of them inventing a time machine( or other huge advancements) one day and that stock and any etf holding it opening the next day up INFINITE %. What will the banks invent? A better way to extract money from all of us as they get free fake newly printed money from the Federal Reserve?

ethereum,When will 2.0 lower gas prices?,"I'm getting extremely frustrated.  There's all this cool defi stuff with awesome APRs but doing the necessary transfers, approving permissions, and creating the contracts costs a fortune.  It would take a massive investment about to justify the fees to create the savings contract making even these sorts of high interest rate returns.  This makes all this only feasible for the wealthy.  Defi is supposed to be about bring the same types of opportunities and returns to the average person that currently only the rich are afforded.  But the gas prices completely prevent that.  

I've spent a long time trying to find a single blog post, article, or reddit comment that answers this very simple question of when 2.0 (or whatever additional needed features) will lower gas prices, but I keep finding nothing.  If eth can't scale to serve defi then why aren't any of these platforms migrating to other smart contract blockchains that can?  The gas prices should be 10 to 100 times lower than they are now.  It's extremely annoying all this cool disruptive tech has been built but now its just sitting there useless for most people to use as their savings account instead of large centralized banks. 

Also, why are staking pools hardly a thing.  Why isn't everyone with eth able to easily stake through pools in the wallet apps like they can with other coins?

So right now, I have about $25-$30k in cash (about 3-4 months of living expenses, give or take) with no credit card debt.

I owe about $37k in student loans (currently deferred with no interest due to COVID) and $40k on a car loan @ 2.75% APR (car is worth roughly $55-60k, and I might sell it later this year depending on a number of factors.)

I have about $50k in my retirement account and am on track to contribute the maximum for the year.

If the student loans don’t get deferred through the rest of the year, I’m inclined to pay those off since the interest rates vary from like 3-9%, but I’ll still have a nice chunk left over to do something with and I should probably start saving to purchase a house within the next 5-10 years.

The market offerings for fixed interest on mortgages are 3,5 or 10 years. Nothing more. This is standard in the market and changing bank won't help. I actuaehave the best possible market offering for myself currently with 1.35 % variable interest, and I can change to 2.00% fixed interest for 10 years. My mortage is 280 000 (in equivalent USD) I and my wife are comfortable in paying it down. We have 20 years left on it. 

The main reason for locking in 10 year interest rates is because I expect that inflation and interest rates will increase faster than what the market expects. However I also see the fallacy in me trying to outsmart the interest market. 

How do you view fixed interest rates? What would you advice me to do?",finance

Is REIT a good investment?  Or should I just stick with other conventional stocks or ETFs?

stocks,The rotation portfolio,"We can all see that the market is a bit extended and frothy. The safest thing you can do during a downturn is shift into undervalued stocks (not necessarily traditional ""value stocks""). When everything is trading at an extreme premium, it's a good idea to move into stocks that are trading at a discount. I dont see most cruises/oil/airlines as value because there's a difference between plain cheap and undervalued. Undervalued stocks are good businesses whose price for whatever reason has not kept up with a companies outlook. Below are some of my personal favorites at the moment.

#Cyclical

MED- how can a company whose price has increased 626% in the last 5 years be undervalued? By being a top 5 fastest growing company (source: Forbes). Forward p/e and ev/EBITDA are both under 20 and peg is near 1. The profit margin and growth rate are mouth watering. With a market cap of just 2.4b they have miles and miles to run. They shouldn't be this cheap.

LKQ- A peg ratio of just 0.48 and managing to grow earnings in a pandemic earns them a spot on this list. The last 2 earnings have beat estimates by 231% and 41% respectively. They're expected to grow by 33.5% per annum the next 5 years, astounding considering their low multiplies. By every metric they're extremely underpriced and not for any negative reasons.

Honorable mention: LGIH

#Defensive

ACI- They're growing faster than Kroger and trading at lower multiples. Peg ratio of 0.3 is almost unheard of. Their debt remains fairly high from the Safeway purchase several years ago but it's really paid off in growth. As they continue knocking down long term liabilities we'll see them climb closer to $30.

Honorable mention: DG

#Industrial

BLD- One of the 16 companies that come up when screening a strict combination of growth and value measurements. Home improvement will continue to be popular as people move out of cities and work from home remains part of the modern work life. Excellent margins and expected EPS growth.

Honorable mentions: CSL

#Tech

CACI- This more mature version of PLTR has a great price/free cash flow ratio, low forward p/e and ev/EBITDA, good profit margins, and substantial growth. They've taken a loss of 8% over the last year in share price while nearly maintaining their growth rate through the pandemic. Solid margin of safety here and possiblity for a huge jump in price at some point.

SNX- They recently spun off their sibling company CNXC and it was expected that SNX would see slowed growth while CNXC grew rapidly. The first earnings report since the split showed the exact opposite to be the case. A bit weird seeing a tech company trade at an 8 pe, especially considering how business has picked up recently. A steady performer that won't fall far in a crash.

SSNC- earnings in 2018? 103m. Earnings in 2019? 438m. Earnings in 2020 through 3 quarters? 430m. They continue to grow earnings yet the share price has risen a meager 6% the last year. Peg ratio under 1, profit margin at 12%, and an excellent price/free cash flow make this a great discounted buy.

Honorable mention: JBL

#Communication

FB- The 1st really big name on the list. Nothing seems to stand in the way of their growth but we've only seen modest returns for it. Theres always the risk of them being forced to break up but the sum of the parts are worth more than the whole in this case. With the overall market froth you'd expect these guys to be at $300 by now.

#Healthcare

HZNP- They blasted off into profitability last year and havent looked back. Their multiples are much too low for a company experiencing this much success. Hedge fund interest plotted on a chart over the last year is is a vertical line straight up. Intrinsic value from dcf puts this at just over $100 while it trades at $78. One of the most undervalued stocks imo.

HUM- Theres no reason this should be below $450 but here we are. Their return in capital is at 24% where the industry average is 10%. An encouraging sign for future growth. The multiples look great as well.

Honorable mention: ELMD

#Financial

PJT- While looking at their share price gain and p/e compared to the rest of the financial sector you'd think I was crazy for calling this stock undervalued. A deeper look will point out just how undervalued they are. Through 3 quarters they've already beat 2018 and 2019's earnings combined. That puts their peg ratio at 0.7. Much too low. Charting their revenue and earnings out over the last few years paints an impressive picture of sustainable growth. 

PFSI- The number one most underpriced stock in the entire market. Period. 3.3 p/e and 0.1 peg ratio. All while exhibiting unbelievable growth and margins. Hedge funds are stuffing into this stock like a clown car, the number of funds investing in them has doubled in just one year. I believe the market has priced in a ""top"" of the housing market. By the time it actually starts to decline we'll see interest rates rise which should only help PFSI.

Honorable mention: OMF

#Real Estate

CBRE- Like OMF this stock got hurt by the pandemic but should be back on track this year. They have an impressive 30.5% margin of safety. The robust balance sheet supports the acquisition moves aimed at expanding their geographical reach.

#Basic Materials

GOLD- Warren Buffet was on the right track buying Barrick last year and the reasoning hasn't really changed. Massive stimulus building supports the gold bull case long term. 

Honorable mention: FMC

#Utilities

DTE- Only one utility company is expected to see EPS growth while having a forward p/e under 30, a peg ratio under 3, and decent price/cash flow. I dont have them being notably under intrinsic value but if you're going to own a utility that isnt renewable this is the one.",finance

personalfinance,I applied to school out of desperation/necessity and am now doubting it was a smart move.,"Sorry this is long, please bear with me. Any insight/advice welcome. 

I’ve reached a breaking point in my life where I was literally going in circles. Just completely horizontal. Sometimes down, sometimes very down, but never up or out. I’m almost 30 and I feel completely frozen in time, somewhere between treading water and floating through space. 

I was lucky enough to find employment during the pandemic. I was self employed for a while but my entire schedule bottomed out due to the pandemic so I had to bite the bullet and find some hourly whatever, despite the fact that I really didn’t want to. My hours were cut to shit and I was making minimum wage and it just wasn’t working so I began looking for a second job. I started job two while I was still at job one and put in my two week. 

Job two was absolute hell. It paid well but was one of the most toxic working situations I’d been in. 4 people quit during my first month. Abusive bully of a boss who constantly set me up for failure, contradicted himself, had impossibly unrealistic standards, and criticized and berated constantly. HORRIBLE hours. I was completely exhausted all of the time and working 6 days a week. I was then fired which had never happened to me before ever. The reasons were a series of bullshit, which everyone I worked with agreed on (they were all on the verge of throwing in the towel too and two more quit short after I was gone).

I hadn’t received any unemployment during a few weeks in there where I would have qualified, having spoken to someone in the office, but they screwed up something and I was denied, specifically for dates I wasn’t even including in my claim because I knew I didn’t qualify. The second time around I screwed something else up. It’s been about 8 months and I haven’t gotten anywhere yet. I also have not received my 2019 federal tax, nor the second stimulus.

I applied for a few jobs but the job market is a nightmare right now. Lots of things I’m not qualified to do etc etc. I applied for some certifications to help open the windows and I’m currently waiting to hear back from a part time job that will probably suck but pays decently. It’ll be totally acceptable while I’m in school.

Due to a series of unfortunate events, some completely outside my control, others totally my fault, my savings is gone and my finances are trash. My credit score is pretty good. I’ve been chipping away at my student loans in small and smaller chunks and for a while was barely keeping up with interest. This is part of the reason I had to get out of minimum wage, low paying garbage. 

I applied to school to round off a Post Bacc and go right into my Masters (counseling/clinical social work. Something tells me the market for that will be decent once I finish). I applied for federal financial aid, I’m not a dependent and I didn’t make much so I’m anticipating qualifying for something, hopefully that may include work study which would be helpful. I just did not seeing running in place at a minimum wage job forever an option. This is something I should have done years ago but that’s neither here nor there. 

I don’t anticipate rolling right into a high paying job but my plan is to do my best and do some networking and try to tack on some additional experience (I have experience with volunteering, crisis lines, etc already). 

Other than considering loan consolidation, student loan forgiveness via my prospective field and attempting to squirrel away anything I can with work, I’m starting to worry.  I feel like I jumped in really unprepared hoping for the best with kind of an overwhelming sense of dread and a little bit of existential crisis as fuel, but it’s starting to sink in. 

According to the above information, was this as terrible an idea as I feels, what can I do to make this a less-bad idea, what do those of you with a much better handle of their finances suggest?

investing,(Opinion) Lower interest rates won't justify excessive valuations forever.,"I'm biased towards the we're overvalued side of things. 

It seems like lately the *only* reasoning many give for the current market prices are the low interest rates. This idea to me does not flow with the idea that most investors demand at least some type of safety or risk aversion with their investment choices. 

Lower interest rates, easy money, and simply no where else to put that money to gain a return, won't last forever. Sure, up until some given point (and that is the key) investors will flock to the only option available for returns. However, in my opinion, that level will slowly wane as the market rises along with the risk associated with it at these price levels. I don't believe investors will continue to put their money to work in a market that (at these price levels) only brings a higher level of risk with it. At some point money will stay on the sidelines. 

Low interest rates just might cut it as a qualifying reasoning for the current valuations, but they won't be the reasoning for a correction/recession if it occurs and stays. 

Low interest rates that fueled this IMO excessive market rally will eventually be named the cause of the eventual correction. At that point whether money on the sidelines flows in will be dependent upon the economic/stimulus conditions at the time.",finance

personalfinance,Buying a condo in a HCOL area today vs rent and then buy a house in 5 years?,"REPOST DUE TO R6 rule. Has now been edited. 

Me and my husband are in our mid to late-twenties (25F, 28M). 

Finances:
Liquid assets: 95k  
Debts: 134k (federal student loans, one car note that's has about 12.6k left on it)  
Monthly take home pay: $15,100  
Monthly cash outflow: $9800 (not including loans, since they are on hold now in the USA). If you ask why they are so high, I should mention my husband visits his kids from a previous marriage from out of state (long distance parent) about every 2-3 months out of the year. We don’t see this expense going away as long as we decide to stay here and we do not plan on moving to where his kids live. This is a given. 

We live in Austin, TX. We've been renting for a year, and our lease is about to run up. We have the option to renew the lease, but I personally feel we are overpaying/rent is too high.

I would like our next place that we live to be the home that we live in for the next 5 years, at least. Our jobs are fairly stable. I don't really want to rent, but I also don't really want to shell out a bunch of cash and become proper homeowners, even though the rates are low now and housing prices are going up. I also understand that we have student loan debt, but I am not convinced that paying up our student loans first would make a ton of sense, especially since there is no interest accruing on them now and there are talks about student loans being forgiven.

I would like to live below our means and I can't really fathom purchasing a SFH right now for $400-500k because our monthly living expenses will go up about $1200-1600. We currently rent 1 br for $1300. 

If we were to purchase an apartment-style condo around 230-250k, our monthly living expenses would only go up about $400 for 2 br condo. I have considered HOAs and the lack of control, but honestly it doesn't really bother me. 

I definitely don't think we could comfortably purchase a $400-500k home today. In a year, we could have $155600 saved up, but what would we do with that money? Houses in the area that would be considered our ""forever"" home are valued at 500-600k. Even if in a year, we could afford a 15%-20% down payment in this bracket, I worry that even then, owning a house will just be MORE expensive. I'm quite intimidated about it. I'm not much of a handyman and neither is my husband. We would like something low maintenance, for sure.

I don't see us really needing the space for a family until 5 years from now. I'm okay with living in a smaller space. I don't have any urges to have a garden, and it just kinda seems like owning a proper single family house would be stressful/excessive at this point in our lives. The only reason I'm even considering buying a home is because Austin is a hot market and prices are only going up.

Any advice would be great. What would be the most sensible  thing to do?",finance
personalfinance,Is it the right time to buy a house?,"My fiancé and I live in a high COL area and rent a one bedroom apartment, which is honestly a pretty great deal for the area at $1700/month including all utilities (even cable/internet). We have been able to save a fair amount while living here. Our lease is up at the end of June. We have been discussing buying a place rather than renewing our lease. The reasons for this are personal (wanting our own outdoor space, a garden, pets) and financial (wanting to build equity). We are also aware that interest rates are historically low and feel this presents an additional incentive to buy.

We have done some informal searches and most of the places that meet our needs are in the $350-450k range, which feels like a lot. Most home prices in the area we currently live are over $600k, so we're already looking at moving further away and increasing our commute time, which we are ok with within reason (my job provides some transportation benefits that could offset some of this burden depending on where we end up).

More specifics for our situation:

* Our combined annual gross income is $125k
* We currently have \~$75k in savings and plan to continue adding to that before June
* I have additional funds in IRAs that I understand I can pull $10k from for a first time home purchase without penalty (not sure if this is a good idea or not...doesn't seem like it)
* My fiancé has about $11k in student loan debt that he is working on paying off
* Because of the loan history, my fiancé's credit score is fair (\~650), and mine is good (&gt;750)
* We own our cars outright, but they are older models and may need to be replaced in the next 5 years or so
* I plan to max out my IRA contributions for 2020 and will be eligible for an employer 403b plan beginning later this year
* My fiancé is contributing to an employer 401k with maximum employer match

So I guess our question is: is buying this spring the right move? We are nervous about it because we have been in a good place financially for the past couple years and don't want to end up ""house poor."" But at the same time, I don't feel like our savings are doing anything for us by just sitting in the bank. The alternative would be to stick it out in the apartment, keep saving, and revisit this in a year. But, real estate prices will likely continue to increase and interest rates could as well. Both decisions feel like a gamble in some way. Does anyone have suggestions on what steps we should take? I would greatly appreciate any and all advice.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

Long-term interest rates refer to government bonds maturing in ten years. Rates are mainly determined by the price charged by the lender, the risk from the borrower and the fall in the capital value. Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.

personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer: Buy or Rent?,"Hello!


So, as the title says, my wife and I are considering buying home in the Denver area. We currently live out of state, and will be moving in the next 6 months. Houses seem to be flying off the market very quick. We are wanting a house, but also understand that renting as we go into a new area may be  best to get a feel for the area and which neighborhoods we might like to settle down in. We do plan on staying in the Denver area 5+ years.


Two reasons we are considering buying a home is: 1. Low interest rates and 2. It seems the Denver houses continue to rise in value sharply year to year. We would like to eventually start a family in a house if we were to buy in the near future.


Our financial info below:

• Annual Household Income - $110k (both with secure jobs)

• Debt - $0 (both have about 6 year old cars with less than 100k miles)

• Down payment - ~$30k

• Potential mortgage - ~$350k-400k -- We are looking at homes around the $400k-$450k range. Is that too high with our current stats for a 30-year mortgage? I know a general rule of thumb is 3x-4x your annual income, so $450k is definitely on the upper end of that.

• Credit Scores - &gt;760


If we were to rent, we would consider getting a 2bd + 2ba, which will run us around $1,600-$1,800/month in the areas I have checked. In checking some online mortgage calculators, it seems our monthly payment would be around $2,500 if we went the mortgage route. My thinking is, if we are spending $1,800 on rent when we could spend $700/month more and build equity, that would be the route to go. Renting would not allow us to save as much each month to boost our down payment quickly.


It is quite overwhelming looking at all the numbers, so I apologize if the information is jumbled. I have a naturally frugal mindset, so it is difficult for my brain to wrap my head around spending so much money in general, but I know it could be financially smart to buy a home instead of rent.

stocks,Biden proposal calls investments in federal IT ‘an urgent national security issue’,"As part of his COVID relief proposal to Congress, Biden called the need to upgrade the federal IT infrastructure an urgent national security issue. To that end, the proposal requests $9 billion for the Technology Modernization Fund—a **3,600% increase over the $25 million it received in fiscal 2020.**

//

“By asking for $9 billion in TMF funding, the Biden team clearly understands its unique value proposition and ability to drive critical IT modernization efforts that can support agency efforts to respond to COVID-19 and accelerate the delivery of enhanced digital services that citizens are demanding,” said Matt Cornelius, the executive director of the Alliance for Digital Innovation, an industry association, and a former senior technology and cybersecurity advisor at the Office of Management and Budget. “OMB and GSA could use this infusion of capital to ‘flip the model’ of the TMF and use it to fund large-scale, enterprisewide IT modernization efforts across some or all federal agencies, while still making targeted investments in individual agency programs that could benefit from the TMF Board’s oversight and the flexibility of funding that TMF provides.”

I was wondering if anybody has any recent experience with investing on the Istanbul stock exchange or can provide any other insight in how safe this is? My main concern is they identify me as a foreign investor and somehow prevent me from selling.

My reasoning behind this idea: I think Turkish banks are well positioned to benefit from internal economic troubles. I wouldn't dare investing in a local company because I don't trust their government at all but I don't think they are willing to risk potential diplomatic problems when they interfere at this Bahraini owned bank.

Lira exchange rates have stabilized and interest rates are at an astonishing 17%. Erdogan is barking at interest rates and banks again, public deficit is on the rise and inflation probably sits somewhere around 15% but I don't expect extreme events because they can't risk further economic problems (as reflected by the fact interest rates where raised recently).

Any input on risks I've missed is much appriciated, as are opertunities to take advantage of the ridiculously high interest rate.

Bitcoin,Collateral Loans on Bitcoin,"I've noticed a lot of talk about financing using Bitcoin as collateral and using that to live off Bitcoin. I just want to share my thoughts and findings, both to solidify what is in my head, but also in the hopes that it helps anyone trying to understand it as well.

I've looked around, focusing on collateral loans, and there are a few financial products. Living in the UK, my options are limited. Some lenders allow borrowing for up to 3 years, whereas some only allow borrowing for a few months. There was Nexo which has an interest only plan with no time limit for paying off the capital. This is interesting, but one thing to note, they have an interest rate of 11.9% whereas others have around 8%. So that's around 4% for the convenience. Nexo can also increase your loan value instead of taking interest payments allowing you to survive the loan without any income until your collateral doesn't cover the loan anymore and you lose your collateral.

Borrowing for a few months is not really suitable for much because if you can earn the money you need in a few months, you probably don't need that loan. So it's kind of like payday loan and it is designed to get you by rather than to help you grow your wealth. It can also be useful for short term speculation based trading. It gives you money to play with and if you're lucky, you made a bit of money, but for me personally, the risk is too high to justify.

Borrowing for 3 years might lead you into the next bear market, so you may need to add to the collateral before you get to the end of the loan. You will be paying off the loan over time, so there's also a reasonable chance that you may never need to add more collateral. So what can you get for your collateral? You can get up to 80% of your Bitcoin's worth in Fiat, but most lenders offer up to 50% which is sensible. The more you borrow, the higher the chance of being asked for more collateral or having your loan immediately payable.

What do you do with that money? You can't live off of it, because then you'd have no money to pay back the loan. If you pay off the loan with the Bitcoin, that is a taxable event and you will need to pay taxes on that. Consider also, that if you are trying to reduce your tax bill, giving $2,000 after investing $1,000 and seeing it rise to $4,000 today, will leave you paying tax on 75% of your $2,000 payment, but  in a few years, lets say your Bitcoin investment rose to $8,000, you would now be paying tax on 87.5% of your $2,000 and this is after paying loan interest. So you're not saving on taxes, but you are ""keeping"" your Bitcoin as Bitcoin which is good. You have to project your expectations, compare the profits and losses and decide if the benefit is worth the risk. Part of that is knowing if the risk is something that could break you financially. If it is, don't go any further, it isn't worth any potential reward. A lot of people cite these loans as a way to avoid paying taxes, so I will assume they are not talking about this strategy.

Ok, so what do you do with the money? You re-invest it. I don't think investing into Bitcoin is great when trying to avoid taxes, because again, in order to pay the loan, you need to sell some of the Bitcoin and we're back to the previous scenario. So instead, maybe you can invest in property. You now have 2 loans, but you also have a source of income in the best case scenario. Buying a property for renting has its own risks to consider, but you can make some income if you do it responsibly. The key here is earning rent money. If you aren't doing that, you can't pay your loans. This is income and you will be taxed on that. You also might only get enough rent to cover the mortgage, if you're smart, you have excess to cover interest on your first loan and maybe even some collateral to protect against bear markets requiring you to add more Bitcoin to your collateral.

Let's talk about taxes on that rent. You earn $900, and you pay $500 on the mortgage, $100 of which is interest. So you get $400 to spend a month (although some of it should go towards your loan) but you pay tax on $800 of profit because they only allow you to offset the interest part of your mortgage. You also need to save a lot of that money for expenses like fixing the boiler and that means you still haven't got enough to live. You get multiple properties, but that's not living off Bitcoin as much as living off a real estate.

Can you re-invest the money into Bitcoin and earn income from that instead? Well yes, but when you cash out, you have to declare it for gains (unless you cash out immediately, some companies might help by paying your interest in fiat) and you'd pay income tax with no relief for the loan interest. Turns out the real estate guys figured out how to be special and get relief for their loans. Right off the bat, your interest will be lower than the interest on the loan. You usually can get about 6% but pay interest on the loan around 8% - 12%. Eventually, if Bitcoin becomes super valuable, your interest can overtake the loan interest because 6% of your Bitcoin is more than 12% of your original loan in fiat. That's a long term hope based on speculation, that's a high risk and you're making losses in the short term.

On top of all of that, you could have instead put the Bitcoin into an interest account instead of even doing anything with the loan and you'd get twice the interest since you put in twice the amount of Bitcoin, and no debts to pay.

If your Bitcoin was worth millions, you could put your coins into something like Nexo and take small loans over time to spend on living. This should give you plenty of space for adding more collateral on margin calls during bear markets, and you can even have the interest pile up on the collateral. This might last for a while and you can live the life, but eventually, you will owe a large amount to Nexo and they may have a limit to how much you can borrow with this strategy (it would seem dumb not to) so you will then have a bill to pay. If Bitcoin is constantly rising, then you could have lived the life for a while and even borrowed millions when you started with just a million dollars of Bitcoin and when you go to pay it all off, you might still only give up a fraction of your Bitcoin. In this case, you did well, but for the sake of taxes, you still have to pay taxes on the amount you pay back (which is the amount you borrowed\* plus interest) but by then, you've already let that money work for you. You have deferred the taxes enough that pretty much used inflation to your advantage, but you didn't completely avoid taxes. There's some maths to do to see how much that benefit is because the difference may influence your decision.

\*The amount you borrowed minus the price you purchased that much Bitcoin for, but by then it's probably so small its negligible.

The last option is probably the best option, but you have to start with a substantial amount of Bitcoin and then you might want to diversify your assets in case Bitcoin crashes enough to put you in trouble, then your other asset might prevent you from bankruptcy. You also have more risk than just the price of Bitcoin; you have your Bitcoin in someone else's custody and that is also a pretty big risk. There's also still a lot of controversy around Bitcoin and governments are still allowed to govern the companies that you service with.

Ultimately, maybe if I get millions in Bitcoin, I might look into the risks again to see if they are reduced by then and possibly look into this then. But for now, it seems like the risk reward ratio for these loans are just not sensible.

I also think that even if I did take this strategy, I would want to use half of the money I borrow to invest in another asset so the risk is diversified. That asset will give me time to sort everything out if it all goes south and I need to get a job after all.

Oh, and then there's inheritance tax. Guess they get the last laugh!

I'll end with a question: What are people's thoughts? Did I get something wrong? Has it helped you? Do you have a different strategy in mind?",cryptocurrency
investing,Series EE Bonds - Sell?,"Hi all - First, I want to caveat that my knowledge of investing is somewhat moderate to minimum. So I apologize in advance if this is a dumb question or if my vernacular is off.

Context: My Grandfather (God rest his soul) invested $100 into a Series EE bond every year until I was 18. (1992-2010). They have a 30 year maturity rate. From what I understand, they at least double in value after 20 years and the other 10 varies by interest rates.

To me, that sounds like a pretty sad rate even if it's just $100. My question is, wouldn't I be better off by selling some of these (maybe the 10 most matured) if not all of them and transfer that money into my TDF which would garner higher returns? Let me know if more information is needed here to be able to justify this.

Additionally, let's say it is wise to sell these bonds... from my limited research online, cashing these bonds in doesn't seem like a dubious process. However, does anyone have any advice here or a simpler of going about it?

Thank you in advance to all answers!

personalfinance,Simple questions about taxes,"Hey everyone, I’m still relatively new to filing taxes. Last year I only had to file a simple federal. In 2020 I purchased a house, put money into a Fidelity brokerage account, invested in a back door Roth IRA. Now I have a few questions on how the taxes will work with all that, and if a tax software will hold my hand through it. 

1). Are there deductions for the mortgage?

2). Are taxes paid on the growth of the Fidelity account? Note, I haven’t withdrawn any earnings.

3). What forms are needed to show that I contributed to a back door Roth, and not a normal Roth/traditional?

personalfinance,Does the current 0% interest on federal student loans change the Prime Directive in any way?,"This question is about how to prioritize paying off debt vs saving for retirement, considering the current circumstances around federal student loans.

My spouse and I (28 and 29) are on track to finish paying off my graduate school debt (~$100k, all federal, 6.0-7.8%) in September. The interest-free forbearance has helped immensely. 

We have an emergency fund of 6+ months' expenses, and have been stashing all of our would-be student loan payments in a HYSA. We are preparing to make a large lump-sum payment at the end of the forbearance. 

Following the prime directive flowchart, all we are doing for retirement at this point is getting the full employer match. We currently have very little saved for retirement. We had planned to start maxing out IRAs after the student debt paid is off. 

However, considering that the loans are at 0% right now, should we:

- max out our 2020 IRAs before April, thereby delaying loan payoff ~3 months?

- stay the course, payoff loans in Sept and then max 2021 IRAs (missing out on 2020 contributions)?

- decide based on how much longer (if at all) the 0% interest period is extended? 

Another factor to consider is that we anticipate hitting the Roth income limit within the next 5-8 years, so we feel some pressure to take advantage of Roth IRAs during the limited time that we will be able to do so.

personalfinance,How to Best Apply Graduation Gift?,"Hi there!

I recently graduated college in December with $84,000 in student debt. Here is the breakdown:

* $20,000 Federal (4 Loans, average interest 4.75%
* $40,000 Wells Fargo (4 Loans, average interest 6%)
* $24,000 Discover (2 Loans, 10.740% interest rate)

As these loans have been in deferment, and now grace period, I have managed to pay down all the interest on the loans so nothing will be accrued and applied when my grace period ends in June.

Additionally, due to the high interest rate of my Discover loans, I've taken advantage of the ""Avalanche"" method and have been able to pay the total down to $19,000 since graduating.

I have two questions...

1. Does paying down the principle of a loan before it enters repayment mean I will have a lower minimum payment when the loan does go into repayment?
2. If I am receiving a lump sum gift of $5,000 should I apply it to the Discover loans due to the high interest, or pay it towards one of my Wells Fargo loans and wipe it out, thus lowering my minimum payments each month?

My current situation is working as a Certified Flight Instructor. I make $19/hr, with a raise in the near future of $21/hr. Hours are inconsistent and the job is entirely weather dependent obviously so making a consistent paycheck each month is unrealistic. Example: Paycheck last month was $1226 after taxes, this month, $450. This is where my concern over minimum payments comes into play. My mom is assisting me by providing $200-$500 each month to help pay down my loans currently and will continue to do so.

CryptoCurrency,USGovt Declares all Privacy Coins Legal for Banking Purposes,"https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf

TLDR:

&gt; National banks and Federal savings associations (collectively referred to as ""banks"") may use new technologies, including INVNs and related stablecoins, to perform bank-permissible functions

&gt; ... cryptocurrencies can present risks under AML and countering the financing of terrorism ... because cryptocurrencies may be used by bad actors for the purposes of avoiding the financial system or engaging in other illicit activities.  **However, banks have significant experience with developing BSA/AML compliance programs to assure compliance** 


*An INVN is an ""Independent Node Verification Network."" In other words, all blockchains, among other distributed, node structured databases.*

In other words, the lead regulatory office for all United States banks just declared that even though some cryptocurrencies present additional risks, they are nonetheless permissible, and they expect that banks are experienced enough to implement proper compliance programs. Much like they do with cash. 

This is huge. Many large corporations and even banks have significant need of privacy, to protect trade secrets, business partnerships, and prevent telegraphing of their movements to competitors.

personalfinance,I'm close but maybe not there yet to dropping my PMI. Does a refinance make sense if I'm not sure I'm there yet?,"I started the refi process too late and now rates have gone up from 2.75 (no point buydown) to 3.25 (no point buydown). So I'm trying to determine if it's worth it. 

My current interest rate is 3.375, so paying closing fees to get to 3.25 doesn't make sense, correct? So only a point buy down would make sense for me?

My main goal in all this was to try and drop off my PMI. The value of my condo has gone up quite a bit. However, I'm being told it's borderline, and that if I roll any fees into the cost of the loan, it will most likely raise me back up over the 80% threshold. 

Right now, the only way to get the PMI off is to get an refinance and have the appraisal come in at the higher end of what I'm hoping it's worth.  Otherwise, to get my PMI off due to increased value, I will have to wait until it's at 75% before my lender will even start to consider it. That's another 13k it would need to go up.  

A few months ago I asked a realtor to see what I could possibly sell my place for, and she said gave me an estimate with 3k between the lower price and the highest price. 

Again for a refinance to knock off my PMI, I would need to come in at the highest point. 

On top of the removal of the PMI ($52/month) depending on how many points I would buy down, I could possibly save another $60 to $97 a month. (I know I need to figure out the break even point with the fees and figure if I'm going to stay this long.) 

Should I risk doing all this and not having my place appraise at the higher end? 

The other thought I had was, if it doesn't come in at the highest price I need, would I be able to pay the refinance company extra in order to get to that spot? Kind of like a 'down payment'? Is that even a thing with refinances?

EDIT: Also, anyone know if having pets lowers the worth of a place? I have a cat I got a few months ago and I know some people hate pets in their living space, is that something I need to consider in the appraisal/resell value?",finance
personalfinance,Can I afford this mortgage,"Hey All

Have been exploring getting a condo for a while and with interest rates so low, wanted to explore whether it's a good idea. I know rent isn't throwing money away, but wanted to look at the financial feasibility of taking out a mortgage.

Been living in Manhattan for 3 years now and don't see that changing any time soon. Manhattan carry costs seem prohibitively expensive so have been looking into Brooklyn (Williamsburg).

Some stats for me

 * Salary: 180k cash + ~30-50k in stock options
 * Next 3 years will have ~200k/year in stock options vesting
 * Max 401k
 * Take home ~8-9k/month
 * ~150k cash + 300k liquid investments
 * No debt, no car

Been looking at 1-2b condos between 1-1.2m. Back of the envelope calculations show maximum monthly payments for mortgage + taxes + hoa fees to be ~5k. With mortgage interest deduction + property tax discount from primary residence (~15%) I expect it to be under 5k. Even assuming upper bound of 5k, I could manage, just wouldn't be saving much outside of vesting equity.

Playing with the NYT rent vs buy recommends I buy unless I find rent for &lt;2600 with a 5y time frame so it seems pretty bias towards buying.
A lot of advice on this sub recommend 3x mortgage and 38% of gross income DTI but in NY/Brooklyn it's just not realistic.

This year, we both moved to the same house in a third state, but at different times, so that adds even more complication. We could really use someone to help us navigate this the best way possible.

Is there any advice on what I should be looking for?

Is that just because small businesses hire more CPAs than individuals\*, or should that be a sign that they aren't a good fit for individual taxes?

investing,Arguments for and against Gold in your Asset Allocation.,"I know everybody is talking about the next Tech Stock with crazy returns which is perfectly fine but a balanced asset allocation can contain more than just stocks. Investors add Bonds, Real Estate, Precious Metals, Krypto or other assets to diversify. Of course stocks historically had the best returns, but do you really want to see your entire net worth drop by more than 50% for a few years?

Here are some arguments for and against Gold in your asset allocation and how it could perform in the next decade.

Arguments for Gold:

- Negativ real interest rates.
Gold is (Edit: sometimes) negatively correlated with real interest rates. Longterm negativ real interest rates would make gold more attractive as an investment and I don‘t think central banks will be able to significantly raise interest rates. This makes gold attractive over bonds to preserve real value.
- Exponential Money Supply.
Most economic crisis are deflationary since consumers and businesses increase savings rate. The increase in money supply could lead to higher inflation when spending and velocity of money increases as the economy recovers. Overall money could become less attractive as supply increases while the supply of gold doesn’t. This leads to my next point.
- Dept Cycles.
We seem to enter the later stage of a debt cycle. Interest rates have constantly decreased over the past 30 years while the debt of governments hast increased. This is not a problem as long as negativ cashflows of payed interest stay roughly the same. So higher government debt is no problem as long as interest rates decrease. The issue is, that this cycle is difficult to break and it doesn’t matter when the next crisis happens but when it does we will have to print even more money than now, decrease interest rates further below zero and hand out more helicopter money, fully embracing MMT. No currency survives forever and the dollar collapsing is possible in our lifetime.
- Central Banks hold massive gold reserves.
Gold is still backing our currencies to some degree as central banks hold gold. If a countries currency faces hyperinflation, gold will be the only thing retaining it’s value. Lots of commodity dependent countries like Russia started to expand gold reserves and China is likely to have way more gold reserves than official as they produce more than they sell.
- No taxes on gold gains.
In some countries there is no tax on gold gains which is often not accounted for when comparing gold performance with other asset classes.


Arguments against gold:

- Economic recovery.
Gold Is generally seen as a save haven and increases in value during recessions. Long bullmarkets make gold less attractive as an investment and it dropped 40% between 2011 and 2015 which was a great time to be in stocks or real estate. Overall gold is way more volatile than people think.
- Increase in bond yields.
Over the past weeks bond yields have increased as expected inflation increased which put pressure on the gold price. Higher bond yields could lead to further drops in the price of gold.
- Gold is a non-productive asset.
Often brought up by Warren Buffet, gold doesn’t do anything for economic output as it just sits around in a safe while companies create value and land can be harvested or built on. 10% of Gold produced has an industrial use but that alone wouldn’t justify the price.
- Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is gaining more and more acceptance as an asset and institutional money is flowing in. Many see bitcoin as an alternative to gold and a preserver of value with better liquidity and higher upside than gold. The market cap of bitcoin is already 1/13 of Gold which is crazy if you compare the short timeframe crypto has existed compared to gold. Capital flows that would otherwise go into Gold get sucked up by bitcoin.

Overall I think there is a strong case to be made for the role of gold in a balanced portfolio. In my opinion at least 10% gold is very reasonable but I can see how some of this could also be allocated to silver or crypto.

Personally I do have a significant amount of gold in my portfolio and it has performed similar to stocks over this particular timeframe (mostly bought in 2016). If you bought gold in 2011 you were less lucky but the same argument could be made for stocks between 2000 and 2010 with zero gains. 

Do you think gold is still relevant as an asset class?

personalfinance,Home-buying decision help needed,"I didn't come from a home-owning family, all growing up, my parents were renters, so I really appreciate any guidance you can give me.

We currently own a tiny condo and I am contemplating selling and buying a bigger house.

After 10 months of being sheltered-in-place, I am really going crazy with my family of 3, in a sub-1000 sq foot home (live in HCOL area)

**The details:**

After paying off the mortgage and commissions/fees, we could maybe net $50K and kick in another $20K cash, for a downpayment of $70K.

We have 800+ FICO scores and no debt other than a $7K student loan that's on COVID deference. (normal payment is $100 per month).

We make $11.5K gross monthly. We have other income as well, but I feel the mortgage company would only count the above income and I don't want to be locked into receiving child support and freelancing just to afford this house anyway.

The house I want is $699K and the total payment related to the house would be $3300 a month (assuming a mortgage interest rate of 2.875%, 30 year fixed, including PMI and property taxes and insurance).

I feel that it's the tippy top of what we can really afford (if even that) and I'm *very* nervous. I believe we could qualify but I'm more concerned with whether it's a smart *idea*.

Complicating matters further, I am not sure that if we purchased this house, we could contribute as much as we currently do towards retirement, and our retirement is sorely underfunded (I am 41 and spouse is 49. Neither of us will see any inheritance, we need to be saving $25K a year to retirement, which we currently do). I am not sure that it makes sense to increase our housing expense by 73%. I do not want to do anything stupid, and I feel like I need to prioritize retirement investments, and just deal with a little bit of cramped living and misery in the house.

Should I try to grin and bear it, and sock away some more money? I'm worried that if I go that route, housing will appreciate further than my savings can possibly catch up, which is the trap I fell into for my first home purchase. And while I realize home price appreciation helps me command more for my condo, it's likely a Single Family Home will always appreciate faster than our condo does, so I'm not sure if I end up on the winning side of that dynamic.

I also don't want to assume I can go make more money, just because... I don't have an income history that makes that a safe assumption. I am probably a bit underpaid right now, but it's a stable job where I'm valued... I don't know if that would be true at another company I try out. Spouse will not leave his job or try to make more money either.",finance
personalfinance,(US) What's your cut-off cost difference for purchasing Used vs New? Specifically looking at Mazda/Toyota,"Conventional financial advice seems to be trying to purchase a car that's used as opposed to new. I can understand that.

My current 15 y/o car has left me stranded too many times and has proven to be pretty expensive to maintain. So, I'm currently shopping for a car that would last a while (7+ years) and be reasonably reliable. Ideally I'm looking to keep it for as long as possible. 

The used car market is a bit lopsided right now because of COVID and I'm noticing that especially on the cars/SUVs I'm looking at the price difference between new and CPO isn't dramatic.

So my thought is, **when would the price difference make new a better value?**

I was looking to spend around $20k for a CPO (want the warranty), but I'm seeing the new versions of the same cars go for under $30k. It has me wondering if the additional 3 year newer model year, no miles, and full warranty is worth the roughly 25% premium ($6,000).

Examples (rough estimate using MSRP - actual OTD could swing a few thousand)

* **2018 Toyota RAV4 AWD** w/ 30k miles @ ~$20k **vs** **2021 Toyota RAV4 AWD** @ ~$27k
* **2018 Mazda CX-5 AWD** w/ 30k miles @  ~$22k **vs** **2021 Mazda CX-5 AWD** @ ~$26k


FWIW:

* I could pay both the $20k and $30k cash, but I'm going to put down $10k on either in cash and finance the rest. I'm more comfortable having the extra $10k - 20k  available and just slowly paying off the rest even with the few hundred extra dollars in interest. This is just a personal preference from past experiences.
* My credit is at or around 800, so my interest rates won't be insane based on pre-approvals.
* I have no other debt and stable income. Keeping the payment at or below $400 (48 mo - 36 mo loan) on either would make up less than 10% of my take home each month.

personalfinance,Dropped out of doctorate clinical program and now have $70K in loans with a $27K salary. Any advice appreciated.,"So I graduated undergrad debt-free with a Health Sciences Pre-clinical B.S. and started my 3 yr DPT (physical therapy doctorate). Clinical doctorate is 13-17 graduate credit hours a semester, basically 8-6 days not including all the studying, volunteering, research, extracurriculars, etc. So unless you find a job that is ludicrously flexible and make sacrifices on school performance you can't have a job and your interest accrues the whole time you're in school... So I took out all unsubsidized federal loans to cover  tuition + living expenses every semester. 

I was excelling in the program but around semester #5 the stars aligned to have every bad thing possible happen in my life at the same time and the mental health challenges became too much to bear with such a rigorous program. I decided to withdraw and no longer pursue a career involving patient-care and just start over from scratch and prioritize my mental health in Dec. 2019..So then the pandemic hit, I searched for work for most of 2020 and finally got a job making ~27K/yr and am going to have to start paying on my $70K in federal loans as the forbearance for COVID ends. It feels very daunting and overwhelming and I have SO MANY QUESTIONS. What should I take into consideration when selecting a payment plan? Do I prioritize putting money into savings as well or just throw all of my money at the loans at the end of the month? I have about $12K saved up total to my name. Do I blow it all on the loan now or keep it saved and just make payments? It just seems like a drop in the bucket on the loans despite it being my entire life savings... How do these student loans affect my credit? Should I try to make sure I'm investing now as well for retirement or prioritize larger loan payments? Is there a financial planning expert resource I should be speaking to? I don't even know where to start, but I know the first step is figuring out how much to put towards the student loans...any help or advice is so greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I appreciate all the responses. To clarify, going back is not an option for a multitude of reasons that are too complicated to explain without writing a novel haha Also I dropped out at semester 5 of 9. So my loan amount would essentially double to 120-140K to leave school and make around 50-60K starting.. leaving me at a similar debt/income ratio. and finally, I do hope that with more work experience and possibly schooling later on if neccessary, I will find a better paying job. However, I need to make this financial decision now, and all of those possibilities are unknowns I can't depend on. My $13/hr job is a full-time job with great benefits and it's alot better than the $9-10/hr I could easily be making for every other entry level ""unskilled"" job in this state.

personalfinance,What house can we really afford? Estimates vary greatly depending on where we look!,"Hi all, and thanks for being a great supportive community.

About me and wifey:

* in our (very) late 20s
* $200k/year combined salary, expecting it to go steadily up, but we like our jobs (stable and great benefits) and don't think of changing so far
* $175k cash
* $150k in retirement accounts, each maxing out our 401k and our Roth IRAs since last year
* $33k in student debt, but a federal program is paying it back over the next 3 years (academia)
* bringing home \~8.6k/mo after tax, healthcare, FSA, retirement contributions
* currently renting a tiny apartment, working from home, going totally crazy
* want to try having kids, and want a house beforehand
* we like to travel, and unless parenthood rocks our plans (we know it will...) we'd like to continue doing that, especially since I'm an immigrant and my family is in Europe.
* we'd stay in that house for at least 4 years, but as our first home, we don't need the moon, and we'd not expect it to be our house for life.

Here are the two kinds of estimates I found. They're assuming **20% down**, as well as a mortgage **rate of 2.75%** which we know we can secure (we'd do 30 years for flexibility and pay faster if we can since the difference in rates is low):

1. [*Dave Ramsey*](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/how-much-house-can-i-afford): mortgage + insurance + tax should be less than 1/4 of our bring home salary for a 15y mortgage. That's a monthly total of \~$2,150, which would be the case for a **$315k** house
2. *Rule I've heard floating around*: mortgage + insurance + tax should be less than 1/3 of our bring home salary for a 30y mortgage. That's a monthly total of $2,870, which would be the case for a **$665k** house... more than twice the other estimate! FFFFF

Obviously, if we can get a house for $315k instead of $665k that'd be better... but it's far from having what we want. Currently, we're looking at houses around **$430k**: that's actually a 1/3 of our monthly income on a 15y mortgage (\~$2,870 monthly payments), and less than 1/4 on a 30y mortgage (\~$1,940 monthly payments).

Last year has been really daunting to shop for a house, so we're going back to figure out if we can actually afford something more expensive. In your opinion, would pushing to **$480k** still be reasonable (1/4 of our salary on a 30y mortgage)?

CryptoCurrency,A break down of the bull case for Ethereum and how it relates to Bitcoin,"**EDIT 11**: This was just a preliminary write up. You can read the full investment thesis (WIP) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11oCA9iPtv6s-twhW6PdSpiENKCbeW7aJJO9Jv8KEc2g/edit?usp=sharing).

&amp;#x200B;

There is a general understanding among ETH investors that the enhancements from ETH 2.0, EIP-1559 and L2 solutions will result in a sustainable monetary policy with near 0% issuance and the potential for Ether to become a deflationary asset. What is even more interesting is that the net return of ETH as a SoV becomes superior to BTC the moment that issuance is lower than the staking yield. In other words, even if BTC had already ceased issuance, it offers no mechanism to provide yield to long term holders with a negligible risk exposure as ETH does. There is an execution risk that Ethereum will not deliver on what is currently planned, but if it does then what I have explained will become a reality.

You cannot separate BTC/ETH's payment rails from their respective monetary policies. As you are probably aware, issuance is just a subsidy, and without it the network will need to operate as a profitable business with a cash-flow that is entirely dependent on network fees. We are observing a situation that is causing a degradation of the utility of the Bitcoin network. What I mean by that is that the incentive for users to transact directly on the network is being diminished because of the tokenization into ETH and by the introduction of custodians (like Paypal) and traditional banking services who will soon be entering this space. If these trends continue, I suspect that the only activity that will end-up happening on-chain will be done by whales sporadically transacting to hodle and the occasional settlement from institutions. Bitcoin seems fast and frictionless, but that is because you are comparing it to something in the physical world. In digital terms Bitcoin emulates the friction of operation that is found with gold: it is difficult and expensive to move it, securing it yourself is not trivial, and it does not make for a great medium of exchange. I don't think this will be a good dynamic to generate enough transaction fees. That is of course my subjective interpretation of it, but regarding this particular situation it is nearly impossible to make objective assertions at this point. It is possible to assert that, in the digital world, the expectation of frictionless money would entail near instant transactions with negligible cost and without the relative risk/paranoia of dealing with nuclear waste and having a hacker watching your every move waiting for you to make a mistake to snatch it away. Digital money would also need to interact with other digital assets, preferably defined and operated within the same ecosystem. Ethereum is steaming ahead on all ends.

Ethereum is fostering a digital economy (this is a very important part of understanding the value of Ethereum, but I will not be exploring it in this post) with DeFi at its center. It is currently generating about three times as much trx fee revenue as Bitcoin. L2 solutions are going live as we speak, and it appears that they will be much more practical and provide better UX when compared to the Lightning Network. This will help to amplify L1 block space value and push revenue even higher. That will be followed by EIP-1559, which will burn transaction fees. Mining is currently excessively profitable and the hash rate cannot keep up. This means the financial incentive can be reduced and by burning trx fees we achieve the equivalent of an issuance reduction, while stabilizing mining revenue. Eventually the transition to PoS will dramatically cut the operational cost of the network. That means that Ethereum as a business will become more profitable and less reliant on the issuance subsidy. Finally, we will see the introduction of sharding which will scale L1 by up to 1,000 times, compounding the effect of L2 solutions and making it feasible for the network to operate as a platform for new use cases. A solution to the hacker/nuclear waste security situation is being explored via social recovery wallets. It is still in the early stages of research and design, but it is important to realize that the Ethereum community recognizes it as a problem and is working on a solution.

There is a lot more that can be said about the BTC vs ETH debate and I am working on a full write up that explores each individual element in more detail. Regardless, it is important to pay attention to this trend: the smartest people in this space are shifting their point of view and realizing Ethereum's potential. Raoul Pal is a seasoned investor, extremely bright and open minded. He started with Bitcoin, but it did not take him long to understand the value proposition of Ethereum. Lyn Alden is a brilliant investor and mental powerhouse who initially did not think investing in Ethereum could be justified, but she is also[ starting to shift her view](https://www.lynalden.com/ethereum-analysis) and now understands that it has a justifiable risk/reward ratio to be included in a portfolio (although she is not personally invested in Ethereum). She has plenty of negative things to say about it, however it appears that she recognizes this is not a black and white situation. I have a feeling she will be revising her analysis on Ethereum again in the future with a more optimist view, but maybe that is just wishful thinking.

The crypto space has a few analogies that have been used to describe technical/economic mechanisms that are somewhat tricky to understand: mining, Ethereum's gas, and the analogy between ether and oil. Crypto ""mining"" is not like real world mining. It's purpose is not to extract resources, but it is rather a decentralized mechanism to process transactions. Newly minted BTC tokens are not ""mined"", they are minted by the protocol and awarded to operators. Furthermore, it is impossible to change the total mining output of the network... adding/removing miners does not affect the mining output. If you are new to crypto, you can read a more detailed explanation of mining[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k4qdyc/if_you_are_new_to_crypto_you_may_be_slightly/). ETH's ""gas"" is not like fuel (it cannot even be stored). It is just a computational metric that is more akin to the distance a car must travel, but not what actually makes it move. The fuel is electricity and it must be paid for with ether. When you transact you are also paying for the ""car"" which is the use of all active mining hardware/validators for a fraction of a second. And ether is just money.

If you put too much weight on these simplified analogies, you will not understand the economic actuality behind them. This is a source confusion in the crypto space, and it is used to support false narratives. From an economic perspective, ether is money. Once you understand this, you will know that the narrative that BTC and ETH are not competing because they are different things is analogous to saying fax machines do not compete with the internet.

The beautiful thing about ether is that it is actually not ""just money"". It is a mixture of a scarce monetized commodity, money, bond and tech stock.

* **Monetized Commodity**: Ether is becoming more scarce and will continue to do so with the transition to proof-of-stake and EIP-1559. Ethereum does not have a supply cap, but it does have a roadmap for a sustainable security model and if it achieves a positive cashflow then it will not only eliminate issuance, it can become deflationary.[ An argument can be made about potential issues with Bitcoin's sustainability in the long run.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/k46gge/the_threat_to_bitcoin_that_no_one_is_talking_about/)
* **Currency**: Ether is used as a unit of account and medium of exchange to pay for every activity in Ethereum. It is also used in the same way for venture capital related to ICOs, and Ether is also used as collateral in the DEFI space and new monetary uses will continue to emerge. It is an immature form of money, just like Bitcoin is an immature form of gold. Some people prefer to say that Ether is just a utility token. However, a utility token is just a narrowly scoped form of money. Not only is Ether's scope within its digital economy growing, by next year users will be able to pay millions of merchants with Ether through Paypal. We have never seen the adoption of a new form of money grow organically. New forms of money have always been imposed by authorities. What would the organic growth of money look like? It would look like Ether.
* **Ethereum's digital economy**: Ethereum has limitless use cases and it is already generating economic activity with real world usefulness. Ether's value will benefit from acting as the native monetary asset for Ethereum. As Ethereum's economic activity grows, the velocity and/or value of ether must also increase.
* **Bond**: With proof-of-stake you need to lock up Ether to receive a yield in return. It is similar to how bonds work.
* **Tech Stock**: Ethereum provides a service. That service is paid with ether. The network is controlled by holding ether that is staked. The more valuable the service provided by Ethereum becomes, the more users will be willing to pay for transactions and the more valuable the protocol and the Ether token become. Cloud based services is the entire business model of many companies. The network will be entirely operated by stakers who happen to be the recipients of transaction fees. It is not exactly the same as holding a stock, but there are a lot of parallels.
* **Full reserve banking model**: This is a bit of a stretch, but it is a potential end-game for Ethereum. It can serve as the base infrastructure and reserve asset for a full reserve banking system. In a nutshell: a consortium of banking companies can be formed to standardize a framework to hold and stake Ether under custody in exchange for wrapped Ether. Customers deposit Ether, banks exchange it for wETH and stake the original ETH. Resting balances of wEther on customer accounts can receive a cut of the staking rewards. Banks get their profit model, customers get to spend wrapped Ether with traditional banking services and potentially receive a share of the staking yield. Customers could also have access to a yield curve based on variable reserve requirements. This would allow banks to create money (which is actually good for the economy when it is done with moderation), but for the first time ever customers would have the choice of how much risk exposure they are comfortable with. This dynamic could help to establish a form of democratic check and balances system that discourages moral hazard. Ether could become a godsend to banks in the land of negative yields. It's a pipe dream, but not entirely impossible. Don't forget that the US OCC has essentially given banks the green light to take the first steps in this direction (US banks have been approved to use the Ethereum blockchain for their operations AND they can become validators... yup this happened).

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT 1: Adding an analogy to explain why ether is money:**

Let’s say I have a car with a 14-gallon fuel tank and I want to take it on a road trip. The car is not aware of the price of gasoline, and it would not travel any farther if the price of gas would double the next day. That’s because the intrinsic utility of oil has nothing to do with its monetary value. The car needs gas because of its particular physical properties and how the ICE is designed to utilize it. If I want to drive from point A to point B and it takes a full tank to get there, it will take that full tank no matter what happens to the monetary properties of gas/oil. This is fundamentally different from how Ethereum uses ether.

Ethereum (the network) is not trying to be money, but it utilizes ether exclusively for its monetary properties and not because it can be magically burned by an imaginary engine of sorts. It costs money to participate in the network as a miner, and their engagement is financially incentivized with ether. Block space is a scarce resource, therefore participants who wish to transact use ether to bid for it. These interactions are utilizing ether as a monetary medium of exchange. In the long run, as the price of ether goes up, the ether denomination of gas prices goes down. That happens because no one is using ether as gas/oil, and it is actually being used as money. In the short run you may see the opposite occurring because of the dynamic between the portion of block space demand that is inelastic and the demand for ether.

**EDIT 2: Revisiting key concepts to explain how they will become price catalysts.**

1. **Wide adoption of L2 solutions**: these will amplify the base layer block space value while encouraging further network adoption by a significant reduction of fees. A successful integration with DeFi protocols will dismiss the ""Ethereum killers"" theory and consolidate market confidence.
2. **EIP-1559**: reduce excessive financial incentives to miners by burning transaction fees. This will also discourage miners from attempting to artificially raise fees via spam.
3. **Sharding**: scale L1 bandwidth, compounding the effect of L2 solutions, further consolidating Ethereum's dominance in the DeFi space, making it feasible to introduce new use cases and eventually increase trx fee revenue.
4. **The switch from PoW to PoS**: discontinuing PoW will eliminate the operating costs related to mining and will allow for a reduction of issuance. Money that was previously allocated to buying mining equipment will be redirected to the acquisition of Ether. Staking Ether will remove it from circulation for extended periods of time. Operating cost will be negligible, allowing validators to withhold most of the Ether revenue. This will be the greatest bull market catalyst in the history of cryptocurrencies and it will eclipse the effect of[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=cashtag_click)BTC halvenings.

Bitcoin maximalists will be nay-saying all the way through and past a market cap flip. Do not get caught up in their narrative. If you are not sure, then it is better to rebalance your portfolio proportionally to market caps. If none of these things happen and Ethereum turns out to be a failure, then you would only have reduced your gains by 20%. Otherwise, ETH will be making you mountains of money.

**EDIT 3:** **Ethereum killers**

Ethereum killers remind me a lot of Tesla killers, but a lot worse. People need to understand that cryptocurrency platforms targeting financial Dapps are fighting the equivalent force of a black-hole when it comes to Ethereum’s network effect and user retention in this space.

Bigger players, with bigger money, are entering this market and they will not settle for anything other than the top dog. This pattern reinforces Ethereum's position as the premium financial system, which ends up attracting even bigger players and resulting in the black-hole effect. To make matters even more complicated, financial apps are more valuable when they are surrounded by a rich and diverse variety of digital assets and other natively defined Dapps. There is not much you can do with your money in a ghost town.

It is VERY difficult to build this type of environment up because the platform and dapps must also have established full trust from their user base. This is not to say there is no space for other networks to grow, but just don’t get your hopes high that they will be taking Ethereum’s stronghold as a financial system. There are other use cases that do not require the amount of decentralization and security offered by Ethereum, and the networks that can focus on these are the ones who will be able to coexist with in the long-run. Gaming, ERP interoperability and supply chain are good examples of such use cases. Remember that alternatives with cheap transactions have existed for a while and they have barely touched ETH's dominance (EOS, NEO, VET, QTUM, IOTA, LSK, STRAT, ARK and dare I say... TRON).

**EDIT 4: Refuting critiques about dynamic monetary policy**

If an argument can be made that the financial incentives to operators (miners/stakers) are excessive or insufficient then an argument can be for the implementation and execution of a dynamic monetary policy.

I don't think an arbitrarily picked issuance schedule determined during the genesis of a new highly complex system is likely to be efficient through its lifecycle. Bitcoin's monetary policy provides the certainty of stability and protection from abuse, but it sacrifices the possibility of efficiency and jeopardizes longevity. It would be like if a captain of a ship would point it in the direction of its final destination, set the throttle, then fall back to his cabin for a nice bottle of chianti and hope that the ship would arrive safely. There would be no one at the helm to navigate the seas, no one to make sure it stayed on route, no one to avoid the storms or to take advantage of currents. In my opinion it is a pretty bad approach to something as critical as monetary policy.

With respect to Ethereum's dynamic monetary policy: I don't see any evidence to suggest developers have been enriching their pockets by keeping issuance at the levels they are. Developers are stakeholders and the Ethereum fund holds a lot of ether - debasing ether is against their self interest. There is a great misunderstanding that the one's who are adjusting issuance are the recipients of the new tokens. Is there any documented case of this happening?

**EDIT 5: Addressing Bitcoin's immutable monetary policy**

The idea that Bitcoin's monetary policy cannot be changed is a myth. It is a false narrative that takes for granted that the issuance subsidy will no longer be necessary at some point, but there is no way to objectively assert this. There is no divine power preventing the monetary policy from being changed. If the security model for Bitcoin was jeopardized because of insufficient cash flow to miners, then Bitcoin's monetary policy would be the first thing on the chop board to go in order to remedy the situation.

**EDIT 6:** Five years ago naysayers were screaming about how everything that is being done TODAY in the Ethereum network would never work. Now they are calling Ethereum a scam, or that is is a platform for degenerate gamblers, or that the fees are too high and therefore it is useless, or that it can't scale, or that something else better is just around the corner to take its place.... you know... basically all the things that traditional bankers have to say about Bitcoin, maxis are saying about Ethereum.

**EDIT 7:** The greater the impact a new technology can have on society, the more difficult it is to comprehend its potential. Ethereum has the potential to have a dramatic impact on human civilization. It could take decades for it to be fully realized, but it would change the world in ways that we cannot possibly imagine today. If it happens, the moon will be just a pit-stop.

**EDIT 8:** Thank you so much for all the awards! Ethereans understand this stuff, and I could feel the frustration in the air every time someone said that Ethereum is not money, or that ETH and BTC are completely different things, or all the other bs attacks that are in great part founded on a lack of understanding of how BTC and ETH actually work. I would love to hear what guys like Raoul Pal, Pomp, Michael Saylor and Fernando Ulrich (for my Brazilian friends) would have to say about some of the things that have been written here. If you know a way to get their attention, then please do it.

**EDIT 9**: Clarification about Lyn Alden's opinion of Ethereum

**EDIT 10:** I am still working on a much more ambitious write up. It is focused on economic aspects of money, monetary systems and global asset markets. I still have not incorporated any of the information written here, but I eventually will merge it together. One of the main new ideas that I am exploring is challenging the notion that money has no intrinsic value and that scarcity is the most important attribute of money. I think I make a compelling argument to demonstrate that facilitating economic activity is more important, and how Ethereum has a big edge over Bitcoin in this regard.

CryptoCurrency,"""Anchorage Digital Bank Becomes First Federally Regulated Digital Asset Bank"" More Crypto Banks Coming Soon",[deleted],cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"""Anchorage Digital Bank, the First Federally Chartered Digital Asset Bank"" More Crypto Banks Coming Soon 🚀","Anchorage is pleased to announce that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has provided conditional approval to our application for a national trust charter, which makes Anchorage Digital Bank National Association, the first federally chartered digital asset bank in history. This is a major milestone, not only for us as an organization, but also for the crypto industry and the wider financial world. Crypto deserves a bank, and we are immensely proud of being approved as the one to set the standard.

Having a national bank charter places Anchorage Digital Bank firmly on the same regulatory footing as other national banks in the country. Most immediately, it puts first-of-its-kind, sub-custody services within reach for any traditional financial institution that wishes to give its clients access to digital assets. Since our founding, we’ve been credited numerous times with blurring the lines between crypto and traditional finance. Today, we’re happy to see those lines begin to be erased.

Before now, there have existed fintech companies with the technical sophistication to securely handle digital assets under a piecemeal, state-by-state regulatory structure, and there have existed federally chartered banks with a robust regulatory framework that lack the true technological savvy it takes to operate in the blockchain space at its breakneck pace of innovation. Anchorage Digital Bank is the first entity to have both the tech and the regulatory clarity that serious institutional participation in crypto demands. And as a federally chartered bank with fiduciary powers, Anchorage Digital Bank will unequivocally meet the definition of Qualified Custodian, giving institutions a straightforward way to meet their obligations under federal law.

We are currently witnessing the rise of institutional crypto adoption. From large asset managers, to corporate treasuries, to endowments and family offices, institutional interest in digital assets has never been higher. As the space continues to mature and its use cases proliferate, we expect to see increasing demand for a wide range of services — services that exceed the expectations of traditional finance. A federal charter significantly increases our ability to develop and offer the kinds of innovative financial products and services with the safety and soundness that institutional participants require.

We could not have reached such an historic milestone without the tireless efforts of our team, and the many, many others who have spent countless hours of their lives and huge amounts of resources to blaze the trail ahead of and alongside us. And we are immensely grateful to the OCC, whose passion for protecting consumers and commitment to keeping the American banking system at the forefront of financial innovation is clearly evident in their work. Today marks a truly meaningful step forward on the journey toward a more fair, equitable, and secure financial system. May it be one of many.

economy,$15 minimum wage and money printing,"Hey all, I have a few questions about things I don’t understand after a good bit of research.

1) What will happen to the US economy if the federal minimum wage is raised to $15/hr? 

Small businesses are already suffering and I read that many won’t be able to pay their employees especially coming out of the pandemic. 

I also read that many businesses will cut their workforce because of this massive increase, whether it’s because of greed or necessity. If they don’t cut their workforce then perhaps they will increase the price of what they are selling. 

What would the effects be on the economy if these happened?

2) With all these stimulus packages and huge amounts of money printing going on in 2020 and likely continuing into 2021, what will happen to the economy? Obviously inflation increases, but by how much and is it enough to seriously effect the economy?

I have about $750 right now in it as well as $800 in a 401(k) provided by my employer that I started contributing to when I became eligible in June. One of my goals by year end 2021 is to have at least 3 months of my living expenses in this emergency fund. My main focus right now though is paying down my remaining debt (36 payments of a car loan at 10.5% interest with roughly 10K in principal left, and the car itself got fucked up in an accident so a refinance is out the window, paying this down first) and about 8K in federal student loans. I figure that paying down a loan with a 10.5% interest rate will yield more equity and build my net worth quicker than investing and getting a 5-8% ROI.

The house prices here are crazy and, frankly, I am not too stoked about adding such a hefty amount of debt into our balance sheet. Wife, on the other hand, is tired of renting and she believes that a house purchase is a good investment. It's hard to argue with this one considering the low interest rate and how much house value appreciates YoY in the area. I see myself as more risk averse than my wife and I've told her that we should only purchase if the price makes sense.

Now the question becomes, how much house can we REALLY afford? Our total pre-tax income is around 450K (235 salary + 100 stocks + 120 salary). And our current NW is 1.8M (1.2M in non-retirement account). We are both in our early 30's and we're planning to put down 20%. Our monthly expense ranges from 3K to 4K per month. Average last year was 3.3K per month.

Our first estimate is that 1.5M would be the max that we can afford. Our mortgage would be around 5K per month. Frankly, I still feel this amount is a bit too much considering that it is above 30% of our take home (considering salary only and single-earner income). I am wondering if this number is a stretch for us or whether I am being too risk averse. My number one fear is having too much debt hanging over our head and not having enough headroom when shit hits the fan (whatever that may be).",finance

cybersecurity,Potential Federal Criminal Liability and your actions on the dark web (US),"Hey all, first time poster here so please forgive me if I’m not following the proper format, I just believe this info is too good not to share...

For those located in the US, and who regularly use the dark web for research or are someone tasked with identifying if Company XYZ’s data is being bought and sold on the dark web, I *highly* recommend reading the following article. This article was created and disseminated by the CCIPS Criminal Division at the US Department of Justice. These individuals are the expert DOJ cyber crime prosecutors who are responsible for prosecuting and providing advice to other DOJ prosecutors on how to prosecute cyber crime. This article discusses how you or the organization you work for could be *potentially* liable for legitimate activities conducted on the dark web and the best practices on how to protect yourself in the event you become subject of an investigation. 

It appears the DOJ give benefit of the doubt to people and organizations that regularly visit the dark web to help the victims of cyber attacks. However, the DOJ makes it very clear that your actions must clearly demonstrate that you were operating on the dark web for legitimate reasons. You don’t need to be caught up in an investigation where your actions are called into question all because you were trying to help the victim of a cyber attack. This article is also only intended to cover intelligence or evidence gathering on “online forums in which computer crimes are discussed and planned and stolen data is bought and sold. It also contemplates situations in which private actors attempt to purchase malware, security vulnerabilities, or their own stolen data—or stolen data belonging to others with the data owners’ authorization—in Dark Markets.” 

I’d like to add, I am not a lawyer and I am not providing legal advice. I just found this article interesting and felt is was necessary to share to help protect those who protect others. Take what you want from it. Thanks for reading!

personalfinance,Choice between starting/advancing career and paying down debt,"Warning: Wall of text.

**tl;dr: I have significant debts and a choice between a job that will advance my career but pays kinda poorly and a job that I detest and is a dead end but pays well**

So I have three job offers, one I kinda want, one I really *really* want but am unlikely to ultimately get, and one I most definitely don't. Sounds like it shouldn't be too complicated right? Well read on.

**Background**

I'm 33 and single. I have about $3,000 currently.

So I recently obtained an associates degree and a pile of IT certifications (CompTIA A+, Network, Windows, Linux, Security) while I was recovering from a nasty bout with the 'rona and not working and spent most of my emergency fund. Before this I was a trucker taking online classes part time. In December I started applying for IT jobs and a trucking job in case I couldn't find anything.

I only started 'getting good' with money recently, I lived paycheck to paycheck for years and racked up considerable debts, many of which I simply did not pay.

My current past due debts are about $14,000. About $5,700 is past the statute of limitations but still reportable to credit agencies. $6,000 is owed to a university at a phenomenal interest rate (18%!) collected by the state tax authority which is currently in an interest-only payment plan because I am unemployed. My debts in good standing total approximately $32,000, including $26,000 in student loans in the REPAYE plan and a loan for trucking school for another $4,000 at the same phenomenal interest rate as my university debt. The rest is medical debt at 2% interest.

In total, the exact debt currently is $47,717.26. The past couple years I have paid over $3,000 in interest each year.

**The Jobs**

The job I *really* want is with a DOD contractor performing IT work. The pay starts at $47k/yr but increases rapidly and opens me up to my intended career path, which is DOD cybersecurity. I feel unlikely to get it as I don't think I can get a security clearance with my past-due debt and the fact I filed my taxes late on and off since 2011, although I have never owed back taxes. If I get the security clearance I will be taking the DOD job. I have already accepted the offer but it is contingent on a security clearance (sf86 is some work, man).

The job I kinda want is with a large software company doing entry-level IT work. The pay starts at $39k/yr and I'm not really sure how fast the pay rises, but is at least adjacent to if not in my intended career path.

The job I don't want is trucking, working for the company I quit when I got the 'rona. My pay was approximately 72k/yr and the new offer is about 5% higher than my previous, so lets say 75k/yr.

**The Question**

Assuming I don't get the DOD job, should I take the job in my intended career path and make significantly less money and pay more in interest but advance my career, or take a job I absolutely detest and pay off my remaining debt in about a year?

I have negotiated a deal with a friend that if I am trucking I can 'live' at his house rent free, as in, receive my mail there and show up once a month for a weekend and keep my stuff in his basement. I'm currently renting a room in his house. Living rent-free while making 75k/yr would put me in a pretty good position to pay off most, if not all, of my 45k in debt in about a year. But I absolutely detest trucking and it will do nothing to advance my career.

I realize people will have different answers to this and they will be subjective.

personalfinance,Refinancing my home is resulting me to get an $80 a month PMI but have a PMT $400 less per month. Is it smarter to pay the additional $400 to principle or invest it? More details inside,"Good morning! 

I bought my first house last year using a loan program through CHFA. Basically the program I used allowed me to buy the house with only 3% down and let me avoid PMI. However, with rates as low as they currently are I have the option to cut my interest rate in half saving me around 480 a month BUT when I refinance I will be required to pay PMI of roughly $80 a month. I am currently at about 13% equity in the house due mostly to appreciation and the lenders I'm talking to are telling me with a normal payoff schedule I'll hit the 20% equity needed for the PMI to go away in about 4-5 years. 

My question is: does it make sense for me to continue paying my normal (current) payment amount with the now excess $400 going straight to principle to get off of the PMI faster or would it be smarter to throw the extra 400 in an investment? I'm lucky enough to be in a very comfortable financial position with a fully stocked emergency fund, secure job, etc. I'm not planning on staying in the house for more than 2-3 years but wouldn't mind keeping it and renting it when I move if I am able to. 

Also, I know I have a shorter horizon for how long I'll be in the house but I've confirmed I'll break even on the refi prior to 2 years so no worries there.

ethereum,"mStable has Launched a New, Composable Version of mUSD Save","**Since launch in July 2020, mUSD Save has been one of the easiest to use, secure, low volatility and** [**high-yielding**](https://twitter.com/mstable_/status/1341766301719670785?s=20) **savings products in DeFi.**

mStable solves for a low-interest rate world by creating a unique automated  market maker that autonomously lends out all deposited USD stablecoins  onto third-party lending protocols while simultaneously allowing for  these same stablecoins to be swapped, earning trading fees. This AMM  produces meta-stablecoins instead of LP tokens: this has several  consequences, one of which is that we can create a **separate savings account to which system revenue is sent.**

Today, the mStable genesis team releases mUSD Save V2 — **a tokenised savings account, for anyone, anywhere.** This release was first proposed by [Richard Galvin](https://twitter.com/richwgalvin) of [DACM](http://dacm.io/) [here](https://forum.mstable.org/t/proposal-make-save-composable/259) and then ratified by [Meta Governors](http://governance.mstable.org/) [here](https://snapshot.page/#/mstable/proposal/Qmagp3yn7CwUGx2LHV4YTkmQ5Re9oTtmfczAQExHrcN17b).

[Screenshot of the SAVE v2 user interface](https://preview.redd.it/a7nihwlx24c61.png?width=1994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6be75f8aa27ca2a6fa6e1263ca07d7d3c2657f59)

## Get started:

* **If you are an existing Save user, please note that funds must be manually migrated from Save v1 to Save v2.**
* **How to Migrate** from Save v1 to Save v2 can be accessed [here](https://medium.com/mstable/how-to-save-v2-8d102903f03a).
* **Audit report by Certik** [here](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-LxR8Ppz-_JQ7mRRKKgl%2F-MRKc1ox6YcLI9B6bWmG%2F-MRKchbPUEmaO2XQpHD0%2FREP-mStable_18_01_2020.pdf?alt=media&amp;token=b99d38ae-276f-4a30-9332-7c7f8f4a0cef).

# Save v2: A Tokenised Savings Account

mStable Save is now tokenised as imUSD. Today, users depositing mUSD into Save will instantly receive a new savings credit token called imUSD at a ratio of 10:1 on Save deposits.

imUSD **can now be transferred and used throughout DeFi as yielding, low-volatility collateral.** We have built imUSD as the “set and forget” collateral that you use as you trade on your favourite DeFi protocol. **Note that it is significantly cheaper to send** **imUSD** **than, for example, c-tokens (c. 40,000 vs. &gt;100,000 in gas fees).**

Expect to see a lot of imUSD integrations coming in the next few months.

# Enhanced Capital Efficiency

**Deposited mUSD in Save can now be used to earn additional yield.**

Savers effectively get &gt;$1 worth of interest for their $1 deposit:

* First, Savers earn yield on the assets that collateralise mUSD, [both from lending, swapping and other income sources](https://docs.mstable.org/mstable-assets/massets/native-interest-rate).
* Now, Meta Governors can choose to allocate a portion of mUSD in Save to other DeFi protocols. For example, [yearn](http://yearn.finance/) just released an [mUSD yVault](https://twitter.com/iearnfinance/status/1349705345690726402?s=20).  In future, a portion of mUSD Save deposits could go there, or anywhere  else Meta Governors choose — think Compound or AAVE when an mUSDmarket emerges there.

This is only possible because of the capital efficiency enabled by mStable’s meta-stablecoins.

# Savings Boost for Stakers

**All savers can now earn Meta (MTA) to govern the mStable protocol.**

The imUSD Vault is an upgraded StakingRewards contract, with baked in incentives providing a ‘boost’ for participants who are also actively staking their MTA in [governance](http://governance.mstable.org/). Those not staking their MTA in governance will still receive base level MTA rewards if they stake in the imUSD Vault. The specific vMTA requirements will vary depending on the total amount of imUSD and vMTA staked at the time. A lockup has also been implemented, where users will be able to claim 20% of their MTA upfront, and the remaining 80% after 6 months.

Users  of mStable can govern their protocol: this is important as mStable is a decentralised collective, co-ordinated and directed by Meta Governors.

## Timeline

Effective immediately, Save v2 is open for deposits! **Please note that interest will cease to be sent to Save v1 and be entirely redirected to Save v2.**

Beginning at 16:00 GMT (11:00 Eastern time / 17:00 CET), interest will be directed from Save v1 to Save v2, and imUSD will begin to accrue value.

Please note that the imUSD Vault is generating MTA rewards as of now.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Federal withholding in first paycheck of new year went up by $75 but nothing has changed. How?,"I received my first paycheck of 2021 a few days ago and noticed it was about $80 lower than my 2020 paychecks. I looked at the breakdown and my state taxes went up by a few bucks, but my federal tax withholding went up by a whopping $75. I haven't changed my 401k contributions or submitted a different W-4 so I'm a bit confused as to how it went up so much (I did receive a small pay increase this year, but it was not reflected in this most recent paycheck, and even if it was it's small enough that it wouldn't account for this). The only time I've ever seen such large swings in a paycheck were when a new tax break was implemented, or an old tax break expired, so I emailed HR to ask if this was the case and received a pretty standard response about the IRS issuing new tax tables every year and that could maybe account for the change.

So, I looked up the tax tables for 2021, and found them [here](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets) and tried to figure out my tax liability.  My salary falls in the 22% bracket, so I subtracted 40,525 from my taxable income (which I calculated to be my salary - my 401k deductions - my insurance premiums), multiplied that by .22, and added 4,664.  I then divided that number by 24 (I'm paid twice a month) to figure out how much withholding I should expect out of each paycheck, and the number I got matched the amount of federal withholding I had taken out of my checks in 2020 almost exactly, but it was $75 lower than what's being withheld from this most recent paycheck.

Anyone have any idea why this could have happened?  I know if I *am* being overtaxed it means I'll receive a bigger return in 2022, but I like to plan my finances based on my monthly income and that's now going down by about $160 (even when my pay increase kicks in, it'll still probably be about a $100 decrease).",finance
Bitcoin,"Sim Swapped, but have an authenticator on my account.","So like many, my account information was compromised in the Ledger hack. The other night I noticed my phone said there was a sim issue. I didn't think much about it because the last month I've been needing to reboot my phone for occasional invalid sim errors. However this time after reboot it didn't fix my problem. While looking into the issue I noticed a Coinbase account access email popup and disappear.  At that point I knew what was going on. Obviously I was freaking out a little bit (a lot) because I wasn't sure how easy it may be for them to get my authenticator removed, I went on Coinbase's support and requested my account be disabled.  After sending the support request, I was able to get my email secured again. At that point I could get past the Coinbase new device authorization email. I updated my Coinbase login to be a new email address. A few hours later I received an email from Coinbase support saying my account has been disabled. I confirmed by trying to login. The original email address says account is not valid and the updated email says the account is disabled. Perfect, that is what I want for now. 

 However, early this morning I received an email from [help@coinbase.com](mailto:help@coinbase.com) to my updated email address that says my account recovery is successful. I haven't done anything to recover this account yet. The only feedback I've received form Coinbase is them saying they have assigned my case to a specialist. I double checked by trying to login and my account still says disabled. That makes me feel better, but I'm concerned about what is going on Coinbase's side.  My fear is someone may be trying to get Coinbase to unlock my account and remove the authenticator. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone who has been through this experience have some feedback? Can an email address be spoofed like you could a phone number, like [help@coinbcase.com](mailto:help@coinbcase.com)? What kind of time frame does Coinbase help in the event of a disabled account?  I kind of wish I hadn't have knee jerked to have my account disabled, but I really was concerned about likely hood of having the authenticator security removed.

Additional Notes: I read a story about a year or two ago that lead me to add some security for this type of event.  My phone account had a pin and security notes that explicitly say account changes can only be done in store with an ID, but according to the support log someone called repeatedly until they got the device switched.  I'm so glad I had an authenticator app for my Coinbase account, but wish I had realized I should have done it on my email.

I am offered a $5500 subsidized loan (historic low interest rate of 2.75%) which would, from the best of my knowledge, just lapse if I don't take it within this semester. I work bringing in my net monthly savings to -$400 (I withdraw from HYSA). I would not need this cash for college tuition and fees, but I am heavily considering taking it anyways and cash in the amount to put in savings or brokerage or retirement account.

**What would you do if you were me?**

I currently have $27k in HYSA and $6k in brokerage and retirement accounts.

TLDR; Enough money to pay cash. Should I take a subsidized loan and just cash that to savings or invest it?",finance
stocks,Taxes,"I’ve just completed my first year in the market but I admittedly made learning about taxes a non priority. I completely understand the long vs short rates, the brackets and some other things. I do however have two questions that I was hoping some of you may be able to help answer. Btw, I use TDA. 

1. The bulk of my strategy is under 1 year positions with few over 1 year.  The question I have, which may be dumb, is do I pay those actual taxes when I sell my positions or do I pay the Feds a bulk amount at the end of the year or at some cadenced time frame?

2. Does the cost basis on TDA help with this?  It doesn’t seem the cost basis doesn’t account for taxes but I could be wrong.

cardano,My Cardano community vision,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a vision on how this year will look like among the ADA community.

People will realize in masses that they can make 5 % pa on staking ADA.

Then they will start borrowing money from Celsius at 1 % (they do not offer staking rewards on collaterals of the loan but a lot of people will put btc, eth etc as collateral), they start taking mortgages at low interest rates as well. Then they start staking ADA.

The additional returns will come as ADA will increase in value due to the additional demand.

This is actually a smart move when you do it before the mass hysteria will start. When the crypto is at peak of the cycle, then the returns are also lower. The returns will be based on the staking rewards only.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Investing and Career Advice,"Hi all, 

I just turned 30 last year and am at a crossroads in life. I am currently trying to make many decisions at once, to find purpose and to also invest wisely for my future. I am an expat living in Germany, and have somewhere between 50-60K saved after 4 years in the workforce, plus some stock options and monthly contributions into a German pension. Most important is I have healthy spending habits (including rent only spending about half of my net income per month), and with my savings plus projected earnings for at least the next year, I have a solid foundation that I would like to grow. However, I am also a bit afraid of making the wrong decisions with my hard earned money. 

I believe I am in a good position with many open doors, but I am in a way struggling to choose which door to go through. I am working in tech, in a cool company, but find the 9-5 office life pretty dim spending my life in front of the computer (even though I am doing interesting work and projects). I am considering what my best options are for the future. I am considering going to a relatively cheap medical school (in USA or abroad, but would require some debt), going back into biology, into biotech, starting a small business with some friends, or becoming a personal trainer, etc... (lots of options). 

Now, considering my personal finances, I would love to invest in the big index funds (but now the stock market seems overvalued), so I am also considering to buy an apartment in the city I live, because interest rates are so cheap and there is a HUGE demand for housing. The housing prices are at an all time high, but I live in a big growing city, so I'm pretty confident the valuation will grow. I can also borrow some money from family if I want to maximize my mortgage and share the apartment with a flatmate. However, I am afraid to leverage considering it will be a high percentage of my net worth, my current rent is really cheap, and as an expat maybe I will decide to move on. I feel it's the time to start investing, but maybe I need to sit a little longer on my savings and let them accumulate a bit more before making a move. 

I would appreciate any and all advice! Thanks so much in advance &lt;3",finance
personalfinance,Can I refinance an add-on interest loan?,"Hi Everyone! This is my first ever post on Reddit! Yay!

Recently, I purchased my first car (pre-owned Mazda 3 2020) for ~$20k. I made a 50% down payment, and took out ~10k add-on interest loan (4.99%). And the loan total balance is ~13K.

personalfinance,Best Way to Manage Debt from US and Canada,"I grew up in the US and have accrued student loan debt, along with debt from 3 credit cards. I moved to Canada and have two more credit cards here. I'm finding that paying off my debt is harder than it needs to be. I've been sending roughly $1k CAD to the US every month to pay debt there, but it feels like it's not doing much. It only amounts to less than $800 and I have close to $200 in interest each month, and I can't even send this much some months. Sometimes I'll send too much over, which leads me to not be able to pay enough of my Canadian credit card to avoid the overage fee when interests puts it past the limit. I don't know what my options are and from who to seek help (bank, financial advisor, etc.). My details are below:

* US Card 1: $6,200 (limit is $7,650) @ 21.99%
* US Card 2: $2,570 @ 15.90%
* US Card 3: $1,730 (limit is $1,800) @ 15.90%
* US Student Loan: $6,890 ($4,680 @ 3.4% and $2,210 @ 6.8%)
* CA Card 1: $5,900 (limit is $6,000) @ 19.99%
* CA Card 2: $450 (limit is $500) @ 19.99%
* US debt is in USD and CA debt is in CAD.

All federal student loan debt is in forbearance due to COVID-19, so I haven't been putting money toward that since March.

Over the past year, I've paid about $700USD/mo and $350CAD/mo on debt, on average.

My initial thoughts are to consolidate my debt so I'm only putting money towards a Canadian loan, because the US dollar is killing me. Is that the best option? Is there a way I can consolidate Canadian and American debt? Or perhaps get a Canadian loan and just use it to pay off my US debt? (I imagine I should leave the student loan as-is, due to the low interest rates).

I would expect the entire 50-85% is taxable. However, [online calculators](https://smartasset.com/retirement/retirement-taxes) (in particular for New York) suggest to me that social security benefits are generally not taxed so highly.

As an example, lets say someone makes $25k in wages. Then 50% of any benefits they receive should get taxed at income tax rate yes?

vet,"sick cat, probably gastroenteritis, refuses to eat, licks walls &amp; tries to eat aluminum foil","Hello fellow redditers,

in early october me and my girlfriend finally got ourselves a cat (5 months old kitty boy we call Čertik - czech for ""little devil"") from animal shelter.

First month or so was great but after that in the early november the little guy started to have blood in the stool. We fed him combination of wet food and boiled meat (mostly turkey and chicken, not spiced!). I went to the vet immidiately, was given some digestive canned food as the vet suspected gastroenteritis and made parvovirus test (the munchkin lady from the shelter didnt vax him). 

Test was negative, cat was getting better, so we carried on. It's near christmas, the little guy starts to have blood in stool again, this time he gets worse much quicker. I visited vet, the lady was just ""meh"", gave me the same food, which now our cat refused to eat, and explained nothing. 

At 25. december he was looking seriously bad, almost wasn΄t eating, so we took him to emergency clinic, where they gave him some antibiotics and kicked us out. Afterwards, on 29th December the guy puked and had diarrhea all over the bathroom, started breathing heavily and started falling asleep. We immidiately drove him to the emergency where they had to hospitalize him for 3 days.

Afterwards we were told it is probably parvo, for which they made another series of tests (complete blood test to see what is going on and two separate parvovirus test, one from the blood, one from antibodies). They also offered me a stool test for whichever may be infesting on the guy. They gave the little man back at 1. January and he was looking terrible. They did not even wipe his butt, just give him series of shots, he was sleepy and exhausted, came home and was sleeping almost nonstop for next 48 hours. When he did not sleep, he would eat, but only very little - he started to refuse the same food twice or thrice in a row. I was giving him chicken, beef and his usual wet food which he positively loved, but now he would take two bites and start to scratch around the plate. What is bamboozled me is that he started to lick the walls and floor in the bathroom.

This was more or less the same until january 10th, where I searched for another vet, since the emergency clinic only told me that ""he should not be eating 10 kilos of salami in one go"" as a dietary tip, and the guy was obviously having problems with git. 

The next guy is, finally, somehow capable, he told me its most probably gastroenteritis (as suspected from the beginning) and gave him some pills and shot for apetite increase and wanted him to have gastrointestinal food diet only. He also gave him vitamins and mineral supplements, and it worked for a few days, but now he's getting worse again, he looks terrible now, changed behaviour completely, is obviously depressed and very weak and i just dont know what to do anymore...

There's very little gastrointestinal food in terms of flavours in czech republic and he started to refuse all of them, he does not like broth (which i was suggested to try), the pills have almost no effect, he hates dry food and still lick the walls and floor. The only thing he wants to eat is, for some reason, aluminium foil (which i ofcourse don't let him near to anymore).

At the top of this he almost sucked my personal savings (all the vet visits costed me like 2 month salaries already) and should be studying for finals. I don't know whether i can take a week more of this nightmare. Every time i go home i am scared i will find him dead on the floor. Our flat's like a prison now.

Do you guys have any suggestions how i can feed the poor guy or any tips upon why he would refuse to eat his food? 

He's still got the second teeth growing, but theres only two of them left and he does not look particularly sensitive when i try to touch them.

Thanks in advance for any tips.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Student loans vs savings and overall financial health,"Hi everyone- right now I just have a basic question. To start, I’m 38, married, and my family is *definitely* not financially healthy. 

I have practically zero emergency fund, about 65k in student loans, and two car notes totaling about 48k, and a mortgage. I also have zero credit card debt, i make sure to pay that off every month. 

I’m currently refinancing my house and between interest rate and PMI disappearing, I’m saving roughly 450 a month. My question is this: should I pay off my student loans while the interest is at 0 despite no emergency fund? The refinance will net me about 1400 at closing, plus the first month will be the waiting month, so there’s another typically 1450 I’ll save, and then Biden’s stimulus if it passes and tax returns all nets out to about 11k in cash in the next couple months. I read a few of the wiki pages, that advises I drop all loans to minimum payments until an emergency fund is built (right now I pay slightly more biweekly to average about $50 more than due in a month), but with My family’s monthly expenses and the amount I would be able to save, it will take me approximately 1.5 years to fully fund 3 months worth of expenses. 

Anyways, sorry for the ramble- what does the wisdom of this sub believe my best course of action to be?

I'm 25, and I've been working for a company for about a year and a half now as a custodian. Given, it's a no experience or skills needed job, with the job being show up and clean, go home as the basic roundabouts. I started at $9/hr

However since I've started, I've slowly been given more and more work to do, often called in to the day shift should anything happen, and am on speed dial for most of the teachers in case my Lead (Boss) is unavailable. During the summer, I was in charge of cleaning another building outside of my own, and had to pick up slack for a very lazy employee, who sat around and complained about being in pain all the time (they fired her AFTER all of those and only because a teacher called corporate about it). We ended up down to two workers, and lead included. My work load was increased to 66% compared to my original 33% on top of cleaning the entire other building as well.

We were unable to find a replacement for the person we removed, as people were making more on unemployment. The company then boosted the starting pay to $9.25 and we found someone. They gave me a *TWENTY FOUR CENT* raise, making just under the new hires. This infuriated me, but I stuck with it, believing that I would be evaluated to fix this mess up. That was in September.

Since then, I've expressed my distaste with my boss about the situation, and he told me to hold off until January (now) to ask for a raise so that we would get our budget in for the year.

Come to find out, they increased the starting pay again to $9.50, without giving myself a raise, making me fall now to .26c behind. At this point, I've been the go to man of doing things. I've stopped doing extra stuff (my boss not minding, given the situation) and stuck to doing what I was contracted to do when I first started (given the exception of stepping in for the Lead shift when needed). The new guy who started, is fed up saying he deserves a raise, despite not going the extra mile, let alone doing his job correctly in the first place. I've had to step in and do it for him. Sometimes it's a simple task, and others aren't so. On top of all this, they're asking me about my opinion on if we should fire him, and despite his terrible attitude etc, I have to tell them no, because that will increase my workload even further and infuriate me more, knowing I'm doing more than I'm being paid for. 

My meeting for this raise has been pushed back twice now, and in doing so I've upped my asking price from $11 to $13. While I understand I will not recieve that big of a raise, asking for $13 and negotiating to no less than $11 would probably be the smarter way to go.

At the end though, I'm debating if all this trouble is worth it, and if I do not get a raise, just quitting on the spot and working at a fast food restaurant the same day. I'm open to the idea of asking for another position that can pay that price range as well. I'm open to suggestions on the situation.",finance
personalfinance,Looking For Advice As a First Time Homebuyer,"I've been completely racking my brain and flip flopping over whether I'm making a solid decision to purchase a townhome right now.

btc,Borrow and spend,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

There is the ancient model of spend bch and replace bch.

The downside is that if bch goes up in the future say 10-100 X by 2025 you probably regret every single bch you spent. 

The solution for this problem is to borrow stable coins/fiat for 1 % annual interest rate from Celsius network (heck it is even lower if you pay your interest on their token). Then spend the fiat and of course replace bch as usual.

The community will also win if people do this because the market cap starts to rise. 

This is also exploiting the Gersham's law. You want to spend fiat and save in bch. Now fiat loans are almost free of charge, why not to exploit them instead of losing the growth potential of BCH?

Sure, there is the risk factor of liquidation, for this reason the loans have low LTVs. And when you replace the bch you always can add collateral to the loan if the situation escalates. 

Also, it is probably smart to repay the loan at some point when the market is over heated (which bch is not even remotely close). To repay the loan it is nice to spend 1-10% of of bch you would spend by the current method of ""spend and replace"".",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I’m 16 and need advice and on my taxes,"In turned 16 may 8, 2020, and at this point I was already basically out on my own. My mom kicked me out of her house in early March because her and I were fighting all the time but we are on good terms now, and I admit I was part of the problem.
Since she kicked me out I’ve had to do a lot to support myself in terms of getting myself to and from school, to and from a job, keeping up my grades, paying my bills, etc. (BY THE WAY INSURANCE IS SOOOO EXPENSIVE FOR A 16 YEAR OLD) I bought my first car for $800 with some money I had in savings and soon after, my girlfriends parents offered to let me stay at their house. I’m currently employed part time and still a full time student in high school (junior).

Long story short: I made about $7200 in earned income in 2020, and I had a total of $335 federal income taxes withheld and $335 state income taxes (Arkansas) withheld. About a week ago my step dad called me and asked if it’d be okay if they claimed me on their taxes. I don’t know completely what I should do and I need some advice. 
There’s 3 general options I’m considering right now. Option A, I claim myself as an Independent, get about $500 in tax refunds, and be done with it. Option B, I allow my step dad to claim me as a dependent, then I don’t file taxes and my stepdad pays me the amount of money I paid into federal and state taxes ($670)... or option C, my stepdad claims me and I file a tax return. 
If I have any other options please let me know, and if there’s anyone that can analyze my situation, I’ll answer any questions you have to ask, and you can tell me what you think is best for me.",finance

personalfinance,Should I buy my first condo now or wait to buy my parents condo at cost?,"Hi everyone,

So here's my situation. I am currently trying to buy my first property in the Greater Toronto Area. I am looking for a condo (1+1 with two bathrooms), preferably around 700 square feet. I've been saving up all my money to buy this property ever since I started working full-time around 3 years ago. I currently have a total of $145k saved, which was possible since I've been saving up by living with my parents my whole life, and with my girlfriend last year. 

For specifics, I make a base salary of $56k a year plus commission since I work in sales. I made around 94k last year (base + commission). When I approved for a pre-approval for a mortgage, the bank said that they could give me a principal amount of $445 000 with a 1.86% interest rate (giving me the option to look for a property that costs around $550k). This is assuming that I put a downpayment of $100 000 (I wanted to put down more but they advised to only do 100k given the closing costs and lawyer fees, etc). 

I've finally started condo hunting last week, and found a property that I like. It's a 1+1 and 2 bathrooms, and on the 6th floor. I really like how it looks, despite the fact that the view is just of another building and doesn't get a lot of sunshine (not a huge deal to me honestly, but can affect the re-sale value). It is listed for $535k, but the presentation date is this Friday, so there will likely be a bidding war on it. 

I told my parents that I am really considering putting an offer down since I like the property. 

They then suggest that I buy their pre-construction condo that will finally be ready by May of 2022 next year (construction was delayed due to covid and such). The benefit of this is that they are willing to sell it to me at the same cost they bought it for around 2-3 years ago ($600k) and the property has apparently already gone up in value of about $100k despite not being fully built yet. It is a 2 bedroom and 2 bathroom, and has a square footage of around 700. I have seen the floor plan, but never in person or any models since it has not been built yet. It is also on the 22nd floor so the view won't be of just another condo building in front of it. 

My question is, should I still try and take advantage of the condo market and interest rates in the Greater Toronto Area condo market right now? Or should I wait and buy my parents' condo off them at cost?

The benefits of buying my own condo now would be that I can finally move out this year and live on my own and finally invest my money that I've been saving in a property that I will also be living in. After living away from home last year for the first time with my girlfriend, it has made me appreciate living alone (her parents own a condo and they let us live there rent-free last year before selling it this year). I've been saving my money to invest in real estate for years. The con of this is that it will take longer for it to appreciate in value if I am buying it now. I will also be putting a lot more money towards this property since I am buying it off someone rather than at cost from my parents. 

The benefits of waiting until my parents' condo is built is that it has already gone up in value, so as soon as I have it in my possession there is already a return on investment. By the time it's finally built by May 2022, I can only imagine it will continue to go up in value. It will also likely be bigger than any condo that I buy any time soon since it is a two-bedroom. The con of this is that I have to keep living at home for another year and a half (at least, who knows if there are gonna be more delays) and I will be 29 in November and feel like I have been living at home long enough. 

So should I take advantage of the condo market now and buy one ASAP on my own? Or should I buy my parents' pre-construction condo that will be ready May 2022?",finance

stocks,Against Value Investing in 2021 – Why an intrinsic value of a stock does not matter when majority of other investors do not care about intrinsic value.,"Disclaimer: Logic outlined below only applies from March 2020 onwards until the eventual stock market crash. After the bear market hits, absolutely please revert back to value investing.


Value investing is hard work – it requires the investor to evaluate the intrinsic value of a stock by careful analysis of the financial statements, researching company’s present and planned future state and looking out for any political factors. You could easily spend 1 week just researching one stock to convince yourself that you are ready to invest say $10,000 into that company.

So it is understandable that most retail investors do not bother to do their due diligence before investing in a company. It ought be noted that sub 100 word posts on reddit with rocket emojis shilling another meme penny stock does not count as DD by any measure of the word diligence when you look it up on the dictionary – “careful and persistent work or effort”. 

If anything, doing your due diligence might harm your gains in this unprecedented bull market. A stock could go up 3 x times in that week it would take you to do your research and you would have missed the boat by then already.

So, what determines the value of a stock to begin with? Intrinsic value plays a part, however ultimately it is the investment community BELIEF in what the stock is worth. It does not matter if the intrinsic value of a stock calculated after careful research is $10. IF the investor community at large believe and are willing to pay $100 for this stock, the value of the stock will climb to $100.

An intelligent investor in 2021 should not waste their time doing their due diligence trying to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock, INSTEAD they should spend their time gauging the opinion of the general investor community to evaluate what they BELIEVE the stock could be worth.

Consider the following example. 

A value investor in Jan 2021 might ask themselves: should I invest in PLUG as a topical example. The company has never made a profit and is currently is in net debt. However due to their forward-looking technology, a reasonable investor might say a fair value is around $10 to $30.

Meanwhile at the same time, a rookie investor browsing reddit in Jan 2021 might ask themselves, should I invest in PLUG? They do some research on reddit and find the company is already up at $60, however with the company still having significant meme potential and the sustainable energy / EV boom currently ongoing, the reddit investor might say: this bull run will run for a while so there is no reason to say PLUG won’t reach $100 by end of the year. By that logic, investing into PLUG at $60 is very reasonable and intelligent, you could make a near 2 x return in a short time frame.

To sum up: being ignorant of the intrinsic value of a stock can be profitable just before the end of a bull run being propped up by artificial manipulation of interest rates by the federal reserve. If you want to make any serious profits in 2021, I’d suggest to give up any pre-conceived notions of value investing and ride the wave until it lasts instead of sitting on the side-lines.",finance

MachineLearning,[D] Time Series Anomaly Detection - What works best online/on edge?,"So I'm going to be working on a project where I have to find a ML solution to detecting anomalies in time series data. It would essentially be used for Predictive Maintenance, where data from sensors like cameras would be processed and then continually fed to the model/network. There are of course many ways to do this, as there always are. Ideally this should be able to run on the edge, which means no cloud computing. This limits the possible solutions to not relying on any heavy deep learning.

What do you think would be the best approach for this? I've searched around the web (and am still doing so). One suggested approach was to train a model using deep learning anyway, and to then try a transfer learning approach when the model would be deployed for a new system/machine. This would then mean that there would be less training on the edge itself. I'm worried such an approach would lead to the model being less adaptable once deployed (after the transfer, so to speak).

Additionally the model would be used ""live"" or online as it were, and no ""look-ahead"" in the time series would be allowed for appropriately determining if the system is experiencing an anomaly.

I did also find Numenta's Nupic (Using something called HTM that I haven't had time to dig deeply into just yet), but I've seen some skepticism on the sub when it comes to this (or perhaps it's Numenta in general?), although I've yet to find a post that goes into detail about it. If you know more on the topic that would also be helpful.

What do you think would be the best method to accomplish this?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: When it comes to the sensor data that will be used for the model, it is yet to be seen if new data can be collected for the project. It's a bit tougher to collect or get companies to part with data now with GDPR (I'm in Europe). That said, I have been informed that in case there is no new data that the project can be demo'd with some data like the one here:

[https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data](https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data)

That is, scalar data over time. The sensor in question could be measuring something like the temperature of the machine, or perhaps rotational speed. It would depend on on the machine in question, while the ideal solution would be somewhat general (i.e., be able to be deployed for different sensors as long as the data can be transformed to be similar). Essentially, then, the data is relatively light. We are not talking Gigabytes per second or something like that. I would say that a few readings per minute would be more realistic, and perhaps even less dense than that if it turns out it can be made so without losing too much on accuracy.",technology
CryptoCurrency,Noob/ELI5 guide to Ethereum,"So you've heard about Bitcoin and you understand thats its peer to peer money. You can send me some and i can send you some. Simple and easy.

But if you're new you're probably wondering what people mean when they say Ethereum is the world computer. You might go to a website like [Uniswap.io](https://Uniswap.io) and think ""Whats the big deal? Bitcoin is also on exchanges.""

The difference is, Uniswap runs on the Ethereum network. Which means theres no server holding a database or making trades for you. Uniswap is just an interface which makes assessing it easier, the same as how a bitcoin wallet makes sending bitcoin easier than using a terminal. The entire back end of uniswap is running on all the Ethereum nodes. Uniswap's website could be shut down tomorrow and everyone would still be able to use it. Even the creator can not shut it down because he would need to convince everyone running an Ethereum node to delete it. Similar to how Bitcoin can't be shut down by its creator. An important benefit is Uniswap the dapp can't freeze your account, ask for documents to prove your identity or limit how much you can trade. It's a self driving exchange.

Uniswap isn't the only dapp running on Ethereum, anyone can write some code and deploy it to the network. We have dapps like synthetix which allow you to trade real world assets with infinite liquidity. This means you can buy $2,000,000 worth of an asset without any slippage in price, it also means anyone from anywhere in the world will soon able to invest in US companies (TSLA, AAPL aren't on synthetix yet but are coming soon). This is powerful and something people in restricted countries have wanted to do for a long time.

Theres thouands of assets on Ethereum which can be stored in your Eth wallet. An interesting one is decentralised stablecoins like Dai which are pegged to the price of the dollar algorithmically. These stablecoins can be used to pay anyone from anywhere in the world.  You can also earn interest on these dollars by using a decentralised savings account like [Aave.com](https://Aave.com) . These dapps earn you interest by taking your stablecoins and lending them out to borrowers while charging them an interest rate (I wont go into how these dapps ensure the borrower repays the loan because im trying to keep things ELI5).

I've barely scratched the surface of all the dapps Ethereum has but felt the need to make this post because I remember getting into crypto and not have a clue what Ethereum was or did besides using it to send to Binance because it was quicker than using bitcoin.

Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola &amp; GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven’t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky3nxo/amazon_stock_price_target_prediction_analysis_dcf/).

So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix &amp; Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil &amp; Gas Industry.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.

Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.

We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care &amp; Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.

On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won’t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.

Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.

We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.

Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.

This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.

We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn’t go through.

Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.

Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.

The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.

Biden’s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state &amp; local governments worth $350B &amp; $50B in small business grants and loans. 

This will probably serve as a starting point and I don’t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It’s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state &amp; local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.

And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don’t have a good fundamental basis.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden’s pick Janet Yellen’s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

personalfinance,Dealing with debt collectors on my final debt,"The last debt I owe to debt collectors

Hello, to summarize this is my situation: Had an amazing credit score and opened up multiple credit card accounts ( about 6) which all got maxed out and ended up in collections. My CS fell to the floor. Was able to negotiate a settlement with 5 of those, and I am finally on my last debt.

 It’s from a Walmart Credit Card. The balance on it is $11,681.61, per the letter of debt validation i asked for, the actual debt is $9,937.14 and the interest charge is $1,744.47, so together it makes the 11k. 

Unfortunately, I have lost my job due to covid and was laid off. I have no steady income. I have $4,000 saved up in my bank account that I want to try to settle the debt with. I’ve talked to these people before and they wanted to settle around the $6-7k mark which is way too much for me. But that was before I got the letter of debt validation (which by the way, is not a very detailed letter, just has the $9.9k amount listed from the credit card plus the $1.7k interest rate). 

I was wondering if any of you have some advice on what I can do to negotiate this with the debt collector. Ive seen previous threads with negotiation scripts, but I wanted help for this specific scenario. Is there a way to tell them to not charge me the interest and just negotiate solely off the $9.9k balance so that I can just settle for half of that $9.9k amount? Apparently my account is in the “Dispute” status because I asked for the letter of debt validation. Any tips would be amazing. Thank you. I am located in Florida. However, the credit card has a Georgia address from where I used to live.",finance
personalfinance,How much wiggle room does a mortgage lender have on the interest rate or closing costs when competing with other lenders? (Bouncing several companies off each other for rates.),"So...I feel like with credit scores that are 795-802 depending on the reporting agency, most of these 30 year refi quotes I am getting on a 189,000 remaining mortgage at 3.0 or 2.975 should be able to be beaten by a company saying something like ""we will do the deal for 2.5"" or some other lower interest rate.   

Am I wrong or approaching this the wrong way?  Do they not have as much wiggle room as want to believe?  I understand rates are set by the government then they make their margin on top of that, *but I guess I don't understand if they are just beating a competitor by a bit because that's all they can do, or if they are able to offer ore discounts now but are NOT doing it because I haven't' played hardball.*

It was a self-employed return since in addition to my regular hourly job, I was doing ridesharing and a couple other gigs, and I racked up a ton of mileage, which I tracked with MileIQ. As far as I know, there were no issues with my tax filing, and I was expecting to get almost $1,300 back in total. I have never received that deposit from either federal or state taxes. 

I've tried almost a dozen times to call the IRS on days when I'm not expecting client calls, but every time I've called, I get a message that says "" We are experiencing higher call volumes than normal and cannot handle your call. Please call again on another business day."" I am at the limit of my knowledge and ability to google things. I cannot find anyone online who has had a tax return delayed this long. 

Additionally, I started my own business in 2020 as a result of covid, and if there are tax issues, that could be trouble. I really enjoy what I'm doing to make a living right now, and I don't want taxes to change that. 

Will this affect me when I file my 2020 taxes? What could have caused this delay? How the fuck do I get ahold of the IRS so they can talk to me about this?

personalfinance,Does it make sense to re-refinance student loans?,"Hey everybody,

First off thanks for all of the free advice I've gotten from this subreddit over the years. Background about me for context:

* 23M (almost 24), legally married to fiancee (23F, almost 24). Living on East Coast outside of a major city
* Graduated May 2019 with BS in Chemical Engineering; I'm deemed essential and part of a small engineering team so my job is stable. Salary w/o bonus is $67k pre-tax and retirement, expected to go up in March
* Currently doing 6% ROTH 401k for company match of 3.5% traditional
* Fiancee is currently in grad school, set to graduate May 2022. We'll likely move afterwards, and once she gets a job, combined income should be upwards of 170-180k pre-tax.
* Credit score is 759 trending upward. Revolving credit util is 5%, credit limit is almost 11k, paid off in full every month and never have had any problems with credit card spending habits. 0 new credit inquiries within the past 12 months, I think about 4 in the past 24 months.
* Emergency/wedding fund has about 15k in an Ally Online Savings acct, other cash across both of us is about 5k in normal checking accounts
* Student Debt for me is just shy of 74k private at 5.18%. Also have about 20k in federal loans but those are just sitting there right now thanks to COVID. I've never had any problems paying minimum payments on loans. Fiancee's student debt post grad-school will be about 70k in federal loans, but we're trying to keep that number as low as possible.
* And finally, big purchases in the near-ish future include Moving costs post grad-school, Wedding in May 2023, and house down payment ASAP. 

Our current strategy is to continue making minimum payments on student loans while continuing to save for our portion of wedding costs, moving costs, etc. I know this isn't the most 'optimized' way of doing things, but since we'll need cash on hand quickly in the span of a year or so for the wedding and moving, we feel better knowing we are starting to save for it now. The current plan is that as soon as my fiancee graduates, her income goes primarily towards paying off the student debts as fast as possible while my salary pays bills, saves steadily, etc.

Last January I refinanced my private student loans to their current rate of 5.18% (from 6.49%) on a 20yr repayment plan. Again, not intending on getting anywhere near that 20yr mark so this seemed like an absolute win to me. I thought rates were low then, but now that COVID has hit and the market is wacky, it seems like rates are even lower. Despite refinancing last year, is there anything stopping me from refinancing again with a different company offering a better rate? My credit score is higher, income is higher, and principal is lower, so I don't see why someone wouldn't lend to me. 

Am I missing any negative repercussions of this? I don't hear of people refinancing frequently and I'm worried there's a good reason why that I just haven't heard about yet.

Thanks in advance for any input!

TL;DR: I refinanced student loans last year. Since then, my credit score has gone up and principal has gone down. What's stopping me from just refinancing again to reduce minimum monthly payment amounts?",finance

(I'd also like to preface this post by acknowledging my good fortune and frankly, privilege, in that I'm able to consider buying a home in the future despite the mess we're in.) I want to own my own home ASAP, but not at the expense of saving for retirement (I have ~$11k in retirement savings between my 401(k) &amp; Roth IRA). Right now, I'm planning to cover the down payment by myself.

I currently have about $2k saved toward a down payment on a home, which lives in a savings account that earns .6% interest. I contribute 15% of my income to my company's 401(k) plan (exceeding the 8% I need to contribute to get the full company match) and 10% to max out my Roth IRA. (I have enough emergency savings to cover 6+ months of expenses.) I currently put away ~$1k per month into my house savings.

My questions for you: (1) Should I reduce my 401(k) contribution and prioritize my house savings? And (2), should I keep my house savings in my savings account, or transfer them to a taxable brokerage account (in hopes of getting a better interest rate)?",finance

MachineLearning,[D] Anomaly Detection for Quality Assurance,"Hi everyone,

I work at a financial services company and am responsible for the release of model output data to our clients and the quality assurance thereof, particular on the DS side of things. A key part of our process is comparing the data our models have generated for publicly traded companies for consecutive quarters, and in particular identifying if there is any significant change in the distribution of the model outputs or large amounts of outliers between quarters for said outputs.

Currently, our process investigating the output data involves a great deal of data visualization, and displaying tables showing outliers in terms of quarter-on-quarter change for particular output metrics. However, in many cases, large changes in outputs can often be explained by other factors in the dataset (such as a noted change in methodology from a data vendor, or a substantial increase in revenue for a particular company, all of which are also part of the dataset being QA'd). As such, I was wondering if people could point me in the direction of an anomaly detection approach which (ideally) learns in an unsupervised manner, but doesn't attempt to find anomalies with respect to all features in the dataset, instead looking for anomalies in individual features which cannot be explained by changes in the remaining features of the dataset. I have looked into some anomaly detection techniques, but for the most part it seems that they look for outliers across all features, which does not fit my use case, as we are particularly interested in observing whether there are bugs in our modelling code causing undues shifts in the output values our models generate.

I imagine a supervised way of solving this problem would be to build a regression model that is trained to predict the values of certain output metrics given the input data, and then identifying outliers by taking the delta of the predicted and real values. However, due to the changing nature of the inputs and outputs of our models, and the number of models we develop, I would prefer to use an unsupervised approach if possible.

**TLDR: Do you know of any anomaly detection approaches which consider the totality of the high-dimensional data fed into them, but exclusively look for anomalies on the basis of idiosyncratic values in individual features?**

Thanks in advance!",technology
personalfinance,Paying student loans and still having an okay savings account.,"Hi guys
So I’m done college right now, and cause of the pandemic, i haven’t had to pay my student loans back. But I’m realizing this is probably the time to pay it back cause there isn’t a interest rate. 
I just got a new job back in September which pays me more money then my previous job working at a pizza shop did. So i started building my savings account more because 1. It sucked ass for a while. 2. I’m 25 and feel like i should have a decent savings account. And 3. I was really building it for travel purposes but whatever. 
I have a new car and I’m on my own insurance, those are my two main bills i have right now, and eventually it’ll be my student loans. I pay around 400 dollars a month for my car and insurance all together. And my student loans are around 14k. I was thinking of basically knocking off 1k each month to pay it off quickly. 
Eventually i want to go back to school and get my master, but I’m thinking of going back the end of this year, beginning of next year. And i know I’ll be right back into debt. So i wanted to at least get some of it down before i did..
Can you guys give me some advice? Idk how to go about this, still have a decent savings account and pay off my loan quickly.

Over the past 6 months I have been able to pay down the principle because of the freeze of interest on Federal Student Loans with whatever is left over at the end of the month. My question is: Should I pay off the last of this loan using my emergency fund before the interest freeze is lifted on January 31st? Or should I wait until next week to see if the freeze is extended further?

Other student loans:
$5,500 at 3.76%
$6,500 at 4.45%

I planned to make minimum payments on the 3.76% loan to help build credit, and may pay more than minimum on the 4.45% loan. I am also waiting to see if the $10k student loan forgiveness talks will come to fruition.

Other Info:
Average Monthly Expenses: $875

I live at home with my parents, and do not foresee me moving out for at least 6 months. I currently max out my retirement contributions and contribute $500 each month to my emergency fund. I do not have a car payment. I work primarily remote, so if my car breaks down it is not an immediate issue. I pay my credit card off in full each month.

personalfinance,Need advice on Home Refi,"Bought home in Feb 2018 on a 30-year fixed via Quicken:

* Original Loan Balance - $355,500
* Current Loan Rate is 3.99%
* Current Principal Balance - $330,025

Working with a mortgage broker via my financial advisor, he's thrown me the following 30-year:

* Loan Amount - $340,000
* Interest Rate - 2.875%
* APR or costs over the loan expressed as a rate: 2.917%
* Estimated Closing Costs - $8,946
* Monthly Savings: $381

My current Equifax score is 802.

Reading through some of the posts here as far back as nearly a year and I see even back folks were getting rates slightly better than what I noted above.  I was assuming I'd be doing better or the same at this time, but maybe this reflects our individual characteristics, specific timing, etc.

Nonetheless, I'd appreciate some feedback on the proposed package I have right now.  The monthly savings is attractive, though I was hoping for something more than $400, but that's based on nothing more than a want.",finance

solar,Experience with Posigen/Solar Leases?,"Would appreciate honest feedback on this lease question. I have seen a number of questions about solar leases on this sub and my gut feeling about them is, don't do it. 

However, I've found a great house in the NE US with a solar lease through Posigen and I'm questioning what I should do going forward (taking it on or paying to remove the system and putting my own on the home and theoretically getting state/federal incentives). As it is a seller's market, I'm guessing the owner won't pay a dime extra to get it removed.

Would love any feedback on the below. I'm comfortable to take it on financially but there are pieces I'm not so sure about and also not sure it would give me the best bang for my buck.

Posigen Lease Breakdown
-240 monthly payments of $99.99each
-The total monthly payments is $23,997.60.

8.4 kW Kilowatt Photovoltaic Solar System
Main System Components:
- (30) PV Modules: Silfab SLA280P or industry equivalent 
- (30) P300 SolarEdge Power Optimizers 
- (1) Inverter: SolarEdge SE7600A-UA-U or industry equivalent

I'm fairly certain that this lease was opened with basically zero down due to the current owner not having the cash upfront. Posigen to my knowledge works with lower income folks. I also don't know if they're sketchy or not since I've also seen mixed reviews online though they do have a BBB rating of A+. They did work with CT Green Bank who I know has a good reputation.

I'm really not handy at all so having another company maintain the system seems like definitely a plus to me... however I'm guessing the answer from you all would likely be to get it removed. This would cost $1800.

Would a possibility be to install a battery to grab even more generation? I also unfortunately don't know yearly electric costs for the current owner but I think mine would be far less since they apparently run PCs constantly...Thanks so much 😊",energy

personalfinance,Income Tax with an Immigrant Wife,"So I have been back and forth on this for a few weeks now and I would like help in deciding. In late 2020, I got married to the love of my life, who just so happened to be to in the USA on a tourist visa at the time. We are currently going through the process of applying for permanent residence, a green card, and a social security number.

After a ton of research and after speaking with a representative from the IRS, I have determined that because she does not have a SSN or an ITIN, I will need to file my 2020 taxes as ""Married Filing Separately"", and then refile, changing the filing status to ""Married Filing Jointly"" once we receive her SSN.

My question is, do I continue to have more taxes taken out of my paycheck as ""single"" until the SSN is assigned, or do I have taxes taken out as ""married"" (decreasing the federal tax rate between an income of about $40k and $80k) and risk the SSN not being assigned before 2021? If I keep my income taxes as ""single"" for now, i have less money in my paycheck, but if i have less taxes taken out as ""married"" and the SSN isn't assigned in time, I could owe thousands of dollars when filing 2021 taxes.

In the end, it should all even out. I just hate giving the government a free loan but I would also hate to possibly owe them money until I am able to refile.

PS: The SSN could take 8-12 months to be assigned (pre-COVID average), and she isn't eligible for an ITIN because she is eligible for a SSN",finance

personalfinance,Early 30s single-income w/ wife and kid looking to buy housing in HCOL (SoCal). Need perspective.,"Need perspective from the good people on this sub to help me make the right decision. 

Please note that I am in a HCOL area where the rents for 3 bedrooms in desirable areas are around $3k and often more. The median house price (3b/+2b) in LA county and Orange County are around $700k - $800k.

Townhomes, condos are around $100 - $150k cheaper than a single-detached but then there’s HOA which brings the monthly cost to about the same. For instance a \~600k condo with a \~$300-400 HOA is $100-$200 less expensive than a single detached at $750,000.

Income:

Gross: \~150k Base + (25% bonus $30,000) = $180,000. Note, Bonuses are discretionary but I have been receiving a bonus every year that is close to the 20%. Last year base was 144,000 and by bonus was 18%. So total gross was $170,000. I don’t really use the bonus in my calcs to remain conservative.

Last year monthly numbers (does not include bonus):

Net monthly take home first 5 months (includes 401k 20% contributions) : $6,880

Net monthly take home last 7 months : $8800

Current Expenses:

$2250/month rent that’s month to month and hans’t been raised in 2 years. It includes utilities. 1700 sqft

$2500/month - Everything else (groceries, utilities, gas, entertainments etc.)

No car payments. Own one care.

No loans.

Assets

$150,000 cash (Saved up for downpayment)

$100,000 equities (non-retirement)

$280,000 retirement (401k,roth ira, trad ira)

House purchase assumptions.

Note: using higher-end of the house budget (which I think might still not be competitive)

$750k @ 20% down @ 2.7% ( $3300/month (insurance + prop taxes) + \~$200 (utilities etc) = $3,500

Savings after housing and securing expenses:

First 5 months:

6880 - 3,500 = $3,380 (take home after mortgage and utilities)

3380- 2500 (recurring monthly expenses) = $880 (savings/month)

$880 x 5 = $4,400 can potentially be saved first 5 months.

Last 7 months:

8880 - 3,500= $5,300 (take home after mortgage and utilities)

$5,486 - 2500 = $2,800 savings/month)

$2,800 x 7 = $19,600 can potentially be saved last 7 months.

The total savings for the year after all expenses including 401k contributions is:

$19,600 + $5330 = 24,000

Additional after tax retirement contributions:

$6,000 (my roth) + $6,000 (wife’s roth) = $12,000

$24,000 - $12,000 = $12,000

The discretionary savings after ALL retirement contributions is:

$12,000

If we include the Net Annual Bonus = \~$10,000 (it ends up being more as I get money back from my taxes but this is to stay conservative)

Then discretionary savings = 12,000+10,000 = $22,000

My thoughts and concerns

&amp;#x200B;

1. Based on the math it seems like I can make this work but based on traditional personal finance rules the house is more than 3x my base pay at 5x my income. 5x seems crazy to me but after working out the math at current interest rates it doesn’t seem as bad.
2. My housing cost does go from 2250 to 3500, an increase of $1250. Which again psychology makes me uncomfortable but when I do look at my non principle costs of the 3500 which is 743 (prop taxes) +137 (Home insurance) + 1215 (half of the principle and interest payment) is $2095 is works out slightly less than my rent. With an additional avg $100-$200/month on maintenance it’s probably even. However, with ownership I lock in these costs for 30 years. I can’t predict my rental costs over time. I know right now for la county I am paying below market for a 1700 sqft townhouse. This could easily be \~$1000 higher.
3. The NYT Buy vs rent calculator does tell me that based on my 750k mortgage numbers I’m only better off renting if I can rent a similar space for less than $2412. This is based on assumptions of a 3% Realestate return, 7 occupancy (us average), 5% investment return (if money was invested in index funds). Kept all the other defaults the same. So, it seems like I’m better off now as I would be buying properties of a similar size BUT as I sate in point #2, I can’t guarantee this price and if I have to rent elsewhere I will likely have to rent similar property for more than $2400.
4. Property values appear to be at peak. This is probably in part due to low rates plus a myriad of other factors. I can’t help but think this has to pop because wages haven’t kept up. On the other hand people have been saying this for a number of years to no avail. I know it’s futile trying to speculate but it’s hard not to do given it’s going to cost me so much in capital
5. At a price point of $750k the downpayment I had set aside ($150k) won’t be enough to cover closing costs. So I have to tap into my brokerage to pull out \~$20k. Something I really don’t like doing as I have never touched my investments for any expenses.
6. Because the downpayment and closing costs use up all my cash, my brokerage ($100k) becomes my emergency fund at least until I build up a 6 month Emergency fund which is around $36k. This would take close to 2 years if I don’t change any of my retirement contributions. Sooner if I do. I am leaning to not changing any of my contributions and taking the risk to tap into my brokerage if need be.
7. I understand in a 2008 scenario I could run into the scenario of losing income AND my investments going down 50% and then being forced to use those investments to make the mortgage payments therefore realizing the losses. This is an extreme scenario and would suck but it could happen esp. if I haven’t built enough emergency cash reserves in time ( within 2 years). But even if my brokerage is down to 50k I should be able to sustain a year or more of expenses before wiping it out. I wouldn’t have to tap into retirement accounts.
8. A more optimistic outlook is that my income should grow overtime at the very least due to inflation which bring the mortgage payment to a smaller amount of my income. I’m in my early 30s so I think my prime earning years are likely ahead of me.
9. Even more optimistic outlook - my wife started a business last year that has very low overhead which netted \~15k in profit in 2020. I haven’t accounted for any of that in the calculations above but based on projections she should beat that number this year.
10. The 150k deposit money just sitting in cash not earning anything is also giving me anxiety as I feel like im leaving money on the table. I need to put it to work. If I don’t end up buying the house I would put it into the market but if there is a crash it would derail my house buying plans for a while.
11. Rates in the 2-3% range can change and then I can afford less so I feel pressure to act fast like time is running out. I hate making decisions from a place of fear.
12. Some people might say you can buy houses below 600k if Im willing to move into the inland empire. Although true, I think it’s not a good hedge if I need to look for other opportunities (work in tech). So I need to be reasonably close to hubs (&lt;40min) like LA proper, Irvine etc. 

Writing this out has been a helpful exercise in itself. But I would appreciate any feedback. I really need some perspective esp. from others who live in hcol areas like I do with similar circumstances to me. It’s scary putting this much money down in one go and then choosing higher housing payments esp in a all-time high housing market.

personalfinance,"24, Budgeting / Investing Advice regarding 403b and 401a","Hello all,

First thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I want to prefix this by stating I have done some research on these topic with the helpful guides on [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/) and from googling but I seem to have hit a wall when it comes to the logistics of things. I understand nothing here should be taken as financial advice I am just looking for some clarity since I am pretty lost on where to continue in my goal to financial freedom.

I am 24, currently living with my parents. I Have a Masters Degree in Data Science, a Bachelors in Computer Science and work for a non profit as a Programmer.

My finances are as follows:

65k Salary

20k in Checking Account

School loans: $23,324 (federal)

Car Loan: $9,596

**Total Debt: $32,920**

I am making aggressive payments towards my student loans and car payment

I have 3 Credit Cards (Discover, Amazon, Best buy) and never carry a balance over to the next month

**Investments:**

Acorns: $1,291 (Invest) $10 weekly and $1,704 (Later) $25 weekly as a way to get started investing in college.

Robinhood: $1430 (I just mess around with swing trades nothing crazy)

Fidelity ( through Company ):

403b: $3,402.50 - Company will match 50% on the dollar for the first 6% that I contribute

401a: $567.11 - 3% Mandatory by me and then 3% contributed by employer.

I currently have 6% contributed in the 403b and 6% in the 401a.

This is where my questions come in.

1. Since a 403b can have $19,500 contributed annually and the 401a can have $58,000 contributed annually would it be more beneficial to invest in the 403b / 401a or would it make more sense to open and max out a Roth IRA at 6k?
2. Would it make more sense to move the money in acorns over to the 403b / 401a?
3. Should I be investing more in the 403b or 401a?

Eventually I would like to move out and get an apartment over the summer. I'm thinking of allocating $1500 in rent with all things considered what would be the next step in my life financially?

Thank you again for taking the time and giving thoughtful feedback I appreciate it immensely.

personalfinance,"My taxes are more complicated than usual this year, just some (probably basic) questions","(Sorry for the weird formatting, I posted on mobile originally. Should be better now.) 

My taxes have always been pretty simple -  single, one W2, some student loan interest, free file software prompts me through everything, easy. Federal only, no state income tax.

This year my taxes are looking to be more complicated, I think. I just want to double check some probably basic things. Probably the kinds of questions I’d just run by my parents, but they’ve never been much for financial advice so.. here I am. 

For 2020, I should have W2’s from two workplaces plus I collected unemployment for about half the year when covid closed my workplace (taxes were taken out of my disbursements). I paid interest on student loans, and paid off two of them. I started grad school in September so also paid tuition. 

I got married in September, so we will be filing jointly for the first time. He should have one W2, I think things on his end are relatively simple. 

So, my questions:

- If we’re filing jointly, do we both need to file and those returns are just “linked” in some way or can I file one return for both of us?

- Our combined income is &gt;$72k, mine individually is below. Can I use the free file software to file a joint return, or no? (So is that based off of joint or individual income?)
- If my husband has been contributing to a retirement account through his workplace, is that information on his W2 or is there a separate form that I need to find? 
- Would it be worth paying for software this year, or are the free file forms for above the income threshold easy enough? It says there is some basic math involved, which I can handle. I like the idea of being walked through it to ensure I’m not missing anything though..",finance

personalfinance,Is cash-out refi a no-brainer with current rates?,"My wife and I are 37.  Our current mortgage has 13 years left, we owe $240,000 on a property worth around $435,000.  Our current rate is 3.875%.

We are interested in buying a couple of investment properties that would cost $100k out of pocket.  We have $300k in savings/market currently so we have the money, but obviously the market is on fire right now with bond returns so low.

We were quoted on a cash-out refi on our house using the equity we have, which refinancing for 80% of the home value of $348,000 would net us about $108k in cash with a new rate of 2.875%.  This would be a 30 year mortgage so our monthly payment would be about the same as it is now (13 years left on a 15 year note).

My basic premise is leaving the 100k we have in equities would likely return well over the 2.875% it would cost to borrow the 100k to put towards the investment real estate.  My wife's hangup is she likes the idea of having equity in the house in case we decide to move so we could use that equity on the down payment of a new home (my rebuttal is that in the unlikely scenario we decide to move we can pull cash out of our equities THEN, instead of doing it now for a move that may never happen or may not happen for many years).  She also likes the idea of having the house paid off at age 50 if we stay put (my rebuttal is income properties earned between now and then will more than makeup for still having a mortage).

It seems to me like pulling that 100k out at 2.875% (while also dropping the interest rate on the $240k we currently owe by a full point) and keeping the 100k we want to spend in the equities market would be a prudent move.  What says reddit?",finance

stocks,Biden will move to implement his $2 trillion climate plan on day 1 to bolster the economy and kick off the new administration's fight against climate change,"Climate change is at the top of President-elect Joe Biden's funding agenda once he assumes office on Wednesday, as the new administration looks to add jobs to the economy while combating the warming climate.

In his $1.7 trillion climate proposal, Biden plans on reversing many of President Donald Trump's actions that relate to the climate on his first day in office, such as **rejoining the Paris Agreement, ending the Keystone XL pipeline, and establishing rules that limit methane emissions from oil and gas drilling operations. The proposals are also intended to boost the still-struggling economy, and by confronting climate change, 10 million clean energy jobs could be created if the proposal is successful.**

""If executed strategically, our response to climate change can create more than 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class enjoyed by communities across the country, not just in cities along the coasts,"" Biden's website states. 

The climate was also high up on the agenda during the confirmation hearing of Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen on Tuesday. **Yellen told lawmakers that Biden's infrastructure plan will involve investing in clean technology, renewable energy, promoting electric vehicle usage, and creating jobs.**

**""Climate change is a critical problem facing the country, and President-elect Biden is committed to a wide range of policies to address it,"" Yellen said at the hearing. ""And in the process, making sure that in doing that we create good jobs for American workers.""**

**Yellen also said that Biden is in ""full support"" of restoring full incentives for electric vehicles, along with ensuring workers have the skills to succeed in the electric vehicle industry.**

Democratic lawmakers support federal spending for combating climate change. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in Yellen's hearing that he hopes to advance a bill that will prioritize clean energy, clean transportation and energy conservation - efforts that address the ""existential threat"" of the warming climate.

Given the partisan nature of climate proposals over recent years, whether Biden can carry out costly climate initiatives is uncertain, but Yellen remains clear that it will be a priority, and will benefit the economy through job creation.",finance

personalfinance,Just secured my first full time job out of college! How do I strategically save for the future? (AGE:23),"Hello r/personalfinance!

I'm a 23y/o &amp; I just started my full time position at the company that I've been working at since the summer. This is my first full time job and I realize I'm at the pinnacle of saving for my future. I'm fresh out of college and with that comes some debt. I was wondering if you kind, intelligent people can help me to strategize for my financial future. 

**DEBT:**

To start, I've accrued about **$17,000** worth of student loan debt out of university. I've refinanced my student loan for a 15 year period with an interest rate of 4.170%. This makes my monthly payment just under **$130**. 

I have about **$772** worth of CC debt in (2) CC's that I know I need to pay off. Not necessarily worth noting but doing so because I need someone to tell me that I'm dumb for not paying them off. 

I'm also preparing to purchase the vehicle that I've been leasing for the past (3) years. I think it's important to note that my parents have been graciously paying for the lease. They also have offered to put a $4,000 downpayment initially when I purchase. (My parents are generous beyond words). I've looked into what a reasonable car loan would be and I've come up with this data. 

Estimated Value: $10,000

Down Payment: $4,000

Interest Rate: 5%

Sales Rate: 5%

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Monthly Payment: **About $200**

Adding in monthly payments (Apartment, Food, Utilities etc.) I've calculated that my total monthly payments come out to about **$1,550.**

&amp;#x200B;

**INCOME:**

I'm currently working for a startup and it's taken me a while to secure a full-time position. I was being paid for 15/hrs a week at $25/hr. I'm now working full time with a cap at 40/hrs a week at $25/hr bringing my yearly income to $52,000. With taxes included, I can expect to be paid **$3,284/month**. Considering my monthly payments of $1,550, I can expect to save on average $1,734 per month.

&amp;#x200B;

**SAVINGS:** 

I currently have a little less than **$15,000** saved and readily available in my bank account. I also have a little in stocks. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

Starting to budget &amp; think about my future financially has been on my mind for some time. I've never bitten the bullet and really did the research until now. I'm curious to know if I'm on a good path and if I'm making any glaringly poor financial decisions that will affect me in the future. I have a couple of questions below that are my biggest worries going into this process. 

&amp;#x200B;

**MY QUESTIONS:**

* Does this savings plan make sense for my financial future? 
* What can I invest in monthly/yearly to ensure financial stability throughout my life and into retirement?
* Should I be doing anything different?
* Since my company does not currently offer any type of benefits, how do I start my 401k/other investments?
* Am I saving enough? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am totally open to any tips you may have. I'm totally new to this and **I want to make sure I make the smartest financial decisions for myself in the future**. If you've read this far, WOW YOU'RE THE BEST!",finance
personalfinance,Optimize Roth 401k,"Hello! I am a recent grad in the US. At 22, I am opening my first retirement account through my employer. I make 63k a year (not including overtime) and am planning on opting for the Roth 401k option over the traditional 401k. Due to about 60k in debt, my plan is to contribute 6% (the minimum to maximize my employer contribution of $0.50 per $1.00 up to 6%), and pay off debt.

Additionally, I am getting married at the end of May. My new spouse will be starting a 2.5 year grad program and thus not providing any income. She has around 20k in undergrad loans, I believe. Her program will be around 50k over the course of those few years, and we are going to try to minimize the loans we need to take out for that.

With that being said, my main question is this: Should I contribute to my Roth 401k starting now, with a federal marginal tax rate of 22% now and then it will drop to 12% once we are married and file jointly? (Remember she won’t be providing any significant income, so that won’t change for a few years). OR Do I contribute first to a 401k, and then once I am married begin contributing to the Roth 401k bucket? Maybe even roll the 401k over to the Roth 401k? With the first option am I unnecessarily being taxed, or does it matter since it is only 6 months and a little under 2k?

As debt is paid off, I would like to significantly increase my retirement contributions. In addition, I would like to open a Roth IRA to have more freedom in my investing. For the time being I was going to leave my Roth 401k set at the retirement age goal. Any suggestions on how I should make those accounts different?

If anyone can provide any insight into how I should start my retirement account, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Also, I have seen all the graphs and know in my head the value of early investing over a lifetime, but does it make sense to pay off my debt quicker or to contribute as much as I can handle? I am just getting on my feet (worked through college without any outside help except Uncle Sam in loans and so have basically no savings) and so would like to make sure I am still having some cash flowing in and savings cushion. After the wedding, my spouse will be bringing in roughly 20k in savings, ideally for her school. We will be moving to her grad school city (Midwest) and are on the fence between renting and purchasing a relatively small and inexpensive home. My bank has preapproved me for like $300k home, but we would definitely be looking for something more like 75-90k that is livable but we could make updates to over the next 3 years. With all of that other information I provided, does that seem irresponsible to take on more debt? Besides home equity, there are other personal value reasons we would like to own a home, so it seems worth it to me, but I’m unsure of the financial picture. As I am typing this paragraph, I realize I am asking more questions than the main post title. But it really all sums up to do I focus on dumping money into investment to help future self, or do I contribute just enough and then try to provide value to my current situation? 

Thanks in advance, and I apologize for a somewhat unorganized post. I might consider consulting a financial planner in the near future as well, but have gained a lot of insight from reading online and see how people really good advice on this sub.",finance

personalfinance,"Closing on a new build in May/June. Husband wasn’t paying attention and missed an annual fee on a card he wasn’t using. His credit tanked, and we need advice on what to do.","So, to give more context to the title: 

-In October my husband was charged a membership fee on a capital one card he never uses. He doesn’t monitor that account (something he’s learned now from this) and didn’t realize he was charged the membership fee until December when he got an alert that his credit score dropped significantly. He called Capital One and they agreed to remove the late charges, but told him he was SOL on getting the missed payment reports removed from the credit reporting. 

-My husbands score was in the 700s before this, and is now sitting at 640-650. 

-We went under contract for a new build in December, not having any idea that my husbands score was about to drop. Our lender that we are working with is helping us with the sign up for a down payment assistance program, but we both need to be at a 680 minimum for this program. 

-My husband sent in a goodwill letter to Capital One in late December detailing what had happened. They confirmed they just received it, and said they would have a decision within 30 days and would mail a letter after that which could take 7-10 business days for us to receive. So we would be looking at beginning of March.

We are freaking out because it doesn’t feel like we have enough time to raise his credit score to where it needs to be in the timeframe that we have left. The lender will re-run our credit 60 days before closing, which at the latest could be April 1. We need to figure out something that will raise his credit score by March to give 30 days for credit bureau reporting.

If anyone has any advice, it would be much appreciated. My husband has some debt on credit cards (5k) that he consolidated and has a low interest rate on for repayment. We could pay this off, but we were saving money to put towards the new home and previously didn’t need to use it as he was fine credit score wise.

investing,Debt buyers: why aren't they worth more?,"Idk if this a tangent or unrelated to this sub but me and my friends were talking about the idea of a ""fintech startup"" based off of buying credit card debt directly off of people and then offering them reasonable interest rates based off of some magic machine learning/big data model. I guess something along the lines of Lending Club. We even included blockchain as somewhat of a joke to get more VC funding.

So then I go down the rabbit hole of debt buyers. On Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt\_buyer\_(United\_States)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_buyer_(United_States))) there's trillions of dollars of credit card debt floating about, yet the debt buying industry is ""13.7 billion dollars "" (in 2017), which seems small for an entire industry like this.

Even the debt they own is minuscule compared to the total debt that most Americans own. I understand that they make their business mainly through buying the debt from banks of people the banks feel like are a ""lost cause"" and essentially just want a write off.

Encore Financial Group ([https://www.encorecapital.com/](https://www.encorecapital.com/)) one of the biggest of these entities  and is also publicly traded, yet it's revenues globally are around $1 billion dollars with a similar market cap. It's not like they lose money; they make a profit and, I know this is being based on Robinhood analysts ratings, is a strong buy. They have subsidiaries like Midland Credit Management ([https://www.midlandcredit.com/](https://www.midlandcredit.com/)) which offer services directly to individuals. Their stock is up 89% over the past 5 years, but over the past 3 months it's down 19%. They even have this message of social responsibility that would look great on any pitch deck ([https://www.encorecapital.com/social-responsibility-and-sustainability/](https://www.encorecapital.com/social-responsibility-and-sustainability/)).

Compare this to Stripe, another fintech company. I know they do something completely different (payment processing) , but their revenue is like 4 times that of Encore and is valued at like $35 billion (potentially). I realize it has to do with Stripe's genius idea of an integrated ecosystem and it's like comparing apples to oranges, but why is Stripe more-so of a household name than something like Midland that offers (on paper) an extremely appealing alternative to crippling debt or declaring personal bankruptcy?

I guess my question boils down to: why isn't the debt buying sector ""worth"" more to investors? Is it because of the lack of growth or potential growth? Thin returns? Big initial costs? Regulations? And is this space ripe for any possible disruption from startups?",finance

So the DDM assumes the present value of a stock should be priced by the future dividends. Then ***Question 1 is***, what interest rate should I use for reference, assuming I'm in US.  I know the growth rate in the formula is somewhat subjective, which I can try to infer based on previous performance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I was watching people doing analysis on stock price by calculating the intrinsic price of a company, using the projected future cash flow. In essence, he is taking the earning report to see the projected revenues and EBITDA, historical data to see the NFAT/EBITA and company growth rate, to derive a series of future EPS, and the sum of that EPS discounted to today, should be the value of the stock. 

***Question 2 is,*** I see by using different growth rate on can gauge the projected cash flow, but how do I use it to actually calculate the EPS discount? Is it similar to the DDM model where I use the calculated EPS divided by the (interest rate - my estimated growth rate)? 

**Question 3**, then, isn't DDM and this intrinsic value calculation the same? If not, what is the difference, which I should I use under what assumption?",finance

investing,Biden may tax dividends and double the tax on long-term capital gains,"[https://www.fa-mag.com/news/will-biden-tax-dividends--it-s-in-the-plan-59861.html](https://www.fa-mag.com/news/will-biden-tax-dividends--it-s-in-the-plan-59861.html)

=================

**JANUARY 19, 2021** **•** [**TRACEY LONGO**](https://www.fa-mag.com/author/2369/tracey_longo)

President-elect Joe Biden’s promise to tax the wealthy may include a tax on dividends, something made easier now that Democrats hold the House and the slimmest majority possible in the Senate.

The Biden administration has called for those making more than $1 million to pay the same rate on investment income that they do on their wages. Investment income includes dividends and capital gains.

But an earlier Biden plan for financing health-care initiatives indicates the new president will tax long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at the new top ordinary income tax rate of 39.6% on income above $1 million and eliminate the step-up in basis that allows decedents to pass capital gains to heirs without taxes.

That means the top rate on long-term capital gains would nearly double from 23.8% to 43.4%. Biden’s campaign cites a Joint Committee on Taxation report on tax expenditures which estimates that the special lower rate on capital gains and dividends reduces federal revenue by $127 billion each, according to Scott Eastman, a policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit.

The change would have a significant tax impact on wealthy investors. “We estimate the plan would increase the average tax rate on capital gains from 19.1% to 27.7%, and the marginal tax rate on capital gains from 22.4% to 33.4%,” Eastman said.

While the revenue estimate implies that the government loses a lot of revenue from the lower rate on capital gains, it is “highly unlikely” the federal government could get this much revenue from just raising the rate, Eastman cautioned. 

Research from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) shows that taxpayer capital gains realizations are very sensitive to taxation.

“This is because taxpayers can time when they want to realize their capital gains in order to minimize their tax bills,” Eastman said. “Specifically, the CBO and JCT estimate that the elasticity of realizations to the tax rate is -1.2 in the short run and -0.79 in the long run. Specifically, a 1% increase in the capital gains tax rate would result in a 0.79 to 1.2% drop in capital gains realizations.

“In practice, this means that proposals to significantly raise capital gains tax rates, with no other changes, can lose federal revenue,” he added. “Using CBO data on capital gains realizations and these elasticities, we estimate that raising the top rate to 43.4% could lose about $2 billion each year.”

Eastman said he arrived at that top rate by combining the 39.6% statutory rate plus the 3.8% net investment income tax.

However, Biden is not simply proposing to raise the top rate on capital gains. He also proposes eliminating step-up basis in capital gains. According to the JCT, not taxing gains at death results in an annual loss of about $40 billion.

Again, this is a tax expenditure estimate and not a revenue estimate, and the amount of revenue Biden’s proposal would ultimately raise would depend on how he structures the elimination of the step-up in basis, Eastman said.

Biden “could require heirs to take on the decedent’s basis when they receive an asset, known as carryover basis, but still allow heirs to defer realization of that inherited asset’s capital gain,” Eastman said. “This would raise much less than making death a taxable event—and even then, proposals to tax capital gains at death can have many exemptions.”

It is also important to note how the two proposals interact. “Since Biden is raising the tax rate on capital gains, the value of the tax expenditure for step-up in basis will mechanically increase. This is because the rate at which these gains would otherwise be taxed at would be higher,” Eastman said.

In addition, eliminating step-up in basis at death reduces a taxpayers’ incentive to defer realizing gains. Part of the reason why there is such a strong incentive to defer the tax on capital gains is that if an individual defers long enough, the tax on the asset will eventually be forgiven, Eastman said.

Without step-up in basis, a taxpayer has a greater incentive to realize the gain during their lifetime. As such, eliminating step-up in basis can indirectly boost revenue from capital gains.

While the plan will raise additional federal revenue in a progressive manner, it isn’t costless. Raising taxes on capital gains would reduce the incentive to save by reducing the after-tax return to saving.

“Lower domestic saving leads to lower income for Americans in the future and can lead to lower output by reducing domestic investment,” Eastman said. “In addition, there are administrative, structural and transition issues that Biden needs to consider if he ultimately eliminates step-up in basis,”

While it is premature to make predictions about what Biden and his Democratic-majority Congress will do, Biden has stated plainly that he wants to raise tax revenues by $3.3 trillion over the next decade.

“On a conventional basis, the Biden tax plan by 2030 would lead to about 7.7% less after-tax income for the top 1% of taxpayers and about a 1.9% decline in after-tax income for all taxpayers on average,” according to Tax Foundation analysis.

In addition to the potential new tax rates for those earning $1 million or more, Biden’s plan also seeks to impose a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax on income earned above $400,000, evenly split between employers and employees. This would create a “donut hole” in the current Social Security payroll tax, where wages between $137,700, the current wage cap, and $400,000 are not taxed.

Taxable income for me is 65k and wife's W2 isn't back yet but salary is 84k (for this year before deductions/contributions etc).

personalfinance,I want to transfer colleges and have a few questions about private student loans.,"Hello! I'm a university student in the US currently studying at my state's flagship public university. I've previously attended a private university (and taken out $7k in federal loans), then community college (for free with a Pell grant) and now my current university, where I enrolled last Fall at the insistence of my family. I'm currently only paying a little bit (\~$300/semester) because I'm living at home and attending remotely and everything is covered by grants, but I'll have to take out max federal loans ($5,500) and will have about $2k left to pay after I move on-campus. I'm not sure how I'll pay that last bit, but I think my family intends to help me cover it.

I don't want to attend the school I'm currently at and I intend to transfer; I've thought about it a lot and made my decision to apply elsewhere. However, I didn't get much aid to the schools that I applied to after I attended cc except for a few, where I would have paid $10-15k after grants and federal loans. I would have been happy to take that money out in the form of a private loan because I so badly wanted to go to those schools, but I had no idea what a private student loan would have looked like. I'm very cautious about getting a loan, because I've seen how it affects people after they finish school. I made a post on College Confidential about a year ago asking about financial aid for transfer students, and a few people replied saying that it would be very difficult for me to qualify for a student loan without a cosigner. My family is low-income and don't want me taking out a loan, so I didn't think they would want to cosign for me, plus I have a credit score of 745, so I assumed I could qualify for a loan myself. 

This leads me to my questions: 1. Can I qualify for a private student loan without a cosigner? 2. What kind of interest rate would I be looking at? 3. What do monthly payments look like after you leave school, say if one opted to start paying it back after they left school vs paying interest while in school? I know this question can vary based on circumstances, but I don't even know what repayment would look like. All I know about repayment is based on my family's experiences: my mom has left her loans in deferment and I don't think she can ever pay them back at this point and my grandfather is still paying off his loans from his doctoral program 25 years ago. 

The whole idea of a private loan is terrifying to me, but I don't see much of a future at my current school and don't want to continue there. Of course, I'll weigh my options when I get admissions decisions and aid offers back, but I don't feel that I can do that without knowing what my options are. Should I completely avoid private loans?",finance
personalfinance,Employer failed to submit my updated tax paperwork,"I found out yesterday that back in February 2020 when I turned in my updated tax paperwork to HR that it never got submitted to accounting.

Apparently HR said they have my paperwork showing that I wanted federal taxes taken from my pay but since it was never submitted I was basically exempt for the whole year.

As soon as I will buy those ETFs I will ask for a loan increase using them as pledge and I will reinvest the new loaned capital into the same assets and slowly repeat the process.

I know the risk of investing with loaned money but I think that a 1% loan interest rate and investing on global ETF highly diversified will reduce it.  
The portoflio I will use to ask for the credit lombard loan is highly diversified too and I will invest no more than 50% of the loaned capital to reduce the risk of a margin call.

personalfinance,Buying our second home,"Greetings, PF!   There is a lot of literature and discussion around how to buy your first home, but less information on what is typically a more complicated transaction - buying your second home.   I was hoping for some advice, tips, and see if there is any strategy that I am missing.

Quick facts about my family - we have an expanding family and have decided to purchase a larger home.  We live in a fairly LCOL area, but like most places, the real estate market is very hot and competitive.  We will have no trouble selling our home.   Our family earns lower six figures.   We owe $208,000 on our house and it would likely sell for $300,000.   I expect to net about $75,000 after fees.   We have $60,000 in cash (13 months of expenses) and $250,000 in retirement.  We have no other debt.  We are in our mid-30s and are expecting.  We both have 800 FICO scores and we both plan on continuing to work after the child.  We are fortunate to have family nearby to make that possible

We are looking to buy a house in the range of $350K-$375K.   We would like to put 20% down.

**Option 1 -** Make a contingent offer.  We would get our house ready to go on the market, find the house we want, and then place a contingent offer on that house.  Once the offer is accepted, place our house on the market, and coordinate closing dates so that we will be able to use the equity from our current home to put 20% down on the new home.   This seems to be the most common strategy.

* Positives - We will have to coordinate only one move.  We would be able to put 20% down, and essentially ""transfer"" the equity from our current house to our new house.   We will not touch our cash, and have enough cash to have some flexibility with remodeling.
* Negatives - As I mentioned, we live in a competitive market, and the seller might not accept a contingency.   There would be additional stress in coordinating selling one property and buying another.

**Option 2** \- Sell our current house now, rent a house or large apartment on a short-term lease, and start looking for a new house.

* Positives - we will have $135K cash on hand which will give us a lot of flexibility and our offer is likely to be accepted.  There is less stress in coordinating the closing dates.   We could potentially sell at a peak and buy back in at a lower price.
* Negatives - two moves.  We would ""throw away"" money towards rent.   We could potentially sell at a lower price and buy in at a higher price, or buy in when interest rates have risen.

**Option 3** \- Save even more cash over the next year, use our entire savings as 20% down on the new house.  We would buy a new house, and then sell our old house.   We would temporarily carry two mortgages, and then receive a large cash infusion once our first house sells.

* Positives - There is no need for a contingency offer.  Our current house is likely to sell quickly.   The move would be very easy as we would temporarily own both houses.
* Negatives - there is obviously a whole lot of risk here.   What if the housing market crashes and we are unable to sell our first home?   Our emergency fund would be depleted, short-term, although likely replenished within 60 days.   Cash flow would be very tight short-term.

What option would you chose, or have you chosen in the past?  Are there any other options that I am missing?

\*edited to add\* We are not in a rush to buy, but would like to take advantage of the low rates that are currently offered.

personalfinance,Ignore capitalization on some loans?,"Hey y’all,

So I think I know the answer but I wanted to double check what would make the most sense. 

I graduated in 2020 and loans have started to kick in. I’m able to afford them, so don’t have to worry about that, but I do want to try and pay them down much quicker than needed, especially as my current living situation for the rest of the pandemic will allow me to pay more aggressively. 

I have loans from only the last two years when I attended university, listed as follows:

Federal all at 10 years

$5500 @ 5.05%

$7462 @ 5.05%

$5500 @ 4.53%

$7098 @ 4.53%

Discover Private loans at 15 years

$7907 @ 6.615% variable

$8029 @ 8.365% variable

The private loans were at 8000 and I already paid off the interest prior to them going into repayment so the interest wouldn’t capitalize. My question here is on the two $7000 federal loans, the added amount is about $600 in interest and that is going to capitalize. 

Thankfully the covid stuff happening has put a pause on those loans entering repayment, but I’m wondering if it’s just worth it to pay off the interest now to not have it capitalize, or if it’s better to just put that $600 into paying off the higher interest loan as a lump sum. I’m already paying about $100 more into the discover loans to pay it off faster, because I hadn’t realized it was a 15 year loan and I don’t want it to go past ten, and hoping to bring it down much faster as well. I just don’t know if that $600 is even worth worrying about even if it capitalizes when I have loans with double the interest rate.

I haven’t done anything with the federal loans because I don’t know what will happen with debt forgiveness or how long the debt moratorium is going to last, but the private is the most important right now because that is in repayment.

Should I just not worry about the capitalizing interest and just keep paying off the higher rate loans first?",finance

My wife and I were married in calendar year 2020. She worked for 5 months in Illinois then moved to Ohio after we got married and did not work the rest of calendar year 2020.
What I would like to do is this. File married file jointly for federal. This will save us thousands of dollars in federal taxes given our vast income differences. In fact, if we didn’t, we would owe thousands to the federal government because I’ve been withholding as married filing jointly all year.

However, I’ve been told that if we do that, regardless of how we file state wise, Illinois may come back and try to tax my income that I made solely in Ohio. This is fully and completely unacceptable. They have no right to any of the money I made in Ohio, only what she made in Illinois. It was suggested to me to just file separately this year, but again, this would be unacceptable due to the thousands I'd lose on my end. (as well as penalties) 

My current plan is to file federal jointly, then each of us will file married filing separately for each of our respective states.  (With her being a partial year resident form) We won’t really lose any money by filing this way as these states don’t give breaks to income like the federal government it seems.

If I was to lose my income, I could probably cut out several hundred dollars of expenses each month and stretch it.

I am wondering how best to utilize the pause in payments and interest to grow the sum I have saved for my loans and the contributions I will be making to that account for the same period. My thoughts have ranged from a CD to a Mutual Fund to grow the payments more than they will sitting in my savings acct (&gt;1%). I am comfortable accepting a moderate amount of risk.

personalfinance,Question on the math behind investing vs. loan payoff.,"This topic has been discussed to death already, I know and I'm sorry, but I'm a little confused on the math behind it.

The answer given time and time again is: if the interest on your loan is greater than what you would expect to make off an investment, pay the loan. Ok. So my car loan at 4.99% should take the back seat to getting a conservative 6% give or take in the stock market. However, according to [this](https://studentloanhero.com/calculators/extra-payment-calculator/) calculator, if I were to throw $3k at the remaining $16k of my loan right now, I can expect a total savings of $532 and a payoff date 8 months earlier, leaving 2 years and 10 months on my loan. Dividing $532 by $3k, then by 2.83 years results in a guaranteed return of 6.26% per year, putting it about even with what I might expect from the stock market.

Similarly, according to [this](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/auto/early-payment-payoff-calculator.aspx) calculator, making additional principal payments of $500/month would result in only 1 year 7 months remaining on my loan, and a total savings of $825. Again, dividing $825 by the total additional principal payments made during that time ($500 * 19 months = $9500) and once more by the 1.53 years remaining, I expect a return of 5.66%, not all that close to 4.99% and still close to 6% on the stock market, with the added benefit of being debt free nearly 2 years earlier.

Am I doing this correctly? These calculations lead me to think I should be paying off my loan more quickly rather than diverting extra funds to stocks, despite my interest rate being lower than the expected return from stocks.

Thank you in advance, finance witches and wizards!",finance
personalfinance,I have a 529 and a UGMA savings account for my son,"Every month I put money in to both with most going to the 529.

My son is only 5 and the idea behind the savings account was that he could use that money if there was a class trip he wanted to go on, help by a car when he gets older, exc.

I believe this can impact how much he can get for college but I’m not 100% sure on that and if that were the case would it make sense to spend the money or move the money to another account before applying for college?

... I also wonder if there’s a better place for me to put this money as the interest rate on the savings account is only .5%",finance
personalfinance,"Best option to finance improvements on primary residence in Washington, DC","I bought my primary residence in 2018 at net 680k knowing it **needs** about $200k of improvement. The house is currently valued at $825k in its current condition, once the improvements are made I expect the house to be valued \~$1,100,000 based on similar comps, possibly more depending on 2021 market. I currently owe $598,000 on the house with a 2.625% rate. Ideally I would like to turn this into rental when I am done living here (or have the option to sale if the market continues on its trajectory)

I do not own any other real estate and I have $60,000 cash specifically earmarked for this renovation. I have other assets available but prefer not to utilize them.

Ideally I'd like to finance the whole improvement project.

Do I go for a 90%-95% HELOC - make improvements and then refinance based on appraised value after/aggressively pay down HELOC? Second Mortgage/Home Equity Loan? Refinance Cash out? Refinance into a 203k?

(I contacted ThirdFederal and they offered a HELOC of $60k (80% LTV), at a phenomenal rate but it still leaves me short. )",finance
stocks,S&amp;P 500 rises to all-time high ahead of Biden’s inauguration,"The U.S. stock market could roar higher if President-elect Joe Biden is able to smooth out the country’s rocky start to Covid vaccinations. 

Biden has pledged to deliver 100 million doses in his first 100 days. Last week, he detailed his plan to do so, which includes tapping the National Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up large-scale vaccination sites across the country. Biden also plans to accelerate the availability of Covid vaccines at local pharmacies.

personalfinance,What should I do with my emergency fund?,"My bank, simple, is “closing” and all the accounts are going to BBVA. I’m not really interested in banking with BBVA without the handy features of simple, so I’m going to be shaking up my banking situation. I have about $18k in what was a high-yield savings account. They’ve slowly been lowering the interest rate and since I’m changing banks anyways, I want to look at options for that savings. 

Any ideas to squeeze the most juice out of this money while still keeping it fairly liquid? I feel like a CD might be my only option?",finance
investing,Hoping to get some help investing in Mortgage REITs.,"I've been interested in the opportunities mortgage REITs have been presenting since the massive margin calls in March, and have been entering and exiting positions since then and collecting dividends along the way. Now that a lot of these companies are starting to show some stability again, I'm trying to find a good place to park my money and check it in a couple years at the earliest. I've noticed a lot of the research readily available only focuses on equity REITs, using metrics like FFO and AFFO, but those don't really apply to the mortgage side.

If anyone could help me find the borrowing rates (mortgage rates a client sees and the interest rate a trust will incur for leverage) and possibly any metrics you use when analyzing the financial statements of this sector, I would be forever in your debt (no pun intended).",finance
personalfinance,"Purchased first home in Sept., married in Oct., unsure how to file (I have significant student loans, my spouse does not).","Like the title states, my wife and I are unsure of how to file this tax season (joint or separate). 

I have roughly $40,000 in federal student loans and I am on an income-driven repayment plan. I called my loan servicer, who took our individual incomes and presented my options. Under my current repayment plan, my monthly loan payment would just from $519 to just under $1,200. There is another payment plan that would bump my monthly to $720 if we filed jointly, while still maintaining my current loan payoff date. Obviously, if we file separately my payment amount is unaffected.

I guess I have 2 questions -  if we file married, separate what do we do about obtaining the deductions for our house purchase? Does only one person claim that for the mortgage interest deduction? 

For those who have been in a similar situation, how big of a difference was your return filing married jointly than the total of what you would have each received if you filed separately?",finance
personalfinance,Trying to get pre-approved but don't know where to start,"Hello! Not me, but my wife. I'll get to the point.

\- So she has between 580-615 across all bureaus.

\- Credit card debt of $4k, interest rates are 5% or less.

\- Car loan of $34k, interest rate is .9%.

\- Student loans of $25k, interest rates are 5% or less.

\- Net take home per month is around $4,500

Credit was around 680 in June but took a hit w/ a new inquiry, two closed accounts and increased DTI because of the closed accounts, and one or two missed payments.

So the question is where to start? We're trying to get pre-approved for a house around June/July and close on it by February 2022 (new construction planned to be done building by then). That's the biggest purchase coming up. What does she need to do to get there? Is there hope to be pre approved by July? What's the best course of action?

EDIT: The mortgage would be a VA loan if that makes a difference.",finance

personalfinance,Looking to refinance home mortgage and wondering if it makes sense,"I’m looking for some advice on refinancing my mortgage. Bought the house on 3/2019 for $800k. Original jumbo loan was for $760k, 10/1 ARM at 4.5%. We put 5% down and since I’m a physician we didn’t need PMI. Currently have $736k remaining. Looking to refinance into 30 year fixed at 3.0%. House just got re-appraised at $890k.They require we have 20% value in the house before they’ll agree to refinance. My math says we need to put about $24k into the current loan (drops it to $712Kwhich is 80% of $890k). We are really motivated to get a lower interest rate right now and also want a fixed rate. We also have $450k in student loans at 6.8% interest. Am I thinking about this correctly? And does it make more sense to throw more money at the student loans and no refinance or go ahead with it? We have plenty of cash in reserve. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Is it really possible to owe at the end of the year even when claiming 0 deductions/withholdings?,"I'm not entirely sure of the right terminology.  I currently have my w4 set to 0 deductions/withholdings for state and federal, based on the old forms.  I just used the IRS calculator, as well as a TurboTax calculator.  The IRS calculator says I will **under pay** by $264, and to make it so I owe nothing at the end of the year to add $26 to my deductions/withholdings per month  (I am paid once a month).  But when I ran my info through the Turbo Tax calculator it said I would get a refund of about $150 using my full monthly gross pay.

1st question - Is it really possible to under pay when claiming 0?!  if so, how is that even possible?!

2nd question - I have some pre tax deductions (a retirement contribution, and several medical benefit additions, and monthly parking fees), does that make any difference to the amount I need to claim?

3rd question - not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, should I trust the IRS, or is the calculator perhaps set to be conservative in estimations?

TIA for any info!",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing private student loan during loan repayment freeze,"Edit: solved, the idea that private student loans were at zero percent intrest was false

Right now student loans rates are frozen at zero. My gf current private student loans at 15k of debt at 9% interest rate (high i know). 

She looked and got a new offer for 3% rate, however all of the paperwork says that the freeze at zero percent will not apply since she is refinancing.

Is that really a thing? 
If they extend the zero percent intrest rate period to October, would that apply to the newly refinanced loan?

Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Paying for Grad School,"I begin a 24 month Master's program in May, where total tuition is $70,000. I will have approximately $55,000 in cash when I start the program, and will not be able to work during the program. The unsubsidized federal loan (up to $20,500 annually) interest rate for graduate students this year is 4.30%, and it appears historically the interest rate is 6%. Should I take advantage of the lower current interest rate and invest my money? Or do I begin paying in cash right away to limit my loan amount and loan term?

Additionally, I have only contributed $4,000 to my 2020 Roth IRA, and $0 towards 2021. Does it make sense to maximize my contribution in this account? Can I withdraw my initial contributions without a tax penalty if needed?",finance
personalfinance,1099 for vehicle lease question,"I'm a superintendent for a construction company that pays me a $500/mo lease plus $0.25/mile allowance.  

Every year for the last 15 years, I would get a 1099 for $6000 that I would file on my taxes.  The annual mileage driven would more than make up for the taxes owed on the 6k and actually increase my return by a bit.

This year, I've been informed that my employer would not be giving us a 1099 as some new tax law makes it unnecessary because ... reasons.  I can't help but think I'm getting screwed over because I put just a hair under 26000 miles on my vehicle last year, about 21000 of which were work related.  

My supervisor actually sounded surprised that I was the only person who wasn't happy with this new arrangement.  I can't help but think that all the other people with truck leases plan to not claim the 6k at all and rake in the full federal deduction for all their miles driven, treating the money received as a gift.

So my question is, can I still claim my mileage even though I don't have anything showing that I was paid a vehicle lease from my employer?  I don't want to do anything illegal, but I do want to be able to claim what I'm due.",finance

personalfinance,When exactly do credit card interest charges begin?,"I have a credit card that was paid in full at the beginning of January. The last statement balance that was issued on January 4th is $0. However, on January 7th I had a sudden big expence that left me around $4000 in debt, and my promotional 0% interest rate expires sometime in February.

For this reason I would like to know whether I have to worry about the interest charges. I know that this $4000 expence will be posted as my debt only on February 4th, so if I pay the balance posted on that February 4th statement in full by March, it will not negatively impact my credit score (as far as I'm aware at least). But I'm not so sure when exactly the interest charges get applied. In order to avoid interest charges, am I supposed to avoid ever having large statement balances posted in the first place? Or are there no negative consequences to having large statement balances as long as they are paid in full by the next month?",finance
personalfinance,Auto loan charged off,"Finances were terrible back in 2019 and my auto loan was charged off after being 180 days late in Dec of 2019. I’m still in possession of the car and I’m in the process of getting it fixed, registered, and inspected for the first time since the charge off. I wasn’t hiding the car or anything, it sat in a lot on my street in plain view. My financial situation is better but not great as I’m on unemployment due to Covid. Bottom line is I have the money to pay off the full amount and I’m wondering what the best course of action is. Ideally I can convince/beg the original creditor, loan was never sold to CA to my knowledge, to remove the charged off and update the loan as paid in full. as of last month the original creditor is still reporting to the three major companies as charged off.  

I know I F’ed up and should have handled this back in 2019. Anxiety and shame got the better of me. 

Any info or suggestions are appreciated.  Thanks.",finance

However, I am now in the process of preparing my taxes and see that the ""Federal Income Tax Withheld"" figure on the 1099G form from the CA EDD is completely wrong.

personalfinance,Student Loan Questions,"Im currently a dental student taking out loans for school and was wondering my best course of action. Right now, I got a 20000 refund at a 4.3% interest rate and was wondering whether or not to keep the money. 4.3% is probably the smallest amount of interest that will be given during four years here, and the extra money could be used to pay next semesters tuition where loans could be higher. On top of that there’s a current 0% student interest rate from the feds and helps to stop interest from compounding till (potentially) October if legislation goes through. 

My question is whether I should keep this 20k, or return it and take out another loan next semester when the interest rate will change.",finance
personalfinance,Deciding between Traditional 401k or Roth 401k,"I’m 25 with an income of roughly 110k a year which puts me at the 24% federal income tax bracket. I currently live in a state with no state income tax. And I  have the goal of retiring early. 

I’m leaning towards a Roth 401k for two reasons. 

1). If I decide to retire in a state that does have state income tax, I won’t have to worry about paying that like I would if it was a traditional 401k.

2). With a Roth 401k I can move it into a Roth IRA during early retirement and take out a portion of my contributions tax and penalty free.

Is there anything I am overlooking?",finance

I want to just contribute to retirement and forget about it till retirement, just occasionally checking the account so is the target date fund right for me or should i try to split my contribution between VFAIX &amp; the retirement target date fund? Also after i hit the $6000 contribution mark in the IRA &amp; hit the 6 month emergency fund amount should I look into investing into ETFs such as VOO?

I have an extra $4000, My three options(so far)

1. put all towards student loans
2. put $3000 to 2060 retirement target date fund and give $1000 to my parents as a gift
3. put $3000 VFIAX($3000 min required) and give $1000 to my parents as a gift
4. Any option you guys think is better than the previous 3

If you guys had any other advice or better options to consider, that would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Investing Student Loan Payments instead of Paying During Deferment,"Hi All,

I'm a high earner unaffected by the pandemic that has been dutifully and semi-aggressively paying down my student loan interest each month.  I budget paying about $1,200 a month. I have $57,000 in federal loans.

I've been paying each month even though the loans have been in deferment since the beginning of the pandemic at 0% interest. I now see Biden will extend the deferment to October.

It's just occurred to me that I have not been very prudent with my money. I could have been investing that 1,200 a month or even let it sit in a savings account with minimal interest instead of paying it off when I did not need to. Right? 

What do you guys suggest I do from now until October? Keep paying the loan, savings account, low risk investment vehicle? I contribute to a moderate risk mutual fund. I could up my payments there. I know I could be doing something smarter...just not sure what.",finance
personalfinance,"With the suspension of Fed Student Loans being extended, can I take those monthly payments and apply them towards a private student loan?","As we just found out, the suspension of Federal Student loan payments and interest will go through Sept 30. Before today, I have just been paying the minimum payments on all of my loans even though I didn't have to.

Today, I would like to revisit my plan and see if another option is available.

As I see it, I see 2 options:

 1. Stop paying federal loans and put all of that money in to a high yield savings account then pay all of my federal loans at the end of September.
 2. Take the minimum monthly payments from my federal loans and apply all of that money directly to my private student loan.

Option 1 doesn't seem worth my time because the interest rates are at 0.5%.

I'm leaning towards Option 2. Is that a bad idea? Will that save me the most money in the long run? Do we know if there will be any penalties for not making any payments to federal student loans while they are pause?

Here are the details of my loans.

| Loan | Balance | Pre-Covid Interest | Post-Covid Interest | Min Mo Payment |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Private | $19,136.37 | 6.24% | 6.24% | $537.15 |
| Fed A | $17,357.16 | 5.96% | 0% | $268.79 |
| Fed B | $18,344.43 | 5.75% | 0% | $160.76 |
| Fed C | $16,304.01 | 5.59% | 0% | $248.94 |
| Fed D | $7,695.48 | 5.31% | 0% | $87.26 |
| Fed E | $18,418.83 | 5.06% | 0% | $145.29 |
| Fed F | $5,197.97 | 5.06% | 0% | $77.77 |
| Fed G | $3,398.28 | 4.25% | 0% | $63.11 |

Total Balance: $105,852.53.

Note: I also have an extra $974/mo that I have been applying to my private loan by using the Avalanche method.
If I went with option 2 then I would be able to apply an extra $2025.92 to my private loan every month until October. That should be enough to pay my loan off in full.

personalfinance,When to pay off 0% APR credit card,"I have a credit card that is currently at a 0% introductory rate. I used it to purchase an engagement ring for $5,000 and currently have the cash to pay it off. Paying it will leave me with about $1,500 in cash, which would cover about 1.5 months expenses if I lost my job. I’ve never really had a larger emergency fund, the cash came from an end of year stock sale, so I’m used to having around this amount in my savings account. I’m expecting a larger tax return than normal thanks to student education credit and being able to claim stimulus checks I’ve not received yet. Is it best to pay the card now, or keeping a balance until I receive my tax return going to negatively impact my credit score. 

I’ve had credit cards for 4 years now(4 cards, each with roughly $10,000 monthly limit), have never missed a payment and always pay in full. In my mind I’m not “borrowing” the money since I already have the cash to pay it and the interest rate is 0% through October. I like the idea of making minimum payments until April to keep the cash as a full four month emergency fund, but in reality the 4 month fund would be reestablished come late march/early April when I receive my tax refund anyways. I’m more concerned about credit score and any impact in having this large balance on a card.",finance
personalfinance,15 year Refinance thoughts,"I refinanced last year and thought it would be fun to run through my thought process on here. 

I originally financed 200K at 4.125% in June of 2018. 

I had the loan paid down to $187,734 at the time I was considering the refi. 

The best rate/closing cost combo I could find was 3% with $4,266 origination costs at a local credit union, I checked rates at about 5 places - be prepared for your credit to take a 10-15 point hit from all the hard credit checks you will get. There might be a way to avoid this if you try. I had a ~800 score. Beware of low rates with very high closing costs, keep in mind where your principal is at current loan and what they make the new loan for - sometimes they hide costs in there and are shady about it. 

I was in a 20yr mortgage and wanted to refi to a 15yr mortgage. 

I thought the best way to analyze this was to look at where I would be in 5 years with the refi. 

I would be saving roughly 1.125% in interest cost, $2,347/year, so it seemed logical that this was a reasonable payback for the cost. 

If you look at 5 years down the road - I would have a balance of 137.3K on the refi, 147.7K on the existing mortgage. In that same time period I would be paying additional money per month, and I would skip 2 payments with the refi. That would be an additional $3,550 paid towards the loan, and I would have $10,400 additional principal in the bank if I sold the house after 5 years vs not refinancing. So in 5 years, I would profit by $6,850. 

The payment increased from $1,225 in the 200K, 4.125%, 20yr loan to $1,325 on the 192K, 3%, 15yr loan. So every year I would be paying an additional $1,200. The first year principal paydown would be  10,291 vs 7,669 on my existing mortgage. 

I know a lot of people are against 15 year mortgages. In my first home I really wanted to pay it off so I got a 10 year loan for a few years at a deal of an interest rate (2.75% was really good back then). After staying in the home 10 years I had accumulated a lot of principal. My company decided to move me to a different city. My wife and I were able to purchase our forever home in the new city and pay cash for a newer van only because we had accumulated 140K in equity in our existing home, a good portion due to having a shorter term loan. I really think this is something most arguments would not take into account, solely focusing on what your money would be doing in market vs home equity. It really gave us the freedom to do what we wanted, not to mention how good it feels to have less debt in general in case of emergencies. I would not recommend doing this to everyone, but for the first 10 years of our marriage I think it really helped us to get our budget in line and live frugally, so later on we were in a much better position.",finance

personalfinance,I think I screwed up my 401k. Need help figuring out what to do.,"Hey all,

So I had roughly 68k in my 401k with my old employer.  I got a new employer, and new 401k program.


Now in the past, I could initiate a roll over, and have the old 401k just mail a check to the new one, fill out a form, no big deal.  This new plan wanted me to mail them a check.  Okay, no big deal.  I went to my old 401k and requested a check.  Now here's where I missed up.  I requested a disbursement instead of a roll over by accident.  So to my surprise, the old 401k sent me a check with my name on it (not the new 401k), and withheld 20% for federal, so the check was worth ~55k.

Now the new 401k won't take a check addressed to me.  and the old 401k is of no help at all (I've asked if they would void the check and reissue one for the 68k as a roll over, but won't do that).  New 401k told me I can deposit the check, and send them a check for 68k, and wait for the IRS to refund me the 13k in my tax return and continue on with my 401k.  Only issue is, I don't have 68k to give the new 401k...

Here's my questions:

1. Would it be best to just take my 55k that has already had 20% withheld for federal, and start a Roth IRA, and just continue a new retirement plan with my new employer? 

2. If so, can I start a Roth 401k, and if I ever leave employers, just keep rolling the Roth 401k into my Roth IRA without penalty?

3. I've read that there is a 10% tax or penalty if withdrawing retirement before 59 years old.  How and when does this happen?  Did the old 401k provider include that in their 20% withholding?

personalfinance,Advice for buying a house in California,"Hello, this is an alt account to avoid doxing myself. I wanted to get some advice on my parents plans on buying a house. My parents are great at saving, but they don’t know anything about retirement and stuff. We live in an expensive area of California. We’re planning on spending around $700,000 for a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house. A couple years ago we got pre-approved for a loan of $500,000. We have $100,000 in a saving account, my cousins are giving us $6,000 as a gift / to help (doesn't need to be returned). My aunt owes my mom $30,000 that she is returning, and my other aunt is lending us $30,000 that we can pay off slowly (no interest rates and other stuff). the plan is for us to put around $200,000 down, get a loan of $500,000 and then have around $16,000 for closing costs and stuff. I was wondering if there are first time homebuyer things that we can use to make this easier on us. Also I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go and put such a large down payment. We have a decent chance to get a larger loan this time, since we now own a business, and my mom's income has gone up a bit compared to before.

edit:  added in the expenses / income of the family. 0 debt

Dad covers all house expenses.

makes $150,000 pre expenses, around 60,000 post. his expenses include gas, insurance, food he eat, alcohol (drinks nearly daily), scratchers (does some for fun), also the money he gives to my mom for saving. the remaining 60,000 is for home expenses.

besides the monthly 500 that my mom gets all of the money is spent.

he'll work a bit extra if an unexpected expense comes up ie. I bought a PC for $1200 around Christmas so he worked for $4,000 in a week instead of $3,000

mom does all the saving.

$1,500 (per month, salary) // post taxes

$2,000 (per month, salary 2) // post taxes

$500 ( per month, from dad, since mom does all the saving)

$2000 (per month, business profit)

&amp;#x200B;

edit 2:

the downpayment would be 200k and I forgot to include a second account that has another $50,000 also none of this is part of emergency funds

I want to remove the co-signer from the loan, which is usually an option with this lender, but because I put the loan into forbearance about 10 years ago, I am ineligible. 

Do I have any options that I’m not thinking of?  My options as I see them are:
1) do nothing and just keep paying as is and just suck it up that the co-signer is on there 
2) just pay it off, even though the interest rate is so low and the money could be better utilized elsewhere
3) refinance and have a higher interest rate (obviously, this would not make a lot of sense, but adding it as it is a possible route to remove the co-signer)

personalfinance,"Should I use my inheritance to buy a house in Austin, TX if I'm 21 and have stable income and little debt?","In the past few months, a tremendous amount of animosity has built up between my roommates and I. I wont spew a bunch of detail, but it's time for my own space. I have been renting the master bedroom in my roommates grandpas house under the table for $1000/mo plus 1/3 utilities for a year now. Before that I was living with my mom, who I moved to Austin with back in 2010 from Indiana.

I turned 21 last June. In November of 2019 my grandfather passed away. Since my father had passed some years prior, my younger brother and I were to split his inheritance. It is roughly $100K each. I also have around $20K in a scholarship fund. The inheritance is set up as a trust and I'm supposed to get 1/3 payouts every 5 years starting when I turn 30. My uncle, who is an attorney, is the trustee. My family (including my (half)brother who lives with his mother) are in Indianapolis, but I live and work in Austin.

Last year I made $46,000 before taxes. This year I expect that to grow. I don't have a lot of my own savings and I have average credit. I've been looking to rent an apartment but over the last year I've been very attracted to home-buying. With the growth that Austin is experiencing, it could be a lucrative opportunity to invest in property and build equity rather than rent. I have no plans to leave my job or Austin. I'm budgeting for a home price between $2-300K. I already have a realtor and lender (family friends).

I work as the Shipping / Receiving Manager at an up and coming tech company just south of Austin. I've been here about 1.5 years. Before that I was a service tech at an auto shop. I had no logistics knowledge prior to working here, but after implementing an ERP system and reestablishing shipping, receiving and inventory processes I feel it's second nature.

In 2018 I attended community college for a year, thankfully without any debt, without anything to show for it. I'd like to take advantage of my scholarship funds to go back part-time and take courses in A/D project management, operations and the supply chain. Living in Austin, I hope to always have job security, especially with major tech companies transitioning here.

TL;DR

Is it worth it for me to attempt investing in property?

**If so, how can I create a compelling argument to my uncle to release my money to me early to make a down payment?** I realize the trust is set up to prevent me from being silly with my money at a young age. But I feel like the low interest rates coupled with the overall growth of Austin will yield higher investment returns than the mutual funds the money is in currently.

There is so much I don't know. I'm relying on y'all for some sound advice, and every comment is greatly appreciated. I don't want to kick myself 5-10 years down the line wishing I made the better choice sooner.

Thanks everyone!

personalfinance,Dilemma of MMD Tax on New Home Purchase,"My wife and I recently purchased a new home and owe an assessment for a CMMD (Club Municipal Management District). Everyone in the community owes one, there is no way to escape payment and I won’t get into too many details of the CMMD specifically but I am more interested in feedback on the payment scenarios. 

Scenario 1: 30 year amortization of approx $34,000 at approx 6.5% interest rate. If I go this route I would pay approx $2,300/year but would pay $44k in interest over the life of the bond.

Scenario 2: I can pay as a lump sum up front. I have the spare cash now and in the long run would save me money. I can afford to do this with no issues.

More details about our situation. We absolutely plan on staying in this house at least 10 years. Although anything can happen with my job and would have opportunities to move elsewhere, and there is a very small chance we would have to relocate at any time, although not probable.

My thinking is that if I pay up front (scenario 2) I would break even after year 12, and any time past year 12, I would be ahead in this particular situation. The other thought that I had was that very few, if any other homeowners decided to pay this down. If the others sell their homes, the CMMD payment burden will pass onto the buyer. It would give my potential buyer an incentive that others couldn’t offer, no outstanding balance owed!

The only downside would be my short-term exposure if I had to relocate, but my thinking is that I may be able to recoup some of that when I go to sell and I’m not passing on that high interest rate.

Have I researched all options?","Hi all, I purchased a condo in DC August, but just interviewed for a job in Boston that I think I will be offered. My pay will increase at least 40% if I get it. Since I got the interview I had been wondering what I can do with the condo if I relocate. Here's what I have found in my own research, but I would really appreciate anyone pointing me to things I've missed:

(1) I can sell the condo, likely at a net loss because it has not had time to appreciate and because closing costs will be \~10%. W~~hile normally~~ a loss on home value is not tax-deductible~~, in this case it will be .~~ if I give job relocation as the reason for selling the home, that only helps me exclude part of the proceeds (gain) from capital gains tax, but that is only if I make a profit. 

(2) I can rent the condo but keep it. I will need to contact my lender because this will likely change the terms of my mortgage (no longer owner-occupied). I would also need to change homeowner's insurance to have landlord coverage. Property management would cost \~10% of the rent I charge. I'd likely operate at a small loss--my costs are very close to market value for this as a rental--but I could hold the property until the value had increased more, then sell. Because I won't have lived in the home for 2 years out of the last five, I will have to pay a higher rate of interest on any profit, but it least there might be \*some\* profit.

Option (1) above is logistically much simpler--I'm not sure how much I love the idea of having a property in another city as in (2), with the headache of the taxes and being a landlord, on the hopes of some small profit. That being said, I can't help but think of whatever loss I incur on a quick sale, as counting against the higher salary I'll be making at the new job. I've thought about paying down more of the principal in a big chunk to possibly lessen the overall interest I will pay, but this does not change monthly payments and the interest rate is so low on mortgages compared to other types of debt that that doesn't seem logical.

So since about March I've gotten roughly $22k from the state all untaxed and I had no idea. I am stupid I know. So now I'm going to owe an insane amount I figure on taxes this year. I am truly so stressed about all this I have lost sleep and it's been affecting my daily life. I am currently employed at restaurant but we're closed right now due to COVID so I'm still just collecting unemployment but I'm almost out. With about $1,000 to my name I feel like I'm going to explode.",finance

I'm a little confused as what to expect, and I can't really find an answer to clarify. 

I received about a $10,000 ""award"" for unemployment last calendar year. I didn't payout much of it (from the state fund, not including the $600 we were getting weekly), maybe about $2000, and what I collected I had them take out the federal tax. State tax is apparently not collected.

My question is this--will I have to pay taxes on my entire award, whether or not I collected all of it last year? Or will I just have to pay taxes on what was actually disbursed to me after reporting in the weeks I did not work?

personalfinance,Advice on Best Banks for Managing Budget?,"Hey guys, 
I’m from Australia (VIC) reaching out hoping for some advice. As it stands I am a customer with one of the big 4 banks (CBA), (have been pretty much forever) but I think I’m done and ready to open a new account with another brand. 
I would be hugely appreciative of any recommendations that you guys think might work for me? I am the only person who uses my bank account and at this stage I’m realising the areas of my budget that I can improve on.. Feel free to recommend big banks or small ones. 
I don’t have too many preconceived ideas about any of this stuff... 

...Except....... after doing a little searching I found Mebank offers a system which looks pretty great for personal budgeting (like multiple accounts collated I guess) they call it ‘bucket budgeting’ as they are seperate accounts though, seems like you do need a seperate card to access each one of them.. mildly annoying, but fine I suppose.. apparently the cards are all colour coded so I reckon I could definitely live with that..(Not sure how it would work for using tap and pay on your phone and stuff though) ... Anyway, I do like that concept.. that kind of method definitely appeals.
So yeah, there is that! I just think it could work really well for someone like me who is pretty much living payday to payday and struggling to have savings. It’s something I try to do anyway, so I would enjoy the extra organised approach.. just difficult when you don’t have the proper system in place to back you.. 
(I almost want to take my cash out and divide it into different envelopes) that doesn’t really work in a modern world though, (especially since covid) a digital version of that however, now that does seem ideal to me. Anyway, I’m just rambling on now. 

Gosh I said a lot about that.. (I really don’t know a thing about Mebank otherwise) 

So a few actual questions: 

Does anyone bank with Mebank? 
And if you do, then what do you think of it? 
Are there other banks accessible in my state who are also offering the ‘bucket budgeting’ system? 
Lastly.. (I don’t want to sound like I’m doing some big survey here) but I’d love to know.. Is it important to you that your bank has a physical branch you can access? Why? Or Why not? 
Are there certain inconveniences involved with not having this? I can’t really think of any, but maybe I am missing something.. 
I guess what I’m basically asking for is a breakdown of pros and cons on the whole.. if you can be bothered. 

Not sure if I should choose a bank purely based on this ‘bucket budgeting’ haha.. but I really do love the idea and can definitively see myself utilising it. 
A high interest rate would obviously be great too but right now I’m finding the whole organisational system thing the most appealing feature. 

Feel free to recommend even if it does not incorporate bucket budgeting.. 
If you are happy with your bank and can take the time to tell me why?.. (what specific features are making it pleasant for you? etc..) 
That’d be brilliant! 

I know I have turned this post into a whole bunch of questions.. please forgive. I just hope that it’s readable enough :/

Thanks in advance :)",finance

stocks,"Stock Market News for Today | GM, NetFlix [NFLX], Alibaba [BABA] &amp; Other Stock Market News [01-21]","**Stocks rally as Biden and the Dems take the helm of the US. Netflix crushes earnings while Jack Ma finally appears. General Motors partners with Microsoft to develop their self-driving tech. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last 2 days, as Tuesday we saw the stock market rally with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/bR7cJ13) gaining over 1.5%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/fXZYKRS) rising by .81% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/yhDLD82) Industrial gaining 116 points to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kJPWrR3) dropped over 4.5%.

Over 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/BT7vfL0) were advancing with over 200 new highs on above average volume as 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/M7wNJ2Q) finished in the green with Energy, Communications &amp; Technology leading the way while Real Estate was the biggest laggard, as growth companies were [outperforming](https://ibb.co/zbgJRWC) with small-caps gaining more than 1%, while Large-Cap Value was the biggest underperformer.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/Dbb47Jn) is the HEAT MAP from Tuesday, as you can see most big tech companies were gaining with Google, Facebook &amp; Alibaba posting a gain of more than 3% while the biggest laggard was the consumer defensive sector.

Yesterday we also saw the broad stock market finish with all 3 major indexes at all time highs as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/s3D1kvZ) lead the way, up almost 2%, while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9hV9fhV) gained 1.36% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/5B3r1D5) rose 257 points as we saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/P9mtRCH) dropping more than 7% after the removal of this big political event.

We didn’t see that many companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/zZzFY6b), with only 57% of them gaining on average volume though 10 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/cTszSd6) finished in the green with Communications leading the way after a huge spike in Netflix, while the Financial sector was the only one to lose ground as Large-Cap Growth companies [outperformed](https://ibb.co/8mVHFyx) the rest of the market, with Large-Cap value play finishing the day down almost 1%.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/LvGDryV) from yesterday with all big tech names gaining over 2%, as Amazon, Google &amp; Netflix all gained more than 4% while the biggest laggards were seen in the banking &amp; biotech sectors.

We didn’t get to much economic data in the past days, with the most interesting one being the Redbook store [sales](https://ibb.co/zPDB0pj) which improved slightly over last week, as the economic calendar was on pause, awaiting the inauguration of the new US president.

[Today](https://ibb.co/jgJ1frz) we start getting more economic data, as we start off with Jobless Claims early in the morning and close with the Money supply and the FED’s balance sheet. We have to see if last week was just a blip or if the jobless claims will continue to rise even more.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Netflix](https://ibb.co/54tB18g) miss the earnings/share but beating both the revenue, and especially the net adds of subscribers, which came in at 8.5M vs the 6M expected as the biggest streaming platform has passed 200M subscribers. Netflix spiked [yesterday](https://ibb.co/B6zTrSp) more than 16% and closed at an all-time high as they have hinted at a sustainable free cash flow after 2021, as the company will no longer seek to raise debt and is expecting to start stock buybacks in the next years, which will be a great positive for shareholders. Another benefit is their pricing [power](https://ibb.co/s93DdWz) , as they have just increased their most popular subscription plan by 1$ and they can do this even further with minimum risk of losing to much of the subscriber base. I really like 3 companies in this sector (Netflix, Disney &amp; Roku) and I think you should own all 3 of them as this is the future, while the old TV and cinema world is dying.

We also saw [GM](https://ibb.co/hyb3GSB) rising after entering a new strategic relationship with Microsoft. This looks like a nice partnership between the two, with GM using Microsoft’s cloud computing to develop their Cruise venture, which is a subsidiary of GM. And on the other hand, this deal will provide needed capital to Cruise to fast-track their self-driving tech while also making Microsoft, GM’s preferred public cloud partner. I think GM is a very good play on the EV world with massive production capacity and good battery technology.

[Tuesday](https://ibb.co/Q9JYY6D), we saw Jack Ma finally show up after numerous speculations of his disappearance. This is finally some good news for Alibaba and the shares are up over 6% since the spotting, after those speculations led to a continued sell-off in the stock as investors feared China’s Government implications around the company. Alibaba is still a great company that will remain one of the biggest e-commerce companies in this new world, and that is still fairly undervalued right now.

Sports betting soared again after the latest reports of new [records](https://ibb.co/KF1Wy78) in Pennsylvania with over $500M in wagers in December, and is also expected to go live in Michigan on [Friday](https://ibb.co/9spwZMT). Morgan Stanley also [expects](https://ibb.co/3CSLKFT) more states to push to the legalization of sport betting even faster than expected. I personally like companies like DKNG, PENN &amp; WYNN in this sector and I am not planning on selling in the near-future any of them.

We also saw investment banks crushing earnings in the past days with [Goldman](https://ibb.co/6rzBBNh) crushing earnings by almost $5 and an increase of 18% y/y in revenues while Morgan Stanley also [BEAT](https://ibb.co/Lp3dJbp) expectations with an EPS beat of 64 cents and an increase in revenues bigger by over $2B than expected. I think the financial sector is pretty fairly valued right now after the huge run it has seen in the past [months](https://ibb.co/k0wTBVn) and it might only see another boost if rates go up, but that will inversely affect the rest of the stock market, so overall they might be a nice hedge against a potential rise in rates in the next years.

And one final thought is that I think staying invested in the markets is the best way to go as always. Even if the market experiences a short-term pullback or correction, I believe this will be short lived. It doesn’t matter if we see tax increases or not, it doesn’t even matter who is president… You should stay invested and look for the best opportunities in the markets.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/1QxtfSH) is the average SP500 return since 1933 under each president, and both averages are way above 5% for each party, far exceeding inflation expectation for the future, so stay invested, look for the best companies and hold even through tough times and even look to add on any weakness in the markets. Keep in mind that the [SP500](https://ibb.co/DKym45m) return for the first 100days of a new president is usually very good, with the last 3 terms returning at least 5%. We can also see the [DOW](https://ibb.co/VDG7vyC) has returned over 10% on an annualized basis for each of the past 3 terms, which is way over the historical average.

Biden has had the biggest [rally](https://ibb.co/wYZKGmT) between the election date and the inauguration date in the past 70 years, so, don’t expect huge gains like we have had since March, but do stay invested even if the markets start to see a slowdown… Your money is better off being invested rather than siting in a regular bank account where they will do nothing.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/9Z075Fy) markets seem to be pointing to another good day, after Biden’s inauguration and Janet Yellen’s latest remarks on the economy and the need of big spending, while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/rf6B1Z0) are also pointing to a green open, with the DOW leading the way.

personalfinance,Roundpoint mortgage now servicing Quicken and State Farm Bank customers - how to best pay Feb payment with no online account available?,"I’ve searched for this firm but most threads are several years old, so wondering if anyone has more current insight on this.

Got a letter from State Farm Bank yesterday saying “Starting Feb 1 your mortgage is transferred to RoundPoint - here’s their snail mail address.” This is just a notification letter, not a bill with a payment coupon or other other information included which is what I would typically expect with a servicer change. And I also doubt many (any?!) customers are mailing checks - let alone with no payment details included. State Farm Bank's website has no information in my mortgage portal on this transition at all. 

RountPoint’s website says “welcome new customers, you can’t create an account until Feb 5 and it may actually take a few days after that.” 

My mortgage is due Feb 1.  I know federal law gives me a 60 day grace period to pay the old bank, and I also know I have a \~10 day grace period to pay my mortgage, but to be honest, this is all feeling like a bit of a set up to nail me for fees during the transition and have to fight to get the money refunded (and calling RoundPoint to make a payment costs $12…)

personalfinance,Reason for tax refund being vastly different this year (2020 Taxes),"Just finished up entering my information into TurboTax to file my taxes and it looks like my refund is VASTLY different from last year. I'm mostly concerned as it looks like my income and taxes paid seem to have both increased at the same percentage, so I'm trying to understand why my overall tax paid is so much more this year. Also, nothing was adjusted or changed with my (or my wife's) employers on how much tax to withhold from our paychecks.

Summary: My income increased by 17K, but I also paid 1.5K more in federal income tax. To get a rough calculation of percentage of tax paid on my income I divided my ""adjusted income"" (actual income minus standard tax credit) by the true tax paid for the year (federal tax paid on W2s minus refund amount). When looking at that number I get 6.7% for 2019 and 9.3% for 2020. That seems like a pretty substantial difference.....

Here is a table summarizing the amounts from 2019 vs 2020:

|Year|Tax Paid|Income|Tax Credit|Adjusted Income|Refund|True Tax Paid (paid minus refund)|% of tax paid on adjusted income|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2019|7386|103349|28400|74949|2303|5083|.067|
|2020|9040|120122|28800|91322|499|8540|.0935|

To me, it looks like I did something wrong this year (or last year)? Why would my return be so different or the % of tax paid on income be so different?  


Answer: I learned that there is a HUGE different in a flat tax vs progressive tax as well as the difference between a ""federal deduction"" and ""federal credit"". Huge thank you to everyone that took the time to step me through how this actually works. You guys rock!",finance
personalfinance,"Walmart gave me a refund. A month later, they reversed it. Item not received. Chargeback?","So I was doing some Christmas shopping early last month and I wanted to buy an IPad Pro.  I ordered one on Walmart.  However, it never showed up even days after it was supposedly delivered and somebody signed for it.  I called Walmart on December 15th and told them I hadn’t received my item and to ask for any next steps.  The rep was pretty helpful and she said she could process a refund.  I was a bit bummed that I still had to reorder an iPad but I accepted the refund.  I got email confirmation of the refund and it was refunded to my AMEX credit card.  I got the IPad from a different retailer and thought all was well.

This morning(January 20th), I woke up to an email alert that a charge of the same cost as the iPad had gone through on the same AMEX card.  I also received an email from Walmart that the items received in my return did not match the items shipped to me and that they would be charging my original payment method.   I never sent anything for a return since I never received the item.  I called customer service a few times and even spoke to some supervisors and they all gave me the run around about how they couldn’t refund me because the item showed that it had been delivered and signed for.  It was quite frustrating since a refund had already been processed a month ago and now I was being told that I was going to be charged again after I had already bought it from somewhere else.  I don’t think it’s fair for me to pay for two iPads when I only received one, especially since, again, I bought the second one after Walmart had already processed the refund.

I even spoke to Walmart customer service on Twitter.  They told me to dispute this with my bank since they can’t refund me.  This sounds like a chargeback, which I thought was a bit shady.  Don’t merchants hate chargebacks? Why would they tell me to do a chargeback? Are they just misleading me to get me to make a misstep? Will they just provide the FedEx documentation in which they claim that someone signed for the package and have the dispute resolved in their favor?
Should I do a dispute with AMEX? What dispute code should I use and what evidence should I provide? Or should I keep trying to work through customer service to hopefully get the refund reinstated? Or something else?

I really need the money back since the IPad was well over $1000.  I can’t just let it go.",finance

personalfinance,Should I keep renting in VHCOL area or buy somewhere else?,"I'm sure this question has been asked plenty on here, but I did want to start a new post to get some dedicated advice since I couldn't find anything related in search.

**Current Situation**

My partner &amp; I (late 20s) are currently renting an apartment in a VHCOL area for $4500 a month. With both of us having to work from home for much longer, we'll need to upgrade our studio to a 2 bedroom for $5500 just to have the necessary space. We have around 500k in savings currently, most of it cash. We both have stable income and have a combined income of just shy of 400k annually. We plan on moving out of the country in 5 years. No debt at all for either of us, we're maxing out 401ks already and put money every month into various ETFs. We have not owned a home before.

**What we are considering**

With having to upgrade our space in the VHCOL area, we are considering if we should stay and up our rent or buy a house somewhere else in the country (our employers are good with us permanently working remotely). We would have enough cash on hand to put down 250k and get a cheap mortgage for the rest (great credit for both of us + interest rates being super low right now). We are trying to figure out if it would make sense to buy a house in a medium cost of living area with a healthy and growing real estate market or up our rent in the VHCOL. 

**Considerations**

After doing some initial research, we can expect the real estate market in the area we are looking at to go up further over the next years, with the annual appreciation being forecasted around 5% - 6%, we are calculating more conservatively here and assume only 3% on average. We figured that because our rent is so high in our current area, we could save some good money with a decent mortgage on monthly payments, even including repairs etc. With the market expected to go up, we should be able to flip it for at least a slight profit after closing costs in 5 years from now. At the same time, if we would put the 250k down payment into the market and would expect a yearly return of 6%, while it is a higher percentage, the total value that appreciates would only be 250k instead of let's say 1.2M of a house, thus the buying-a-house route likely yielding higher returns after the limited time horizon of 5 years.

Would love any input on the above, especially the considerations. Wondering if the back-of-napkin-math sounds reasonable or if we're missing a big consideration in any of it?",finance
personalfinance,Using Roth IRA Savings for Home Down Payment (strange circumstance)?,"32F that moved from a super HCOL area with a bad/okay salary to a super LCOL area with a pretty great salary (private sector consulting to federal).  Down to the final $20k of student loan and bad decision credit card debt.  Besides 3-month emergency fund, I mostly focused on throwing money into my retirement accounts (work 401k/TSP and a Roth IRA Savings account at my bank).
 
Roth IRA was left in a certificate at bank and only made maybe 1% average over the time (&gt;5 years) I left it there because I was afraid of the market.  I’m thinking of using $10k of my Roth IRA as a first time home buyer and finally transferring the rest to my Vanguard Roth account. I feel like I’m not losing too much if I did use this money for a down payment since I never had any of that fabled ‘compound interest’ on these Roth funds. Also, though I could be minimizing everything to bulk up my down payment fund, I somehow can’t stop myself from throwing money into my TSP (traditional and Roth), maxing out my Vanguard Roth IRA for ’21, and attacking my debts. 
 
Actually affording a monthly mortgage payment wouldn’t be too difficult with my current salary, and I was preapproved up to $300k on a 3% conventional, but it is the down payment is what’s holding me back (I have the 3% but I’m worried about all the other contingency costs like closing and inspections).  My lease is up in July ’21.  I can potentially save up another $5k towards my down payment in this time period.  The extra $10k would really help, and I think I would make up the ‘loss’ since I can actually max out my TSP and Roth IRA in actual brokerage and 401k accounts over the next 20+ years I am working. I just don’t want to keep renting since I want the freedom to have my own space and actually settle down.

Bitcoin,After an hour with the bank President I think I made believers out of them,"My friend's Mom works in a small bank and knows that I'm interested in Bitcoin so when they had an issue come up at the bank involving a different customer I was called into the President's office for a meeting.  I was surprised that both President and Vice-President of the bank were there and they quickly admitted that they had only heard about Bitcoin in the news but that they didn't really know anything about it.

I talked with them about Bitcoin's origins after the banking crisis and it's potential use as a reserve currency or a hedge against inflation.  I described the Fed's policy on quantitative easing and they leaned in to listen closely.  We talked about how Bitcoin differs from gold in terms of utility and security, but is similar in terms of scarcity and the properties from which its value is determined.  I glossed over how all of their account records are centralized and shared only with their partner institutions, but introduced them to the decentralized nature of blockchain and how the open, distributed ledger of Bitcoin is much less anonymous than some state actors would like them to believe.

By the end of our hour-long meeting they were thanking me for my time and offering me a consultancy fee!  I told them I'm happy to come back and talk anytime because we still have important concepts such as mining and other blockchain applications to go over.

We bought our house with a conventional mortgage just over a year ago and have a 3.75% interest rate.

Closing costs would run us about $4,000 - since we only bought the house about a year ago, the title company is offering us a pretty good discount for using them again. 

If we refinance to another 30 year at 2.75%, we’d save just over $300/month but would add a year to the mortgage. Right now, I’m already paying an extra $200 or so every month towards the principal to help lower the interest paid long term.

My question is this... which refinancing situation makes the most sense (if any)? Should we go for the 30 year and save money in the short term that we could split between continuing to pay down the principal and investing in our retirement funds? Or should we just go for the 20 year, which has a lower interest rate and wouldn’t change our financial situation much on a monthly basis?

I don’t know if we’ll be in the house for the full term of the mortgage, but we do have young kids and will probably stay for at least several years since they’re in school. We are already maxing out our 401Ks and have smaller Roth accounts and 529s on the side. Already paid off cars and student loans, so the house is our only debt right now.",finance

I’ve got a 401k, fully vested, from my first real job that I had for less than a year in 2015 and I’d like to figure out what to do with it. It has a little over 9K. 

At my current job, I’ve got a pension and a 401k with employer match that’s sitting at about 56k. I don’t plan on touching that.  

My partner and I are trying to buy a house this year, so I’m tempted to pay the taxes and add whatever is left to our down payment/incidentals. 

Another option is to open a Roth and put it in there to allow my partner (who works for a small law firm that doesn’t offer a 401k) an opportunity to contribute to a retirement account, with the 9k as a base to start compound interest. 

Or I could leave it where it is and choose a more aggressive fund. 

I could roll it over into my retirement account, but it’s a public fund (I work for the federal government - TSP) so it won’t count toward years of service or anything and it seems like such a small amount that wouldn’t make a huge dent in my ultimate retirement.

personalfinance,What does Schwab get from me having an IRA with them?,"**Schwab provides me a service and I don't understand what they're getting out of the arrangement. The rest of this post is my musings on what might be going on.**

Every month I put a bit of money in and immediately use it to by a vanguard index fund. So there's some money in the account as cash, but it's somewhere around $100, always less than the cost of one unit of index fund (one share?). So they get some benefit from that money, but otherwise, they get nothing directly from me - I'm almost certain I've never directly paid a fee to them, though things are kinda confusing and it's possible I'm missing something. And they also pay me, I think, a pretty decent interest rate on the money I have sitting there, and I imaging the service they're providing me costs more than the service an online bank is providing me, so it doesn't seem like this should be the whole story. Not to mention the fact that I imagine people tend to keep more money in bank accounts than as cash in retirement accounts. 

The other possibilities that I'm imagining is that Vanguard, for example, pays Schwab so that Schwab lets us buy Vanguard funds without charging some kind of transaction fee, but that seems like it would be an enormously complicated situation because it isn't just the big financial companies trading around money. I can also buy just single stocks for free. 

Or maybe it's some legal requirement. They have to offer these accounts to us regular joes at a bit of a loss, if they want to be allowed to... I dunno... sell their own mutual funds... or offer some other kind of accounts that will be making them money. 

Or maybe it's just advertising. I'm using Schwab and I have no complaints, they seem chill and helpful, so maybe I'm gonna want to buy their mutual funds which does make them money.",finance

personalfinance,Seeking advice re: balancing inheritance with low interest debt,"Location is Ontario, Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a business that has been in operation for 8 years. It's pretty much a one-person retail operation and I stay afloat, but don't make a lot of money. When I started the business, I was loaned money from family members to do so, from their line of credit. The loan is technically a personal loan at this point. The amount is about $120,000 and the interest rate is 2.9%. I pay the interest every month, plus a bit extra, without issue, but I realistically do not have a clear path to paying back the principal short of chipping away at it for a decade.  I should also mention that I'm not at  particular risk of defaulting on the loan, despite the state of retail right now. I am also in my 30s, have a long term partner, and would love to think about buying property in the next few years, but that is, until now, not looking like being in the cards.

&amp;#x200B;

The family members in question have recently sold property and have some money. They have very generously offered to, effectively, give me an advance on my inheritance and to receive the full amount of the loan to either a) pay it off in full or b) pay it off significantly and take/invest some of that money for life investments (buy a home, raise a child, etc) over the next few years. This is a clearly a big problem solver for me, but I am looking for input on the smartest way to proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm of two minds. On the one hand, it always feels better to be debt-free before you can think about any large investments or purchases. It would be a large weight off my (and my family's realistically) mind to get rid of the debt entirely and move forward.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I am unlikely to come into an amount of money in the foreseeable future that equals a home deposit, and I would love to have it available for that. The interest rate on the original loan is so low, that I wonder if I could safely invest a large portion of the funds into an account that would pay me a better interest rate than the debt. So for example, if I pay off $70,000 of the loan, invest $50,000 safely and have it available should the loan ever need to be paid off in future, in an emergency. A remaining balance of 50k on the loan is a lot easier to think about paying off through normal means. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope I've articulated the situation concisely. I am of course going to consult with either my accountant or with an investment advisor, but I'd love to hear if there's anything non-obvious that I should consider. Thank you for your input.",finance
personalfinance,Time to tap into home equity?,"Family of 4 and I've been struggling trying to recover my credit due to long term financial mistakes on my part. Month after month my debt was increasing significantly. As of earlier this summer I owed $95k in debt. This was multiple credit cards. It seems like an obscene amount and as I dug into it over the years it was from many different things. Having two kids without a lot of savings, and 2020 Covid struggles didn't help as some things hit those cards. Medical issues over the past few years, even with benefits, were a large chunk of the expenses. The real killer that kind of caught me unaware was the significant interest being paid. Years of making minimum payments made me sink further into debt and I would get slammed with $800 interest fees on one card alone every month.

I won't go into too much detail here because I changed a lot of things thanks to some feedback on this subreddit. I did the following:

* Reviewed all weekly / monthly / annual subscriptions. Things like Netflix and other entertainment, Spotify, etc. I cancelled everything. Even if I thought maybe I really needed something I could at least go without it for a little while.
* Reviewed my electric, gas, and internet bills. Tried to figure out what I could do to reduce all of them and limit expenses. Reduced my internet bill as low as I could.
* Contacted home insurance and car insurance to renegotiate. Home insurance was already good but car insurance I ended up saving $1,000 per year.
* Sold both cars and bought one used and leased a low mileage under a good deal. Believe it or not this ended up being a significant savings.  Leasing is not a wise decision but there were too many costs with my last car. This is now saving me $500 per month.
* Created a food plan for the week and reduced eating out. Easier to do with the pandemic but at the most I will grab a coffee at Dunkin on rare occasion now.
* Sold a lot of things on Ebay to which turned into a good hobby to reduce clutter and earn some extra cash.
* Started using Upwork as a second job finding gigs to earn some extra cash

.Nothing I did was a significant savings up front but over the past few months it was a huge help. I'm down to $58k in debt now which I think is still a crazy amount but at least it is going in the right direction. I make an excellent salary at the moment and want to do whatever I can to get my debt to zero so that I can start saving like a normal responsible person. 

I have an upcoming bonus that should be around $12k after tax that I intend to put 100% towards debt. We have zero vacation plans this year and again the pandemic helps with this so I am using that as an excuse to keep things cheap this year.

My credit score has jumped up about 45 points now and what I am looking for advice on is if this is a good time to look into tapping into my home equity. I currently owe $200k on my house and it is valued at $340k. I didn't want to do anything with it until my spending was under control and using meal planning, and budgeting  (I use [Mint.com](https://Mint.com)). Also, I have done some balance transfers to reduce interest rate on cards and have stuck to one credit card that I put charges on and pay off to $0 each month as a spending card. Now it is appealing to tap into my house equity and pay off the remaining debt after my bonus is used on some of that debt.

  
Is that a wise move at this point? Any feedback is appreciated.",finance

We’re trying to decide if it is better to refinance to at 15 year mortgage with just about the same monthly payment we make now or to go with a lower monthly payment and invest the rest. 

The details:

-We have 25 years left on our mortgage with a balance of about $235,000 and rate of 3.35%
- Our house is currently worth between 375,000 and 400,000 (we paid 320,000)
- We are planning a major renovation in 5 years and this is our forever home
- We have a fully funded emergency fund, a house repair fund, and are on our way to a solid retirement fund (a bit behind but we have a plan to catch up). We also have college funds for our kids that should have enough for state schools. 
- We are starting an investment fund to help pay for the renovation with a 20k start 
- We will need to take a home equity loan for the rest of renovation, which maybe around $250 k but will likely make our house worth 600k

At the same time, it also presents opportunities for states and non-state actors looking to
circumvent the current financial system and undermine American interests. For example, the
Central Bank of China just issued its first digital currency.

Dr. Yellen, what do you view as the potential threats and benefits these innovations and
technologies will have on U.S. national security? Do you think more needs to be done to ensure
we have appropriate safeguards and regulations for digital and cryptocurrencies in place?


Answer: I think it important we consider the benefits of cryptocurrencies and other digital
assets, and the potential they have to improve the efficiency of the financial system. At the
same time, we know they can be used to finance terrorism, facilitate money laundering, and
support malign activities that threaten U.S. national security interests and the integrity of
the U.S. and international financial systems. I think we need to look closely at how to
encourage their use for legitimate activities while curtailing their use for malign and illegal
activities. If confirmed, I intend to work closely with the Federal Reserve Board and the
other federal banking and securities regulators on how to implement an effective regulatory
framework for these and other fintech innovations.

Based off a mortgage calculator I’m seeing mortgage, tax, and insurance coming out to $538 a month plus the HOA of $425 total being $963 a month 30 year fixed. 

I’m basically looking to pick your guys’ brains and determine the pros and cons and figured anything I haven’t considered. My ultimate goal is to afford a home not a condo, but I’m wondering if buying a condo will help accelerate me in reaching at goal. At $963 monthly condo and potentially an equal or greater apartment rent does it make sense. Are there tax benefits or draw backs. Is there a time frame that makes more sense such as less than 5 years or greater than? I’m also located in CA, USA.

Thank you in advance. I appreciate any fed back you guys can give me.",finance

personalfinance,Buy car cash or finance?,"Hi,

I’m saving up about $6-8k/month after taxes and living expenses. I’ve got two big projects: buying a house and buying a car. The car would be between $30k and $60k, depending on whether I decide to splurge or not. The house, depending on location, requires a down payment of about $150k, of which I have about $80k saved up for (25% down payment, banks are crazy here).

I’ve grown up in a modest environment, so not I nor anyone I know has ever been in a position to be able buy a $60k car cash. I’m not bragging, I’m trying to explain why I have trouble figuring this out.

The question is: does it make more sense to finance the car or to buy it cash. The car is a requirement to get the house because housing will require me to move out of public transport range of my clients.

On the one hand, not having any debt is appealing as it means I’m not under pressure about finding clients. On the other hand, it pushes back my house acquisition project back by about a year, which doesn’t make sense because the car is only needed if I have the house.

Side note: I’m paying negative interest rate of about 0.75% on anything above $30k. Car finance would be $22k down payment and 2.6% interest rate over 6 years.

personalfinance,Rolling over funds to an IRA and now picking stocks,"In my old job I was paying into a 401(a) ($15,000 total).  In my new job I am paying into a 401(k) to get a company match.  I would like to roll over my funds from my old job into a separate IRA that I opened with Fidelity because I think that I will learn a lot about investing.

Investing strategy: because I am younger and because interest rates are probably going to rise and bond prices fall, I want to invest 100% in stocks (70% U.S. and 30% Foreign).

Some questions I have:

1. I don't see why I should purchases ETFs and pay a fee.  Could I not instead of purchasing an ETF (like VTI which tracks the market) open it up, see what stocks are there, and purchase the stocks myself?  I assume the fund managers routinely do things like ask, ""Do we want to be in petroleum right now with global warming and new regulations coming?"" and then probably sell off those stocks and re-allocate that % of the fund to something they deem a better investment.  I feel like: A) I would have fund doing this. B) I would like to try to do it and thereby learn. C) Again, couldn't I just copy them and change my %'s in my portfolio myself? It seems like a waste to give up a % of my potential earnings when I could just do it myself.  I've never purchased a stock before so please correct me if I'm wrong.

2. Should I diversify my portfolio based on industry/market (e.g. Health or Tech) and stick to a max percentage for each say 10%.  Example, say I did 10% tech, 10% health, 10% real estate.. What do people usually do? Or could I just say, ""I'm a tech guy, I believe in tech,"" and then just diversify within that one field (or maybe just a couple fields like tech and real-estate) and just own like 10% Apple, 10% Microsoft, 10% AMD...

3.  When I purchase more stock stock should I purchase across my portfolio. Say I have 100 dollars, should I spend it with a percentage going to the percentage of each stock % I decide in my portfolio.  That way I am maintaining my desired % for each company, or should I spend my money to return me the most stock by seeing which prices are low.  Then later if some stocks get to be too high a % in my portfolio I can trim them back?

4.  Dividends seem very intriguing.  Because I deduct from my paycheck into my 401(k) to get a company match I don't know that I will invest regularly in this IRA.  I feel like earning dividends and re-investing them would be the best long-term growth for this account, considering that I do not want to really risk lots of money in random cheap stocks that might boom or might bust.

5. Off the last question, if I was to invest in dividend earning stocks, would it not make more sense to have a Roth IRA? I'm required to rollover from a 401(a) to a traditional but I believe that I could do a conversion? Would this be beneficial, especially if I'm looking for dividends?

6.  This is going to vary person to person, but what is typically a healthy amount of speculative stock in a portfolio? If I put like 10% in a company that I think could be big in the future, is that too much? I know that it varies based on a person's worth, but how can I start to compute this because I think there's got to be some amount there, not too much, not too little, if I'm going to do this correctly.",finance
personalfinance,Any hidden downsides of using a cash out refinance to invest?,"With interest rates on mortgages being so low I'm planning on refinancing my house. Due to a combination of principal payments and appreciation my house is worth about 600k more than my remaining principal. Looking at my options I can take cash out with my refinance of up to a couple hundred thousand without it increasing my interest rate above the 2.8 it would be even without cash out. The loan is conventional 30 year fixed and there would be no PMI. Naively it seems like the right thing to do is take out the cash and then invest it in my portfolio, which is a mix of different index funds. Long term returns should easily be able to beat 2.8%, so I should come out ahead. The biggest down side I see is risk. It's possible return will be lower, possibly even negative, and the shorter the term the greater the possibility. I can't honestly say I know how long I'll stay in the house. It depends on job market mostly. I think I can tolerate the risk in exchange for the expected return. I know I can't deduct the interest from my taxes, but I anticipate usually using the standard deduction anyway until whatever the next tax change is, but I don't have much hope in predicting when and what will change there. Is there anything major I'm missing? How should a loan like this affect asset allocation if at all?",finance
stocks,Complete PLTR DD ahead of Demo Day (Valuation Included),"# Company Overview

Palantir technologies is an American software company founded in 2003 and headquartered in Colorado that specializes in big data analytics.

They started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large datasets.

Later they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects.

Palantir has now developed two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham which serves primarily the intelligence community, and Palantir Foundry for commercial purposes.

Palantir went public on September 30, 2020 through a direct public offering. The company opened for trading at $10 a share, giving it an initial valuation of about $22B. As of the date of this publishing, Palantir stock is trading at $25.98, with a Market Cap of $44.26B, and 52-w high of $33.50.

# Understanding the Business

**Value Proposition**

Institutions often rely on various single-purpose software solutions which support the specific workflows of their operations such as customer relationship management and financial planning. Each new software creates a new silo within an already fragmented data landscape.

When it comes to making operational decisions, institutions are left spending significant time and resources to unify their data. By the time the question is answered, the underlying data may be stale.

A central operating system for data

Palantir’s software allows institutions to reorganize the various independent data systems that support their operations into a unified data asset which facilitates advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration.

Augmenting existing data systems, not displacing

At a large manufacturer, Palantir does not build machine production ERP software, instead, Palantir’s software connects their production ERP data with other relevant systems. By integrating existing solutions into our central operating system, organizations can choose to maintain key historic investments without having to rebuild their entire data infrastructure.

Making data actionable

Gotham and Foundry enable their users to put data in context, using language that people understand. They transform data into objects that make sense to everyone in an organization. Data is represented not as cells in a spreadsheet, or exports from a single system, but as entities, events, relationships, consequences, and decisions.

Their ontology management systems allow organizations to create their own description of the world, starting from a set of basic components: objects (such as people or events), properties (attributes), and relationships that tie objects together.

Understand the history of data and decisions

Palantir’s software tracks each piece of data in the system to its source and records all changes that have been made to a dataset or data object. Users can distinguish between data derived from a source system or data created by another user, and if a dataset has been updated/modified, the user can also identify the fact that the data was updated, the action, and the logic used to perform the update. This allows users to easily explain where the data, logic, and decisions originate.

Enable users to work together even in the most complex circumstances

The versioning and branching capabilities of their software enables thousands of users across departments and organizations to work on the same datasets, and actively collaborate on new models and analysis.

Users can safely branch a view or a dataset into an isolated sandbox where the user is able to build or experiment as they wish and may merge successful experiments back into the main dataset. Each version of a dataset is saved so that it remains protected and available for concurrent access.

Enforce rigorous and reliable data protection

Palantir’s software was designed to embrace the complexity of security clearances, institutional boundaries, and varying data sensitivity levels. Organizations are able to secure each piece of information and define the privileges users require to perform a specific action on a specific resource. The central authorization system creates an audit trial of user activity which allows oversight officials to monitor behavior, identify potential violations, and investigate anomalies.

AI/ML and operational change through data-driven decisions

Their software infrastructure also enables organizations to combine simple math, third-party black box models, and machine trained models of the different components of their businesses in a graph made up of nodes (for example, each node can be a manufacturing unit and distribution site in a supply chain) where each model can describe the properties of a node, resulting in an interactive digital simulation of an entire supply chain.

The AI/ML interface surfaces critical information about models, including plots, validation statistics, model stages, parameters and metadata.

**Revenue Streams**

Palantir’s revenue streams consists of their two main software, Gotham which was designed primarily for the defense and intelligence sectors, and Foundry for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector, for example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem.

Currently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sector.

It is important to note that for the government sector Palantir has to participate through a procurement process against other contractors who also sell custom tools.

Gotham

Its main tools include:

Graph – a whiteboard like interface for users to explore, visualize, and interact with entities, their properties and their networks. Users can create or edit data in the graph and resolve duplicate objects to ensure robust data quality.

Gaia – lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.

Dossier – is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.

Video – an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data. Users can review video footage in the platform as well as enhance raw footage with geospatial information and overlays based on other data sources.

Ava – an AI system which scans billions of data points in order to proactively assist investigations by alerting users to new, hard-to-find potential connections.

Mobile – brings Gotham into the field via mobile devices to provide support to real-time, distributed operations.

Foundry

Monocle – enables users to understand data lineage using a graphical interface. Users can explore upstream dependencies or downstream consumers of data, as well as trace logic for a dataset back to its source.

Contour – enables top down exploration of large-scale data. Users may filter, join, and visualize datasets to answer analytical questions and publish the results as a report or new dataset that will automatically update with the underlying datasets.

Object Explorer – allows users to interact with data represented as objects – like customers, equipment, or plants – rather than rows in a table.

Fusion – Foundry’s spreadsheet environment.

Reports – allows users to publish their work from other applications in a document that dynamically updates as the underlying data changes.

I strongly suggest watching [Palantir’s demo day](https://palantir.events/livedemoday) on January 26 to gain a better understanding of the tools provided by both software.

Palantir’s Software Example Use Cases

* Humanitarian workers plan disaster relief missions following a natural disaster.
* Investigators receive alerts about open cases when new data about a suspect enters any system.
* Automotive plant engineers detect defects at their station while vehicles are still on assembly line.
* District attorney map out complex criminal networks in order to decide where to focus resources.
* Scientists use a unified view of cancer patients to personalize care.

# Industry

**Market Size**

As of Q3 2020 Palantir had 132 customers across 36 industries around the world.

Currently, according to Palantir’s own estimates the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for their software across the commercial and government sectors around the world is approximately $119B. The TAM for the government sector is $63B and for the commercial sector $56B. Within the government TAM, $37B is international and $26B is domestic.

According to [Statista’s market forecast](https://www.statista.com/outlook/14000/100/software/worldwide) revenue in the software market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 7.4% between 2021 and 2025.

**Industry Fundamentals**

Embrace digital transformation or risk getting disrupted

It has become evident that companies which embrace digital transformation persist, while businesses that fail to transform or transform too late will disappear. According to a [Harvard Business Review report](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/07/digital-transformation-is-racing-ahead-and-no-industry-is-immune-2) digital disruption extinguished 52% of Fortune 500 companies between 2000 and 2017.

We have repeatedly seen that pathbreaking institutions that use data to transform their core operations are the ones that win.

Buy or Build

Institutions often resort to the default approach of attempting to build a custom solution themselves. However, according to a recent [report by The Standish Group](https://www.standishgroup.com/about), of 50,000 custom software projects from more than a 1,000 organizations, only 23% that were started from scratch were completed on time and on budget, while 56% of all projects were either overdue or over budget. Additionally, only 12% of organization-wide digital transformation projects were considered successful.

Additionally, according to the [NewVantage Partners 2020 Big Data and AI Executive Survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005280/en/NewVantage-Partners-Releases-2020-Big-Data-and-AI-Executive-Survey), business adoption of Big Data continues to be a struggle, with 73.4% of firms citing this as an ongoing challenge.

Palantir provides the example of a U.S. Military department which spent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.

Crisis &amp; Instability

A [survey from AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/news/agents-of-transformation-report-2020/) reports that 71% of IT professionals said COVID-19 has caused their businesses to implement digital transformation projects within weeks rather than the typical months or years, and 65% of respondents said they implemented digital transformation projects during the pandemic that had been previously dismissed.

# Competitive Landscape &amp; Risks

**Competition**

Palantir’s main competitors include:

Internal software development – At first, organizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms with the help of consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source software, and sizable internal IT resources.

And two software companies with very similar business models:

[Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/) – founded 23 years ago and based in California, Alteryx is a public company with FY 2019 revenues of $418M and more than 1,290 employees. Alteryx is focused on providing solutions to the commercial sector and as of 2019 they had approximately 6,100 customers in more than 90 countries. Amongst their main customers are Chevron Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, Nasdaq Inc, Netflix, salesforce.com, Toyota, Twitter, and Uber Technologies.

[Semantic AI](https://www.semantic-ai.com/company) – is a privately-held software firm based in California, Semantic AI was founded in 2001 and after 9/11 it was used as “platform by choice” by the intelligence community. Similar to Palantir, they have gained significant adoption in the Defense and Law Enforcement communities and have recently launched their enterprise intelligence platform.

**Competitive Strategy**

Customer acquisition

Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy targets large-scale, hard-to-execute opportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the long sales cycle associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition.

Additionally, in the first phase of Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy, they provide minimal risk to their customers through short-term pilot deployments of their software at no or low cost to them. As the customer increases the usage of the platform across its operations, Palantir’s revenue and margins grow significantly.

Software engineers on the front line

In order to fully address the most complex challenges of their customers, Palantir sends their Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs), in order to experience and understand the problem firsthand. By working alongside their customers, FDEs gain a deep understanding of their needs, how and why they make decisions, and how they calculate trade-offs.

Leverage experience in both private and public sector

To the commercial sector, Palantir offers software which was designed to be secure enough to handle national secrets and stable enough to support soldiers’ wartime decisions. To the government sector, they offer software which incorporates and reflects Palantir’s experience of working across 36 industries and years spent in the field.

Palantir’s strategic relationships last for years

By the end of 2019, Palantir’s top 20 customers had an average relationship of 6.6 years.

Palantir has chosen sides

Their software is exclusively available to the United States and its allies in Europe and around the world.

**Growth Strategy**

Become the industry default

Palantir’s current and potential customers are some of the largest enterprise in the world. They intend to broaden the platform’s reach through partnerships that establish their platforms as the central operating system for entire industries.

This model has been successfully implemented in the aviation industry where, through its partnership with Airbus, work with more than a 100 airlines and 15 airline suppliers.

Continue to grow their direct sales force

Palantir’s decision to grow their sales force in recent years has resulted in a number of significant new customers, including Fortune 100 companies as well as a number of leading government agencies in the U.S. and other countries.

Increase their reach with existing customers

To drive revenue growth at an account, Palantir uses a number of sales and marketing strategies which include:

* Creating partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer’s four walls into the operations of their partners and suppliers
* Selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities
* Selling strategic implementations of Palantir’s software against specific use cases

For Q3 2020 Palantir’s average revenue per customer had increased 38% compared to the same period last year.

Become the default operating system for the U.S. government

Palantir’s software has been tested and improved over years of use across industries and various government agencies in the U.S. who have been able to deploy Palantir’s platforms rapidly with minor configurations.

Palantir already works with government agencies such as the U.S. Army, Navy, and Airforce, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, FDA, and SEC.

New methods of customer acquisition and partnership

As Palantir considers growing into new markets outside the U.S., they may consider entering into partnerships with strategic organizations that operate in their target market.

For example, in Japan they launched a partnership with SOMPO Holdings, Inc.. one of the largest insurance companies in the country, to help grow their commercial and government business in the Japanese market.

**Moats**

R&amp;D expenditure

Since 2008 and up to 2019, they have invested a total of $1.5B in research and development.

Network effects

Every data source that is integrated to the system, and every action taken by a developer, data scientist, or operational user, is made accessible to all other users at the institution.

At a financial services customer, network effects enabled Palantir’s software to scale from a single use case to more than 70 workstreams across compliance, front office, risk, and internal audit desks. Each new application was built on a shared foundation of integrated systems, user groups, and existing applications.

Additionally, each customer on their platform generates network effects. Palantir can leverage the knowledge acquired and capabilities developed for a customer within a specific industry and incorporate it into the platform for the benefit of all customers across industries. For example, capabilities of Palantir’s platform that were originally developed to help optimize production of crude oil, has been adapted by manufacturers of medical equipment to optimize supply chains.

In addition to supporting individual institutions, Palantir’s platforms have the capacity to become the central operating system for entire industries and sectors.

Regulation

Section 2377 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (“FASA”) requires the U.S. government to first consider readily available commercial items before pursuing acquisition of custom developed items. Palantir’s software is a commercial item within the meaning of the law. A custom government solution built by a consulting company, is not.

In 2016, Palantir won a lawsuit against the Army, challenging its decision to pursue a software development contract for the replacement of its battlefield intelligence system. In 2018, the ruling was upheld, and the US Court of Appeals ordered the Army to consider existing commercially available products. After testing real products, the Army selected Palantir’s software to deploy tactical units across the force.

**Other Relevant Risks**

Privacy and civil liberties

Palantir is not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. They build software platforms that enable customers to integrate their own data – data they already have. Palantir claims to be committed to ensuring their software is effective as possible while preserving individuals’ fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties.

Customer concentration

For the 9 months ended September 2020, Palantir’s top 3 customers accounted for 27% of their revenue.

**Income Statement**

[https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4](https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4)

Palantir’s revenue has had a CAGR of 68.8% since inception, and 27.6% for the last three years.

For the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:

* Revenue of the government sector increased by $177M (73%), of the increase 84% was from existing customers.
* Revenue of the commercial sector increased by $80M (30%).
* COGS, Sales and Marketing, R&amp;D, and SG&amp;A expense increases consist primarily of an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to recognition of cumulative stock-based compensation expense upon the Direct Listing related to the company’s restricted stock units. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in traveling expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Palantir uses a Contribution Margin as a key business metric to evaluate their financial performance, which has improved consistently over the last 4 quarters. In short, by achieving a higher contribution margin, the increase in revenue required for Palantir to break-even is smaller.

**Valuation Results**

[https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv](https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv)

The result of my [Valuation Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMy8dkNFib7h-FkFtPZMf9bhH8DjE3XKf5t-HB_c5eY/edit?usp=sharing) indicate a **Value of Equity per share of $28.38**

Mayor assumptions of the valuation model include:

* By 2031, Palantir will gain 6% Market Share of a $119B market that grows 7.4% annually. This implies Palantir’s revenue will grow at a CAGR of 30% for 10 years.
* Palantir will achieve US GAAP operating margins of 23% by 2031.
* Terminal year growth rate of 5% and WACC of 7.5% after reaching a Beta of 1.0.
* Risk free rate of 2.5% and Equity Risk Premium of 5.5%

Follow the link to view the valuation model, it include references to all assumptions. Please feel free to download it, play with it, and share your conclusions.

**Investment Decision**

I believe that at its current price PLTR is a buy opportunity for the following reasons:

* The model’s revenue and margin growth assumptions are achievable and likely to be exceeded if PLTR successfully executes their growth strategies.
* The industry is driven by strong fundamentals, organizations that do not embrace digital transformation and big data will cease to exist.
* Even though Palantir’s moat is currently narrow, it could expand significantly if they are successful in establishing their software as a central operating system for various industries.",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Two Years in a Row,"In January of 2020, I completed a refinance with my current mortgage company in which I kept the same loan term (28years) and dropped my interest rate by 1/2 point from 3.875 to 3.375. This dropped my monthly payment by $60. The only fee that was rolled into the mortgage was the FHA fee, which was between 1-2 thousand dollars I believe. The savings on the interest more than outweighed that fee I believe. 

Recently, my mortgage company has been reaching out again with the same deal. At first I ignored it, but today I called them, interested in how low rates had dropped. The person from the company said that they could lower my mortgage by a full point from 3.375 to 2.375, saving me $100 a month and around 30 grand over the life of the loan if it reached maturity. I would keep my same loan term (now 27 years). I would again only have to roll the FHA fee into the loan, a cost of $1200. They will cover all other fees since they already service the loan.

My question is, is it a no brainer to take this deal, or is there something I’m missing? The loan officer said they want to keep me from refinancing with another company since their company isn’t in the business of selling loans.",finance
personalfinance,Laddering CD a good idea?,"I’d like to start saving more, my credit union has a Laddering CD which they call “short term certificate”.

The interest rates start at .30% and go up .05% until the 60 month host .55%

“Laddering protects against the risk of interest rate fluctuations and provides a reliable flow of interest income. Owners have access to a portion of their funds at staggered intervals without triggering early withdrawal penalties. 

To start ""laddering"" your STCs, divide the total sum you wish to invest by five and open five STCs with different maturity dates: 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months.

investing,Big 5 Sporting Goods (NASDAQ: BGFV),"For anyone looking for a new idea to add to their portfolio -

Big 5 Sporting Goods (**BGFV)** is a sporting goods retailer in the western U.S. with 431 stores as of the end of 3Q2020 (\~50% in California but has presence in Washington, Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah as well). BGFV’s average store size is 11K square feet, so think of these as smaller scale versions of Dick’s Sporting Goods stores (35-45K square feet per store) but larger than a Hibbett Sports store (5.6K square feet average size). Despite BGFV’s relatively small market cap (\~$260M), this is a very real business with very real earnings that is - I believe - significantly undervalued.

1. BGFV has been a huge beneficiary of the stay-at-home lifestyle following the initial lockdown measures. Same-store sales declined 11% in 1Q2020 and 4% in 2Q2020 (partial lockdown period) but jumped to a +15% increase in 3Q2020 as people staying at home purchased “hardgoods” (pretty much anything that’s not apparel or footwear), which represent \~50% of BGFV’s sales. Breaking down the 15% increase in sales in 3Q2020 – hardgood sales grew by 38% while footwear sales declined 19% and apparel sales decline 8%. BGFV posted preliminary 4Q2020 earnings last week which showed same store sales growth of +11% for the quarter. Management typically talks about how the next quarter is trending during the earnings call, so we should be able to learn more about January / February in the Q4 call as well.

Obviously the COVID benefit won’t last forever, but there still seems to be a \~4-6+ month tail until there’s widespread vaccinations in the US. Even still, a portion of former gymgoers might prefer to work out from home instead, avoiding crowds and touching equipment that’s been used by others and not always sanitized between each use. (As a side note, BGFV is a seller of guns and ammo, which means they like benefitted there as well with the last few months of unrest in the US...)

2. BGFV’s balance sheet is in the best position its ever been dating to at least 2002 (per financial statements). 3Q2020 marks the first time that BGFV operated without debt (though, to be fair, the last several years have only utilized a revolver with very cheap interest rates primarily to fund working capital). Said differently, liquidity (measured as cash + net working capital – debt) of $170M is the best it’s ever been since at least 2002. This compares to $126M at the end of 2019 and $97M at the end of 2018. Cash on the balance sheet at the end of 3Q2020 was $56M (press release from last week mentioned in increase to $65M as of the end of December) compared to the $5-8M cash BGFV typically operates with - more on this below.

3. VALUATION. This is the main reason to buy for me. As of close today, BGFV’s market capitalization sits at $262M. Netting out the ton of cash sitting on the balance sheet, enterprise value is only $197M. This compares to sales for the 12 months ending December 2020 of $1,041M, implying a 0.19x enterprise value / sales multiple. This is *very* low. The same multiple is 0.42x for Dick’s and 0.55x for Hibbett. I'm personally not a fan of sales multiples, however BGFV’s enterprise value / EBITDA multiple is also extremely low at 2.9x (will go down - BGFV didn’t post an income statement for FY2020 yet, but the strong Q4 revenue growth noted in the press release last week highlights that EBITDA will definitely be higher than the $7M for Q4 of last year) – also *very* low and effectively implies that BGFV is near bankruptcy (which it clearly isn’t, with no debt and $55M+ of excess cash on the balance sheet). EV / EBITDA multiples for Dick’s is 4.4x and for Hibbett is 7.0x. All three of the businesses had the same hits to earnings in Q1 + Q2 and same benefits in Q3 + Q4. Given the negative earnings impact from COVID in Q1 + Q2, the next two quarters should be fairly easy comp periods, meaning these bottom barrel multiples will compress even further on nearly guaranteed earnings growth.

4. At this point, it’s unclear what management plans on doing with the excess cash. I’m expecting a mix of (1) keeping an above average cash balance to the extent COVID continues on and (2) investments in improving the website / e-commerce platform (looks like it hasn’t had a major revamp since the early 2010s, though the home page is clearly pushing home fitness and winter / outdoor gear). Historically, management has had a focus on returning capital to shareholders through primarily dividends (had some buybacks in the past). Ideally management will be willing to repurchase a block of shares in the market or issue a special dividend, but can’t guarantee any of that. I’m hoping this is addressed during the Q4 earnings call.

My price target here is $30-45, with 1Q2021 and 2Q2021 results determining where I’d actually sell (as well as management’s plan for the shit ton of cash they have). Will try to answer any questions that come up, and appreciate any feedback on the idea!",finance
personalfinance,College Private Loan/Cost of Living Questions--Need Advice,"**General Stats:**

Married

Mortgage ($285,000 at around 3.5%)

My Car is owned outright

Wife has auto loan in her name only (around 10K)

No credit card debt

1 Child, newborn

Unemployed/Full Time Student

Wife Works

Live in Portland, OR

Current Loans: Fed Unsubsidized $4500/year+Fed Subsidized $4500/year. Taking all of it currently to pay tuition/books.

**My Situation and Questions**

I am in my second term at a local community college knocking out credits until I can transfer to a larger university. Currently my wife works and I have savings that we have been living from. If I continue on this path savings will dry up mid summer 2021. We have talked about me working while in school but there are some decent arguments to not try and work. Currently I am free childcare, COVID exposure issues, and jeopardizing success in school by being over extended there by possibly pushing out graduation further.

Our idea was to get cost of living loans for me for about a year at which point my wife will have moved into a new job making a lot more money (enough where cost of living loans shouldn't be needed). I have applied to these banks:

Wells Fargo Student Loans, community college (denied, no reasons I could find)

Sallie Mae, approved at 12% didn't take it.

**Loan Application Stats:**

Applied for around $18,000 for the year in question

My credit fluctuates between 775-800

no income for myself

CoSigner Father, cosigned with both the above loan applications: Credit Score 800+, Retired $9,000 /month for the rest of his life. No mortgages /auto loans or credit debt. Some of this income is new as he is recently retired. Not sure if history is effecting things.

**My questions are:**

Are my stats for borrowing bad enough to warrant denial and 12% rates?

What can I do to get a lower rate?

Shopping around seems to need to run my credit a lot, should I be concerned about this?

My school financial aid department wasn't much help with regards to recommending loan institutions or answering specific questions. Is there a place or person I should be reaching out to to find this information? My local bank? Calling lending institutions rather than filling out online applications?

Are my expectations crazy? When I started applying for loans I was expecting it to be fairly smooth and rates to be much lower for my stats.

My Dad (cosigner) just retired. Is it possible a lack of retirement income history is affecting the outcome?

personalfinance,westlake financial required the addition of a nearly $5000 fee on top of a 20% interest rate for a subprime auto loan on a $7000 car with a $3000 down payment. Is this a real practice?,"I found myself at a rather sketchy seeming car dealership thay advertised a car through car gurus with a list price of $7350. I have subprime credit. Essentially, 580 fico 8 score.

When i arrived at the dealer there were a number of red flags. The vehicle i intended to test drive was trapped in by several other vehicles. The dealership's only building was basically a hut. The vehicle was much rougher than its pictures made it appear. I had told the dealer in advance of my subprime credit and pre approval by westlake financial and ny intended downpayment and they said all good come on by.

When i finally finished inspecting the car on the lot and decided that with a little negotiation, i might be interested if the test drive worked out I went to request they move the other cars out of the way and they said wait a minute we need to talk about how you're paying.

I said we already did i told you westlake preapproved me id make a 3000 downpayment but i am not going to do a hard application untill im sure im buying and I need to test drive before I will make an offer.

They then said oh yeah well the 7350 we had on car gurus was their ""cash"" price and that westlake charges an additional $4495 in bank fees on top of the interest and so If I were financing the price was actually $12245 plus an $850 dealer fee because he was listing the car at cost and the dealer fee was the only way he made money. First of all what kind of loan company would charge a fee equal to 100% of the total ammount financed (roughly $4000 after the downpayment) plus another 20% interest on top of that. That makes absolutely no sense. They would not want to risk me oweing 200% double the car's value on a ""risky"" loan that would in my mind double the odds of default on the entire amount I believe the dealer made that ""bank fee"" up entirely. Nowhere on car gurus was this mentioned, nor in westlake's consumer reviews, or their own website. 

Not to mention, while 7350 would be an acceptable price for the car in average condition, it was not in average condition. It had two things that would cost me at least $1500 to have fixed and would have to be taken out of the price and there would be no way in hell I would pay the $850 dealer fee. There is no way in hell they would have paid $7350 for the car at auction (they maybe would have paid $5,000 or probably less) or as a trade unless they are the dumbest car dealer on earth and im honestly not sure who in their right mind would just be like ""okay yeah lets do it"" to something that insane. But, without even mentioning a price I said alright well i have the full value in cash, i only wanted the loan cause i need the positive credit history to thicken my file and would have paid ot off over 6mos to a year for that purpose anyway so ill pay cash but we are gonna have to talk about coming down on the price because what you are asking is a little high at which point they still said ""nope thats the price."" To which I said, well there is no way im paying that for this car and instead of even asking what I would pay they just said ""okay then thanks for being honest have a nice day"" and I left.

So.... Am I crazy or does the $5000 bank fee thing actually exist and in that case who the hell would take a loan like that?

And 2ndly, even paying cash they seemed like they were 100% confident someone would pay their insanely high asking price and their insanely high ""dealer fee"" without any negotiation because otherwise there is no way they would have just let me walk out but.... Someone doing even that would have to be both stupid and crazy.

Please help me make some sense of this experience and maybe reassure me this is not normal even for my credit threshold. The only thing ""normal"" would be a high interest rate or a denial if I used credit.

If it helps shed some light it was at a sketchy dealership in a sketchy neighborhood by the miami airport. The only logical option i could for see is this place being a money laundering front that doesn't actually need to sell cars but just look liks they do cause the lot was totally full but there is no way in hell they could survive covid-19 with that kind of business practice as again surely nobody is crazy enough to actually make those kinds of insanely inflated buys.",finance

stocks,"Stock Market News for Today | Intel [INTC], Tesla [TSLA] &amp; Other Stock Market News [01-22]","**Stocks have a mixed day as Biden has his first full day in office. Traditional energy stocks lose some ground as we continue to see a transition to Green Energy. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news!**

**\~Long post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw a mixed day, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/RbB5Xhz) leading the way, finishing .55% up and closing at a new all-time high just like the [SP500](https://ibb.co/X5v19R6) which barely finished the day in the green, while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Gtq5WF7) industrial lost 12 points. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Mpbp84k) continuing to drop, but at a lower rate, as it is testing the 21 levels yet again.

Almost 60% of the companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/6rnhSpQ) on below average volume, as the companies trading above the moving averages is still very high. Yesterday we also saw only 3 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/2ZbYCWp) finish in the green with Tech leading the way up over 1%, while the biggest laggard by far was the Energy sector, dropping over 3% for the day, as Large-cap growth companies were the only ones to gain [yesterday](https://ibb.co/yQNzN5b), while value plays lagged behind.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y626Sdj) from yesterday. We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings, with most of the semis also joining in the rally, while the value heavy sectors like banks, materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/QFsMCkj) which revealed a further drop in bullish investors, which is music to my ears, as bearish investors saw another increase of 3%. I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.

We also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn’t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher &amp; higher right now.

And one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction &amp; lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.

[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.

In some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.

This sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market.

I think this highly flying stocks and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.

Yesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel’s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.

So, let’s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.

stocks,BLS (SIX Swiss exchange): Next-Gen Battery Producers. A hot runner for the next years and the ever growing battery demand.,"I‘ll try to keep it as short as possible because I‘m on my phone.

Summary

They‘re a Battery Developing- and Producing Company with a ready factory and ties to the german automobile lobby ([production of batteries in saxony, germany](http://blackstoneresources.ch/investors/news/index.php?content_id=129)) and their development (especially with Solid State Batteries) has close ties to some of the best research centres. It‘s supported by [the federal swiss laboratories for materials science](http://blackstoneresources.ch/investors/news/index.php?content_id=133) and the Bern university of applied sciences, which the former is in the top 10 of all global science laboratories if I‘m correct. 

Goals

Their goal is to produce next-gen batteries that will power a whole lot of things: phones, cars, even [ships.](http://blackstoneresources.ch/investors/news/index.php?content_id=134) They want to be competitive in the market of tomorrow and produce 3-d printed Solid State Batteries for practically anything as long as it‘s possible.

They also have mines for different resources in norway, peru, chile, china mongolia and mlre all around the world where they try to farm their own material.

Current &amp; Price Target

As of writing, their Price is 6$ per share, and because of the rapid development and the lobby they‘re in they received a 12$ + price target EOY on 18th january, which [could even go higher IMO as they expand rapidly.](http://blackstoneresources.ch/investors/news/index.php?content_id=136)

News

They have a great website with [all the important news on here.](http://blackstoneresources.ch/investors/news/)

If they expand and keep up the development and connections to the swiss federal institutes of material science etc. I really believe this will be a long term runner.

Verdict

In it‘s current state, there‘s not much that can go wrong, and because of the lobby they‘re in there‘s HUGE expansion potential. 

I believe the stock price could be 20x or more in 2-3 years. 

My position (I‘m poor): 120$ @ 5.4Fr, approximately 20 Shares

gaming,"EA has the perfect platform to capitalize on all the new Star Wars stuff, make money, make us happy, and they just... don't care?","Yes, it's Star Wars Battlefront 2.

Yes, this post is born because of Epic Games giveaway.

Yes, please read on.

Not because I picked up the game now - though I did pick it up for the cosmetic unlocks I had it earlier and abandoned - but because of the absolutely staggering amount of players and interest peak that the giveaway generated. First, the servers got full, no more players could enter. Then EA announced twitter they'll expand them shortly, and they did. And it got full again. They announced additional servers, and. it. got. full. again. Then they announced additional servers, which also got kinda full, generating log in issues but those got quickly dealt with. They had to expand server capacity for this game three times within days, years after it's release, to able to handle the insane amount of players jumping on it.

And now that I gave it a second chance after quickly abandoning it shortly after release, guys this game is everything now we dreamed it would be at release, and wasn't back then. A list of improvements and additions:

* Supremacy, the classic open capture and hold 5 points mod. On certain areas this is combined with rush: whoever wins the ground battle, gets to invade the enemy capital ship where it's rush mode to the core. If the invaders lose, both teams go back to ground war. Damage done to ships, checkpoints for that, are all saved. I had a 3 hour long amazing actual war with tons of back and forths, having repelled invaders from our ship 5 times and as players rotated we started to turn things around and eventually won. Best Battlefront experience I ever had, including all 4 games.
* The progression is superb now: lootboxes are completely removed, unlocking even skins is completely removed, all 3 currencies that made it feel like a cheap ass mobile game where you have to grind through all the trash to get what you want, is completely removed. With Celebration Edition you have all skins unlocked from the moment you launch the game, and I cannot believe how much this improved my experience with the game: no longer I worry about income / hour, what to spend it on, how many weeks will it take for my favourite digital 3D model to get a cape. The focus of me spending time shifted entirely to enjoying the gameplay, what a game should always feel like.
* Tons, and tons of new content. This includes Droidekas, Clone Commando from Republic Commando, various skin variants for fans of every phase within an era (Clone Wars armor for Anakin and Obi Wan, shattered and reforged helm for Ben etc., Solo movie themed skins for Han and Lando), a huge variety of new maps involving Rogue One, clone wars animated series.
* Now that I don't have to focus on 3 different currencies and like 5-8 progression types, I actually understand the flow of the most important resource: battle points. For those who don't play: you get battle points for kills / assists / doing any kind of damage (which is so good because I feel rewarded even if I don't score a kill or even an assist) / playing the objective. From these points, you  get access to heroes (blaster / lightsaber heroes) during the match, and 4 different reinforcement or if you prefer, elite unit types. For example, for the Federation this means Droidekas, Super Battle Droid (heavy weapons and jetpack variants) and Droid Commando (the assassin-like ones with their weird swords). I had no idea that these 4 elite types are the same 4 types across every faction, meaning a super battle droid jetpack variant being in the same slot as the jetpack clones, all progress together, or the heavy weapon super battle droid being in the same slot with the First Order flamethrower trooper progress together, because I was so preoccupied with the - now gone -  3 types of money and leveling up heroes. Allowing me to focus on the game, the battle, the flow of the battle, instead of ""okay when is this over so I get my credits"" increased my fun factor tenfolds, which, speaking to the suits now, increases my loyality and time spent in your game, increasing the likelyhood of me paying for additional content (NOT lootboxes and having a depressing amount of chore ahead of me if I don't pay for your ""surprise mechanics"").
* With so many events of double and even TRIPLE experience points, you can level up your heroes and soldier classes in no time. Not going to lie, this matters, because higher level objectively makes them so much better: access to star cards (stupidly named and designed traits) to increase maximum health, damage reducion while at low health, gaining health on kill, combining these three and upgrading them even (like damage reducion at low health means 20%, but upgraded to max 40%!) makes a normal assault class soldier much stronger than the same assault with lower level, making the starter experience kinda bad, which the very authentic but seemingly chaotic map design (which is really good once you learn them but the lack of a map doesn't help with that) makes worse, but once it clicks, you'll be hooked, and it's VERY worth it because it's the only Star Wars game out there where you can experience this quiality and quiantity of Star Wars stuff, aside from Battlefront 2 2005.

So, there is clear overwhelming interest. There is a (now) stunning game ripe with quality content. There are no more background economy bullshit where a whole team worked hard to fuck you over and make you pay additional money or grind 'til you are blind. The game is well optimized, beautiful.

And it's a PLATFORM. Because let's face it EA always wanted it to be a platform for money making, the nature of the gameplay is also perfect for it. Now that the bullshit monetization is out of the way, why not do a proper one? There is MASSIVE interest in Star Wars these days because:

* New movie trilogy
* Disney is adding a whole new prequel era between Old Republic and Prequel Movies, called High Republic
* Mandalorian TV show
* Ashoka TV show in development
* Reknewed and rising interest in Clone Wars and Rebels TV shows because of Mandalorian fans who have no idea who Ashoka is.
* Kenobi short series in development.
* John Boyega won't shut up about how he doesn't want to return to the franchise so that's in IGN daily news every day lol :P.

**And what EA does?**

* Nothing. They pulled the plug on this game's support, said it's done.

**What EA could do? (Not neccessarily for free).**

Add heroes to Prequel era:

* Ashoka Tano
* Mace Windu
* Shaak-Ti
* Kidi-Adi-Mundi
* Assaj Ventress
* Savage Oppress (the most lacking in creativity but wanting to sound badass but ending up cringe name ever)
* Mandalorian / Djin Djarin
* Jango Fett

Add Heroes to Sequel era:

* Snoke
* Hux
* Maz Kanata (seen with jetpack / blaster)
* Rose Tyco
* Poe Dameron

Add new reinforcement / elite class:

* Bodyguard (Palpatine's prequel era red bodyguards with a spear, Grievous's purple staff caped bodyguard droids, a melee variant of wookies, tons of lesser jedi characters with limited powers, throne room guards of Snoke, Knights of Ren).

New locations

* Exagol
* Death Star crash site on the sea / shore.
* New / Reworked death star map from Awakening of the Force where the terrain is already erupting, there is a forest area with lightsaber duel damages to the trees
* Destruction of the Jedi Temple
* I can't even count how many more iconic locations from Clone Wars era that were in the movies, the industry world where Kidi-Adi-Mundi died, the ""hole cities"" world where the whole Grievious vs Kenobi ""Hello there"" duel took place, Mustafar (how the hell is Mustafar missing, not only it's super iconic and important but could also play with a twist, putting Anakin on the ""evil"" side for that map only, and it's also thematic because there is no vulcanic map in the game).
* The new shows playing out between various eras bring tons of new locations and possibilties for battle, which EA (or any business with sense to how to make money and keep people happy) could capitalize on, and the way things look from Disney's perspective, new material is coming for at least a couple more years. Sure they could do Battlefront 3, but then we'd lose all the amazing content present in Battlefront 2 by moving on to that, and I understand it's 60$/euro per unit vs smaller content packs, but the latter also involves less resources required (already perfectly functioning game and mechanics / animations all in place, plus the trust that this is a good game and EA won't try to fuck us over by introducting whatever ripoff open your wallet mechanism 2 months after good reviews for a sense of pride and accomplishment, locking nearly all heroes behind grind or pay after doing an open beta with all unlocked and unlocking them all for review copies only).

Cross-game content:

* Cal Kestis / Second Sister

And EA could use this game not only as a platform for these paid expansions but as an experimenting ground in what kind of monetization the playerbase is fine with:

* Battlefield 3-4 type of Premium Edition / actually highly valuable DLC content packs is already proven to be working
* They could even try support packages: all of this is free, but you can buy support packages openly communicating that this is so they can keep adding new stuff. It would truly show how much support there is from the community.
* No more fucking RNG please, no lootboxes, no new currencies, no grind.
* Release paid packages such as heroes, but be sure to always add a free one (so 4 new heroes for 7.5 euro +1 free sounds fair to me and not unreasably cheap for the publisher). See, we gladly pay for what's worth paying for and we are not playing when you aggressively push to make us pay for what's expected as baseline: such as the infamous post of having to grind 2-4 months to play as Vader or Luke.

&amp;#x200B;

EA, this is a freaking GOLDMINE, not only because of the insane interest in your game that you had to see for yourself, but also the peaking interest in Star Wars as a franchise, and the fact that your exclusivity deal for a decade is rapidly coming to it's end, and with Ubisoft's open world Star Wars you'll lose your grip on the fanbase too, so now is the perfect time to announce a big comeback for this game (as it already happened and YouTube is full of it), more content, new paid content format, and doing what's missing. EA is obsessed with games as service, so THIS IS IT, it's finally in the state where players want to stay on one of your platform games and actually support it, don't throw it out for a Battlefront 3 where 99% of the opinions will be like ""okay but I'm still waiting for X or Y character that I loved in Battlefront 2"" or if everything from previous game is in, it's going to be a ""glorified graphical update not a new game"". You have it, you are done, now keep supporting it! Put it on next gen consoles, do a giveaway on nextgen consoles even, you'll blow up the bank with it.",technology

But while looking I’ve seen it’s pointless on how we’d be wasting about 2,500 to 3,000 dollar each month when we could get a house. This is a recent idea and I’ve tried to see how we could since my mom says she’s on board. A house around my área are around 700,000 and above. I’m not sure how it exactly works but I’ve done the math with what I know and said we be paying about 2,800 to 3,000 on what I think it works because this is how I think things work. You ask for a loan and make sure you’re able to get it. Then after signing and everything you pay the seller of the house off completely with the loan and then you have a house you’re paying a mortgage for. Now quick house we found was for 700,000 and it looks good but again since it’s recent idea we don’t really know what to do or expect. My parents credits are pretty bad due to late payments when getting there life together and mostly everything is fine now. My brother could run his credit but it’s not great either. My parent credit is 569 and with that comes the increase of interest rates and banks declining loans. Let’s say we are given an opportunity and a bank says yes. To a loan towards a house. Let say the house that is 700,000 is a good and we take it. I know we would need to pay a property tax and also a tax after buying it during the first year. And that’s like 87,000 or so. If we were to take a loan out for a 30 year fix it would be for what I think 800,000 again there might be other payment that are due but bare with me I’m new to all this. My mom says probably 30 percent interest rate with Im assuming is high but she says it as let’s just say it’s 30% it would be 1,040,000 with that loan. Assuming that’s any of what I say is correct We be paying roughly 2,900 a month not including other bills like utilities and groceries but I think we’ll manage. Seeing our situation, can you answer me these questions.

1) is 30% really what they are going to charge?
2) we’re going to have to pay a tax after buy the house right?
3) with the credit score how does it look?
4)and what am I going to pay monthly?

personalfinance,"Is cashflow king? We plan to only be in house for 2-5 more years, Should I refi and kick back a mortgage to a 30 year and save/invest the difference, or do 15 year?","So I understand the general principal of ""If you can make more money investing somewhere else than your mortgage and are comfortable with it, do that"", but I wanted your opinions.  (43 years old, 2 kids, no other debt, plenty of retirement savings.) 

189,000 left on a townhome currently worth about 370,000.  

**Currently a 30 year refi at 3.0 would drop our monthly payment 279 a month.  
A 15 year at 2.5 would raise it 185 a month.**

Difference between the two mortgage types is 465 a month. (Rounded to 500 for investing down below.) 

Our plan is so save for 2-5 years more, and have a fat down payment on a house we really want. We have 100k in a high interest savings account as a start.  (We are in a townhome and want a house for our kids, but we need to save more to be able to have an affordable mortgage in our area. Hence the savings.  We think we can save 50 grand a year from our businesses, hence the 2-4 year savings goal we've set to be able to get a house we really want in a few years.)  

MAIN SCENARIOS: 
I've looked at amortization tables, and after two years, we would have 14 more grand paid off on principal with the 15 year.

*However,* even if we just saved the 500 a month from the 30 year refi into a regular savings account, we would have 12 grand at the end of that same two years in our pockets/savings acount/investment/529 etc, a roughly 2,000 difference that the 30 year ""Costs us"" over the same time as the 15. 

I would most likely invest in the market in a target fund or total stock market fund or another vehicle as the amount over the few years we will be in the house won't really amount to much of a dent in the savings goals for the new house over the next few years, so that 12 grand we save on the 30 would be something like 13 grand assuming a 5 percent return.  I understand that's not guaranteed.  

Most of our house savings would come from our businesses and I understand that in general, you don't put money in the market you will need in the next 5 years. This extra fund would just be additional long term investing more than likely. I know statistically stock market is an average about 7 percent year to year with wild fluctuations in any year.

Break even on these refis is about 14 months BTW. 

I think the 30 year gives us both more option for financial growth and more flexibility if we decided to rent this house later or whatever.

I guess I am asking...what would YOU guys do here? (Wanting to only be in a place for 2-4 years and wanting to take advantage of these low interest rates.)",finance

personalfinance,2019 and 2020 Tax Help,"Hey, so I attempted to file my taxes last year on the dead line. After a couple days or weeks (I don't remember), I checked on the status of it since money hadn't been taken out of my bank account, and it turns out the AGI from a previous year (adjusted gross income iirc?) was entered incorrectly. I tried again, and the same thing happened after I checked again a few weeks later.

Being the lazy person I am, I checked to see how long I had until I had to try to resolve this (I didn't feel like calling up the IRS or dealing with anything in this regard, honestly). I read somewhere that I had months to file an amendment after the initial attempted file, and that was more than enough for me to just shelf it and not think about it anymore. I also thought to myself ""I'm trying to hand over thousands of dollars in self-employment taxes, and they're rejecting it for some silly reason, I'm not going to go out of my way to give them money they refuse to take"".

Well, that time came and went because I honestly stopped thinking about it, and I was browsing reddit and something came up about taxes, and I got a hit of anxiety because I remembered I needed to do that. I got into doing research about what penalties there are for filing late or not filing at all, and read that I'd be paying up to a 25% increase in tax, and more concerning I could be jailed for every year that I filed late.

Is it actually likely that in this circumstance I'll be sent to prison for paying the tax late? This is probably one of the most anxiety inducing things for me, and jail has always been a (I thought irrational but seemingly more rational now) fear of mine since my teenage years. It's been harder to sleep because of this, and I'm just looking to get this resolved in the best way possible that doesn't result in any jail time.

I learned I can't e-file for previous tax years, but also, interestingly enough, the AGI is not even required for filing by mail, so I assume that issue would just resolve itself?

I used free tax USA to ""file"" last years taxes again, and now have PDFs that I'm ready to print out for 2019 taxes (federal and state). I'm also thinking I might just do my 2020 taxes now as well, and file those at the same time, assuming doing that all at once is possible?

Also, I shouldn't have any trouble paying the taxes for both years out of pocket, including the 25% increased tax for paying late. Since I'm planning on sending a check, should I send it with the total of both years + the 25% additional payment for 2019, or should I wait for them to get back to me and say I owe more in taxes than what I've paid?

Thanks for any help in advance, I'm hoping to resolve this and get rid of the respective anxiety I'm getting from this.",finance
personalfinance,"Where should I put my money so that it grows more but I can take it out as I please, to pay for tuition?","I currently have 31k in my savings account, and am estimating to have about 45k in my savings by the time I start my graduate program in June.

personalfinance,"Private student loan options w/ cosigner - default, bankruptcy, etc.","A little desperate for someone to point me in the right direction, so here we go.

This is a situation my partner is in, although we both feel the impact due to how awful &amp; unethical these practices are. My partner (26M) has been out of college for nearly 3 years now. We both live in Georgia and attended the same college, which he spent five years at. Unfortunately, his parents (mother and step-father) did very little research, and put very little thought, into the whole student loans thing. They went with Sallie Mae, the notoriously evil private student loans company, and had his step-father co-sign on the loans. They also never cared to read the fine print that states interest has no limit to which it can increase. I can't help but be a bit mad, but I know not everyone is informed on the student debt crisis. I, however, am very lucky my parents helped research with me so that I could take the federal loan route.

I believe my boyfriend has either 8 or 10 loans. The interest rates on all are very high, one being at 13%. The monthly payments end up being half of what he brings home each month -- leaving very little wiggle room considering other costs such as rent, food, etc. After countless attempts, he's come to terms with the fact that Sallie Mae won't adjust his payments to income-based, they won't give him any options for forbearance, and they generally won't give him any options to alleviate the hardship he faces. He tried refinancing with his bank (student loans are $80k), but was denied. I never understood how miserable this could make a person, and even using the word miserable to describe it's affect is an understatement.

Currently, he is in delinquent status on his loans. I believe he has three months of missed payments until he goes into 'default' status. We've researched lots on people who default on their loans and end up going into collections. Some are able to do a pay-to-delete with the collections agency. Ruining his credit wouldn't be the end of the world -- Luckily, I'm a homeowner and he lives with me. He doesn't have anything to his name, although he does make car payments. Although he has been paying the loans for almost 3 years, they have continued to increase. It seems like it will never end.

The issue here is the whole co-signer thing. If he went into default, they would come after his step-dad. I've been trying to research relevant laws in Georgia, but have had little luck finding anything..

My primary question is this: what options are available? 

1. Loan consolidation? I doubt Sallie Mae would allow him to take this route because of his payment status
2. Refinancing? Several lenders have denied him (annual income w/o taxes is $55k, student loan principal cost + interest is probably $85k, and his credit score is below a 650 due to delinquent payments.) I've even tried seeing if a lender will refinance his biggest loan of $20k with no luck
3. Filing for bankruptcy? I noticed that if you were to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in GA, there are more protections for the co-signer. I know this isn't ideal.

investing,"Jeremy Grantham believes the stock market has ""matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble""","I thought this was an interesting write up from a man who's live through several market bubbles.

Link: https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/

From the summary:

&gt; The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble. Featuring extreme overvaluation, explosive price increases, frenzied issuance, and hysterically speculative investor behavior, I believe this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history, right along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000

&gt; These great bubbles are where fortunes are made and lost – and where investors truly prove their mettle. For positioning a portfolio to avoid the worst pain of a major bubble breaking is likely the most difficult part. Every career incentive in the industry and every fault of individual human psychology will work toward sucking investors in.

&gt; But this bubble will burst in due time, no matter how hard the Fed tries to support it, with consequent damaging effects on the economy and on portfolios. Make no mistake – for the majority of investors today, this could very well be the most important event of your investing lives. Speaking as an old student and historian of markets, it is intellectually exciting and terrifying at the same time. It is a privilege to ride through a market like this one more time.",finance

personalfinance,Please help me understand these numbers (MN 2020 Taxes),"I've entered my W-2 and 1099-G into both TaxAct and FreeTaxUSA, and the numbers are quite different.

I first entered my W-2 into TaxAct which then estimated a Federal Refund of $99 and MN Owed $140 (net $41 owed). I had several weeks of unemployment in 2020 with total UI compensation of $11,940 and I opted to pay no taxes at the time of compensation, expecting to pay 15% ($1,791) of what I was compensated come tax season. I entered my 1099-G into TaxAct and the numbers shifted by a lot, coming out to Federal Owed $2,501 and MN Owed $969 (net $3,470 owed). This means I need to pay $3,429 ($3,470-$41) or 28.7% for combined federal and state UI tax?

I then entered the same info into FreeTaxUSA. After entering my W-2, I was show an expected Federal refund of $315 (it does not show a number for state at this time). After entering my 1099-G, it changed to saying Federal Owed $2,129. So, this makes me think the unemployment has a Federal tax rate of about 20.5%.

Why are these numbers so different, and so much higher than what I expected? I understand that the numbers may become more accurate after completely finishing the process on either site, but shouldn't the estimations be somewhat accurate during the process?

One point of uncertainty I have is exactly what rate the unemployment income should be taxed. I assumed 15% (10% federal and 5% MN) as this is what is [demonstrated by the MN UI portal](https://i.imgur.com/OBn4iSA.png). I have seen a few sources say that it is taxed at 20% (15% Federal and 5% MN), but I cannot find a sure answer.

personalfinance,"Reservist, deciding how long to keep going from one set of orders to another","Basic question:  Is saving between 50K and 100K extra a year + added retirement worth going from one set of army orders to another for 3 more years.  Note this has a personal and emotional aspect to it.  


On the civilian side I work as a senior IT manager.  With new qualifications, and my drill pay I think I wont earn more than about 145K/year.  Expenses generally top about 61K as a civilian.  I put full amount into 401K, some companies match.  Outside of 401K I save about 21K a year, sometimes more, depends what comes up and what help my grown kids need.  I live just fine, but generally the job means I am on call 24/7 and expected to read emails make contact while on leave.  I have not been working in an industry that gives stock options or stock purchase (grocery).    


Army orders that take me overseas earn less on paper about 127K, but my expenses drop to 41K, in some cases the expenses can drop really low if very austere environments (nothing to spend money on) and I don't pay taxes on a portion of my income.  I save about 50K a year doing those orders, sometimes  more.  I max TSP(401K) which does not match.  Also every year on orders equals about $250 more a month when I reach army retirement.  That retirement date is reduce by about a year for every deployment I go on.  My army job has good crossover to the civilian job market, so I am not losing skills.  My current retirement date that I can draw money is 57, I am 47.   Yes, if I do 5 more years then I can retire and draw retirement pay.   I don't intend to live off that retirement pay, well not yet.  
Positive:  Army orders equal travel, most of the time to new nice places.  I can somewhat pick and choose, unless something big happens these are not combat tours.  I like the army people I work with in general.  I get paid to do PT!  We get every federal holiday off, 30 days a year leave, and extra days.  I have been saving like a crazy person I went from divorced 10 years ago with 60K of debt, a house underwater and car payments,  to no debt.   I have about 100K in TSP and 401K, with 170K in a wide spread of stock.  I don't own a house, I don't have any debt.  


The negative side:   
Mostly new people each set of orders.  Sometimes long hours and stress, and uncomfortable situations, think very cold or very hot.  It is hard to start or establish long term relationships when you keep moving about.  I don't see my kids as much.  I am not putting down any roots.

They are giving us a 3% but rolling the loan back to the original amount, pretty much 1k in closing cost added to the loan and resetting the loan amount. Would this be smart to do? How long would it take to recover the cost of the last year? We paid 1000 a month before and now it’s $860.

Also no pmi. Home is worth 183k from their evaluation and also don’t have to pay for an appraisal. It just feels bad to roll back the loan over again but I know it’ll save me monthly and long term.

personalfinance,Need some advice for my mother,"My mother is age 71, in a nursing home due to health issues.  She's down to her last couple thousand dollars in assets and that will be all she ever has, she's transitioned over to Medicaid and that is covering her nursing home costs.  

The last time she filed her taxes was 2015 . . . not because she didn't need to, she has a bad habit of ignoring her problems to make them go away.  I helped her file the past returns recently to figure out how much trouble she's in.

Her liabilities are
- $5,500 on a Chase Amazon Visa card
- $6,700 in KS state taxes (back taxes &amp; penalties for not filing returns 2015-2019)
- $23,000 in federal taxes (same as above)
- $9,000 in more federal taxes, currently in an installment agreement (from tax years 2009-2014)

After paying for a few Medicaid-approved expenses (funeral plan, new hearing aids, glasses, a few other items) she'll have roughly $3,000 in cash left in her checking account and that is all she'll ever have.  Her only income is social security and she's only allowed to keep $62/month, the rest goes to the nursing home.  That is not even enough to cover her IRS installment agreement payments.

I have sent POA documents to the state, IRS, and Chase so I can speak with them on her behalf to work out arrangements, but I haven't spoken to any of them yet.  Basically, there's no hope of her ever paying any of this back and she has no assets to garnish or seize.  She owns no car, no real state, nothing but what's in her checking account and a few hundred dollars in personal belongings.

Basically just looking for advice on what to do here.  Should I contact her debtors and just tell them what's up?  Or, just stop paying and wait for them to take action and just deal with it?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Questions from a Crypto Skeptic,"I come in peace. 

I’m interested in cryptocurrency, but many of the claims about its potential as an investment leave me wondering if I’m seeing the same thing others are. I also know I don’t know everything. Instead of shaking my cane at all the youngsters making a fortune with their internet money, I want to see if I can learn more. 

Let me also preface this by saying that I’m generally interested in cryptocurrency. I think cryptocurrency is going to be useful, both for its anonymity and for cutting out costs from the traditional financial system (e.g. fees for converting dollars to euros, time spent waiting for transactions to clear, etc.). I’m also intrigued by the potential of smart contracts to automate some transactions, though I think some of the bullish arguments for these are overstated. We’re not going to get rid of contract law.

My skepticism of Bitcoin (and other coins) comes from the idea that it’s going to make you rich, which is the majority of the talk I hear around the topic these days. I’ll lay out why I’m not convinced by the “get rich” case for Bitcoin (and it would apply to any other cryptocurrency). Maybe you all can set me straight. This is all pretty basic, so don’t expect some sort of novel argument. I just tend to see the crypto community dunking on people who claim Bitcoin will fail because it will be hacked or that it will be banned and so on, when some of the basics seem more pressing.
 
**The Currency Paradox.** One of the biggest bull cases for Bitcoin is that it’s the currency of the future. But for it to be a functional currency its price has to be stable. No one is going to spend it if it could be worth double or more in a few months, yet people are owning it precisely because they hope for it to double or more in a few months. At some point its price will need to flatten and be boring and predictable for it to be a functional currency. That will neuter the investment thesis. I’m also seeing a lot of related arguments that Bitcoin is the new gold or a store of value, but the same reasoning applies. No one is going to protect their wealth by putting it in an asset that regularly crashes. It may turn into an alternative asset used for diversification, not entirely unlike gold, but it will still need stability. 

**The Fiat Currency Obituary.** You might reason that Bitcoin will stabilize as a global currency when fiat currencies disappear. The logic is something like this: If Bitcoin replaces fiat currencies (~$37 trillion in circulation?) then it will have to be worth several million per coin, making early adopters wealthy in this new system. Now, I can’t “prove” that fiat currencies aren’t going anywhere, but I want to note their demise is far from a certainty. 

People have been predicting the end of fiat currencies for decades, long before Bitcoin ever existed. I suspect many people have suddenly found these fringe arguments more convincing now that they have a financial stake in the outcome. Of course, it’s possible these prognosticators weren’t wrong, just early. But your great-great-great-grandkids could wind up saying that about you too.

Governments have a very strong self-interest in maintaining their own currencies, tools to enforce its use (taxes must be paid in the currency), and have militaries to protect their people and secure their existence. While there are plenty of cranks who hate the Fed and think it manipulates the dollar too much, most people are pretty comfortable with their cash. There would have to be something in the order of an interwar Germany hyperinflation or something like the 1997 SE Asian currency crisis, but for the major developed economies, for there to be serious pressure to flee fiat currencies. I’m not saying it can’t or won’t happen, but it’s a longshot.  

It’s possible Bitcoin could stabilize as a more niche currency, something that solves a specific problem like the obnoxious fees charged for exchanging currencies abroad or something in that vein. That would lower the dramatic price predictions, though. And unless you’re active in whatever area Bitcoin is used in, you’ll still need to convert it to dollars to enjoy the fruits of being early.

**It’s Mostly Paper Profits Right Now.** Yes, lots of people have gotten rich from Bitcoin, but not everyone drooling at the current valuation can cash out at that price. Some people converted their Bitcoin to dollars during the latest peak and have enjoyed their riches. If a lot more Bitcoin owners decided they’re ready to collect their winnings at $32,000 then the price will crash again. When you see lots of people’s goals for owning Bitcoin is to convert it to dollars to pay debts, buy a house, buy a Lambo, whatever, you realize not every Bitcoin owner will have this opportunity until Bitcoin is a functional currency (see above), which could be never.

You might say the same is true of the stock market, and there are some similarities. Here’s the difference: Companies have assets, including future profits, that backstop their stock’s value. If I was the lone shareholder of Apple I would be filthy rich whether there was anyone to sell the stock to or not. They made around $60 billion in profits last year and that would be all mine. Bitcoin’s value is more speculative and I need more people willing to pay more for it than I did or I can’t realize that value. These people will eventually dry up unless Bitcoin develops more functional value. 

As long as Bitcoin remains a speculative asset there are going to be winners and losers, people who cash out with extraordinary gains and people who’ve sunk more money in than they can get back. 

**It’s Just Math.** I see a lot of formulas and mathematical jargon used to justify supercharged price predictions for Bitcoin. That’s all fine, but I suspect some of this is meant to put a scientific veneer on what amounts to guesswork or enforce an insider/outsider dynamic (Bitcoin skeptics just don’t understand math!). 

The problem here is that making accurate predictions is incredibly hard, even with an ironclad model and perfect data. It gets even harder when you factor in the uncertainty of human behavior. Imagine the difficulty in trying to forecast the 2032 presidential election or what market share Tesla will have in 2040. You can certainly make an educated guess and there’s lots of data to draw from. But there is always going to be a big “if” justifying even the most complex sounding model. Just because a model spits out numbers doesn’t mean it’s right. 

One of the more popular of these is the stock-to-flow model predicting Bitcoin hitting $1 million per coin by 2040. One of the selling points is that it predicts Bitcoin’s price with 95% accuracy. That sounds great. Unfortunately, this is a meaningless number by itself. There’s a lot more behind convincing statistical research than finding a line of best fit between two variables. As any number of p-hacking scandals can attest, finding “statistically significant” relationships between variables, sometimes totally unrelated variables, isn’t hard. I’m willing to wager an enterprising sleuth could find a similar relationship between the log price of Bitcoin and many other variables. In fact, the author of the stock-to-flow post does it in the same post.

What would be more convincing is a strong justification for analyzing a relationship between these two variables with robust statistical tests that rule out other explanatory factors. Even then it may have very little predictive power. Instead, the author plucks a metric from commodity analysis as a proxy for “scarcity,” while simultaneously dismissing the utility of analyzing Bitcoin as a commodity, then does a basic regression between the two variables and voila, Bitcoin will hit $1 million. I wouldn’t put much faith in that analysis. And it seems to be representative of many of the ""just do the research"" arguments I see for Bitcoin's future. 

***

Based on my reasoning above, my investment thesis in Bitcoin is this: It’s a speculative asset to buy with money you can afford to lose. You can make money from other speculators driving the price higher in the near term, when/if it begins functioning as a currency in the long term (where it could be a niche function like international transfers or could happen well after you’re dead and gone), or as a hedge against catastrophe like a global currency crisis, where you may have much bigger problems. This is not a lot different than a financial roulette wheel: It’s fun to play, but you wouldn’t put your mortgage on it. 

Now, where have I gone wrong? Help me see the light.

UPDATE: Thanks for all the replies everyone. There is lots to think about. I can’t reply to everyone so I thought I’d add a few comments here. 

It sounds like a consensus here is that Bitcoin is not a currency and shouldn’t be treated as one. Instead it should be viewed more like gold. I mentioned I didn’t find this reasoning particularly convincing in my initial post due to the volatility. It might also be the cynic in me, but the sudden change in narrative from “it’s a currency” to “it’s a store of value” sounded like a rationalization. But I think the analogy to gold u/GSEDAN made was a good one and I see the case a little differently now. I’ve never been interested in investing in gold so I think I overlooked some of the rationale behind it. There’s no doubt it’s retained its value because people believe in it and the same can be true of Bitcoin and other cryptos. I can see some of the value there. 

With that said, I’m still very skeptical of the “get rich” claims around it. Gold is a pretty conservative investment, even with a community of very passionate believers. While I think Bitcoin is obviously more exciting, the analogy can only take you so far if you want to make an extreme prediction for Bitcoin prices. I would update my investment thesis for Bitcoin to include that it’s a gold-like asset that can offer you exposure to a unique market as a hedge against other markets (stocks, real estate, etc.) with more speculative upside and risk. 

A lot of other people pointed me toward Ethereum as a crypto with more obvious value since it can do a number of useful things. I followed Ethereum with a bit of interest before the 2017 crash but haven’t followed much since. I’ll take another look now. I’m still uncertain of how the utility of the currency translates into price appreciation. u/ExtraExtraMegaDoge and a few others had an interesting discussion in the comments here about this too. I think my question here is if the usefulness of the currency increases the demand for it, which increases the price with a fixed supply, wouldn’t the constantly increasing costs deter people from using it? I have some more to dig into here. 

Anyways, thanks again. As I said, I’m interested in cryptocurrency. I first started paying attention to it in 2015 and have casually followed it since then. I even own a bit of Bitcoin I bought during the 2017 frenzy (and wish I’d bought it when I first researched it in 2015!). But as the price rises again I keep hearing more and more about how it’s inevitably going even higher and going to make everyone rich and so on and I’m routinely wondering what I’m missing. So that’s where I was coming from.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Please help! Want to reverse credit ding.,"I have a situation and was hoping you guys could help.

I have been working hard to build good credit. My new husband and I are first time home buyers and have been preparing since Dec. 2019. My main job was in theatre, but I had 3 other part-time jobs as well. I lost all of my jobs in March 2020. I've been on unemployment since June, but for some reason they stopped payments in October and I am waiting for back pay. Through careful budgeting and help from family I have payed off both my credit cards ($750 &amp; $2,000) and a private loan from college. ($5,000). I still owe 18,000 on a federal student loan. AND this stupid car loan.....
       
In January of 2020 I needed a new car used, so I paid half out of pocket and got a Loan of ~7500 from Huntington. BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. Huntington has been nothing but terrible to me. I had a few late payments since March 2020, but always within 30 days until November. In April, May, and June, Huntington offered me a 3-month deferment. I declined because I had savings but said ""it's good to know that's there."" In August, my savings ran out and I asked for the 3 month deferment. They said that I was not eligible for it. So in September, my mom covered my late August payment, Sept. And prepaid Oct. November I told them I was waiting on back pay from unemployment, and explained that my theatre was still closed so I couldn't resume employment. 

On Dec. 30th they called and said the repossession agents were going to get the car. No prior notice. They claimed Oct. had not been paid, but my mom's bank transfer showed an amount equivalent to 3 payments so I don't know where October went. On Dec. 30th, my mom paid the minimum amount to stop repossession. I had to sell some of my stuff to pay her back. I am STILL an waiting on unemployment. They say it's processing. 

Today I found out that Huntington reported me to credit back on the 30th of December, which dropped my score 160 points. The chance of my husband and I getting a mortgage was slim before, because I have been out of work, but I had a good credit score at least. Now I have terrible credit. 

I feel like they stabbed me in the chest and I'm doing everything I can. They refuse to work with me and I feel so hopeless. As soon as unemployment sends the backpay my mom agreed to lend me the money to pay off the Huntington Loan completely so that I can just be away from them. But is there a way to reverse the negative hit on my credit? Or advice for the letters I am going to write to the credit bureaus? Thank you.

Edit: had 2 job interviews last year, but didn't get either job. I also let Huntington know about this. Religiously married, but we haven't filed joint finances or legal papers because of Covid.",finance

personalfinance,NEED advice/suggestions on buying my first (definitely used) car. I'm 21 and will NEED it in the very near future.,"Hi Reddit,

I've been a lurker and never posted so please excuse my poor way of formatting and for wanting (somewhat of an) anonymity; I'm gonna use a throw away account. 

I currently live around northern Texas and need to get my first car in about a month's time. I will need it to commute to work and in the future when I enroll back into school. I don't need anything luxurious and have no wants; just want to be able to have a reliable way of transportation for my destinations. 

My Background:

* 21 (in a couple months 22) / Male
* License was received last year
* Clean driving record
* About $34k/year income, around $1100 bi-weekly
* Bad/Decent credit score ranging from 591 to 639 (I have a balance of $600 on my credit card)
* Live with siblings in Apt (paying around $350 and planning to move into a house in a couple months, rent going up to maybe $570)
* Savings will be $3k (after paying all bills + utilities) when buying the car (month's time)

I was wondering if I should spend my next pay check paying off all my credit card or just lowering it to get a better credit history before applying for a loan.

Unfortunately I also currently have no knowledge of how to do any of steps (getting loan or buying car) and would like a point in the right direction of how I should go about the situation. I plan to research more into the subject but would like advice and possibly answers as I learn more. I don't believe I can get a co-signer for my car and I'm a very shy and anxious person so going into a dealership is going to be difficult as well, but I'm willing to give it a shot.

All I have knowledge on is that I should put a down payment to secure an auto loan and lower the interest rates and that I should get a reliable brand (Honda or Toyota like).  Any answers is truly appreciated!",finance

Background: my adult brother has lived with my parents and has no plans of moving out, esp as my parents get older.

The loan is not a very good one, with a high interest rate but they manage. However with interest rates being so low, they were thinking about refinancing but then my dad lost his job. Since the loan is in his name only, they are unable to refinance.

CryptoCurrency,"I had to deal with a bank today, and my experience was the reason why crypto is so important for the future of how we handle money.","Today I had to take a withdrawal out of my 401k, I’m in my 30’s but I’m having a baby and I need the cash in this Covid times. The 10% federal tax penalty should be waived by the event of having a baby, so it’s worth it. It’s an old 401k and isn’t a lot of our future retirement and it made sense.

So I call the big bank that manages the retirement account. Everything goes smoothly until the the phase where the phone banker is going to do an ACH. He can’t get my account information at my credit union to send back a verification. The only other option is a check for a huge amount of money getting sent(get this) by regular mail... no certified mail, no fedex signature, just regular mail. I refused to do that. So he told me I should call my credit Union and see why they are kicking back the ACH. So he gives me a number and his name where I can call him back so I don’t have to explain everything to another banker.

I call my credit Union and they are like. There is no record of an attempted ACH, and for me to recall the other bank to get some sort of transaction number. So I recall the big bank and ask to talk to the same guy, surprise surprise they can’t get me back to the same guys. So I have to explain the whole thing to a new person. So she explains that the reason it didn’t go through is that this big bank can’t send an ACH to my credit Union because of a few dollars of fees they would incur... and so I have another bank account at another big bank that I have from a while ago and I still keep it active for whatever reason. So I am like ok please send it to this account. Well this bank ALSO wasn’t in their approved list of banks to send an ACH to. So I’m like “you are telling me that two of the biggest banks in the Country will not communicate with each other? And because of this, you are forcing me to accept a check sent to me in the mail with a Substantial amount of money?” And she’s like “well we aren’t forcing you...” ummmmm I’m giving them 2 bank very viable bank options and they are refusing to send to them because they aren’t in their very small network of banks they send money to.

So at this point I’m like, “let me speak to your manager.” And she puts me on hold for half an hour.... at the end of the half hour she comes back on and instead of having a manager she explains that she was looking in the wrong place of the list and that she thinks she found the bank in their acceptable list to send ACH. She then asks ME if it’s the same bank, like I know??? It’s the legal name of one of the largest banks in the country and their branding for the name they use for their customers is not the same. So she was confused by this. I will tell you it’s a very well known bank, if I told you want bank you would laugh. So now we get past that. And I ask “ok so how much are you depositing into my account after fees and taxes withheld?” She refuses to tell me....???? I’m being asked to sign off on an ACH transfer without knowing the amount of the transfer... that to me sounds sketchy, like hidden fees and weird shenanigans. 

I’m not a huge fan of big banks, I have repeatedly had to fight fees for random shit over the years. Accounts being opened without my approval. It’s happened at all the big banks and finally I just moved to a credit Union. So the trust is already broken.

So I ask “ok well what are the taxes and fees you will be deducting from my withdrawal?” And she says, “well maybe this one and maybe this one...” 

“Ok what do you mean maybe” so we go back and forth about this for like another half hour. Her answers to my questions are very dodgy as to not accidentally give something away. She can’t tell me when my money will exit market fluctuations, she can’t tell me what taxes they will be taking out and which ones I will owe retroactively. The importance of this is that I expect to have the 10% penalty waived and I don’t want them taking this out now, I would rather argue I don’t owe it while the money is in my bank account rather than argue that the government should send me back the money. 

At the end I finally we just like “ok you can’t tell me anything about even the Amount of the ACH you are going to be sending me... just send it” the last thing we end with is, if the ACH doesn’t go through they will be sending me a check in the regular mail, I ask if it can be certified mail, the answer is no.

FUCK BANKS. Seriously I hope crypto fucks them all. I yearn for the day that the last person withdrawals their money from the banks and they fuck right off into nothingness. The big ones need to be broken up immediately they are predators and if you look the other way for a second they start with fees and Nickel and dime you like crazy.

Banking,Can you open a separate bank account despite having a joint bank account?,"Exactly as the title states. I’m from the US and have had a joint account with my mother my whole life. I’m over 20 and am still considered a dependent since I’m a college student. 

I wanted to blow my bank on GME months ago but my mother rejected all of my attempts, but after witnessing all of the 🚀🚀🚀’s lately, I’m fed up.. I could’ve doubled or tripled or even quadrupled my life savings...

personalfinance,"Drowning in Student Debt, feel helpless. What should I do?","I don’t have any CC debt, no mortgage but renting instead, no car debt because I’m driving a 2004 Toyota Camry.

Single, never married, no kids. 

However, I have $248,958 in student debt. 

I graduated with a BS in 2008. Job market was in the tank, couldn’t find a meaningful job, went back to school, got another BS, graduated 2010, couldn’t find a meaningful job, got my MA, graduated 2014, was an adjunct professor making $20k/year, parents and family pressured me to go to law school. I literally cried about it saying it was a terrible financial decision and they reassured me it wouldn’t be. (They were wrong). There is more to that story, but it isn’t relevant. I worked many part-time jobs along the way to help with living expense, etc. 

I graduated law school 2018, summa cum laude, top 10%, from a decent state law school (lawyers/law students would classify it as T2, it is a top 80 school). 

Since being out, I’ve only been offered jobs paying $35k - $50k per year. I’ve applied to almost every job I’ve come across. 

I accepted a job this month for $60k with the Court of Appeals.

I cannot keep up with the interest on my student loans. I’ve been lucky in that the past year, $200,000 of my loans have been in forbearance because they are held by the Dept of Ed (so CARES act). But the other 50,000 are not held by the department of education and are ffel or other federally planned loans held by commercial entities. So they are accruing and in repayment. 

I’m on income based repayment. They want me to pay about $100/ month on the $50,000. The $200,000 is frozen currently by President Biden executive order. 

Here is my question. When my $200,000 unfreezes, I’m most certainly going to be in negative amortization. Should I try to keep up with the interest now, or just pay the minimum they want on IBR and start my negative amortization early?

I’m feeling helpless and don’t think it’s going to matter either way, because once everything kicks in I’m going to be so far underwater that it’ll likely balloon to $400,000 before anything is possibly forgiven. 

I don’t know if there is any advice I need or just a pep talk, but really I think I’m completely screwed.",finance

Bitcoin,Risk to reward analysis and current market sentiment towards speculative investments,"Under current market conditions, momentum trading has been very profitable, examples include EVs, SPACs, bitcoin, marijuana stocks, uranium and clean energy.

A lot of money in the market feels the need to make substantial short term profits because of current market conditions for the past year caused by fear of inflation and low interest rates (low risk investments are far less attractive as they are barely beating inflation).

In a situation where bitcoin reaches our recent ATH, based on current market sentiment and conditions it will gain strong momentum (as speculative plays have been over the past year) and blow past ATH in the span of a few days just like it blew past 20-30k in a very short period of time.

On the flip side, if bitcoin dips following no fundamental changes, such as legislation or strong institutional selling, bitcoin would be bought on dips, creating a strong bottom resistance. 

Why would bitcoin be bought on dips? This is because as other assets in the market inflate, especially considering most of the inflated assets are speculative plays or plays that are based on projections very far into the future (most of the stocks I mentioned earlier) the risk to reward of bitcoin would improve. 

This is due to the fact that current sentiment towards speculative plays is due to ""cheap money"" and fear of inflation. As bitcoin is a direct hedge against this issue, and as risk to reward of other assets gets worse (prices increase) bitcoin becomes more attractive.


Tl;dr risk to reward will continue to improve under current market conditions.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinance Dental Loans vs Wait and See,"Hi everyone, I’m an engineer and my wife is a newly graduated dental specialist (orthodontist). Thankfully, I have no student loans but my wife’s dental school and residency have her at 350k in debt with the average interest rate at 6.6%. She graduated in July and has been working since, making approximately 12k/mo after taxes. We’ve been making payments every month but we looked into refinancing with Laurel Road and were quoted 2.8% for 7 years (monthly payments would be ~$4100). This is very doable for us so we were excited about this quote. However, I’m intrigued by the extension of student loan payments through September. I was thinking what if we made payments around $4100 without refinancing while everything is frozen and then wait to see if we should refinance around August or September. My dad said we’d regret not accepting the 2.8% because it’s such a good deal and he doubts the Biden administration would move to forgive medical and dental student debt considering their high salaries. What would you do if you were in wife’s position? Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Should I invest or pay down my mortgage?,"Years ago while we were still recovering from the 2008 crash I bought my house on the cheap as a foreclosure. This summer I owed about 20k on it. I got a cash out refinance at 2.85% and ended up with about 70k for remodeling and to do an addition. Priorities have changed and I'm no longer planning the addition, just going to spruce the place up a bit and hope to keep everything under 30k. I currently owe about 12k on vehicles. I am planning a career change in a few months and will be taking a pay cut probably starting at around 40k per year. I also have 20k available in a HELOC at a decent interest rate but trying not to use that.

I've been thinking about it and I think what's best is to pay off the vehicles and invest the remaining ~28k in acorns, it should make more money than I'm losing in interest and it's still easily accessable for home renovations if needed. Maybe even put more in now and pull it back out when needed. The house is going to be slow going as with the pandemic it's impossible to get contractors here because they are all so busy.",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 25th, 2021.

# **Apple and Tesla earnings, along with the Fed and GDP will drive markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/apple-and-tesla-earnings-vaccine-news-and-the-fed-will-be-focus-of-markets-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Stimulus euphoria may be waning, but investors will have plenty to focus on in the week ahead, as a blast of earnings news hits, the Federal Reserve meets and new data will show the state of the economy at the end of the year.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week on optimism for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, proposed by President Joe Biden. But by Friday, the market lost steam amid increased concerns about the pandemic’s economic impact, and as it seemed Biden would not have an easy time getting the stimulus plan approved.
*****
&gt; Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla and more than 100 other S&amp;P 500 companies report earnings in the biggest rush of earnings reports this quarter.
*****
&gt; The pandemic will also be a factor as travel restrictions and lockdowns threaten the global economy, and worries remain over the speed of vaccine distributions.
*****
&gt; But there is hope that Johnson and Johnson will release positive news on its vaccine results soon, and if that’s the case it could signal another source of vaccines will be available. The J&amp;J vaccine would be a single shot, as opposed to the currently available double-shot vaccines.
*****
&gt; “We expect to see their results,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “That could be super bullish.” The company reports earnings on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Hogan said the market may also respond to Covid news. He said the seven-day average in new Covid cases fell below the 14-day average this past week for the first time since Thanksgiving, and if that continues, it could indicate a peak.
*****
&gt; If the virus news improves, the market could resume its grind higher in the coming week, said Hogan.
*****
&gt; # Economy
&gt; As for the economy, the first look at fourth quarter real gross domestic product comes Thursday, and it is expected to show growth of 4.7%, according to the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update survey. For the year, the economists surveyed expect GDP contracted by 3.5%. The economists forecast 5% growth for 2021.
*****
&gt; Consumers pulled back at the end of the fourth quarter, evidenced by a surprise 0.7% decline in December retail sales reported this past week, after a negative November.
*****
&gt; “You’re really going to see a loss of momentum throughout the quarter,” said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “It’s a set up for a really weak Q1.” PMI data shows manufacturing activity has been strong, but labor market data is weak and consumer spending is disappointing.
*****
&gt; “You’ve got to juxtapose what’s happening with the vaccine and the virus with what’s happening with underlying data. We’ve definitely seen a lot of the things that could spark a pullback,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at RBC.
*****
&gt; Calvasina and other strategists expect a sell-off early in the year.
*****
&gt; Stocks hit new highs across the major indices Wednesday, as Biden was inaugurated, and many technicians see the market as overbought. The catalyst for a pullback is not clear, but strategists expect the market to gain this year and say a buying opportunity would open up with any decline.
*****
&gt; “Do we start to see stuff showing up in that data that makes us question that recovery?” said Calvasina. “My assumption is we’re going to get a lot of volatility in that data, and we’re going to get some downdrafts but it’s not going to be bad enough to erase this upward trajectory we’ve seen in the economy since the second quarter.”
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
The Fed is also a powerful backstop for the market, and economists don’t expect the Fed to take any action or change in its dovish tone when it releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, following its two-day meeting.
*****
&gt; “I don’t see them making many changes,” said Cummins of NatWest. “They’ll probably acknowledge just the fact that employment was weak.
*****
&gt; “It’s going to be pretty clear cut,” he added. “I think Powell will sound similar to what he sounded like in September.” Cummins said the Fed chairman is likely to say the economic outlook depends on the course of the virus and vaccine.
*****
&gt; There is also durable goods data Wednesday and personal income and spending data on Friday. The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the PCE deflator is also released Friday, and Powell will surely be asked Wednesday afternoon about inflation, which is increasingly being priced into market expectations.
*****
&gt; Powell is also likely to be asked his views on fiscal stimulus, which could end up being smaller than some expect.
*****
&gt; Hogan of National Securities said the market traded lower on Friday on expectations the package could be smaller and take longer than expected to gain approval.
*****
&gt; “I think the realism of saying $1.9 trillion and doing $1.9 trillion are two different things,” he said. “We fall into that trap all the time.”
*****
&gt; “What’s happening now is there is no magic wand here,” Hogan added. “It’s not to say there’s no stimulus. It’s just a matter of how long it will take and how much there will be. There’s a little bit of realism.”
*****
&gt; Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said a pullback could be sparked if bitcoin starts to fall more sharply, since some investors would sell stock in response. “When there’s no bid in bitcoin they have to sell something, and they sell stock,” said Maley.
*****
&gt; Bitcoin has had a wild early ride in 2021. The cryptocurrency hit a record high of $41,973 on Jan. 12, according to data from Coin Metrics. Days later, it fell about 15%, wiping out as much as $200 billion in just 24 hours.
*****
&gt; Bitcoin then regained some of its losses, surging to near $40,000 before another reversal. On Friday, it was trading at $33,200 after dipping below $30,000.
*****
&gt; “If this thing starts tanking again, it’s going to cause some forced selling and it’s going to cause some selling in the stock market,” said Maley, adding it will be important to hold the low from Thursday night.
*****
&gt; He said the short position in the dollar is also an overcrowded trade that could turn quickly. A resulting short squeeze could cause a dollar rally that would be negative for the stock market. He also is watching Tesla, which reports earnings on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; “I think whether it be bitcoin, the dollar, Tesla, one of these crowded trades...it’s going to turn the narrative that’s permeating right now, and if we don’t get a surprise the market will continue to push higher,” he said.

&gt; # February Almanac: Worst S&amp;P 500 Month of Post-Election Years

&gt; Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.0% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

&gt; February’s post-election year performance since 1950 is miserable, ranking dead last for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average losses have been sizable: -1.5%, -3.3% and -1.6% respectively. February ranks tenth for DJIA in post-election years with an average loss of 1.1%. February 2001 and 2009 were exceptionally brutal. NASDAQ dropped 22.4% in February 2001, its third worst monthly loss ever.

&gt; # Housing Closes Out 2020 on a Positive Note

&gt; Housing closed out 2020 on an extremely positive note as both Housing Starts and Building Permits topped forecasts by more than 100K. Since 2002, there have only been ten other months where both reports topped forecasts by more than 100K, and today's report was the third time it happened in the last 12 months!

&gt; The table below breaks down the details of the December report in terms of both single and multi-family units and regions. One of the clear areas of strength was in single-family starts and permits. On a y/y basis, both were up over 25%, and relative to November, starts were up 12% while permits rose 7.8%. Multi-family units, meanwhile, both saw declines with notable weakness in multi-family starts. On a regional basis, most areas of the country saw strength although starts and permits were down m/m and y/y in the Northeast.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Details.png))**

&gt; Given its overall size, you can easily make the case that as goes the housing market, so goes the economy, and history tends to bear this out. The top chart shows the 12-month average of Housing Starts going back to 1967 with recessions overlaid in gray. With the exception of the latest downturn, every prior recession was preceded by a rollover in Housing Starts. Given the sudden onset of the pandemic, housing played no role in the current recession, but once the lockdowns started, the residential housing market wasn't immune to the weakness. Whatever weakness there was didn't last long. As shown in the second chart below, less than a year after the recession started, both the 12-month average of Housing Starts and Building Permits have now moved back above their pre-pandemic highs.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle-Last-10-Years.png))**

&gt; While Housing Starts and Building Permits are both at new multi-year highs, on a population-adjusted basis, they're still closer to levels typically associated with recessions than expansions. After adjusting for population growth, Housing Starts would need to come in above 1.9 million just to keep up with population growth.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Population-Adjusted.png))**

&gt; As for the stocks of homebuilders, the performance of the iShares Home Construction ETF (ITB) tends to track trends in Housing Starts and Building Permits pretty closely, so it's no surprise that it also traded to a new all-time high on Thursday for the first time in three months. As long as interest rates don't see a sudden spike higher, trends in place for the residential housing market remain positive.

&gt; # Impressive Reading From The Philly Fed

&gt; Of the several strong economic data points to have been released today, perhaps the strongest relative to expectations was the Philadelphia Fed's monthly survey on the region's manufacturing sector. The headline index was expected to rise from 11.1 to 11.8. Instead, it more than doubled expectations rising to 26.5. That is the highest reading since last February just before the pandemic's full impact was felt. Overall, the report showed the region's manufacturing sector experienced strong growth in January with accelerating growth in demand, prices, and employment.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-HL.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we break down the various sub-indices of the report. Nearly every component experienced a month over month increase that ranks in the top few percentiles of their respective histories. That also left most indices in the top decile of their historic ranges. That compares to last month in which most readings were far more moderate. Although most indices for current conditions saw impressive readings, the indices for expectations were much more mixed with a larger number falling than rising MoM. Given every one of these indices remains positive, though, the region's manufacturers still have an overall optimistic outlook.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Table1.png))**

&gt; Of all the sub-indices, the New Orders index saw one of the most significant increases in January rising 28.1 percentage points from a barely expansionary reading of 1.9 to a much stronger reading of 30. Going back over the past couple of years, the only times this index was higher was in October (32.9) and February (30.7) of last year. That indicates very strong new order growth after a slowdown in December.

&gt; Similarly, the index for unfilled orders was the only index in contractionary territory (those below zero) last month, but there was a massive improvement this month as the index surged to a reading of 25.6. Both the level of the index and the monthly change stand in the top 1% of all readings going back through the history of the survey which began in 1968. The only times the index has been higher was in August of 1972 (26) and January (29.6) and March (45.1) of 1973. In other words, New Orders remain strong while Unfilled Orders are bouncing back at a historic rate.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Orders.png))**

&gt; While the unfilled orders index reached one of the highest readings on record, the index for Delivery Times actually hit a new record. The index rose 12.7 points to a record high of 30; surpassing the previous record of 21.3 from October of 2017. Higher readings in this index indicate that supplier lead times are longer and vice versa for lower readings. That means a historic number of respondents are seeing delays in their supply chains.

&gt; Perhaps to get ahead of the growing demand and longer lead times, businesses are also reporting higher inventories. That index rose to the highest level since September of 2019 which also stands in the top 5% of all readings in the history of the data.

&gt; Given the stronger demand and tighter supply lines, prices have also been accelerating. Both Prices Paid and Prices Received experienced some of their largest monthly increases on record after rising 20.5 points in January. At 45.4, the index for Prices Paid is at its highest level since August of 2018. Those price increases are also getting passed along to customers as the index for Prices Received is at the highest level since February of 1989. These results echo some other hints of more inflationary conditions like the New York Fed's readings last week and the ISM services and manufacturing report earlier this month.

&gt; # Real-time COVID-19 Data Suggests Final Peak May Be Here

&gt; It has been exactly one year since the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and to say the world as we know it has been completely changed would be an understatement. Thankfully, we may finally be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

&gt; With the rollout of multiple approved vaccines underway, some real-time COVID-19 indicators and mobility-related data points have put in their final highs (or lows). As shown in the LPL chart of the day, restrictions implemented at the end of 2020 appear to be helping to curb the spread of the virus, as new COVID-19 cases and those currently hospitalized have been on the decline.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Meanwhile, the positive rate has also declined despite daily tests near all-time highs.

&gt; However, while COVID-19 data has been improving, real-time economic indicators like OpenTable reservations show businesses continue to struggle as restrictions on activities to curb the late-2020 surge remain in place.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Similarly, the number of people getting on airlines has fallen back to mid-October levels after the holiday bump. Domestic air travel activity remains 64% below pre-pandemic levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The good news is that cases are declining and vaccine distribution is increasing, but service industries and air travel are clearly still under a lot of pressure,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While manufacturing and housing data remain firm, recent data on the job market and consumer spending have been choppy.”

&gt; It’s very encouraging to see COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations improving, a trend we hope will continue until this pandemic ends for good. In the meantime, we will continue to follow high-frequency data to gauge the recovery’s progress. The next report card comes next week with the release of fourth quarter 2020 gross domestic product (GDP).

&gt; We’ll also be closely watching developments in Washington, DC. The economy’s bridge to the other side will likely get stronger in the coming weeks with more stimulus—potentially to the tune of another $700 billion to $1 trillion.

personalfinance,Should I Pay Off My Debt?,"Hi everyone,

Long term lurker here but this is my first post. I’ve been considering reaching out to you all for awhile. 

My situation :

Debts

$55,000 student loan @ monthly payments of $692.00(25 years remaining) 2.1% interest 

$35,000 vehicle at monthly payments of $775 (4 years remaining) 4.0% interest 

$60,000 private loan 4.7% interest

$300,000 mortgage 2.4% interest

Holdings

$35000 savings

$54,000 stocks (current value)

Financed Assets

$394,000 apartment 

My salary is $105,000 with very good job security. On top of this with vehicle allowance, bonuses, gas card etc my total income is around $140,000 annually.

30 years old with fiancé who is making about $75,000 annually. We share payments on all besides my student loan and truck loan. 

Market value on the vehicle is about $17,000.

Long story short I’ve made about $30,000 in stocks this past year and wondering if it’s smart to unload this account against my student loan to clear it completely. Is there a way to transfer my stocks account towards student debt without taking a capital gains hit? Is this advisable?

Canadian, living in BC.

Thanks everyone!

Edit: need to confirm interest rates but at work so don’t have it all in front of me until later. Those are based on my recollection",finance
personalfinance,"Refinanced my student loans in 2020, 1098E reflects interest on total loan balance. Do I really report that?","I refinanced my federal student loans in January 2020 (yeah...worst decision of the year) and now my 1098E from FedLoan reports an exorbitant amount of interest received by them.

I don't qualify for the student loan interest deduction, and this question is purely for reporting on my tax filing.

After reading the relevant section of IRS Publication 970, I came away with this:

&gt;**Interest paid by others.** If you are the person legally obligated to make interest payments and someone else makes a payment of interest on your behalf, you are treated as receiving the payments from the other person and, in turn, paying the interest.

Am I correct in interpreting that I report this huge amount on my taxes?",finance
personalfinance,Retirement planning for parents,"Hi all,

My father is 65 and plans to work until 70/71yo to get maximum social security benefits. Realistically, I’m not sure he’ll be able to last that long in his industry as his skill set is nearly outdated.

My mother is 63 and plans to work until 65 or 67. This may be more realistic for her industry and skill set. 

In addition to about 800k total in their 401k and IRAs, I recently found out that they have been keeping a whopping 1.5 million in cash due to massive losses and fears of future losses from the 2000 and 2008 crashes. 

With interest rates so low currently, they are now interested in investing in the stock market again.

They have asked me to find some “safe investments” to put some cash into.

I’ve read that it’s reasonable for retirees to keep about 2-3 years worth of expenses in cash. I estimate my parents are keeping closer to 20-25 years worth of cash considering how frugal they are (not sure this would account for increased costs for medical costs later in life or if they’re going to start living large once they actually retire). Based on our family history, I’m guessing they both have another 20-25 years to live (likely will live into their late 80s/early 90s).

My questions for this situation are:

-What would be an appropriate amount to keep in cash versus moving to a brokerage? I’m thinking 500k-1 million moved to a brokerage which would leave with them anywhere between 7-14 years worth of expenses in cash.

-For an investment timeline, would a DCA be more appropriate in this situation? Although “time in the market” beats “timing the market,” I’m thinking DCA into a brokerage over the next year or two would be safer than putting a lump sum in all at once.

-The only “safe investments” I can think of are more target date funds or an S&amp;P 500 index fund. Would S&amp;P still be considered safe for retirees given their likely 20-25 year life expectancy, or should they have more bonds? 

-My father in particular is starting to read about the hyped up ARK funds and is considering putting some money into those, but they seem more volatile and speculative rather than safe to me. If he wants to “gamble” with some speculative investments, would 10% of the brokerage account be an appropriate amount to do so?

-Maybe not a specific question, but the cost of healthcare in the future seems very uncertain and I am unsure of how to account for this. Would keeping more in cash make sense to anticipate for home health care or assisted living facility costs?

ethereum,Borrowing DAI vs other stable coins on AAVE,I don't understand if there is an advantage to borrowing DAI instead of other stable coins. Currently DAI has a borrow interest rate of 30% and USDC has 7.5% for example. Can't someone borrow USDC and buy DAI and supply it and gain %12(DAI supply interest rate)-7.5%(USDC borrow interest rate)=4.5% interest on it? Is there a reason why interest rates are different for different stable coins and for DAI to have such high interest rates?,cryptocurrency

I’m 21 y/o and completely financially independent. I have just paid off all of my debt (excluding student loans unfortunately), and the job I have I am finally making enough money to not be completely strapped.

I was never taught much about this stuff from my family, so I don’t really know where to start. I want to open a savings account and begin saving money every paycheck. Like I said, I don’t really know where to start. I’ve been trying to do my own research but it’s so confusing. Here are my main questions:

- What “types” of accounts are the best to use for savings?
- What banks do people recommend? Are there maintenance fees at every bank?
- What is a good interest rate?
- Will I have to pay a % of the amount I save every year?

I’m not sure if it’s relevant, but after paying for all my monthly bills, I probably have around $200/month to put into a savings account. I would go into a credit union to ask, but I work 7-6 weekdays and I’m in school full-time, so I don’t have much spare time (or when I do, they’re closed). I appreciate any help and advice.

personalfinance,"Forgot to ""unlock"" 2/3 credit reports before applying for car loan.","Hi! I recently bought a new (used) car which I am financing. I filed for Chapter 7 a couple years ago which was discharged in Dec '19. So I was expected high interest rates on a car loan. I have had a unsecure Capital One card for a year now as well which I've paid every month and has helped my credit score.

Anyways, several months ago I ""locked"" my Equifax and Transunion credit reports on CreditKarma (had a password breach).

Today I got a decline letter in the mail from one of the banks the dealership sent my financing application to. The reason said ""no credit history available.""

This reminded me that I locked those two credit reports, so the only one available was Experian - which my score is lowest with them.

Other than just having the bankruptcy on my history. Could this be part of the reason I only had one, really high interest, offer? Did I shoot myself in the foot by not unlocking those prior to applying for financing?",finance

personalfinance,home improvement- large cost projects- how to fund?,"We refinanced last year from a 30 yr loan to a 15 year fixed rate loan. Home originally bought in 2014 for 330K, just appraised at 535K last year, we owe $267K, paying @ 2.75%. Principal/Insurance is about 1920, and the rest is for taxes/insurance (we live in a HCOL area in the northeast). Total mortgage payment is 3270/month. 

The house is a fixer upper, in the 6 year's we've been here we've redone the first floor (new flooring, conversion from oil to gas heat, lighting, electrical, kitchen, added a front porch, paved driveway, fencing) and were able to do that without any loans. However, there are some significant improvements to our upstairs we'd like to make (creating a master suite, redoing bathrooms/floors, new windows/siding), estimating between 50-100Kin costs. 

We have a fully funded E-fund with 8 months of expenses, retirement/roths, 529's for the kids, 800+ FICO scores, and no other debt. If my calculations are correct, saving the extra 80K in cash would take us at least 7 years at 1K per month. We'd like to do it sooner than this...How do people pay for these sorts of large cost projects? 

Is a cash out refinance the best option?  If we rolled the 80K into a new 20 year mortgage refi, the mortgage would be about 350K and our mortgage payments should be roughly the same, assuming a similar interest rate. 

I looked into HELOCs and Home Equity Loans, but it didn't seem like that would be the right move financially.

Any thoughts are appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Need help deciding whether to refinance mortgage or pay down student loans!,"Hey PF,

I am trying to run numbers on what makes the most financial sense for me and my wife. We have a mortgage and student debt and some money to throw at refinancing mortgage or paying down student loan debt or both.

Basically, we have a $740k home mortgage in a 10/1 ARM at 4.5% (physician loan so no PMI). Looking to refinance into a 30 year fixed at 3%, but we need 20% home equity to do so (given our home’s newly appraised value, would cost about $25K to get to 20%, plus $10k in closing costs). 

We have about $400k in federal student loan debt at about 7% - currently in covid deferment until at least September.

We have about $125K to use.

My wife is adamant about using all of our available cash to pay down as much student loan debt as possible (mostly due to psychological burden of our student loans for the past 10 years) and wants to defer refinancing for 6-12 months with the idea that the interest rates for refinancing jumbo loans will likely not go up much in the next year. 

My idea is use $35k to refinance and the rest toward student loans, but I don’t know how to do the math so I can make a side-by-side comparison of her option and mine. I’m not looking for exact numbers, just a close approximation of what’s a better idea financially. We are planning to stay in our house at least 10 years.  Looking at a refinance calculator at nerdwallet.com tells me I would save about $153k over 30 years by refinancing now.  Any help on a good spreadsheet or calculator I can use? Or can some kind soul walk me through the calculations? Thanks!!",finance
personalfinance,Bought a work truck recently with zero credit. High interest rate and I’m wondering should I wait to refinance or not?,"Bought a truck back in November. First payment was this month. 

I’m 20 years old and have a good trade job that pays well for my age. it’s not my perma career but it’s getting me to the field I want to be in. I had a beater truck that I bought with a loan from my Uncle early 2020. Right as I paid my loan off with him, of course my 2500$ truck left into the sorrow night with a repair bill higher than what It was worth. 

I sold it and put about 2000$ towards a used CPO Nissan Frontier. I needed something newer that was reliable and something I could feel comfortable working on myself. The truck is perfect for its needs and work. It should easily last another 200,000k-250,000k miles. Which is good since I put 40k miles a year on my truck and do all the maintenance my self.

Problem is, I have zero credit. So naturally with Nissans good ole financing department that would finance a newborn baby if they could, they approved me but with a high interest rate. I knew this was going to happen but honestly what else was I suppose to do? I have to have a truck to work and I didn’t have money to outright buy something to hold me over. Gotta provide for the family. 

So I took the hit and went with it. I knew I could refinance to something more reasonable as soon as my credit started to get higher because of the payments I would be making. Also me and my wife live very cheap in general so the payment is well within the means. 

My questions is, how long should I wait to refinance? Should I wait at all? Credit karma is already showing me pre approved/highly likely to be accepted to many refinancing options that would cut the internet rate by half or a little more for the same loan period. 

Should I grab a credit card now that I can and boost my credit up while also making loan payments and then wait 6 months or so and then refinance? Or just do it now and save myself money?",finance

gaming,My thoughts on the Nintendo Switch from owning it since Day One.,"The Switch is a well constructed system, I'll give Nintendo that, but as the next generation of consoles rolls around, I can't help but want to pick up a next-gen system. We're nearing in on 4 years of the Switch existing. Here are my thoughts on the current state of the Switch.

# The SoC

At peak performance, the Switch only gets up to 393 GFLOPS of performance, which is comparable to the Wii U at 350 GFLOPS of power. Between the Wii U and the Switch, Nintendo had only gained 43 GFLOPS by using an Nvidia Tegra X1 chip. This basically means that the Switch is a beefed up tablet rather than an actual gaming system.

# Games

First party games made by Nintendo look great on the system, but third party games on the Switch compared to the same game on other platforms look downright terrible. If a game is launching on PC, PS4-PS5, Xbox One-Series X|S, and Switch, the Switch version will look objectively worse because of technical limitations.

# Nintendo's future

If Nintendo doesn't get rid of the Switch, they'll never be able to catch up to next-gen consoles and next-gen PC hardware, making their future look similar to SEGA. Developers want to use consoles that have better performance, so eventually developers will stop wanting to develop on the Switch and focus their efforts on next-gen/PC exclusives. The only way I can see Nintendo remedy this long-term problem is by ditching the Switch and creating a truly next-gen system.",technology

The post-election rally of cyclical, value and small cap stocks was built on stimulus hopes and the reflation trade from the Blue sweep; it didn't see as much participation from big tech. When reality sank in that the massive stimulus bill was not going to be easily passed in the senate, the cyclical rally hit a pause -- suddenly tech was looking cheap, and NFLS’s earnings post market on Tuesday lit the fire. Interest rates too held steady – the 10 year closed around 1.10 and didn’t douse the fire.

**What lies ahead?** 

Next week is a very busy week with 20% of the S&amp;P expected to report earnings. I do expect the tech rally to continue, though not at the same blistering pace; many will sell on news and take profits. I own all the FAAMNG’s and will sell small portions to book some profits. However, they remain a fairly large part of my portfolio and barring anti-trust government action, I don’t see any secular threats. 

I’m still bullish on cyclicals, value and small caps. I bought Toyota Motors, (TM), General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), besides increasing positions in US Foods (USFD) and Performance Group (PFGC). The autos deserve some of Tesla’s sunshine - sure they’re far behind in technology and branding but the gap is too wide and presents opportunity. I like USFD and PFGC, they’re food distributors and post vaccination and lifting of lockdowns – people will release their pent up demand for eating out. [Bloomberg reports that vaccinations are now almost 1Mn a da](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/)y, that should give a boost to the small cap Russel 2000.

personalfinance,Mortgage Questions on Condos,"I'm trying to work out the best thing to do in this situation. My offer for condo in a vacation ski town (that I plan to use my self and rent out some too) was accepted and I'm about to start working through the mortgage situation. I already got preapproved with multiple big lenders (loan cabin, better.com, etc), but my real estate agent really wants me to use a local lender due to issues with low occupancy rates in the condos. He claims confidently that I will not get a mortgage if I don't use the local lender who has already approved all of the condo developments in the area.

Now - I don't know if that's completely true, maybe it is, or maybe the realtor gets a kickback from that lender. My close timeframe is 30 days and I wouldn't be surprised if using one of the bigger lenders messes that up. The local lender would easily be able to get it done without issue BUT their rate is pretty significantly higher (loan cabin had me at 2.6% and the local one was 3.1%). I plan to ask the local lender to match - but I'm trying to work out a back-up plan if that falls thru. These are some of the options I'm considering.


* No longer seriously considering this option ~~A) I go with someone like better.com - risk to closing ontime and maybe they don't approve the condo (although I asked them about it and they didn't think its a big deal). Additionally, I think this will piss off my realtor and I have other business with them so I'd like to avoid this option unless I stand to lose out on a lot of money.~~


* B) Buy up the interest rate on the local lender further to get lender credits to cover the closing cost. Immediately refinance with one of the bigger lenders with low rates after the sale goes through. This sounds pretty interesting to me, but I'm trying to fully understand all the risks here: 1) Rates could go up 2) Rates are higher on a refi 3) Costs associated with the whole process of getting a second loan. 4) Legal issues on the condo complex or something that might make it so that the local lender can't sell the loan to the government? Not sure on this one, but possibly it'd prevent me from refinancing?


* C) Use the local lender but wait until after I finish renovations (probably 5 months) and then refinance with the higher condo value (presumably). Big risk on rates changing, but let's me pull out the cash I put in for improvements. Also I'd have to pay at least 5 months of the higher interest mortgage but that's not a big deal. Still thinking about if this makes much sense for me though.

I'm 24, and rent ($1000/month).  I have an auto loan w/ a remaining balance of around $16k.  Monthly payments are $336 and my interest rate is 5.9%.  I have enough money to completely pay off my loan.  I've also inquired about refinancing and can refinance to 2.9% with various lengths (48, 54, 60 months, etc.).  My credit score is \~800.

investing,Safe to purposely put excess funds into 529 plans?,"I'm wondering if I'm making a mistake in terms of how I'm thinking it's pretty safe to put as much money you want into 529 plans which are used for education. The way I've thought about it, in some cases, it could reduce the overall income tax burden on investment gains or at least be close to breaking even.

I'll be in the 35-37% federal tax bracket for the foreseeable future. I eventually plan to pass on much of what I've accumulated to my children. So, my thinking is this is what would happen to unused money in 529 plans: If money is withdrawn from a 529 for a non-qualified distribution by the beneficiary (my child who will be in a lower income tax bracket), they would have to pay: 10% penalty on the earnings + whatever % income tax bracket they're in (let's assume 10-12% if they're withdrawing &lt;$40k/year while they are still a student, without income). So then the taxes paid on the investment income would be 20-22%.

On the other hand, if I invested the funds in a regular stock account, depending on trading strategy, I'd either pay 35-37% short term capital gains taxes or 15-20% long term capital gains taxes. Of course, there's more flexibility for what to invest in in a stock account, but if we just use an S&amp;P 500 index fund for both the regular stock account and 529, then at worst, the 529 plan would cost an extra 2% on income, right? If someone's children end up using the invested amount and gains for qualified education costs, then there would be at least a 15-20% capital gains savings.

So even if one is not sure how much college will cost in the future or how much schooling someone's children will end up doing, one should not fret too much about putting TOO much into a 529, correct?

personalfinance,Paying off my debt,"Hello Redditors! Long time creep of this subreddit and now I think I should make my first post.

Early in 2020 I decided enough is enough and I want to be debt free. I did some research on how to tackle this and found Dave Ramsey's ""snowball"" method. It seemed like the perfect plan for me since you get that motivational boost when you pay off your smallest debt first. And it turns out it's true. I allocated more money to my smallest balance debt and had it payed off within 6 months. That feeling was intoxicating! So I got the motivation to keep going. I rolled that monthly payment amount into my next debt and killed it a few months later. Again, I felt great! So I rinsed and repeated and rolled the amount towards my credit card.

This leads me to now. I have two debts left to pay off (so close!). The balances are:

* Credit card: $1,339 - 14.9% interest rate
* Car: $2,490 - 8.5% interest rate

With the snowball method I am currently paying $350 a month towards my CC. And then the plan is, once the card is payed off, to roll that over to the car for a total of $550 a month. 

I currently have over $11,000 in my checking account. I make around $3,100 a month. Would it be wise to pay off these debts faster, or even outright today, or just keep my current course following Dave's advice? I would love some opinions and pros and cons of each option.

personalfinance,"I am 27, a full-time employee, have a bachelors degree, may have to move out of my parents soon. looking for advice on budgeting","Hi everyone. I am 27 year old from New Jersey, and a graduate from the Rutgers University Engineering Program. Currently, I have about $46,000 in student loan debt (about $30,000 in private loans from Sallie Mae, and the remaining $16,000 in federal loans). I currently have a 777 credit rating. In addition, probably about 60% of my assets are in the stock market. I also have about $10,500 in my company-sponsored 401k, for which I contribute 10% towards and the 4% that my company matches. I currently receive $55,000 per year salary. My funds in my investment accounts can be easily accessed in case of an emergency. 

This is my dilemma: I graduated about a year and a half ago, and wanted to refinance my loans as soon as possible - obviously to avoid as much interest as I could - but I realized that perhaps in the [now past] upcoming election that there may be some type of student loan forgiveness plan if a democrat had been elected. It is still early, but my suspicions were sort of true. Though, the unfortunate part for me is that any student loans forgiveness would apply only to federal loans. Okay.. not a huge problem. So I decided that refinancing only my private loans was the best course of action. I am actually in process right now of hearing back from the credit union. I applied for a 3.85% fixed APR 15 year plan. This is very do-able for me, but I also wanted to pay off roughly $4-5,000 of principal right away. This would leave me with roughly $6-7,000 liquidated. 

Now, my concern is that this is risky. I worry that if I do get kicked out of my house in the near future, that I may have screwed myself. Again, I can take money from my investments if possible, though I obviously would be reluctant to. But I do live in New Jersey... meaning that rent and living conditions are very expensive. for example, according to Smartasset, the average market monthly rent is $1,851. From what I've seen, you will not find too many good places to live where you are paying less than $800-900 a month (this is if you have a roommate to split the cost). 

What I want to know from you guys is if you guys think this is do-able. Assuming I keep my current full-time job (I can't see any reason why I would be terminated at the moment), and would be living on my own, I would be paying about $255 dollars a month for my student loans, at the very least $1800 a month on rent, while receiving about $2800 a month from salary (this is after all deductions from my paychecks. healthcare, 401k etc.). I know I haven't factored in auto, miscellaneous etc. costs either. I can always lower my contributions to my 401k, and take money out of my stocks if I needed to. I could obviously also just not pay off the principal I was talking about, but this would mean that over the course of the 15 year repayment period, I would accrue roughly $15,000. I feel like paying off a large lump-sum of the principal would be very advantageous.

At the time it seemed like a bold move, but we had no idea when we would be back to work, or what was going to happen. Gold seemed like a good idea, until you actually look into trying to buy gold, and that’s why we revisited BTC, which I had held for some time in 2017 and sold before it crashed, but had basically gotten out of. 

So, we started collecting stimulus and unemployment,  and I stopped freaking out about when we’d be back to work. Instead, we decided immediately to get some film equipment we’d been looking at, and start shooting a YouTube show of her cooking, and try to put together a Covid-ready shoot of a movie we wrote the script for. We figured - hey, let’s invest this money in equipment and skills. Our thought was we’d start a video production company after the pandemic. 

Well, fast forward, we actually managed to shoot our movie safely, and it’s being edited now, and a friend of mine hired me to edit videos for his company. It was basically the ideal job in every respect - work from home, for good friends of mine, start late, editing videos of celebrities talking to each other (I signed an NDA or I would name drop). I have loved working for them, and I was learning some skills to put towards our own business, right? Everything was great... except the pay. It was half what I used to make, plus 1099 instead of W2, plus non-Union so I don’t get any health care benefits and pension. But it’s not all about the money, right? And now isn’t really the time to be picky, I was unemployed for an entire year. 

So I took the job and was loving it. Then two weeks ago my wife came to me and told me she is pregnant with our first child. Here’s the funny part - we know the exact day this child was conceived, because we tried exactly one time. So the pregnancy was a bit of a shock. But still, the happiest news I’ve ever gotten. 

I started being terrible at my job. Couldn’t focus, couldn’t hit deadlines. All I could think about was the riot at the Capitol, and Bitcoin’s price, and reading about bitcoin, and reading about sound money. Because, oh yeah, I convinced my wife to move all of our savings to Bitcoin right BEFORE we found out we were pregnant. We both agree that on some level we both knew, that the hormones and pheromones were signaling us to make plans for the baby our conscious brains didn’t know about yet. And before we did the pregnancy test, we had already planned to move everything over. 

So today I finally wrote them and quit my job. Because I realized there is so much more at stake, and what they are able to pay is not sustainable to raise my kid. 

I know what I’m doing is the right decision, but even my father asked “aren’t you supposed to have a new job before you quit the old one”? And I asked him “if Warren Buffet wants to sit in cash and look for a good deal, no one tells him he’s being lazy, right?” He seemed to think that was a good point, so he dropped it. 

Here’s where I’m at - my wife and I have everything we could want. We made a movie from a script we wrote together. We have a baby on the way. We have a house with a low mortgage and the money to pay it off if we want to, and we have some bitcoin beyond that still too. We have decided to sit on the sidelines like Buffet and wait this out. 

Obviously there’s also tremendous upside of BTC goes to $100k. Then we’ll look like geniuses. But here’s the thing - all we will have done for that money is read a lot and push some buttons. And suddenly wealth will transfer out of society at large and to us. We can’t build a society where all wealth creation is a casino.

And this is why we need Bitcoin. We need sound money, precisely so that no one can push a few buttons one afternoon and become a millionaire. We need the money supply to be stable so that prices can be stable so that we can all plan for our futures, and not keep gambling like we have for the last century. 

I know I made the right decision quitting the job, but at the same time, it’s hard not be mad that the whole issue is just a price mismatch between what they have budgeted and what I need to make. The only reason prices fluctuate like this is monetary debasement. Here we have friends working together making things, and just because the fed is printing too much money, that arrangement becomes untenable. It’s insane. 

None of this holds a candle to my neighbor, though. He and his partner have several kids. He’s been trying to buy a house, and he’s pre-approved, but then he got offered a Union job that paid double. Same kind of work, he SHOULD take it. But because of the rules they’ve written to protect from bad loans being written, he would lose his pre-approved status if he switched jobs, and couldn’t get it back til he was Union for two years. So he didn’t. In what fucked up world do we live in where he has to turn down a better job to get a house? In what world do we build luxury condos next to homeless people? In what world are there food surpluses and starving kids? A world without sound money. 

I used to think holding on for dear life was about the volatility, and I guess it was. But now I realize, it’s about sound money, low time preference, a society that looks forward to the future - it’s about holding on because life is dear. 

The baby’s due in September. Between now and then I’m now totally free to get this world ready for them. 

Thanks for reading y’all. Happy hodling.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Advice on down payment and mortgage,"Husband and I are interested in purchasing our first home, and are excited about the historically low interest rates right now. Let’s say we have the means to put down anywhere from 30-40% down payment. Does it make more sense to put as much of a down payment down so our mortgage is lower or put the additional cash somewhere else? Thing is, we want our mortgage to be at a certain price so we aren’t “house poor,” but that requires the higher deposit. But if we can put that extra cash in say, a mutual fund, and pull from it every couple months to make up the mortgage difference, then maybe that makes more sense? Any advice welcome.",finance
personalfinance,Trying to figure out the best course of action for some debt.,"So currently I have just under $33,000 in debt (not counting student loans but those payments are deferred for now so I’m not counting it atm). I’m getting $24,000 in the next week or so and am trying to figure out the best course of action for this debt. The interest rates on my debt are insane but I had to do what I had to do at the time due to financial misfortune and no support system to turn to family or friend wise at the time. I’ve been working to dig myself out of this and finally got a bit of luck with this money coming in. Any help as to what would be the best course of action would be greatly appreciated. 

The debt is as follows:

$19,200 car loan with an 18% interest rate (first car purchase and not the best credit when I bought it. I pay $475 per month)

$5,074.15 rescue loan at 30.44% interest (I pay $173.29 per check)

$2,400 rescue loan at 97.7% interest (I pay $155 per check)

$6,016 in collections (not currently paying anything to it)

$171 in collections (not currently paying anything to it)

Before taking out those high interest loans I did try other options for personal loans to try getting a better interest rate but my credit at the time didn’t let me qualify. What I’m trying to figure out is if it would be better to pay off the two rescue loans, both collections, and then throw the remaining amount into the car loan and then refinance the rest for a better interest rate or if I should pay off the car and the smaller loan or idk what else could possibly be best. I know the auto loan accrues interest daily if that makes a difference. Thanks in advance for any and all help. If I need to give anymore details lmk!",finance
personalfinance,"Recently paid off all of my CC debt, need guidance on how to invest/plan for my next goals","On a throwaway account because I reference bitcoin and some financial figures in this post (Yes I'm paranoid about security).

I recently paid off all my credit card debt by cashing in some of my bitcoin when it was ATH earlier this month (side note: I thought it would take me 10 years to pay off this debt, so thank you bitcoin). So now I'm trying to decide on a plan and what to invest in next. But first some figures to get a better idea of my current financial picture:

Age: 29, Single

Income: $60k/year

Rent/Utilities: $1,400

Credit Card Debt: ~~$50,000~~ $0 (Ah, it feels so good to say that)

Student Loans: $35,000 @ 0% interest until Dec. 2022 (then 6% interest)

Roth IRA: $7,000

Cryptocurrency: $40,000

Property Assets: 20 year old car worth about $2,000

As you can see I didnt cash out all of my crypto, I still have some. And yes I know thats a lot (relatively) to have invested in crypto, but my initial investment in it 3 years ago literally grew 1000%. And like I said if it wasnt for bitcoin i wouldnt have been able to pay off my CC debt this soon. So in other words I'm a big believer in cryptocurrency. Though I know its only worth $40k on paper right now and I dont actually have those gains until I cash out

As for my financial goals foremost would to be completely debt free, so that means paying off my  federal student loan debt too. Its currently 0% interest (because im still in grad school) until \~December 2022 (projected to graduate June 2022 + 6 months grace period is when interests starts) when the interest rate will be about 6%. So my plan is to put away money into some kind of low-risk investment (or just a savings account) so that way by the time the interest starts, I can pay it all off completely right off the bat.

My next financial goal would probably be to save up for a downpayment on a condo or starter home and stop paying into the ""blackhole"" of a rental unit, paying someone else's mortgage and have something of my own. However, I live in a high COL area and even a 1 or 2 bedroom starter home would be about $150-200k (so the 20% downpayment is like $30-40k). So i will need to plan on how to save up for that

After this is to start seriously saving for retirement (\~currently about 35 years away), but I'd like to get a house/condo first.",finance
personalfinance,Do solar panels make sense for us financially?,"We live in Los Angeles and just bought a house in July. At first the solar payments were almost as much as our electric bill, and it just didnt seem worth it because when we get solar we also have to replace our roof (its just old). We just got another quote from a company with a higher price tag (better panels and better warranties) and they are giving us a very low interest rate comparatively (4.99% typically and we are getting 1.99%). The math makes sense when I am doing it, but also... Its a lot of money.

Our electric bill monthly ranges but average is $160. With the 1.99% interest rate our payment for the panels would be $84. We would definitely pay off the loan early, so the interest wouldnt really end up being that much anyway.

personalfinance,Please help with Debt Consolidation and advice - thanks,"There’s two items. 1) Debt consolidation to a lower APR, and 2) problem with My credit score.

1) I’ve rung up my debt over the years chasing a business startup. I’ve recently changed over to a business checking to help keep things separate. However my personal debt is as follows.

Slate $3,916 @ APR 23.97% -
Chase $18,539 @ APR 18.99% -
Barclays $2,037 @ APR 12.99% -

These APRs are high. Is it time to do a debt consolidation or other solution? Should I take an offer from a company offering a lower consolidated rate?

2) I’ve never missed a payment in my life, however last year there was a bill pay error on a US Bank held auto loan over 30 days due and that dropped my credit score from 780 to 638 in that one missed payment. Everything else on my credit report is pristine. I wrote US Bank an itemized what happened for a good grace reversal and they denied it, saying it was a valid hit on my credit.

- I want to pay off these balances to get my credit back up as soon as possible. I want to apply for a SBA loan or business loan soon to grow my business. But I’m not sure they’ll take me if I have the above scenarios. 

- is it time to seek a consolidation plan at a lower interest rate to get these balances off my credit cards? I’ve seen rates at like 5.99, but probably won’t qualify that low with my debt portfolio and credit score.

personalfinance,What should I do with 25k in savings while I am in medical school?,"I’m 23 years old and I will be starting medical school in the fall. My estimated cost of attendance for the next 4 years of school will be ~280k, and I’ll be financing my education with federal loans. After medical school I’ll be a resident for probably 3-5 years, making around 50-60k a year. Then I’ll be an attending and finally making 6 figure salaries. 

Single as of now, no kids or dependents. And I don’t plan on working during medical school. Edit: also, no debt from undergrad

personalfinance,Looking for Feedback on Investment Plan,"Background: 28yo, single and no dependents, currently making around $80,000/year before taxes. I'm living in CA, so income taxes are high. Currently have $40,000 sitting in my checking account and $6,000 in savings and I'm looking to put this money to work. I contribute 7% to my 401(k), which my employer previously matched at 3%, but is not matching for 2020 due to COVID; they may or may not match in the future. 
I have a lot of student debt, almost $170,000. I'm on an income based repayment plan which will allow my remaining balance to be forgiven after 20 years of payments. I will owe taxes on the amount forgiven. 

The Plan: Going off the prime directive, I'm thinking I should:
1: Decrease 401(k) contribution to 3% (in case they match again), open IRA and contribute $6000 to that per year. If I'm trying to save 15% of my income for retirement, is it better to increase the percentage towards my 401(k) or start looking at index funds after maxing out an IRA?

2: Start saving for the large tax burden of student loan forgiveness. I'll need this money in 18 years, so are index funds the way to go? Or shoulder I be looking at something safer?

Am I on the right track?

Note: I'll leave $10,000 of my saved money for an emergency fund. The book ""Investing for Dummies"" recommends placing this in a money market account to get better interest rates than a savings account while still keeping it pretty liquid. Any thoughts for or against this?",finance

In somewhat of a surprising analogy, the year over year performance (spread) for total returns for US HY - IG credit in the last down cycle (i.e. high yield underperforms IG) looks quite similar to 2007-2009. On Wednesday, performance turned positive, which had not occurred since December 2019.

Separately, as posted on in April 2020, I have subscribed to higher treasury yields, specifically the 10 year. I still hold this belief given current economic data, as described in a December 2020 post. In my estimate, the 10Y has between 75-100bps of upside risk. This is a moving target, as a collapse in personal savings and/or a significant rise in the monetary base could bring my fair value estimate closer to the most recent yield.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to best use my savings,"Hi folks,

In the broad sense, I'm trying to figure out what my wife and I should do with our disposable income, which for the past few years has just been gathering up in our checking account. We have about $60,000 in savings and roughly $190,000 in debt on a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage (only 18 months in). We are a two-income family and save about an additional $1,500 per month. We are both contributing 15% of our income to individual 401ks. We have a savings account with a few thousand dollars with a pitiful 0.01% interest rate, and the rest of our cash is in checking accounts.

Our long term goals are to move into another, larger house in 8-10 years and pay for our daughter's education in about 17 years.

I'd like your thoughts on what we can do with our savings to help them grow faster with low risk. Right now, we're considering paying off more of the principle on our mortgage, putting funds in a high-yield savings account or investing in non-managed index funds. We've also discussed making contributions to a 529 for our daughter.

Anyway, what do you think are our best options, and is there something better out there that we haven't discovered yet?  


Edit: Thanks everyone for your advice. My main takeaways were

* Open a 529 for our daughter
* Max our Roth IRA and 401k contributions
* Don't fuss with our mortgage.
* After maxing our tax-advantaged savings, see how much is left over month-to-month and adjust accordingly.",finance

personalfinance,Why do I owe $5k + in taxes every year?!,"Here’s the ironic thing- most my career I’ve worked in Sr roles in Corp finance.

Since my wife and I got married in 2016, when we’ve filed in taxes it’s resulted in our owing between 4-6k every.single.year. ... including the 2020 results that I just updated.

We both claim Married 0-fed and 0-state (Wisconsin). I don’t know a single person who has additional money or quarterly payments made as working individuals.  Our total household income is only around $150k and we pay around $9k in mortgage interest and $2.5k in student loan interest each year.

I use TurboTax to file it always starts the same way-  whichever W2 I start with it always shows a progress of around a $1,000 return in both state and federal.  then when I add the second W2 for us it skyrockets in taxes and shows we owe thousands.

Does anyone have any feedback on how to avoid this going forward?!  Or better yet... why this is happening?!

****** UPDATE ******

Well... oddly I did not realize filing jointly meant one income.  He and I had thought that married filing separately was more of an odd case. For example the first year we were married we were not married the entire year so I thought that’s why we filed married filing separately.

YES I’m aware now that I’m a moron.

personalfinance,Funnel money toward mortgage principle or into savings?,"This is probably going to come off fairly ramble-y, but I'm going to give a lot of detail. Sorry in advance. Also, I was **awful** with money when I was 24 and probably shouldn't have purchased property; I realize and own that fact, so don't need anyone to point it out. But we are where we are, so here's the situation.

Ok, so I purchased a condo 3 years ago with like 4% down. My LTV is sitting at 83% today (according to bank, it's sitting at 90.5%, but home has gained equity so if I compare to a recent sale in my complex then I am at 83%).

My fiancé and I have been taking a look at what the future holds in store and it certainly isn't spending forever in the condo :)

We want to buy our ""forever"" home in the next five years. Goal: buy \~2.5 acre parcel and build. We're looking at a $650k project. With construction loan, we're going to need $150k (20% down at $130k and an extra $20k because you shouldn't go cash poor paying your down payment).

Our today: we both have some consumer debt (remember my preface about being awful with money when I was 24??) that we're going to have paid off by July. So for the next six? seven? months, we have money going to consumer debt.

So Aug. 1 rolls around -- we are debt free (aside from car loans financed at 2%, so not terribly concerned about expediting payment here) and mortgage (financed in 2017 at 4.125%). ~~We talked about refi since the rates are so low (looked at a refi to a 20 yr fixed at 2.375 - this is buying $5896 in points - raises payment by $73 per month). Also looked at a few options (purchasing points and not) for a 30 yr.~~

We have $4k per month outside of our budget; saving cash takes us 43 months to get to $175k. At an even 4 years, we'd have $192,000 in the bank. Interest rates are so sad that they're negligible.

If we stay on the course with our mortgage (without refinance) and just make minimum payments, then we'd have $68,300 in proceeds before closing costs and commission (let's ballpark $30k in costs to close).

$192,000 +  $38,300 = $230,300

OR...

We have $4k per month. We save $1k in cash per month, which gives us $48k at the end of 4 years.

We throw an extra $3k at mortgage principle. In 4 years, we'd have $231,655 in proceeds before closing costs and commission (ballpark $30k in costs to close).

$48k + $201,655 = $249,655

There's also obviously a mix of how we could approach this. $2k in the bank, $2k toward principle. $3k in the bank, $1k toward principle. We could throw a refi in there at the 20yr and the amortization of the loan with additional payments would probably look quite different.

We plan to chat with a financial planner once we've got that pesky consumer debt paid off. So many of you might be thinking ""holy moly, go see a financial planner"", but I'm just trying to get some thoughts from others before we get there. Putting all our eggs in one basket seems risky (either cash or principle). Also lots of reading out there that says why you shouldn't pay your mortgage off early.

**THE REAL QUESTION! Would you funnel money toward mortgage principle or throw the cash into savings? Would you take another approach knowing the goal is to build a new home in 4-5 years?**

EDIT: Strikethrough on refi. We know that a refi probably isn't in our best interest when comparing breakeven point vs. when we want to move.",finance
personalfinance,(US) Multistate Resident in 2020 - Turbo Tax is Showing a +$800 from TaxSlayer,"I am super beyond confused. I'm trying to file taxes, and as I saw I decided to double check with Turbo Tax and I am really glad I did. The two states I lived in were GA and NY, and NYC specifically for NY. Tax Slayer and Turbo Tax match for federal and GA State Returns, but TurboTax says I am getting $500 back from NY while Tax Slayer says I owe $300 to the state of NY. I have given them the exact same info so I cannot figure out what would be causing such ahuge discrepancy. I deleted my return on tax slayer entirely and started over and that's when my federal and GA state matched, but can't do anything that makes the NY State Returns match.

It's a pretty wide difference so I wanted to see if you all knew anything I could possibly have done (or not done) to trigger this. I knew taxes would be complicated this year (Two jobs in GA + two jobs in NY + unemployment in GA) but this seems nonsensical. Should I just switch permanently to Turbo Tax and pay the $120 for federal + two states?

&amp;#x200B;

* I bought a car early last year and financed  $16550  @ 12.65% which amounts to $21171 ($4621 in interest alone)
* I had applied for a credit card the prior month for the first time and thus no history.
* Right now I have an estimated 16k to pay over 3 years. $442 monthly payments.
* The loan issuer is offering me to pay off the entire loan for $13513. 
* With some back of the hand calculations that is around 6.3% effective interest. (I would pay \~2.3k in interest)

My concerns are: I am planning to buy a home end of this year or early next year (2022). I am afraid paying off this loan will tank my credit score I will let the payments proceed as is and improve my credit score to excellent and get a better deal with a house loan.

Things to note: 

* I have plenty of savings and can pay it off easily.
* My score hovers around \~735(vantage3.0) All 3 have a very good score. I have only 1 year of credit history.
* I tried to refinance using Lightstream but they rejected me outright because of my credit history being less than 1 year. My Credit score from the start was ""very good"".

Had posted in pennystock, but we'll soon be leaving that and investing. I'll focus on  r Stock going forward. Links at bottom of reference posts. 

Below is a recap of why I believe whole-heartedly in Tellurian and the potential growth in this company. As full disclosure and being transparent, I currently hold 119k shares. I began buying Tell at the COVID crash in the .70s. I've wheeled options while rolling money into shares as I've gone. It's been an emotional roller coaster (especially October dips) In one year I started with 60k YOLO and now I'm at 417k at Friday, Jan. 22 close. Even with the recent growth in the last 30 days, this is just the beginning for Tell.

I could make this post a college essay, but I'll aim to keep it short and to the point.

**Who is Tellurian Inc?**

""Tellurian Inc (TELL) is a liquefied natural gas (LNG) development company headquartered in Houston, TX. TELL plans to develop a 27.6 mtpa LNG terminal with five plants near Lake Charles, LA, as well as upstream assets and pipeline infrastructure. The initial phase will likely include 3 plants (16.6 mtpa capacity). The Driftwood project will be financed by equity customer/partners as well as project debt financing. Tellurian will own 28%-42% of Driftwood Holdings and 100% of Tellurian Marketing.""

**Why Tellurian?**

Tellurian is a market disruptor with their proposed Driftwood Project, which will make them the first end-to-end (well for the production company, pipeline network for transportation, terminal LNG for exporting) exporter with an at-cost LNG acquisition independent of domestic Henry Hub (HH) as they'll be selling primarily on Japanese Korean Marker (JKM) at this time.

HH - [https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/natural-gas.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/natural-gas/natural-gas.html)

Driftwood Project has received federal permits and is 30% engineered. Capital will be funded by equity partners, most likely long-term buyers of future LNG. The equity partner will receive future contracts for at-cost LNG in exchange for the front load of capital. Current partners already include Total and GE. $5B capital is needed for the Final Investment Decision (FID).

Current assets include:

Haynesville Gas Production Well to supply gas. 10,067 net acres and 71 producing wells.

Driftwood LNG LLC, owned by Tellurian Inc., is developing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production and export terminal on the west bank of the Calcasieu River, south of Lake Charles, Louisiana.

Driftwood plans to deliver LNG &lt; $3.50/mmBtu. ($3.50/mmBtu FOB LNG price &lt; $2.00 gas delivery + &lt; $0.75 opex + &lt; $0.75 debt service)

Octávio M.C Simoes - CEO - ""Previously, he was President and CEO of Sempra LNG &amp; Midstream where he was responsible for all LNG and natural gas midstream activities in Sempra’s efforts to develop, build and operate liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminals, liquefaction facilities, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities.""

**LNG**

Over the next decade, there will be a large difference in demand to supply for LNG as countries transition from Coal/Nuclear to ""cleaner renewable"" sources from a combination of both natural gas and renewables will make up 74% of the energy landscape. In addition to the domestic shortage of natural gas with the number of offshore rigs shut down during COVID. Even if they turned them on, it would be 1-2 years before production would be online again. Tell will be exporting to Asian LNG market (JKM) and European LNG market (TTF) where local markets for natural gas extraction are limited and will rely on imports from providers such as Tell.

LNG will be the source for heat/cooling as it will be used for power generation including all those EVs and Tesla's that need to charge from the grid.

**Price Targets**

1/21/2021 - Wolfe Research - PT $5.00

At max capacity, Tell valuation would be 100B made by Souki the chairman. Break down the math from there. Tell will retain 40% of capacity for themselves.

2021 - February = $4-$6 (1B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - March/April = $8-$12 - Deals announced gap up (3B valuation / 329M shares)

2021 - May/June or FID announced = $15-$20 - 5B in capital in (5B valuation / 329M shares)

2023 = $45 at Phase 1 Project completion (15B in valuation / 329M shares). Note: I would expect 1 year delay to 2024 due to hurricanes or natural events.

Mid-decade will see a peak in Demand/Supply pricing where LNG company's valuations could get frothy, much like early to mid-2000s with oil peaks.

Future: 40% capacity equals $80 a share

Future: 100% capacity equals $130 a share

Max would be 100B valuation / 329M shares at $300. Equity partners could comprise 40%-60% of equity that would eat into total available shares.

personalfinance,Home Addition - Options to finance help?,"We're looking to put an addition on our home and I'm looking or wondering what the best options might be.  Sorry if this is a mess, my heads overwhelmed with info on what we should / could do here.   
Some info that might help...we still owe 80% on our current mortgage loan and we JUST did a refi which I'm now kicking myself because I could've done a refi-cash out.  Just didn't think we'd be ready for this addition so soon!  We're thinking we might need 100-200k for the job.  We do have almost 100k saved for the job in savings as we've been planning for this for a while.   (we also have an emergency fund)

  
Anyways here's the two options I was exploring but maybe there's something else someone can recommend or help with here that might be better.

**Refi again with cash out** \- Pros are all the money is there with a locked in interest rate for a 30 / year fixed.  Cons is it'll probably raise our mortgage due to a higher rate / larger loan, more costs potentially for the transaction.  

**Line of Credit -** Pro is we can just pull money when we need it and repay back with savings to try and maintain a zero balance for at least a little while. No early termination fee's.  We have 10 years to pull funds, and 20 to repay. Cons are there's a monthly fee and adjustable interest rate.  So if rates go crazy all of a sudden there's a risk there.  

One thought I had was to try and put the money we have in savings someplace else while we get going so it can earn more interest than a savings account, but CD's and other options that are equally safe aren't that great at the moment.  % wise.

Not sure if there's info here I'm forgetting, I could be going about this ALL wrong so hoping someone has some suggestions or advice.  Thanks!  (I will edit and update with additional info if needed)",finance

The money would do better in the markets, but with our goal being to have my wife stay at home, the extra wiggle room in our budge would be nice($250-$300 less).

As to explain a couple of things before I get roasted for them. The luxury car was purchased in cash knowing that we would sell it once we had our first kid. Memories are worth spending money on, and my wife and I knew we wouldn't have another chance for a long time. The tractor was purchased to maintain our property, and makes us money on the side. Not quite enough to make the payment, but close. If it hadn't been for 0% financing, we would have paid cash. As it is, we've owned it for a year, and paid off enough when we purchased it to beat depreciation.

vet,"My cat has had soft stool for 8+ months. We have tried numerous tests, deworming, and antibiotics. Should we keep experimenting with food or take the corticosteroids shot? Any second opinion would be appreciated!","Hello, I tried to search in the sub but could not find anything similar to what my cat is experiencing. I have taken him to two different vets and tried a number of diets at this point. It's not horrible but nothing seems to be really working to improve his condition either. Our current vet suggested giving him a corticosteroids shot to reduce the inflammation. We don't know if we have arrived at the point to take the corticosteroids or if we should keep experimenting with food. So I am posting in hopes to finding a second opinion.

Species: Cat

Age: around 10 or 11. We don't know for sure but he was an adult cat when we adopted him in 2014, our then vet estimated him to be around the same age as our other cat who was four at the time.

Sex/Neuter status: Male/Neutered

Body weight: 7 kg/15.5 lb (he has a large frame and actually looks fit)

History: Crystals in urine 2015, was on Royal Canin Urinary s/o which fixed his urinary problems. Before May, 2020, he ate dry food throughout the day and was fed a portion of wet food daily. Since 2014 he has always been up to date with vaccines, routine checks, and tick/flee prevention. He moved with us internationally in 2018 and moved houses again in 2020.

Clinical signs: Chronic Diarrhea/soft &amp; stinky stool, inflammation in the intestines.

Duration: 8 months

He used to have access to an outdoor area so for two years he didn't need to use a litter box. When we moved into a city apartment in **May, 2020** he started using a litter box. That was when we noticed that his feces were often **soft, sometimes watery, and often stinky**, so we took him to the vet. We did a **series of exams (see link below) but didn't find anything conclusive**. The vet **wormed him out of precaution and put him on an intestinal/digestive diet with probiotic pastes,** which lessened the frequency of him producing watery feces but they were still on the very soft side and were never well formed.

So we saw another vet **in December who suggested that we monitor a cycle of antibiotics and try a monoprotein, grain-free diet** to eliminate possible allergens. We have so far tried 4 different proteins, which all started and finished in a similar fashion. When he started a new protein (in the order of lamb, turkey, duck, beef), his feces would **improve in the first few days (well formed, not very stinky), then going back to the old soft form for a few days, and on day 6 or 7 he would have a watery and stinky one**. Sometimes we could still see the food residue from the color, texture, and smell of what came out of him so we knew he didn't absorb it well.

In this past month we fed him wet food only mixed with power probiotics. We also tried steaming and blending raw, organic mea (turkey and beef) for him (mixed with carrots, pumpkin, or nothing) but unfortunately he didn't like our cooking. So we are on a store-bought beef (only ingredient) monoprotein food now.

Regardless of shape and smell, **he rarely has more than two bowel movements daily so it's usually once or twice a day**. The other cat we have who has been living with him for more than six years has always produced perfectly shaped feces. He may have lost some weight in the past 8-month period but he **doesn't appear sick or skinny.** Even when he had access to the outdoors, he was never really interested in going outside other than releasing himself. **He purrs a lot and is always extremely affectionate.**

personalfinance,Pay off student loan while work is paying part?,"Hi all,

My wife's work pays $150 a month of her student loans. 

Her payment is $400/month and the interest rate is around 3%. 

We don't need the money, so is it worth it to bother paying off her loans early, or just let her job keep paying the $150 with us paying $250 a move for the life of the loan?

I figure that they're paying more than the interest, so I don't see a point in dumping some of our savings to pay it all off now?

Am I thinking correctly on this?",finance
investing,Pandemic-Era Central Banking Is Creating Bubbles Everywhere,"* [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-24/central-banks-are-creating-bubbles-everywhere-in-the-pandemic)

&gt;Signs of bubbles are everywhere as stock prices jumped by a magnitude not seen since the dot-com era, new share listings boom, and Bitcoin, though volatile, continues its generally upward climb. But if company earnings fall short of expectations or the vaccine rollout falters, there’s a risk markets will lurch as investors take money off the table.

&gt;Central bankers, from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Jerome Powell on down, are well aware of the danger. Surging ­valuations—some investors call what’s happening “the everything rally”—have been too obvious to ignore. Powell, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, and other leading central bankers, though taken to task about bubbles in markets in recent months, have played down the concerns. That’s in part because they’re mindful of the danger of closing the monetary spigot too quickly. Indeed, coming out of the last crisis a decade ago, policymakers in some economies were probably too quick to withdraw stimulus for fear of creating bubbles and ended up putting the brakes on the economic recovery.

&gt;***

&gt;“Central banks [in advanced economies] are in a global liquidity trap,” says Jerome Jean Haegeli, chief economist at the Swiss Re Institute in Zurich. “The liquidity bazooka buys time and pushes up asset prices but has zero value in improving economic trend growth. Like a black hole, once you are in it, it is extremely difficult to get out. That’s where we are in central banking, we are in a liquidity black hole.”",finance
personalfinance,Bought a used 2014 Toyota Camry yesterday. Here is my experience.,"For starters, my prior 1998 blazers motor died while driving home on the interstate Monday. So I purchased this vehicle without having one. (wife and I shared her vehicle for a week)

I got a pre-approval from my credit union, a $13K loan, of which the car couldn’t be more then 8 years old, less then 100k mileage, at 3.24% interest rate (credit score was a 776). I was also given the option to include upgrades for 5K if I wanted.

In my mindset, I was showing up at the dealerships requiring this:


“I’m looking to purchase a a vehicle out the door 11,500k, with less then 50k miles, 4 doors, and it can’t be older then 8 years old.”

I told them I didn’t really care what the car brand was, because truthfully I don’t really care. A car is a car. Brands don’t matter to me. My FIL (my mechanic) told me to stay away from dodge, Kia, and Hyundai (I guess these brands build their vehicles cheaply).

The 4th dealership I went to had a 09 Camry with 45k miles on it, priced at 8.9k. Well within my means of what I wanted, and I’m sure my bank would be okay with me buying a slightly older then 8 year old vehicle (I think). Anyway, I told the sales guy I wanted to further look at more cars and this guy really tried to sell me this car and tried to get me to regret leaving. Told him I might be back because an 09 is a pretty older car.

5th dealership, I told my guy my desires in a vehicle. He went onto his database and I picked out a 2014 Camry that wasn’t “on the lot yet”. The car had 61k miles on it, and had a price tag of 11.5K on it. The vehicle was not yet cleaned from the prior owner, and it didn’t have a “check whatever the mechanic does before it gets on the lot yet either. I gave the car a test drive, and I determined that I was okay driving this car for 10+ years. I told him let’s talk numbers.

He knows that I want the car out of the door for $11.5K. He came back to me with 12.1K out the door. I told him don’t worry about your mechanic checking it out (under the hood looked fine to me) , and don’t worry about cleaning the car out either. I then told him to cut it down to 11.5k. He brought it back to the manager and manager said he wasn’t going to lose my business for $600-700 bucks.

I went in knowing I could get a decent car, and knew I didn’t have to settle. I wasn’t desperate, and was able to get the same car 5 Years newer for maybe 1K more then the other dealership.

Also, the sales guy I worked with wasn’t pushy, as I knew what I wanted. So he couldn’t really try and sell me shit I didn’t need. Super cool dude.

I got a 2014 Camry with 61K miles, all the fees, documentations fee, registration fees, title fees, out the door for 11,500. He even threw in a free tank of gas and an oil change (I didn’t even ask but cool) my interest rate will be 3.24%. I’m pretty happy with my first actual used car purchase.",finance

investing,Has Investing Become Less About Fundamentals and More About Group Psychology?,"I get a sense from watching the market in the past years and company fundamentals matter less and less. Seems like as of late you make gains by simply riding the wave of investor sentiment regardless of where the long term road leads. Oddly enough, this sentiment, which often seems irrational, seems to be propping up companies with failed business models since those companies can cash out on the stock gains. I fear this is going to end very badly because eventually there could be a sudden and deep shift, leaving certain stocks or sectors in a very bad downward spiral. Akin to the tension that springs a significant earthquake. Then when the volatility hits, its about which way the Fed and Congress decide to move.

Is this logic flawed and if not, what percent of investors are successful focusing on investor sentiment and not fundamentals?",finance
personalfinance,Should I build an ADU (2nd house) on my property?,"I have 1200 sf home in the Phoenix area. I’m considering building a second dwelling in the backyard. I’d probably live in the new dwelling and rent out the main house (3 bed, 2 bath). This is the fastest growing county in the nation. 

Me: 43M. No other debts. Income @ $70k/year

Owe: $157K, current monthly mortgage (PITI) is $1040 with 27 years left @ 3.5% interest rate

The house could be rented for $1500-$1700/mo.

The property is zoned for an ADU (accessory dwelling unit, aka casita, aka granny flat) and I’ve been approved for financing (renovation loan). Up to $150K (shooting for less though) for the ADU, and around 800 sf. New mortgage payment would be around $1500/mo. 

My parents are mid 70’s and I could see this being a great option in the future. In the meantime, I can rent house and pay mortgage in full from rental income while saving/investing/paying down mortgage faster.

Is there a professional that I could hire/ consult to help me review my options?

Do any of you guys have any feedback, things I need to consider before I get this build going? Will renters suck and trash my house? 

Please help with your advice and insight. Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Interest Rate - Lender Credit,"Super green to the details of mortgages and house buying in general.  Was talking to a lender about getting a pre-approval letter for potentially putting in an offer.  After providing him with the information he asked for, he said that I would have the option to chose between the 2 below:

2.375 - No Lender Credit

or 

2.625 - $4000 Lender Credit 

What I'm confused about is why the lender credit for a higher interest rate?  I thought typically lenders want to charge points in order to ""buy down"" the interest rate?  Why in this case I'm getting a lower rate for no extra fees?  So isn't the right thing to do in this situation to select the 2.375% rate, correct?",finance
personalfinance,"I've built up $40k in savings: investment property, open Roth IRA, or student loans? Open joint account?","Title says it. I'm looking to do something with my savings and jump into the next chapter of life with my partner. Pay off all loans (debt free)? Move to a new city/country? Maybe buy duplex or small home/condo of our own? Enter into domestic partnership or marriage? Open joint account? Travel the world?  All options are on the table and it's a bit confusing (but also exciting). Que the pandemic and all associated limitations. Never had this sort of buying power before where in the next year I could actually have a down payment for a house. Family and SO have their own biases so I'm seeking reasonable/ objective input.

Tl; dr: So I have this cash that's just sitting around. My gut is to pay off my student loans to be debt free. $40k in savings ($25k of which was saved in the last year alone), I'm caught between pragmatic &amp; opportunistic. Looking for advice, what would you do in my shoes?

Employment:

$70k/year and monthly take-home is $3,800 as an entry level position. I'm currently not putting anything into the company retirement option (minimal employer match &amp; no match until after the first year, which just became available for me).

Expenses:

Credit card payments over the last year average to $1, 013/mo. Debit card is probably another $500. These include misc. like food, gas, online classes, gifts, some travel etc. Haven't exactly been frugal...

On top of this, my living costs (car payments + rent) = $1,100/mo. I live with my SO, our finances are separate but we're sharing costs. Their name's on both the car &amp; apartment leases.

Student Loans:

$62.5k, in 4 separate groups (by year), interest rates are smallest on largest loans ranging from 5.3% on $20k to 6% on 10K. Federal unsubsidized, all of which were supposed to go into repayment last August but are all in covid forbearance. I opted for extended repayment for flexibility but with intention to pay much more, the combined estimated monthly would have been around $400/mo minimum. I dislike the idea of paying this for years on-end and consider throwing everything I've set aside into halving this debt. However I wouldn't mind if the alternative means giving me a leg up on purchasing property/other long-term investment.

Savings:

The reason I'm here asking for advice. I have low-risk stocks my relative setup when I was born for my college tuition, after which I still have about $15k in the account. I honestly don't fully understand them and don't want to really mess with it unless I'm emptying it all to put down on a house or similar. Advice welcome. On top of that I have another $25k in savings set aside over this last year that was supposed to go towards student loans. Don't have a designated emergency fund or retirement &amp; up until covid happened, I was plodding along with assumption that paying student loans was the best ROI.

Other considerations:

Financial experience: Limited, in case it's not apparent.  I do have good credit (fico score = 780) but not much credit history; Parents were cosigners on my college apartments, they helped with undergrad tuition (loan in my name). I've never owned a car or had considerable loans/purchases other than tuition. My SO owns the car. I've never missed a credit card payment, expenses are minimal. Graduated with masters degree and I've retained employment through the pandemic so that's a big plus in my book. I imagine it'd be hard to get approved for a mortgage on my own, however see below on relationship.

More about the job: I have a year at my company  but I'm looking to transition into my preferred industry that realistically I'd expect a pay cut to around $45 - $50k/year for entry level. The transition would be to pursue my passion and field of study. Some of the current experience translates but pay cut would be inevitable (this would be worth it to me just for the job fulfilment alone).  With covid the sector is struggling a bit more than my current industry.  I have my masters degree but again no experience in the sector; I have yet to land an interview so may be some time before it materializes.

Relationship: Serious committed relationship of several years; This is the person I want to spend my life with! Have yet to combine our finances and could also use advice here. They make considerably more than me ($110k/year) so the combined income would of course change the financial landscape I've detailed above significantly. Don't know their full financial situation but I believe they do have a few grand in credit card debt and they have the car ($400/mo for 5 years), no other major loans. We're late 20's/early 30's so naturally talking about big life choices on the horizon like marriage, moving &amp; buying a house, year off for travel etc. Feeling a bit stagnant in our current living situation and looking to mix it up. Obviously this pandemic changes things but feels like we're both doing solid compared to most. My industry is typically conservative (traditional office, work up the ranks &amp; earn license, limited time off, no remote work) which limits where/if we could move. In contrast my partner's is unconventional (tech) that allows for flexibility to work anywhere.

So there you have it! Any advice (&amp; criticism) welcome, just happy to have someone else's perspective. If you've read this far, thank you! I'm not very financially savvy, don't understand investing, real estate (or even taxes) so I'm a bit nervous to make a bold decision but also don't want to just sit around with my hands tied. Mostly I just recognize that I have this opportunity of liquid assets and am much more fortunate than many during these times. I think about single parents or business owners who really are at the end of their rope; just feels like I should be doing something with my situation that others may never get.

Edit: I know there's a lot of straight-forward things I can just look up in the sidebar like cutting down my expenses, starting to get that employer match on retirement fund &amp; paying the highest interest rate group on my loans. I'm posting because I find myself lacking the big picture direction/goals. I see and want the very safe route to saving for retirement but also acknowledge that my partner and I are talking about unconventional lifestyle choices (moving around/travel, investing).

There may be some amount of wanting to have our cake and eat it too. We both want that long-term stability for when we reach our golden years, but don't want to necessarily be playing it safe for the next 30 years just waiting to retire.",finance
solar,Not sure who to call regarding inverter error.,"In 2012 my new build home came with solar, the company that supported it went out of business, and then they were bought by another company that also went out of business. So our solar installation was effectively orphaned, though I knew it was still working based upon the statements from the power utility. Occasionally I would notice it wasn't working, but a reboot of the inverter would bring it back online. Seven years later I added Tesla solar with powerwalls and had them direct the existing solar into the new solar so that it was all monitored via the app, fed the powerwalls, etc. It all worked great for maybe 6 months, then the old solar inverter stopped working completely and now displays the error""

Line failure: undervoltage L2

The inverter is still under warranty from the actual manufacturer, but so far it's been a huge pain trying to communicate with them, and more importantly I don't know if the issue is actually the inverter or something else in the system.

stocks,Stock Market News for Today | PLTR / GM / AAPL / TSLA / FB / MSFT &amp; Other Stock Market News [01-25],"**Stocks close out the week with big gains as Big Tech comes back in flavor. The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook &amp; Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM &amp; Ford spiked last week, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% &amp; the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies &amp; Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil &amp; Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel’s drop last week, Microsoft &amp; Starbucks reporting after Tuesday’s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&amp;T &amp; Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday &amp; Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla &amp; Facebook reporting after Wednesday’s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday &amp; Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low &amp; the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It’s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I’ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla’s models. It’s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way… [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV &amp; self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB &amp; the shorts continues, with this move making Citron’s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might pump up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons &amp; especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don’t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of the pullback… keep investing safely &amp; have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

personalfinance,I should refinance my private loan right?,"Hi there, 

Just double checking some stuff but I think I know the right answer. 

I’m 26 and graduated in 2020, and have two private loans in addition to my federal loans that I’d like to pay off aggressively. 

The two are with discover:
$7968 @ 6.615% variable
$7768 @ 8.365% variable 

My monthly payment is set at 147 dollars together, as it’s a 15 year loan. I’m not doing anything with federal loans yet as the moratorium is pushed till September, so I’m going to use the time to attack the other loans. 

I have a well funded emergency fund, and separate to that have another savings account with about the same amount as that higher interest loan. 

I think I’m definitely going to pay off that second loan because I can just get rid of it and not have to worry about the high interest rate. 

However, I checked credible.com and was able to get pre-approved for a refinancing loan through PenFed for 3.35% variable for five years and RISLA at 3.65% fixed, also five years. 

If I were to pay off the second loan and just refinance the first loan, it would put me down to five years with the same monthly payment I’m paying now, $148 and substantially save me on interest. I could also use the money I have budgeted monthly for my federal loans, about 300 or so, and put that towards the refinanced loan as well to save on even more interest, but at the end of the day, even with the minimums for five years, I would only owe $700 or so on the $8000 which seems like a great deal. 

I’ve been looking into investing and general advice has been don’t invest when you have debt more than 4%, and before, both loans were above that. Well now, one loan will be gone and the other will be at 3.7%. 

Are there any downsides to refinancing? I am trying to keep my credit free of as many hits as possible, but the two hard checks I have now drop off in June of this year from my last student loan check and last credit card. I will be getting an apartment this year, and my score is 770 all around, so I’m in a good spot there as well. Will the hard check make it not worth the refinancing? I would think it would still be worth it but that seems to be the only downside of refinancing this loan.

I have about $350 allocated towards other student loans but that won’t do anything until September, and I don’t want to do anything with them before any debt resolution stuff is or isn’t announced. Should I put all $350 on top of the $148 and just get the loan paid off, or do you think it’s worth investing in just a simple three fund portfolio with maybe half of it and then put the other half into the loan?

I was planning on selling some stock this year (2021) to buy said electric vehicle, When I sell the stock, it'll be at a profit, and I've had the stock for over a year.

personalfinance,Which should I start to pay off next?,"I know there's 2 general philosophies on debt in personal finance:

•pay off the debts in order of high to low interest

•pay off the small debts first to get rid of a payment (and to keep the emotional momentum of a $0 balance going)

I'm very close to paying off my credit card (higher interest debt) and then I'm on to my student loans. I'm still in school so these numbers will change next fall.

• $19,500 Discover at 8.515%

• $4,500 unsub federal at 4.53%

• $3,500 sub federal at 2.75%

• $2,000 unsub federal at 2.75%

The Discover loan is accumulating interest and requires a ~$70 payment monthly. The federal loans are not accumulating interest (according to my account page) and require no payments.

I make roughly $15k a year. I may get an on-campus position that instead of pay it reduces my tuition by ~50% if I only do the minimum, pays hourly if I do extra, but will require me to lessen my off-campus hours regardless.

I currently make ~$500-900 monthly AFTER all required payments, depending on if I have exams or large projects in school. I work nearly full time in summer. I NEED very little of that for day to day expense, e.g $40/month bus pass, basic groceries/essentials like milk, eggs, medicine, etc that I can't buy on campus.

My monthly salary will likely go down to 2/3 to 1/2 of what it is currently if I get the position.

By philosophy A's rules, I should start dumping money into the Discover loan.

By philosophy B's rules, I should start at the $2,000 loan and work up.

Is there an advantage one way or another? Thank you!

personalfinance,HYSA with fast transfer,"I currently have a HYSA that I’m mostly satisfied with, besides the fact that when I transfer money, it usually takes a few days for the money to actually show up in my account. I’m not complaining because I know this is pretty standard, and it’s usually no problem when I can anticipate a need and transfer the money ahead of time. I’ve considered in the past opening a separate savings account with my current bank that I have a checking account with and keep a few thousand there to give me peace of mind, and this may just be what I have to do. I was just hoping there was a savings with a half decent interest rate that had a faster way to access my money.

For example, my fiancée and I are going on our honeymoon in two weeks. We have money in savings set aside for this trip. However, I don’t know exactly how much of this we’ll use, and I don’t want to just transfer it all to our checking. I also don’t know what amount to guess that I should transfer if I don’t move all of it. It would be wonderful to have instant access to our savings so if we need more funds, we can easily transfer it over and have it immediately. With my current savings account, we’d have to request transfer at least 2-3 days before it’s available to us. Again, I’m not complaining, I’m just hoping for alternatives. Thanks!",finance

I might be wrong to look at it this way but, if we're looking at the best way to invest $2,000/mo but over 10 years in an S&amp;P 500 tracking index fund the CFP's fees would reduce earnings by 15%.

economy,Do not ignore this about inflation,"In a progressive healthy economy where production is constantly growing, all goods and services are represented by all the currency in the system. Therefore, the value of the total quantity of currency must be equal to the value of the total quantity of goods and services bought which are represented by the gross domestic product. Here is the equation that describes the relationship, being nominal GDP the multiplication between the average price and the quantity of products:

https://preview.redd.it/7q6qn7i1eid61.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd993c1d45ee22ad771c6926b4e9e40a6958e98a

In the equation, velocity of currency “V”, indicates the number of transactions per amount of currency. For example, when someone uses 10$ to purchase some product and latter the seller of goods spends the same amount to buy other products, in this case velocity equals to 2 as the same amount is used in different transactions. To simplify complexity, we are going to suppose that velocity is constant and equal to one. Then equation shows that the value of currency unit must vary exactly and inversely with the amount put into circulation. Keeping in context, adding currency supply in an existing circulating amount through credit spending or fiscal stimulus, devalues all the existing currency against all goods and services.

https://preview.redd.it/b0e8bje3eid61.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9604798703fe44dbcf8f4740a790995331ef2014

To understand how the process is carried out. Suppose, for example, that the Central Bank lows interest rates and many corporations and individuals reconsider to borrow to purchase real state. The first effect of this expenditures will be to raise the prices of housing as the demand increased, this is described in the second equation. Real state agencies and their employees, then, will have higher revenue and they will spend more for the goods and services they want. The sellers of this goods and services will be able to raise their prices because of this increased demand, here velocity starts to grow describing the first equation. Those who have increased currency income will be willing to pay higher prices rather than do without the goods, for them, a dollar will have a smaller subjective value than before.

Basically, this purchase-chain process spreads among the economy and assuming production of goods and services has not incremented, its prices will have increased correspondingly. However, the state is not richer than before. Credit used in a non-productive way, creates fake demand in the sector involved distorting its prices. Other sectors and people not related will basically see prices raising and their incomes will keep being the same but with less purchasing power. This is how inflation expands through the economy and it is not an average standard of 2% as we are told. Depending on the consumer goods and services purchased our currency value could be much more exposed.

For a better understanding let’s simulate the value of a dollar over time so it will be easier to realize the scope of an inflationary currency. At first, let’s simulate the historic US currency since 1913, more than a hundred years of currency devaluation:

https://preview.redd.it/h2qoyux4eid61.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21ff5e48fbf1c0e1882b870da8573dcb4eae472

Since then, the dollar has devalued 96% of its initial value. What people were able to buy in 1913 for 4¢ you can buy it now for one dollar, or what is the same, one dollar back then had the same purchasing power as 26.05$ today.

Remember that the dollar purchasing power is calculated using the inflation on consumer prices (CPI). Inflation generally caused by an increase on currency supply against production as it has been described before.

In the chart you can see how the dollar almost permanently goes down in value. During this century, specially since the federal reserve was created in 1913, monetary policies have been constantly manipulated to spend and add currency supply in the economy. In 1933 Roosevelt implemented the executive order 6102 which required all persons to deliver all but a small amount of gold coins to the Federal Reserve in exchange for 20.67$ per oz. Then the price of gold was fixed to 35$ per oz. This expanded gold reserves and as them grew and had more value, allowed commercial banks to expand currency supply through credit. Realize that the gold standard was a constrain for the government power because always limited credit.

In 1971, already in the dollar standard placed in 1944 after Bretton woods agreement, President Nixon detached the dollar from gold and currencies became fluctuant in the market . Basically, US was creating more dollars than gold reserves permitted and borrowing countries claimed the gold that was backing their dollars. This made significant change in the banking system as credit lending became not limited by the amount of gold hold as reserves but for the dollar reserves known as base money.

The main reason of not having a gold standard is to allow government and central banks to spend and print currency, limited only by monetary policies dictated by themselves. This can be used to stimulate the economy during a recession period, natural disaster, a pandemic or even to subsidize war. At the end, this gives control of the currency value to a centralized entity and power to choose which sector to expand.

So, as you can see in the chart below, it shows the commercial and industrial loans issued by commercial banks. Specially after monetary policies easing, commercial banks have brutally expanded their business:

https://preview.redd.it/8wlzufw8eid61.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ed8d5658b3dec4d765ad4bf128213a6222d0eed

Back in the dollar devaluation simulations, here is the last 20 years of US chart inflation based on BLS data, which is an average of 2.35% inflation per year and is going to give us a first vision on how effects our savings:

https://preview.redd.it/hq7pb0rbeid61.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f01f66a9110e499adc199df214412a3b24b8860

The amount of 0.64$ back in 2000 today have the purchase power of one dollar, for this 20-year period the dollar has devalued 36%. If some responsible person wants to save 100000$ in the early 2000, right now this 100k$ savings can buy only what they were able to afford 64000$ back in 2000. This last statement could sound a little complex at the beginning but its key to understand how the system shapes human behavior, as it shows how generations are susceptible to spend instead of saving because the system incentives for it. if you spend more right now you can consume more goods and services than in the next year, that’s the message behind. It’s a high time preference mindset that incites to spend and consume instead of saving and investing into something productive.

Now, it is important to analyze how CPI is measured. We mentioned before the standard inflation of around 2% does not apply to everyone as we consume different products and brands. The chart below is from shadowstats.com and measures the CPI as if it were calculated using the methodologies in place in 1980 (blue line) and right now by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (red line):

https://i.redd.it/3ztvkh0deid61.gif

Back in that times inflation was determined comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time was changed to reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living. Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI) allowing the government to report a lower CPI.

A cost of living index basically measures the inflation on the *generic* goods and services that people consume, it reflexes the potential consumer substitution in response to relative price changes. For example, an ecologic orange juice priced 2$ which its price is incremented to 2.20$. The CPI should indicate a 10% inflation rate but being able the option to purchase a generic orange juice (with extra sugar) for 2$ which its price has not incremented, then the CPI is rated 0%. This is how a CPI based in a cost of living index rates inflation. Now, you may have a better idea on how inflation can affect your cost of living or at least influence to buy lower quality products.

Putting numbers in inflation rates above 2%, here is a table on how a dollar is devalued for 10 years in different constant rates, expressed in % and its actual purchasing power. Additionally, I encourage you to visit Chapwoodindex.com to see real inflation in the 50 largest cities in US.

Our budget is about 1.1M. We found a house in our desired neighborhood that is a fixer upper. The house is $535k and we are looking to put around 400K into it which would bring it right around all the other houses in the community.

We have a couple hundred thousand we can use towards the reno but for this question lets assume we want to finance the entire $400k.

(FYI The first $535k for the actual house will be a VA loan so really no money will be going down for that piece)

\*Do we take 1 mortgage for the original $535k and a second mortgage for the $400k at a higher interest rate? 

\*Is it all just put down as one mortgage for the total amount once the project is done?

\*Is what I'm suggesting even possible or do we have to take out a personal loan for the reno?

economy,Interest rates at zero means that it's highly likely that the economy's prospect of growth is zero or less than zero,"If interest rates have to be set at zero to stimulate growth, that means that investors aren't willing to pay a single dollar in interest for their investments. Short term, this means what everyone thinks, that money is free and investments will shoot up.

Longer term, it's a sign of zero growth and when the market reaches it's true value with such low interest rates - the forward growth will be zero or negative. Really what these interst rates mean is that we cant even get an investor to pay a 2 % per year to invest in the future of several countries.

Think about it. Isn't that pretty messed up? 
People here will now say that with zero interest rates, the roof for markets is infinite - that is correct. But if interest rates go up to even 0,1 % with an infinite valuation - even that tiny raise could lead to a huge crash.

So the question is. Why are so few willing to pay to borrow money to invest in Americas (and several other countries) future? Because the future outlook is awful, just awful. Sooner or later this realization will hit people and the markets will react.

It also means that inflation isn't coming. More likely if my assumptions are correct, fall of asset prices is the first step, then delation of money and then we hit inflation. Why? Because if the prospects for growth is zero and stocks go up. As soon as the interest rate rises, stocks go down. People sell stocks, stocks go down even more. People won't spend money, leads to deflation. Then people realize that commodities and other things are getting more and more expensive and harder to come by, that leads to inflation. Problem here is that there is no guarantee that stocks will go with that inflation, rather we could have a terrible situation with inflation of money, lower stock prices and higher prices of living.

economy,The entire financial system has been bailed out,"To understand how the banking system works, it would be interesting to analyze the baking structure through a credit lending process and unwrap step by step all financial engineering build on the background.

To make it as simple as possible, let’s simulate the process of an individual taking out a mortgage to buy a house, since the currency is borrowed from a commercial bank (buyer) to the transaction of the currency to another bank (seller), the seller's deposit account. Every step visualized in both balance sheets of the commercial banks.

At first the loan is created when the customer borrows currency, the balance sheet of the buyer bank looks like this:

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/d5b7qrrt9jd61.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35725cd4740de903db593dc74686ab049063a1ef)

In the asset side of the commercial bank appears the loan, in the liability side, the borrower's account is credited with a new deposit. At this moment money is created out of nothing with the loan matching the other side of the balance sheet. Bank deposits are simply a record of how much the bank itself owes its customers. So, they are a liability of the bank, not an asset that could be lent out. Realize that the bank’s business model relies on receiving a higher interest rate on the loans (or other assets) than the rate it pays out on its deposits. It is important to mention that the repayment of this loan exempting the interest, destroys the same amount.

Proceeding with the house purchase, this is how the transaction between banks look like when the house buyer and the seller settle the transaction:

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/jtopacgv9jd61.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81ff5b0455f1073a56214bc86e04f261dee606da)

As seen in the figure, deposits are transferred to the seller’s bank along with reserves, which the buyer’s bank uses to settle the transaction. Unfortunately for the buyer bank settling all transactions in this way would be unsustainable, the buyers bank could run out of reserve to meet possible outflows or reserve requirements which fixes a Deposit/Reserve ratio limiting potential loan demand.

Under this scenario, a withdrawal or a potential loan lent, could place the buyer's bank under the minimum reserve requirement. Being a commercial bank in this position, it is necessary to borrow liquidity in the repo market. Also, banks with excess reserves are in the opposite situation, lending liquidity in the repo market in exchange of earnings.

The Repo market is an over the counter (OTC) market where financial products are traded between two parties in exchange of cash, generally treasuries as are the pristine collateral with low risk. This is how the exchange looks like between two entities:

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ib7327zx9jd61.png?width=1287&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65c5b92eb57121af88f5a0ad5beeeda221db522c)

Institutional investors lend cash in exchange of collateral typically T-Bonds as we mentioned, after a short maturity generally a few days the bank buys-back the treasury at a slightly higher price, earning the counterpart a little profit.

To keep in context with the FED policies, central bank uses net transactions data reported by commercial banks for a particular computation period (few weeks) to calculate reserve requirements applying the reserve ratios. If the commercial bank reserve is less than the reserve requirement, it must borrow from the discount window. That means borrowing directly from the central bank which lends at an interest rate usually 1% higher than the repo market rate. Basically, it is much cheaper to borrow from the repo market than directly from the central bank.

On September 2019 a disruption in the repo market led to a sharp spike in short-term interest rates, shown in the chart below:

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bvn82s90ajd61.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd0e2e4b77c228ef49d6ea411014ac06a1338889)

As we described before, trying to find liquidity to cover lack of reserves, commercial banks found out this scenario. Institutions refused to lend for treasuries and asked a higher rate, as a consequence, the rise in liquidity demand made the repo rate to sky-rocket forcing the central bank to step in.

Realize that liquidity problems were already hitting the economy even before the COVID crises. This reveal how commercial banks are in the edge of insolvency as they need liquidity to keep issuing loans that make them earn with some interest and keep the business afloat.

However, like in 2008, the FED intervened with Quantitative easing (QE) program. This monetary policy tool is not necessarily inflationary as the general public believe. In this situation is generally used to recapitalize the banking sector. Let’s draw how a commercial bank balance sheet looks like after a central bank QE purchase:

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/e8a1i9n1ajd61.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1a8678d9dfa13484825e22515bbcfb50bc99180)

Notice that central bank liabilities are the same reserves as the commercial bank’s assets during all the process, reserves are under the central bank umbrella. At first, the bank is under the minimum reserve requirement and owns all kinds of assets (T, MBS…). In this case a treasury, and the FED is directly purchasing it, adding the asset in its balance sheet and creating reserves out of nowhere in its liabilities side which mirrors the commercial bank’s assets. As we mentioned before this is not directly inflationary but provides the commercial bank with new reserves extending the loan facility to a new level, QE basically greases the printing machine.

Additionally, QE is used to manipulate interest rates. The chart below shows how interest rates are adjusted according to the increase or decrease of bank reserves. When reserves grow, interest rates decrease. And when reserves decrease interest rates rise.

So, QE is also implemented to keep interest rates low to incentive corporations to borrow. As interest rates goes to 0% demand for credit grows.

The following chart shows how interest rates are kept artificially low as the big debt cycle is broken since 2008.

inflation,Do not ignore this about inflation,"In a progressive healthy economy where production is constantly growing, all goods and services are represented by all the currency in the system. Therefore, the value of the total quantity of currency must be equal to the value of the total quantity of goods and services bought which are represented by the gross domestic product. Here is the equation that describes the relationship, being nominal GDP the multiplication between the average price and the quantity of products: 

https://preview.redd.it/q98f7jlsbjd61.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1e03708c94d7eeb9da60b33927c0a5fcc3dac9c

In the equation, velocity of currency “V”, indicates the number of transactions per amount of currency. For example, when someone uses 10$ to purchase some product and latter the seller of goods spends the same amount to buy other products, in this case velocity equals to 2 as the same amount is used in different transactions. To simplify complexity, we are going to suppose that velocity is constant and equal to one. Then equation shows that the value of currency unit must vary exactly and inversely with the amount put into circulation. Keeping in context, adding currency supply in an existing circulating amount through credit spending or fiscal stimulus, devalues all the existing currency against all goods and services. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bg8nv7svbjd61.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddffd29e96c73e57fd299fa4cc7f1ca46f585f4b)

To understand how the process is carried out. Suppose, for example, that the Central Bank lows interest rates and many corporations and individuals reconsider to borrow to purchase real state. The first effect of this expenditures will be to raise the prices of housing as the demand increased, this is described in the second equation. Real state agencies and their employees, then, will have higher revenue and they will spend more for the goods and services they want. The sellers of this goods and services will be able to raise their prices because of this increased demand, here velocity starts to grow describing the first equation. Those who have increased currency income will be willing to pay higher prices rather than do without the goods, for them, a dollar will have a smaller subjective value than before.

Basically, this purchase-chain process spreads among the economy and assuming production of goods and services has not incremented, its prices will have increased correspondingly. However, the state is not richer than before. Credit used in a non-productive way, creates fake demand in the sector involved distorting its prices. Other sectors and people not related will basically see prices raising and their incomes will keep being the same but with less purchasing power. This is how inflation expands through the economy and it is not an average standard of 2% as we are told. Depending on the consumer goods and services purchased our currency value could be much more exposed.

For a better understanding let’s simulate the value of a dollar over time so it will be easier to realize the scope of an inflationary currency. At first, let’s simulate the historic US currency since 1913, more than a hundred years of currency devaluation:

https://preview.redd.it/0nrs2rfwbjd61.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85f1381692a6490e6fd60c40d1f266ea794f61d0

Since then, the dollar has devalued 96% of its initial value. What people were able to buy in 1913 for 4¢ you can buy it now for one dollar, or what is the same, one dollar back then had the same purchasing power as 26.05$ today.

Remember that the dollar purchasing power is calculated using the inflation on consumer prices (CPI). Inflation generally caused by an increase on currency supply against production as it has been described before.

In the chart you can see how the dollar almost permanently goes down in value. During this century, specially since the federal reserve was created in 1913, monetary policies have been constantly manipulated to spend and add currency supply in the economy. In 1933 Roosevelt implemented the executive order 6102 which required all persons to deliver all but a small amount of gold coins to the Federal Reserve in exchange for 20.67$ per oz. Then the price of gold was fixed to 35$ per oz. This expanded gold reserves and as them grew and had more value, allowed commercial banks to expand currency supply through credit. Realize that the gold standard was a constrain for the government power because always limited credit.

In 1971, already in the dollar standard placed in 1944 after Bretton woods agreement, President Nixon detached the dollar from gold and currencies became fluctuant in the market . Basically, US was creating more dollars than gold reserves permitted and borrowing countries claimed the gold that was backing their dollars. This made significant change in the banking system as credit lending became not limited by the amount of gold hold as reserves but for the dollar reserves known as base money. 

The main reason of not having a gold standard is to allow government and central banks to spend and print currency, limited only by monetary policies dictated by themselves. This can be used to stimulate the economy during a recession period, natural disaster, a pandemic or even to subsidize war. At the end, this gives control of the currency value to a centralized entity and power to choose which sector to expand.

So, as you can see in the chart below, it shows the commercial and industrial loans issued by commercial banks. Specially after monetary policies easing, commercial banks have brutally expanded their business:

https://preview.redd.it/fsux3ztybjd61.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9531872ba373f3cd9cde50883f27ddace3a549fb

Back in the dollar devaluation simulations, here is the last 20 years of US chart inflation based on BLS data, which is an average of 2.35% inflation per year and is going to give us a first vision on how effects our savings: 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/yp8hs381cjd61.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15f7650315f0e0b3a4c181bc1c60d19b1bbbd0bb)

The amount of 0.64$ back in 2000 today have the purchase power of one dollar, for this 20-year period the dollar has devalued 36%. If some responsible person wants to save 100000$ in the early 2000, right now this 100k$ savings can buy only what they were able to afford 64000$ back in 2000. This last statement could sound a little complex at the beginning but its key to understand how the system shapes human behavior, as it shows how generations are susceptible to spend instead of saving because the system incentives for it. if you spend more right now you can consume more goods and services than in the next year, that’s the message behind. It’s a high time preference mindset that incites to spend and consume instead of saving and investing into something productive.

Now, it is important to analyze how CPI is measured. We mentioned before the standard inflation of around 2% does not apply to everyone as we consume different products and brands. The chart below is from shadowstats.com and measures the CPI as if it were calculated using the methodologies in place in 1980 (blue line) and right now by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (red line):

[ ](https://i.redd.it/el9j3qf2cjd61.gif)

Back in that times inflation was determined comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time was changed to reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living. Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI) allowing the government to report a lower CPI.

A cost of living index basically measures the inflation on the *generic* goods and services that people consume, it reflexes the potential consumer substitution in response to relative price changes. For example, an ecologic orange juice priced 2$ which its price is incremented to 2.20$. The CPI should indicate a 10% inflation rate but being able the option to purchase a generic orange juice (with extra sugar) for 2$ which its price has not incremented, then the CPI is rated 0%. This is how a CPI based in a cost of living index rates inflation. Now, you may have a better idea on how inflation can affect your cost of living or at least influence to buy lower quality products.

Putting numbers in inflation rates above 2%, here is a table on how a dollar is devalued for 10 years in different constant rates, expressed in % and its actual purchasing power. Additionally, I encourage you to visit Chapwoodindex.com to see real inflation in the 50 largest cities in US.

personalfinance,Home Equity loan,"My wife and I were considering buying a new house. Our reasoning was we wanted an upgraded kitchen, more space and a deck. I currently owe about 280k on my house which currently appraises for around $400k. My mortgage is very reasonable at $1,600 a month. Because the market is so crazy right now to get the kind of house we want it would probably be pushing if not exceeding $500k. We did our budget and found we could comfortably spend about an extra $700 a month towards our home. I don't think we could get the home we want for that budget increase, however I could accomplish the renovations we would want for our current home for around $80,000. Does it make sense to do something like a home equity loan and make the changes we want. my plan would be to do 80K over 15 years which would put the payment just under $700 a month factoring in the average interest rate for a 15 HEL, we both have excellent credit so I don't doubt we would get better than the average.

I must admit, I am a novice in Economics but really do enjoy learning more each day. One thing that has been frustrating is the lack of explanations on the mechanics of the yield curve. Google and YouTube really have been trash with respect to this topic which is why I resorted to Reddit.

My two questions are this:

1. How are these rates determined? Does the Fed influence them or are they a product of Supply and Demand?
2. After looking at the yield curve and seeing its steepness (after about 2 years), what is that implying for the next year in the economy? Is it assuming that for the near-term the economy will need help, hence the low rates, increasing borrowing but after two years we should be back toward normality? Or is it saying that inflation will increase? It's weird seeing that a couple years ago the 30 year was almost double. Any help would greatly be appreciated!

personalfinance,Need some advice paying off credit card debt,"Hello everyone, I’m sure something like this gets posted all the time but I need some help. Over the years I’ve racked up about $12k in credit card debt from being in college instead of working and just being a dumb kid who wasn’t responsible and now have to pay for it. Now I’m employed and would like to start paying that off. My annual salary is $30k so obviously it’ll take a while but my expenses are minimal as my employer covers my housing and truck. My thought is that the best way to do this would be to get a personal loan to get the interest rates lower than the 21.9% and 22.9% on my two cards. Would this be the right move for paying it off gradually? My credit is okay but not good at about 650 so I would like to start getting it up for down the road when I need to purchase a new vehicle or house. I feel like right now with minimal expenses and no family is the perfect time to tackle this debt. 

If a personal loan is the right move do y’all recommend any online services for that? I’d rather not use my personal bank because it’s a small town and people talk. I hear advertisements for loan companies on radio and whatnot but have no clue who the legitimate companies to go through are. Thanks in advance y’all.

EDIT: While I appreciate y’all’s concern for my spending, it is very much under control and has been for quite some time.

If things reopen, there should be a physical shopping spree, and well located malls should do well.

Fat dividends coming?
So from a dividend angle, MAC pays around $0.75/ quarter pre-covid, and has cut it down to $0.15/quarter last year, as rent collections were uncertain, but turns out they were able to collect  80% of rents since Q3 and that number is improving.   Let’s say they can resume only 50% of their 2019 dividend, that’s $1.5/shr / annum, and on a 6% dividend yield assumption ( which looks very juicy in a very low interest rate environment) , this thing can go to $25/share. Seems there are articles out there on seeking alpha suggesting an even higher number. 


Short squeeze angle?

 Everyone is talking about short squeezes lately, let’s look at MAC’s short interest, 58% of freefloat shorted, and borrow costs have gone up massively lately, looks ripe for a health squeeze. Volumes picked up in the last few trading sessions, but looks like this is just the beginning.

personalfinance,"Food Budgeting - HCOL, Healthy food","Hi all, typical long time lurker first time posting. I guess I'm looking for a little bit of niche advice. My wife and I (both 26) live in a HCOL area (think major market but not LA/NYC) and are both healthy, active people. We have a kid on the way but for now just the two of us. My wife is a Registered Dietitian and along with that we have some things we care about when it comes to our food. 

I'd like to ask for opinions/advice on what you all think is a fair monthly budget when it comes to food. We both LOVE our food and it is one of the things that we want to spend our money on - we don't do a lot for entertainment as we both enjoy things that are pretty much free by nature. 

When it comes to our food we eat all grass-fed/pasture raised meats. My wife, being an RD, knows a little behind the scenes about the myth that is organic food, so we're not picky about the organic label. Rather, we try to support local efforts for various reasons and try to just eat cleanly - a lot of produce and seasonal eating. We're both gluten free (me because of celiac and her by choice, mostly for me). Naturally, these guidelines mean our food is typically more expensive than some other family's food. 

When it comes to eating out, pre-COVID we absolutely loved eating out - it was one of our favorite things to do together. Now we occasionally get delivery but we mostly cook at home. Once COVID is resolved we plan to return to eating out at good restaurants roughly once a week and takeout once a week in addition.

Now, my question. I'm having a hard time determining what is a good monthly allotment for food given some of our dietary restrictions, eating habits, and desired food quality. Any advice from you all or opinions you'd like to share would be welcomed. Thanks everyone!",finance

Bitcoin,Bitcoin offers slight chance to become an oligarch,"Imagine this scenario: the dollar collapses. Your employer asks you ""how do you want to be paid?"" Some people may respond with food, oil, coal, or materials. These are reasonable choices. The dollar is worthless, and people want to ensure they have the necessities for daily life. '

Some might fall back on gold. Gold has productive use like other commodities. For instance, we can melt it and make coins. You can make coins with copper and other metals, but those materials are way too abundant. They make sense for small value amounts, like the former Canadian copper penny. But it is prone to fraud by your average Joe. Everyone would be ""printing money"" if doing so was effortless. What makes gold unique is that it is rare enough to not be able to duplicate so easily, but not so rare as to prevent circulation. A record of its supply can be trusted as accurate and genuine  much more so than other metals.

So what do you choose as the form of your pay? Barrels of oil? Galleons of milk? With a gold coin, you can be confident that the risk of being cheated out of the value of your labour is much lower than with non-precious metals. The latter is a more stable and efficient way to record the value of your work. It's efficient because you do not need to hold barrels of oil to be able to drive a car. You can just hold a record (the gold coin) of the value of your work. It's reliable because you are always on the same level as someone holding the same number and weight of gold coins. Replicating the gold coin with  will require the same weight in gold. Anything less requires the introduction of impurities, which can be identified by the trained eye and thus reported as fraudulent. 

But what if there was an even more reliable way to record the value of your labor and use it to transact, or *store* the value of your labor from extraneous market conditions? Well, this is where bitcoin comes in. Bitcoin's main advantage over gold is that it is even harder to print that Bitcoin. The corollary to that is Bitcoin is more flexible than gold in that we could, in theory, create more Bitcoin through a vote that includes all holders with proportionate voting powers. There's nothing stopping this from happening. We just don't have the incentive to do so at this time. With gold however, we can only mine so much. We can never print more even if we desperately need to do so to avoid collapse.

The disadvantage with Bitcoin is that it is not a commodity. It cannot be used for anything else other than to record the value of your work without cheating you. Thus, it is valueless so long as we still have faith in the dollar.

In 2020, we experienced some eroded faith in the dollar as the Feds kept printing money. This caused Bitcoin's price to go up. Bitcoin also went up because of greater adoption, at least as perceived by the investment community. Should the unforeseen event occur, Bitcoin may have already gained enough confidence to fall back on as a reserve currency.

Bitcoin is redundant in a world that relies on the dollar (and a reserve dollar at that). It would take a truly exceptional situation with no government intervention for Bitcoin to ever be what its truly designed to be: a reserve currency.

I see Bitcoin's value tied to the level of societal fear towards a collapsing dollar. Can it happen? Sure. And you'd be filthy rich while 99% of people are broke with a worthless savings. You will be an oligarch, no doubt. But the odds of such a situation happening are incredibly low. The foundation for society to fall back on Bitcoin is certainly being paved. But for Bitcoin to turn you into an oligarch, there needs to be 1) collapse of the domestic dollar; 2) collapse of the current reserve currency; 3) no government intervention; and 4) no better alternative (ie technological replacement). Oh, and this must occur in your lifetime in order to enjoy the fruits of your investment.",cryptocurrency

But I realize no one wants to hear it. No matter how you slice it, buying a car is nearly always a net-negative transaction.

solar,Which of these three would you choose?,"I have gotten quotes from two installers. Both are well respected in my area and provide a lifetime warranty of the installation. I am located in Central California (Fresno) and have a south facing roof that can accommodate all of the panels and there is no tree cover.

**Installer 1**

**6.48kW 18 SunPower X22 360 Panels** \- $26,156 (10 year loan at 0.99%)

Small add ons are a $750 credit and 3 cleanings the first year. Also tout their production guarantee.

**Installer 2**

Small add ons are $1240 cash back and once per year they will clean and visually inspect for up to 25 years.

From my research, it seems SunPower is probably the best deal here because of their warranty and performance. With the low interest rate and 10 year loan, they end up being the cheapest as well.",energy

I’ve talked to my company’s payroll dept and they’ve assured me that their system is  working fine, and that they cannot give any tax advice. I get that they can’t, too much liability. They sent me a link to the IRS tax withholding estimator tool, which says that my federal withholding should be $232 per paycheck, and also that my spouse’s withholding should be increased by $89 per paycheck. This is in order to have a $0 refund next April. Before I updated my W4, about $115 was being deducted per paycheck, however, my spouse and I have both received raises since then, so idk. Any advice?

personalfinance,Should I intentionally tank my credit?,"34yo forever poor American (howdy) here with $46k credit card debt and a low 600 score.  I'm finally making the most money I've ever made ($34k non-exempt woooo) but I'm still having trouble keeping up with all of my bills.

Most of my credit cards I have been able to close and place on reasonable payment programs to slowly chip away at them (without all my monthly payments being negated by exorbitant interest rates), but I have a couple I have left open due to their age or low interest rate.  One card in particular is still open and is just burning through my paychecks every month; it's maxed out, and the minimum payments on it just keep getting worse (currently sitting just under $300/mo) to the point where I can't really afford to pay the minimum (but still do), and then the interest fees each month knock me so far back it seems like I'll never even get it down to below the credit limit, short of a miracle windfall.  I have tried contacting the company to close it and get on a payment program, but I am ineligible because I have not missed a payment in almost 10 years.

I am to the point where if I pay the minimum on this card in February, I will not have enough to cover the other bills due around the same time, and I know I'll just get charged most of what I threw at it in interest the next month.  At this point, I'm seriously considering tanking my credit and not paying it until they force-close the account and try to settle the debt.  I likely won't need to apply for a new lease for a year and a half, I do not want to open anymore credit cards, and if/when my car dies, I have no intention of trying to get a new one.

investing,Interest rates at zero means that it's highly likely that the economy's prospect of growth is zero or less than zero,"If interest rates have to be set at zero to stimulate growth, that means that investors aren't willing to pay a single dollar in interest for their investments. Short term, this means what everyone thinks, that money is free and investments will shoot up.

Longer term, it's a sign of zero growth and when the market reaches it's true value with such low interest rates - the forward growth will be zero or negative. Really what these interst rates mean is that we cant even get an investor to pay a 2 % per year to invest in the future of several countries.

Think about it. Isn't that pretty messed up? People here will now say that with zero interest rates, the roof for markets is infinite - that is correct. But if interest rates go up to even 0,1 % with an infinite valuation - even that tiny raise could lead to a huge crash.

So the question is. Why are so few willing to pay to borrow money to invest in Americas (and several other countries) future? Because the future outlook is awful, just awful. Sooner or later this realization will hit people and the markets will react.

It also means that inflation isn't coming. More likely if my assumptions are correct, fall of asset prices is the first step, then delation of money and then we hit inflation. Why? Because if the prospects for growth is zero and stocks go up. As soon as the interest rate rises, stocks go down. People sell stocks, stocks go down even more. People won't spend money, leads to deflation. Then people realize that commodities and other things are getting more and more expensive and harder to come by, that leads to inflation. Problem here is that there is no guarantee that stocks will go with that inflation, rather we could have a terrible situation with inflation of money, lower stock prices and higher prices of living.

personalfinance,We're not getting a tax refund anymore.,"We were looking forward to filing our taxes in expectation of a decent refund. Instead, we owe net $200 ($950 to state with $750 refund from fed). We thought we were doing well, but this came as a disappointment. We could use guidance on what to do next.

Our situation in brief:     
- Married filing jointly with one child.     
- Making combined $105k per annum gross.     
- Our tax withholdings as given to our employers specify zero exceptions. We thought this meant we would have the maximum income tax withholding on our paychecks; this was apparently incorrect.
- We rent, have no stocks or property, and don't likely spend enough on anything to justify itemizing deductions.

I know our situation is not nearly as bad as it could be; we have been fortunate to make it through 2020 without loss of income. If this is as simple as asking our employers to withhold more, so be it.

Alternately, we could see this as an ideal situation, since we technically got close to the maximum per-paycheck we could have. But right now, I feel as if we are being penalized for not owning a business or a house.

I hope this doesn't turn into an AmIA. Thanks in advance for any guidance you can offer.

personalfinance,Federal Student Loan Refund,"Hi everyone,

My sister currently owes around $1000 in student loans after graduating in May 2020. She has paid off around $5000 since graduation in anticipation of the forebearance ending. She was about to pay it all off but then found out the new Biden forebearance until September 30th.

I know she can get a refund but would that cause any issues later on with additional interest? No matter what, she wont be paying interest because she will be paying it off before September 30th but it would be nice to have that money now (and potentially put into some safe investments, ie. CD, HYSA, to get a return off of for around 8 months)

And by a long shot, if Biden passes his $10,000 forgiveness, maybe it will be forgiven before September 30th! Not counting on that as a definite, just a bonus possibility. Am I looking at this wrong?

vet,Cat possibly stressed? Vet visits aren't providing many answers.,"**Age:** about 8

**Breed:** unknown, but something black and green-eyed and fancy. Maybe a bit of tabby judging by the ringed tail.

**Gender:** female

**Weight:** 4.9ish kg, was 200g more in December but the vet says she's still at a healthy weight.

**Symtoms:** excessive sneezing, drooling, slight weight loss (200g over two months), restlessness, hiding a bit, bilateral serous discharge from eyes, excessive scratching/pawing at right eye (but no blood or swelling)

**Vet visit findings (January 25, 2021):** lungs okay, possible abdominal mass that feels like it could be an organ and slightly larger than a kidney (but the vet wasn't sure if it was an organ or something else), neck mass has grown, otherwise no remarkable findings

**Conditions:** has a large mass about 6-7cm on the right ventral side of throat. First spotted about a year ago, has grown a bit in the last few months and shifted closer to the midline.

My girlfriend is going sick with worry that the cat has something terribly wrong with her. She had a senior blood panel in December that came back normal except for something slightly elevated (but still in the normal range) with her kidneys. I don't know what the elevated thing is, sorry.

The past couple days, the cat has been sneezing and drooling (from the excessive sneezing) about 4-6 times each and a dozen plus times in a day. She's eating, drinking and going to the bathroom normally, but this morning she wasn't finishing her food - I think her nose is stuffed up and she can't smell it as well. She's still eating treats no problem.

The vet last night injected her with Convenia and took a biopsy to send off for cytology testing. We'll get the results back in 2-3 days. The last time she had a biopsy (I think December 2019) it came back negative for lymphoma, and same with her blood panel in December 2020.

We did have a poinsettia that was out of reach, but just in case that was aggravating symptoms, I've thrown it out. I also sprayed a chair with methyl nonyl ketone, but that was at least 6 weeks before she started showing symptoms.

We adopted a dog at the end of July 2020 who has a strong prey drive and has chased after the cat on multiple occasions - we're working on conditioning this out of her. My hunch is the dog is still stressing her out and symptoms are only manifesting themselves now, but my girlfriend thinks the cat's current condition would have presented itself far earlier.

Another possible cause of stress might be that I've been working up to putting a harness on her. I've been working at this for about a week and using plenty of treats and never chasing after her. She seems comfortable enough with my approach, but perhaps it is causing her stress? I work in five-minute segments once a day over the past week, but have since stopped just in case that is the cause of her stress.

I'm hoping someone can help shed light on what's going on with the cat. I think it's just stress and rhinitis but no idea what the mass is, but not too worried because she's still eating and drinking normally. My girlfriend is quite worried, however, and thinks there's something ominous going on that we don't have the answers for.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Seeking advice - Buying a house with large student loans?,"Hello! My fiancée and I are considering buying a house. The mortgage payment would be cheaper/comparable to what we pay in rent and the in-laws are willing to give some financial assistance in the form of covering anything that needs fixing/replacing at move-in and acting as a general safety net.

Here's our current situation:

**Income: $5600** (reduced due to covid. we're expecting $7100+ once one of our job situations returns to normal or change, hopefully February. This is after pre-tax deductions for retirement)

**Debt: $2000** minimum monthly payment (significantly less right now due to COVID). We have $272k student debt. 155k is in a 5.7% government loan that's on a 15 year forgiveness plan with income-based payments. 80k are Sallie Mae loans with ~9% variable interest rates that we're trying to refinance. The remaining 38k are 1.1%(government) or 3.2% (refinanced) fixed APR loans.

**Rent: $1500**

**Utilities (electric, gas, internet): $170**

**Car/Life/Renter Insurances: $90**

**Groceries: $400** My father-in-law graciously pays for all his offspring's dash-pass orders, so this is really just groceries.

**Other (Netflix/etc): $80**

**Unspent: $1400** Usually less due to other costs. We typically save about $1000 a month.

Our front-end DTI is 26%. Our back-end DTI is 61%.

We have about 25k we can put towards a down payment/closing costs without hurting our emergency fund (11k). That would afford us a 240k house in our area, which has some homes we're interested in. The mortgage for that would run ~$1370. We have been pre-approved for that amount.

The in-laws are willing to support us if things pop up, so we have that safety net if things exceed our worst case scenarios. In an *absolute worst case*, we can rent out the home and move in with them. We see a lot of personal/QoL value in buying a home. The main cons are we'd be taking out the mortgage on top of our loans and we'd be spending a bit over half of our (current) income on rent and monthly payments (which we do already).

So my financial questions are...

1. Is this reasonable? Are we being hopeful? Is this affordable given our budgets and costs?

2. Is there a better option that would result in buying a home? 

 1. We're willing to make less-than-ideal (not destructive, but also not min-maxing) financial choices if it means getting into a home sooner than later. We do not want to wait 10-15 years to buy a home.

 2. I would prefer not to move in with my in-laws to save money, but I am considering it.

 3. There's a less clear option of moving into her parent's condo... But they have a tenant there who they can't evict right now due to COVID (the tenant ceased paying rent and is not communicative so they're not too keen on keeping on them) and it's unclear how long that will persist. We don't love the condo or the area, but it would be rent-free which more than makes up for it.

I know those last two options are probably our best choices and we're actively purusing the condo, so I would particularly appreciate advice beyond them. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Need advice choosing a card to consolidate credit card debt.,"Hi everyone. I am currently 25 years old and have racked up about $2000 over the last 5 years in credit card debt. Most of which can be attributed to large purchases during moving that I never caught back up with. The balance was much larger before due to some stupid decisions but I have been working very hard to try to eliminate it altogether. Because of that hard work I just got my score up to 710.

Recently due to Covid I haven't been able to pay down the balance as much, so it has practically plateaued....when I got the card I had a credit score in the 500s and could only be approved for a Capitol One Quicksilver card. It's current interest rate is 22.7% with a limit of $5000. I didn't even know I could refinance or attempt to lower that interest rate until recently. 

I've read about debt consolidation and balance transfers but I don't really know what to trust and what is a trap. I just really want to get that interest rate lower so the payments I make will actually make a dent and Capitol One has basically written off all of my attempts.

stocks,Don't sleep on Lordstown Motors - $RIDE,"Its CEO is Steve Burns, founder of and has a close relationship with fellow American EV company, Workhorse $WKHS. Is an EV company in the United States. Has the ex-director of Tesla. Has the third largest gigafactory in the United States, having taken the reigns of the abandoned Lordstown, Ohio plant GM left to rot just a few years ago. Their main slice of pie is the Lordstown Endurance, an EV pickup truck that already has working prototypes. Press has included having the Endurance parked at the White House and the Endurance being driven by a guy from CNBC. They plan to bring the Endurance to market by end of year/early next year.


The Endurance as of this post has no direct competitor. Its an EV pickup truck marketed to the working class man. Its priced at $52,500 offering 250 mile gas range, tow capability of 6,000lbs. Pre-orders booked at 100,000 as of January 12.

The factory is in full working shape. The company isn't fucking around and fluffing investors. They stated their mission, showed a proof of concept and got to work.

This also brings a story to sell the news on of a destitute American town that GM abandoned and time forgot, being saved by new hard working jobs, crafting top of the line American-made pickup trucks.


This last point gets more bullish with Biden's recent executive order and how much he's proven to be invested in the future of EV. Upon taking a look at the government fleet of vehicles he intends on replacing with EV's, a sizeable portion are pickup trucks. Even disregarding this, the mission is clear to have an EV manufacturer for the USPS. And I'll say this one more time - THERE IS NO DIRECT COMPETITOR TO THE ENDURANCE.

Say what you will about the Cybertruck but its just not a proper candidate for the Endurance's demographic. The Hummer EV is priced at $90k. Ford's at least another year away from the F150 EV.

Federal catalysts for huge growth:

* this USPS contract. If Workhorse gets it that's good for Lordstown Motors as they'll be building a portion of those trucks for them. If Lordstown gets it that's even better

* Lordstown recently asked the Fed for a loan. They won't be the only EV company provided with federal assistance as Tesla was given the same many years ago

* Biden and Buttigieg love EV, want to subsidize and invest in the infrastructure, build a future for American-based EV companies

personalfinance,"Closing on first mortgage, will my credit card balance be an issue?","Greetings! I’m exactly 1 week from the closing date on my first mortgage for a condo unit. As it stands, I’ve been issued a conditional approval from my lender (Navy Federal Credit Union) for an amount of $271,000. 

My anxiety as I move closer to closing is being fueled by reading some of the horror stories of buyers being denied at closing due to lenders discovering new lines of credit, undisclosed debts, losing their job, etc. 

My situation is as follows:

My lender determined my current combined assets at $109,000. Over the last few weeks, I’ve been making purchases for the condo. I have two credit cards: 

1) an Amex gold charge card (does not have a set credit limit)

2) an Amex cash magnet credit card (has a $22,000 limit)

The majority of purchases for the condo I’ve made on my gold card. As it stands this morning, my balance was listed at $1,617. I paid $617 from a savings account and have the balance at an even $1,000. When I get paid this Friday, I’ll pay an additional $566 to this amount and get the balance down to $434. I won’t be charging any more purchases to this card until after the closing. 

My cash magnet card is the card I use for most of my everyday purchases ( I buy everything on my credit cards and pay off my entire balance weekly usually). I made a purchase of furniture from Wayfair on this card this Saturday at a combined amount of $2,390 (I made the purchase on this card due to a referral bonus I had on the card and I would receive a large amount of points.) I made the transaction on Saturday; the next day (Sunday) when the transaction was posted to my account, I paid it off in full (a housewarming gift from my parents haha). As it stands, the only balance I have on this card is $400 of my standard weekly purchases (grocery, food, gas, etc.) which I will pay around 90% off this week as I do weekly. 

As it stands:

- Closing is in 1 week

- On Friday, I will have a balance of $434 on my Amex charge card (which has no limit) and a balance of less than $100 on my Amex credit card (which has a limit of $22,000). 

- I have made large purchases on these cards in the last few weeks, but have paid them almost completely in full. In addition, the charge card does not have a credit utilization factor. 

Besides the concern of the credit cards, I have no additional loans, the property has been appraised as was expected, and my employment is secured. I have also not applied for or opened any new lines of credit or taken out any loans since beginning this home buying process. 

With all of these things considered, do you think my loan is in any danger of being jeopardized? When the lender pulls my credit prior to closing, will they just pull my credit score and report or will they pull up the actual balances on each credit card?

I appreciate any and all feedback, I will add any updates to my scenario to help you if you need them!

Some quick stats:

Current credit score: 787 as of 01/26/2021

Length of credit: 7 1/2 years

Current Lines of credit: 2 credit cards and 1 charge card

No outstanding personal or student loans, medical bills, child support, etc.

I'm currently maxing my Roth IRA and funding an individual account with $300-$500/month or as much as I can swing that month.  My concern is the USD value plummeting with the constant printing of money by the Feds...wasn't it something like $5T last year?

personalfinance,Should I sell investments to pay off credit card debt?,"Hi all, I'm hoping you all can give me some advice on proceeding to pay off credit card debt.  Over the past few years I went from paying off my credit card in full every month to carrying a little debt, to the point where I am now at about $10,000 in the hole.  I pay off the minimum every month, and a bit more, but last year I still payed about $1,500 in fees to the company at a 15.24% interest rate.  

Back when I was on top of things I was regularly investing into a Roth IRA and a Mutual Fund.  I haven't invested into either of those in the past year or two, as I've been trying to focus on paying down the credit card instead.  I've got about $29,000 in the Vanguard Roth IRA, and about $30,000 in the Mutual Fund.  Should I sell off shares from one or the other to pay off the credit card debt in full, or do the taxes on gains make that a bad idea?  

A few other things that may impact on the decision:  My wife and I will be looking to buy a house probably in the coming year, so I do want to improve my credit score as we will be looking to take out a home loan.  Also, my wife does have an inheritance coming of around $70,000 (minus whatever taxes there are) probably sometime in the next few months?  We would use most of that on a down payment on a house, but should we just wait and use that income to pay off this card?

I appreciate any advice anyone has, or any suggestions on what I should maybe be doing instead to get this under control.  Thank you!",finance

investing,ATAC,"Ever heard of ATAC? Probably not. However, I believe this SPAC will prove to be a lucrative investment with limited to no downside. 

After thorough research concerning SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) and the unique merger between Owl Rock Capital Partners and Dyal Capital Partners (a subsidiary of Neuberger Berman), I have concluded that this opportunity classifies as a standard “Dhando investment” (for those of us that know Mohnish Pabrai); the limited downside of Blue Owl Capital (the newly merged company) becoming publicly-traded via ATAC (the SPAC enabling this transaction) is substantially offset by the attractive and likely upside of this investment. Moreover, due to my appealing buy-in price of $10.39, there is limited liability as I will explain later on. 

However, in the case of any purchase, an investor must both assess and limit his/her downside. Through implementing and focusing my decisions on Warren Buffett’s two rules, I have done significant research into SPACs as a whole and their potential downside. Coming to the conclusion that if the deal was to fall through or I deemed the prospects to be unappealing, I am protected through a redeemable purchase price of $10 a share + Interest. Therefore, my investment is limited to around $0.34 per share assuming a conservative $0.05 interest payment. However, I believe that I have done a successful job hedging that loss due to my research.

In regard to a SPAC, one of or if not the most important factor is management. As in any stock, management plays a significant role in the success of a company. However, there is more dependency on management in a SPAC than in any other business due to the Sponsor’s responsibility to (1) acquire a company, and (2) successfully merge. After performing my due diligence I have concluded that Tom Wasserman - with about 30 years of experience in alternative asset management, direct lending, and capital solutions - is extremely qualified to be the Sponsor of such an endeavor. Furthermore, HPS Investment Partners has publicly expressed their support, with over 13 years of experience and $67 billion of AUM. Not only does HPS Investments bring talent/insight to the newly emerged company but they have vouched for ATAC as a viable sponsor for such a merger due to the company’s experience in a similar field. The management of Owl Rock Capital, Dyal Capital, and Neuberger Berman - with principals bringing an average of 18 years of experience - has confirmed that all companies have unanimously agreed to the merger. The likelihood of a successful merger is high and consequently has eliminated the outstanding risk of a SPAC concerning their ability to find a company to bring public. 

As with any investment, investors should take the time to understand the industry in which they are investing in. After a plethora of time, I believe I have a substantial grasp of credit and alternative asset management. With the knowledge I have acquired, the post-merger market cap of about $12.5 billion and 1.25 billion shares issued dictates that there will be an initial per-share price of $10. With that said, after evaluating SPACs as a whole, Owl Rock Capital, Dyal Capital Partners, and ATAC individually, I have come to the conclusion (after reviewing their pro forma financial statements) that Blue Owl will initially earn about $0.25 cents per share with a conservative 18% growth → leading to a conservative price of $12 per share. Blue Owl Capital has reassured my evaluation through various actions that they have taken. For instance, management has issued warrants and founder warrants to the public and Sponsor respectively at a pro forma value of about $14.29, only furthering my belief that the share price will go behind $14.  Further, management has illustrated their internal belief by providing incentives of issuing more equity with a raise in equity price. For example, 100,000,000 shares of Class E common stock will be issued if the stock price was to stay above $15 for a limited period of time. Additionally, Blue Owl Capital has underscored the fact that their P/E ratio will be higher than their industry due to appealing prospects such as immediate growth, doubling AUM, lowering costs, widening profit margins, attaining a larger customer reach, acquiring the backing of various institutional investors, a recovering economy, higher earning power (a business' ability to generate profits over the long haul, assuming all current operational conditions generally remain constant), and an already established monopoly by Owl Rock being the second-largest BDC in the country.

As a futuristic outlook, I believe the rising interest rates on loans through a recovering economy will play in favor of Blue Owl’s direct lending and alternative asset management. Specifically, the leveraged loans towards unfavorable candidates that may struggle to get a loan as the economy recovers and credit begins to tighten. Blue Owl’s potential and likelihood to deem profitable to me has only grown after assessing Owl Rock’s competitors such as Monroe Capital and Stellus Capital Management through a simplistic view. These competitors are priced at about $8.50 per share and $10 per share with $7 billion and $1.6 billion of AUM respectively. Creating market caps of $180 million and $202 million. Without any further research into the outstanding shares and possible dilution associated with these firms, the large values assigned to Blue Owl concerning AUM and Market Cap will likely generate a view of a monopolistic company and further push them towards a larger market share. Ultimately driving the price higher.",finance

personalfinance,Opinion on taking a 401k Loan for Primary Residence,"Hello,

I want to take a loan of around $15K-$20K out of my 401K to help put money down on my first home purchase. Fidelity offers 12-180 month loans for primary residence and I would be paying 4.25% interest back to myself over the loan term.

All my 401K is currently a Roth 401K where I went ahead and paid the taxes on the money upfront. My job matches 50% of every dollar I put into the 401K up to the federal limit. I estimate that over the next 6-7 paychecks I could contribute around $9K-$10K then get an instantly vested match of $4.5K-$5K. 

Would it make sense to make those next 6-7 paycheck contributions pre-tax 401k as opposed to my current roth 401k option? That way I am technically contributing a bit more as the taxes aren't getting taken from it.

personalfinance,Looking for a tax filing recommendation(s),"Every year since I've been married (this will be tax year #13), I've done our taxes using H&amp;R Block's deluxe + state, filing as ""married filing jointly"". For whatever it's worth, we have 2 kids. Either the first or second year we were married (no kids at that point in time), we actually had to pay a couple hundred dollars in federal taxes, before I adjusted the amount taken out of my paycheck (I don't remember how I did this, but someone in HR walked me through it; my spouse and I both have our same respective employers as we did 13 years ago, so we've never really touched any of that stuff). Since that correction, we've gotten pretty decent refunds every year, particularly since kid #2 was born a few years ago.

In my mind the main reason I chose the H&amp;R Block software was because, for the first several years we were married, our itemized deduction would usually exceed the standard deduction, or at least was worth checking. But since the Trump tax cuts bumped the standard deduction pretty significantly, we haven't come close to the standard amount. I've ignored the IRS Free File option because our AGI the past few years exceeds the amount, but it literally just occurred to me that, since both my spouse and I each make less than the current AGI ($72,000, I believe), wouldn't it be in our best interest to go the ""married filing separately"" route and use IRS Free File? Is there any disadvantage to filing separately that is gained by filing jointly?

Additional facts that may impact any recommendations:
- Both have HSAs, plus spouse has Daycare SA
- Both contributing to retirement plans through employer (spouse is a public school teacher, so it's not a regular ol' 401k plan they have)
- Low 5 figures in a joint savings account, but we don't make any massive contributions, so interest earned is relatively minimal (especially with interest rates plummeting as they did most of the past year).
- No other significant investment income.
- Again, we do make charitable contributions, but our itemized deductions almost certainly unlikely to exceed standard amount
- Again, 2 kids, both live at home

To restate my questions:
1) Go with IRS Free File + Married filing separately? Or stick with H&amp;R Block deluxe + state I've been using all these years (that automatically imports a bunch of my info saved from last year) / some other software recommended in the megathread (TaxAct, Tax Slayer &amp; FreeTaxUSA all seem like attractive alternatives to the TurboTax/HRB racket)?
2) Obviously I can look into changing my withholding amount if I'd like to increase my take-home pay and decrease our refund. Any other simple tricks I'm missing?

The only homes I like on the market are around $875,000. It's a popular city with many big companies. My idea is to buy a home with 3 bedrooms and rent out two of them for about $1k each while I live in the last bedroom.

* 1% @ 52 (earliest age)
* 2% @ 62
* 2.5% (max) @ 67

If I stay with the state:

* At age 52, I'd have 22 years of service (so I'd get 22% of my high 3 salary)
* At age 62, I'd have 32 years of service, so I'd get 64% of my high 3
* At age 67, I'd have 37 years of service, so I'd get 93% of my high 3

If I retire from the state at 52:

* I am free to go work in another retirement system with no penalty.  
* For example, I could go take a federal job from age 52-67 and double dip all those years (full time federal salary plus state pension) while earning a 1% federal pension multiplier for federal years of service.

Then if I retire from the federal job at 67:

* I'd still be getting the 22% of my state high 3 but I'd also be getting 15% of my federal high 3.  I think I just answered my own question lol.  Probably not worth it.

*However*, the federal TSP is significantly better than my state 457 (TSP offers matching contributions whereas my state does not match my 457 contributions).

stocks,Why UNFI is worth $231 per share and is a 10 bagger,"In 2015 UNFI traded as high as $80 per share back when their revenue was 8B. Back then they had 50,100,946 shares which made their market cap 4B or 50% of revenue.

In 2018 something strange happened - David absorbed Goliath. UNFI paid 3B for SuperValu (wholesaler and retailer of grocery products) to more than double their revenue from 10B to 21B becoming the largest grocery wholesaler in North America. This acquisition was completely financed by debt so their outstanding number of shares remained relatively low.

Then in 2020 the mother of all tailwinds hit - COVID. Imagine when the only food you're allowed to go out for is from a grocery store? Restaurant sales plummeted, but grocery sales went up. In addition interest rates went down (remember that SuperValue was purchased completely with debt). So interest costs for UNFI have come down.

Today UNFIs market cap is only 1.755B (7% of sales) and less than half of what it used to be when revenues were only 8B. If UNFI returned to its old valuation 50% of its current sales (26B) that would mean a market cap of 13B.

personalfinance,I am 27 and just started my first 'real job.' I have access to exclusive investment research and a 401k. How do I maximize my financial success with literally no prior financial wisdom?,"**INFO:** 

  
\- New job's starting salary: $75k (More like $52k after taxes), annual bonus &amp; potential for increase

\- Additional Income: \~$5,000 / year

\- Location: Maryland, USA

\- Current monthly rent: $550/month

\- Utilities: \~$130/month

\- Food/Dining: \~$250/month

\- Insurances: $190/month

\- Debt: $35,000 student loans, 6k other debt

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little late to the game as far as getting a hang of finances. Up until now, I've lived off of waitressing tips and video gigs. It worked but it was basically treading water while larger debts grew under the surface. I deduct part of my rent for my home office and all business expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

**GOALS:**

\- Invest as much as I can to earn passive income

\- Pay off immediate debt

\- Begin saving/earning for retirement/house/etc

\- Afford a bigger place

\- Network with the many successful people this job puts me in contact with

\- Grow my wealth

\- Retire at reasonable (if not early) age and focus on my personal passions/business ventures

\- 10-15 years down the line: no more college debt? (Not my top priority)

\- 20 years: help my parents out

&amp;#x200B;

**QUESTIONS** (Explain like I'm 5, my brain has a hard time absorbing this kind of information which is why I'm here after many a googling):

\- How realistic are my goals?

\- What should I be working towards (career-wise, budgeting-wise) to achieve my goals?

\- Even though I work for an investment research company, I really don't know much about investing (I do media content). Should I bother with ETF's because they're hands-off? Or skip this step because of my access to awesome research and invest in individual stocks? Or are ETF's still the more safe, cost effective way to move forward?

\- On what platform should I be investing? I have a Robinhood account, but the interest rate is low. What earns the highest annual interest? What's the difference between a high interest rate or an account that pays dividends and is one better?

\- What percent of my income should I pay into my 401k and should I bother with a Roth IRA if I already have a 401k?

I don't want to squander this opportunity to struggle less than I was before. In fact, I'd love to get comfortable or even wealthy if I can. I know this job could be a long term thing but life is always uncertain. I know I'm a bit naive about this whole process, and learning about it makes my brain melt, but I really want to try and get smart with my money. 

Thanks in advance!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Theories: How will Reddit inc. deal with YKC regulations when handing out future tokens like Moons?,"So we all know Reddit Inc. plans on rolling out moon like tokens to the whole platform. What I am thinking about is how they plan on adhering to KYC regulations and or regulations that require in the US 1099-misc to be filed (any amount over 500$)

So I am thinking either Reddit inc. maintains that the tokens have no real set value only intrinsic value like trading cards, or antiques which is market determined or they would have to collect that information. 

This is a grand experiment but would rather for privacy sake not hand over my personal information to Reddit inc, so they can issue me a 1099 or report my moon income to the fed.

I also think that because Reddit for so long has been about user privacy, they have developed a crowd which will regularly reject the idea of handing over there information.

personalfinance,Why do I owe so much in federal taxes when I'm claiming single 0?,"I've been doing taxes for quite a few years now and I always jump to file through TurboTax as soon as I have my W2(s). Most years I've had two W2s (I was a student worker for 6 years and had a second job for 4), and I've never had to pay federal taxes, and I always pay a small amount to the state (I live in California, figures).

But, for my 2020 taxes, I have three W2s -- the last semester of my university job, a temp agency, and a company I now work full time for. I've always filed single 0 on my W4s to get the most back from my taxes, and it's never been an issue until this year.

I entered my university and full time job W2s first, and I was set to receive $500+ from federal, which was looking great. Then, I entered my temp agency W2, and suddenly I OWED federal $192, which blew my mind. I made the most money at the temp agency in 2020, but only a few thousand more than at my now-full time job. I double checked the temp W2 and I definitely paid plenty of taxes to state and federal for that job, so I'm not sure why I essentially ""owe"" $700+ to the federal government.

I read somewhere that filing with multiple W2s can cause you to owe federal taxes, but again I've almost always filed with 2 every fiscal year so this doesn't make sense even now that I have 3 and filed single 0 for all of them. Is this just how it is? Did I do something wrong, or is there anything I can do to double check this and not owe any federal taxes? Any help or insight is greatly appreciated!",finance

Rent: 600 Monthly \*Temporary housing\* (will be moving in a month and will pay 1000 for a new apt)

Car loan: 10.5k ( 3.25% apr for used car); monthly payment 450ish for a 24 month period. 

Federal Student loan: 23.5k (initially) but now it’s 18k (sigh student loans suck; BUT forbearance so 0% interest wohoo)

Credit card debt: 2.2k (distributed across 4 credit cards)

I have a 401k (10% match from employer, I contribute 10% of my salary) and an HSA which I contribute since I started my job 5 months ago. 

For context: I have not had financial backing from parents since I left for college (except for when I graduated from my master's to look for a job - I lived in their place for a few months) and so when I relocated for my new job I had to pay for new furniture, travel and initial costs and other logistical costs.

personalfinance,"Wife and I made some mistakes last year and ended up owing just shy of $5000 in taxes for 2020, did we cover our bases for next year?","Hi personalfinance, I'm a long-time follower of the subreddit and tonight I've found myself in a spot to finally ask for some advice. I apologize for the length of this post in advance, but if you manage to bear with me and have any advice or commentary, I am very thankful.

My spouse and I filed our taxes tonight and discovered that we owed a lot more than we expected, about $5000. Yes, we filed very early, but we have all of our documents and do not have a complicated tax situation so we just got it done.

* We live in California
* We do not have kids
* We do not own a home
* We do not have any investments beyond each employer-provided 401k and a Roth IRA that we did not contribute to last year
* We have a higher-yield savings account that generated about $300 in interest
* We paid a few hundred dollars of interest in student loans due to the COVID-19 deferment
* We are shooting for $0 owed and a $0 return

The reason I say ""expected"" is because we did discover that we were in a pickle a bit past halfway through 2020.

## Federal Taxes

For most of last year I was making about $75k as an hourly employee working 4 days a week at 10 hours per day. I started working in that role in November 2019. Not long after starting I noticed that I was receiving 8 hours of regular pay and 2 hours of overtime (1.5x) each day, in addition to full days of holiday pay that fell on days I was not scheduled to work otherwise. Instead of thinking harder about this, I thought that was cool and enjoyed it; my spouse expressed that they didn't think that was normal but took my word for it to not worry (I know). Later on in the year I was called into a meeting with about 4 other coworkers in the same situation and my manager told us that this was not intended, but the company would not be asking for any repayment and that we should expect future paychecks to be decreased to their intended amounts. I was grateful that they didn't ask me to write them a check but naturally was concerned about my tax situation; I used the IRS withholding calculator for 2020 and it determined that to shoot for $0 owed, I should withhold an additional ~$230 per paycheck and my spouse should withhold an additional ~$100 per paycheck in federal taxes (amounts estimated based on my memory). Great, I modified our W4s and added that in. I do not recall what we were additionally withholding prior to this correction but I do know that we were shooting for $0 owed/returned. (EDIT: I'm realizing that we probably were not withholding anything additional prior to this, because I wouldn't have the same question that I detailed at the end of the post. We were probably just withholding whatever is automatically withheld by our employers.)

Then, in December 2020, I started a new job making $110k, plus a yearly 10% bonus, with a $10k signing bonus that was supposed to be paid out 90 days after starting. I figured that since I started in December and would receive 1.5 paychecks before the end of the year, I wouldn't bother using the calculator to create an accurate W4 and just submitted an unchanged W4 with no additional withholding. In my mind, whatever I owed would be minor given that I *should* have fixed most of my unpaid tax burden by increasing withholding at my former employer. My spouse did not change their withholding and continued to withhold ~$100 for the last month of 2020.

My signing bonus was unexpectedly paid out a few weeks into the new job and naturally fell into my 2020 income. Taxes were withheld from this (22% for federal, which agrees with what I read elsewhere online about how much bonuses are taxed, as well as other applicable taxes). I am unsure if this had an effect on how much we ended up owing in federal taxes, but my hunch is that it did.

Our federal taxes owed has come out to **$2235**, much higher than I expected given the adjustments that we made to our W4s to compensate for my stupidity.

## State Taxes

After the shock that we were in because of our federal tax situation, we were dismayed to discover that we owe **$2628** to the state of California in unpaid taxes. I had no idea where this came from as we followed California's DE-4 instructions very closely:

* I took 2 standard allowances for the both of us with no additional withholding
* My spouse took 0 allowances with no additional withholding

We discovered that my spouse paid $5 in California income tax for the entirety of 2020. Unbeknownst to both of us, the checkbox on their DE-4 stating that they are exempt from state income tax was checked since January of 2020. We can only conclude that while we were filling out the W4 when their company switched payroll systems that month, we weren't paying attention and checked that box. My spouse made $26.55 hourly for most of 2020 and then began making $65k salary in October 2020. No federal or state withholding adjustments were made with the new pay rate so they were still withholding the additional ~$100 federal per paycheck that was calculated to fix my own mistake described previously.

This was a mistake on both of our parts, a big one at that. We should have noticed this much sooner. We have corrected the problem now and they have only received 2 paychecks this month that have no state income tax withheld.

## Where We Are Now

* We filed our taxes and are set to pay back what we owe. Based on the issues mentioned above, I have no reason to believe that the numbers are incorrect. We have a substantial emergency fund and will be fine shouldering this burden, though it may take a bit for the embarrassment to wear off. Payments have been scheduled for the new tax season start date of February 12 2021.
* We fixed the California DE-4 exemption checkbox, as mentioned.

Earlier this month I used the IRS withholding calculator with the first paycheck that we each received for 2021 to determine what our federal withholding should be to achieve $0 owed/returned. It determined that I should be withholding $208 additional per paycheck (up from the $0 that I withheld after transitioning to my new job but down from the ~$230 I was withholding at my old job), and that my spouse should withhold $73 additional per paycheck (down from the ~$100 that they were withholding). We both adjusted our W4s as such.

Tonight, after panicking at the unexpected owed taxes, I decided to go through the IRS withholding calculator again. Despite our increased withholding that we set based on the calculation from earlier this month, it estimates that we will **owe $2040** in federal taxes at the end of the year. To owe $0, it says to:

1. Set my additional withholding to $210
2. Set my spouse' additional withholding to $74

Next to both of these numbers, it says ""this is an amount of withholding over and above the standard withholding from each paycheck for this job if lines 3 through 4(c) of the Form W-4 were blank or zero."" At the moment, line 4(c) is not blank or zero since we are withholding the additional $208 and $73 respectively. Those numbers are suspiciously close to the earlier numbers that were returned.

So my questions are:

1. How much did the early bonus affect our tax burden?
2. When considering my expected yearly 10% bonus, on the IRS withholding calculator, am I correct to check the box that says ""My employer will withhold the appropriate taxes from this future bonus"" since I do see that taxes are being withheld from my bonuses?
3. Do we add the $210 and $74 returned by the calculator onto the additional withholding that we are already doing since the beginning of the month, effectively doubling our additional withholding? Am I interpreting and using this calculator correctly?
4. How do we correct our state withholding for the two paychecks that my spouse has received this year with $0 state income tax withheld? Just take a guess at an additional amount of state withholding on a new DE-4?",finance

personalfinance,15.49% Car Loan Interest Rate!? SOS,"I need some advance on how to proceed with a high-interest car loan. Five days ago, I went to a Toyota dealership to check out a used car that caught my attention online. The car’s price was listed at $16,750, and according to Kelly Blue Book, it was a good deal. However, considering that I am a 19-year-old student, the salesman really took advantage of my lack of knowledge and a dire need for a car. First, he sat me down and told me he was going to crunch the numbers and file the paperwork, so I gave him my basic information (e.g., SSN, address, etc.). After a while, he came back with an estimated total and the interest rate was set at 19% for a 71-month loan. Additionally, there was a $2,200 “warranty” included on the statement, and I was shocked. I looked at the paper in shock because I didn’t realize my credit score (680) would give me such an awful deal. I asked the salesman why there was a $2.2k warranty included in the estimated statement and he said, “the bank won’t loan you the money if you don’t take it,” and I realized that was BS. After that, I asked him to give me a minute to think about it, and he said “I’ll send the finance rep over to get you started,” so after waiting 45 mins, the finance rep finally comes and shows me the same estimate paper. I told him: “this $2,200 warranty isn’t sitting right with me. I don’t want it, and I’ve never heard of someone having to take a warranty to get a loan. Please show me where the lender stated that I need it, or sign a paper stating that I need it to get a loan!” After that, he got nervous and said “I’ll go talk to my manager to see what I can do.” 1 hour and 35 mins later, he comes back and says, “let's go to my office and get this done.” And I told him, “If the warranty is still there, I will not buy the car” and he replied, “let me show you what I did.” 

Me thinking he got rid of the warranty because I made it clear that I did not want it, I proceeded to sit in his office. After that, he typed some things up on his computer and showed me that he had “adjusted” my loan. On the screen, he brought my interest rate down from %19 to %15.49 and decreased the warranty from $2,200 to $1,600. ON TOP OF THAT, he added GAP insurance that was $1,150. He went on a huge rant about doing his best to help me, and how that was the best he could offer. So, I said “okay, could you write on a paper that I’m required to accept the warranty and sign it” and he got so defensive and said “NO! It’s because we lose money when we sell you a car and this makes up for it.” At that point, I was exhausted from being at the dealer for 5+ hours and staying after closing time, so I was convinced that maybe he was being honest because at the end of the day he wants to go home too. 

Finally, I accepted, signed all the documents, and took the car home that same night. I ended with a %15.49 interest rate on a loan of $19,200 something, $1,150 GAP insurance, and a $1,600 drive train warranty. Keep in mind, I gave a $2,250 down payment, so all in all, I paid $21,000 something for the car that was supposed to be $16,200 (+tax). After financing, I’m going to end up paying $31,000 ($10k financing) over the next 71 months. Meaning my monthly payment is going to be $412 JUST FOR THE CAR. 

I know I should have rejected this from the start, but it was my first time going to a dealer and I did it all alone. I had no one to co-sign because my parents have bad credit. They did offer to help me pay for the car and back me up when I don’t have the money, but I feel played. $31,000 for a car that’s worth half that price??? Don’t get me wrong, I liked the car, and it only had 70k miles, but WTF. I feel like I set myself up for financial ruin... any advice on how to proceed with my purchase? Or any advice on refinancing? If you’re planning to comment about how stupid I am, save it. That’s the last thing I need right now. 

P.S. It’s been five days, so I can’t return it for a money-back guarantee...",finance

The short squeeze continues to crush short sellers while EVs &amp; Hydrogen are on the move. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 major indexes finish the day down, with both the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PspccJG) and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/rwB8b2z) losing .07% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/qg7hSBb) dropped by .15% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/NYVtHtF) remained pretty flat in a build-up day for today as the stock market is going to be hit with numerous economic data and big earnings reports from [Apple](https://ibb.co/kqJ38mj) which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Boeing, Facebook, Tesla &amp; many others.

We saw almost 60% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/7kH7Zjv) advancing with some companies dropping below the 50-day moving average as only 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/x6pRR2P) finished in the green, with Communications &amp; Real Estate gaining more than 1% while Energy was the biggest laggard dropping more than 2% despite being the leader of the bunch in the early morning.

We also saw large-cap growth [companies](https://ibb.co/3svx5md) leading the way while the rest of the groups were lagging behind as you can also see in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/S3ChnhR) from yesterday, with most of the small &amp; mid-caps losing ground while the FAANG, Tesla, Microsoft and some other big companies were keeping the markets steady.

In terms of economic data, we saw the November housing price [index](https://ibb.co/dG3FNCJ) coming in as expected with a 11% increase y/y, which was also supported by the Shiller [Index](https://ibb.co/5ndWrBz) which indicated a 9.5% increase over last year, the biggest increase we have seen in this economic data in more than 6 years.

We also saw the January [consumer](https://ibb.co/vxdYwYy) confidence coming in better than expected at 89.3 with most of the increase coming from the expectations that consumers have of things getting better in the near future as the re-opening goes along.

Meanwhile the Richmond FED manufacturing [survey](https://ibb.co/F6PzgFL) came in at 14, lower than the 19 we saw last month as we saw a decrease in shipments, capacity utilization &amp; volume of new orders.

In some other stock market news, we saw a lot of highly shorted stocks rise yet again, with the forbidden one rose by more than 90% for the day and continuing with an additional 120% in after hours, while [Beyond Meat](https://ibb.co/rtQccJB) rose by 33% in early morning after announcing a partnership with [PepsiCo](https://ibb.co/wRL5s66) which is one of the biggest food companies in the world, as they will develop snack &amp; beverage products that are plant-based.

We also saw the pot stocks rise again, with [Tilray](https://ibb.co/wpZGYPD) leading the way after some national agencies from France tagged them to supply products for experiments in France. Tilray has been on a huge run since the Aphria merger news, and the company still has a lot of upside potential left especially if the Biden administration manages to push some sort of legislation, even if it isn’t a full-legalization in the US.

The same hopes of future help from the current administration were also seen in the EV &amp; Hydrogen [sectors](https://ibb.co/3TwmFNC), with a lot of names like WorkHorse, Lordstown, Nikola &amp; many others rising significantly yesterday

Some big companies also reported yesterday, as we saw General Electric [beating](https://ibb.co/0jpB660) most of the estimates in early morning and giving better than expected guidance on future free cash flow, which is a very big thing for a dividend paying company which has been struggling in the past years, while [JNJ](https://ibb.co/vQwJh52) also beat expectations and guided for even better revenues and earnings for next year as they are expecting vaccine results by next week, which could be huge for the hole stock market.

We also received a couple of big earnings reports in after hours, with [Starbucks](https://ibb.co/x3jzxHb) reporting pretty much as expected, but this high valuations for the stocks don’t really allow for OK quarters, everything needs to be exceptional for the most of the stocks to grow into these big valuations.

On the other hand, we saw [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/z8htnJC) crushing expectations, beating by almost $0.40 and a beat of more than $2.5B on revenues hitting over $40B in revenues for the first time due to the big demand in cloud revenues with Azure growing revenues by 50%, even better than the 48% in the last quarter. Microsoft also [guided](https://ibb.co/FYkGRSw) for upside in the next quarter, as this was a sleeping giant just like most of the big FAANG names which were underperformers for the better part of the end of 2020.

Meanwhile the other big tech name that reported was [AMD](https://ibb.co/fnB4Zvw), which also beat expectations due to big growth in all-areas of their business. I’ll be making a Due Diligence in AMD probably later today as I really want to see what growth they have ahead as they continue to battle with Intel

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/ZhwtrgB) are mixed, with the Nasdaq leading the way as we also await MBA mortgage applications in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/3yGpYRj), but mostly expect to see what the FED announces later in the day, as they end the two-day meeting and it is very likely Powell &amp; The FED will keep the interest rates close to 0% and remain very dovish, probably continuing the monthly $120B assets purchase program for the foreseeable future.

personalfinance,Higher mortgage rate to have closing covered?,"Hey PF. If anyone has any experience with this, I’d greatly appreciate your input. My wife and I had our offer accepted on a home. We’re working with a mortgage broker to get financing squared away, and he’s provided us with some options. I didn’t anticipate there being options, I just thought you looked for and accepted the lowest rate you could find. This would be for a conventional, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. 

Here’s are the specifics:

Our offer was accepted at $562,000. We have, right now, $75,000 earmarked for down payment and everything else due at closing. I can potentially pull the estimated raw closing costs ($5,800), year of homeowners insurance premiums ($1,400ish) and property tax escrow ($3,000ish) from a taxable brokerage account, but I’d rather not. 

The options are (1) pay $350 to get a loan at 2.5% and pay all closing costs ourselves, (2) accept a 2.625% loan and have $2900 in closing costs covered, or (3) accept a 2.75% loan and have all closing costs ($5800) covered. In all options we would obviously still be responsible for insurance and tax escrow. 

I’ve been racking my brain trying to figure out which is mathematically better. Option 1 saves us $66 per month or $23,760 over the course of the loan. But that savings is reduced with extra payments, becomes less valuable with inflation, and goes away if we sell. I’m assuming interest rates won’t be this low again, so ever refinancing is likely out, and if we move any new mortgage will likely have a higher interest rate. Option 3 costs us $23,760 more over the life of the loan, but that is also reduced with extra payments. The $5800 that we’d save in closing costs could be additional down payment (still not enough to get us over 20%), or I could toss it into Vanguard and let it grow—presumably at a rate that would make it worth far more than $23,760 over 30 years. Then again, that pool of money won’t be worth as much as it seems due to inflation, and any earning will be taxed. 

At this point, I’m leaning toward option 2 simply because it splits the difference. I’d obviously rather choose the best option, but I’d rather be half wrong than fully wrong. 

Am I missing anything? Does choosing properly require knowing unknowable things (e.g., how long we’d be in the home, what future interest rates, inflation, and investment gains would be). 

Again, any input would be immensely appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"My senior parents (Ontario, Canada) say they'll be homeless in 2 months, but I can't imagine they've done all they can for their situation.","I'll be honest, I'm a 23 year old who knows nothing about money besides to save it, hence why I'm here.

My parents are seniors (68f, 70m). My dad has worked his whole life as a self contractor doing carpentry. He was working up until September where he got chest pains, went to the ER and found out he immediately needed a triple bypass heart surgery. He was in the hospital for two weeks for prep and tests, and then another two weeks or so for recovery. They've told him that he cannot go back to work anymore - especially something so labour intensive. It took him over a month to be able to walk for more than a few seconds and he still struggles with breathing, plus he constantly needs to take a ton of heart medication now (for the rest of his life). Plus now he's at high risk due to covid. My mom has small scale babysitting (under five kids) but that came to an end when covid started.

My dad is in a lot of debt. I don't know the exact number but I'm guessing close to 100k between all his credit cards. My dad has a lot of credit cards with interest rates as high as 20%, and he's too stubborn to find a better option because he refuses to admit he's made bad financial decision.

I believe my dad got his pension sorted out and gets $700 a month. My mom hasn't applied for hers because she said she'll get $400 at most so it's not worth the effort ($400 is better than $0 Imo). They don't get any other government support in Canada. They're also Polish citizens. I don't know the exact details but my mom is getting some retirement money in Poland but she can only get it when someone visits Poland and brings it back for her - which I'm not sure why. I don't believe my dad is getting anything in Poland.

My sister has been pushing for my dad to file for bankruptcy to help with the debts, which he seems to be in the process of pursuing. They don't own anything. They rent an apartment and borrow my brothers car when they need it. I paid for uni out of my pocket so they weren't affected by that either. Their rent is ~$1400, which is really cheap for our area. My dad made about 35k a year before. 

Is there any other financial assistance they can get? I just can't understand how two seniors can only be getting $1100 in support when the average rent in my city is $2100 and so many others seem to have found at least some top up through covid relief (especially since my dad can't work anymore and my mom is his caretaker) or elsewhere.

I hope I included all the important info. Please ask if there's anything I missed.

Edit: I just want to thank everyone so so much for their input. I never expected so many of you would take the time to help me our and offer advice to guide me and my parents through tough times. I wrote this up before work on a whim thinking I'd get a few responses if any. I wish I could reply to everyone individually. If anyone has asked a question I will try my best to get to it when it slows down at work. Thank you again!!!!!",finance

Forgive me if I am posting in the wrong sub

I'll start with Charles Schwab.

I had around $300 in my Schwab brokerage account. I wanted to use another brokerage besides Robinhood so I made transfers from my bank account to start out. Then on December 27th, I started a transfer of $3000 from my Bank of America account to my Charles Schwab brokerage account. The Schwab account was then suspended for suspicious activity on December 29th. I called Schwab on December 30th, and they told me that the fraud department is investigating, and it can take 3-5 business days, maybe longer because it was the holiday season. I said OK, called back a week later, and they said the same thing, called another week later, they said the same thing again. Called them about 5 or 6 times, and they always say that they need 3 to 4 or 3 to 5 business days to investigate. Well, it's now January 27 and my account is still locked for suspicious activity.

When I try to ask them what they are investigating, they will never tell me. How can I get access to my money?

Does it usually take this long?

If i do nothing, how long would it take to complete the investigation? months, years?

Is it legal for them to hold my money for this long?

&amp;#x200B;

TD Ameritrade

[https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/xjScClZ.jpg)

I got a letter in the mail that I have been banned from TD Ameritrade. I created an account with them on December 26th and this letter is from the 29th saying that their business relationship with me has been terminated, and they will not change this decision, and I am basically banned from using them in the future. It seemed that I was banned for an unknown reason; they won't tell me, so at this point, I have more questions than answers. The only guess I have is because Schwab bought TD Ameritrade, so they are trying to prevent me from using both? IDK

EDIT: Contacted Schwab early this morning because if I call later in the day, I will be on hold for 2 hours. They said that the fraud department hasn't updated my case since the 14th of January so they are not sure what is going on. They put my case as urgent and said that I should get a call today or tomorrow. I'll give them another week because they are probably going to drag this one out; if I don't hear back from them I'm going to file a federal complaint.

EDIT2: Just filed a federal complaint through CFPB for my Charles Schwab account. Hopefully, my account gets unlocked or funds reimbursed to me. CFPB says maybe up to 15 days; that's fine considering I've already been waiting 43 days now.

EDIT3: So, the company Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc. claimed on the federal complaint that the complaint doesn't belong to their company. What?!? I'll keep updating the post when I get more information.

EDIT4: 51 Days. CFPB closed my complaint and told me to contact FINRA. I have submitted a complaint to FINRA. Let's see what happens.

PROBLEM SOLVED

EDIT 5: March 1, I get an email from Charles Schwab regarding my account. They finally closed my account after 61 days.

I immediately make an account and transfer the funds, which are transferred on March 5 (Day 66). Finally, I have access to my money and can invest at Fidelity.

CryptoCurrency,UtahBusiness.com trying to pump Ravencoin?,"Copy/paste so we don't drive clicks there

""Cryptocurrencies are changing the way we build wealth

While the rest of the world was glued to their televisions and browser refresh buttons this past November, Trent Larson was largely indifferent. A member of the Libertarian party and a cryptocurrency enthusiast, he knew his preferred presidential candidate had no real chance at winning the election.

“It always goes to the money,” he said as the race unfolded.

Utah, long recognized as a bastion of Libertarianism, was one of just eight states where 2020 candidate Jo Jorgensen won more than two percent of the vote. Those same political leanings, coupled with the state’s technical background and rising business prowess, have helped make Utah a hotbed for a new system some believe will bring about economic reform and revitalization.

Ravencoin is an emerging cryptocurrency that is decentralized and hosted on multiple servers around the world. One of its developers, Tron Black, calls Utah home, and the spirit of the state, he says is well-aligned with his latest project.

Like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Ravencoin relies on distributed computer networks to track and automate transactions between network users. But while Bitcoin is designed to facilitate the storage and exchange of value in the same fashion as money, Ravencoin is designed specifically to track the ownership of real-world assets.

Black and other proponents of the project imagine that Ravencoin will help to create a more economically just world—one where all individuals are free to transact on an equal footing beyond the reach of government machinations. Others believe the revolutionary power of cryptocurrency in general, and Ravencoin in particular, is probably overstated. 

Either way, it still has the potential to change the way many industries operate, right down to businesses with which we interact on a daily basis.

How cryptocurrencies can increase national freedoms
Ravencoin started as an idea presented at cryptocurrency conventions: what if developers took something like Bitcoin, tracked on a similar ledger, but modified so that the coins or “tokens” represented real-world assets? That would make it possible to trade things like certificates of authenticity for art, fractions of a building, or even stocks.

“I was in the right place at the right time,” Black says, “and I got to help with the project.”

Black’s interest in cryptocurrency began in 2013. At the time, he says, he found himself following developments in the Cyprus banking crisis, which got him thinking about the nature of money and what gives it value.

Somewhere along the way, while following the news from Cyprus, Black encountered someone holding up Bitcoin as a solution, and with his background in computer science and business, his interest piqued.  That year he signed up to attend what was then the largest cryptocurrency conference in San Jose.

During the conference, Black recalls, a comedian took the stage to entertain the crowd. As he gauged his audience, the comedian asked for cheers for each political party.

“He asked how many Democrats in the convention. Nothing,” Black says. “How many Republicans? A couple claps. And then he asked for Libertarians, and it erupted.”

Black, himself had “kind of a Libertarian streak—basically this freedom idea” that had developed while watching the US wage war against Iraq. “I felt a frustration at the things that were being done in the US’ name or, in my name, across the world,” he says. He felt the US government had taken his tax dollars and used them inappropriately to interfere overseas.

And as he discovered cryptocurrency, he discovered he was far from alone. Libertarians, Larson says, are often drawn ideologically toward cryptocurrency, seeing it as a means of reducing government power.

“Some people may believe that money is a good responsibility to leave to government,” Larson says. “I think most Libertarians lean no. Having a federal currency is a state overreach. It’s them taking on something that they don’t need to do, and they’re doing that because it brings them more power and influence.”

Utah Libertarians, in particular, Larson says, may be drawn to cryptocurrency because of local cultural aspirations for entrepreneurship and self-sufficiency. 

How cryptocurrencies can solve global wealth disparities
For Black and many others, the appeal of cryptocurrency is both entrepreneurial and ideological. Bitcoin, he believes, is to Netflix as money is to Blockbuster. Taken as a whole, he says, blockchain is the inevitable digitization of business—one that, as digitization has done to other sectors—will make the business world more efficient, less costly, and more equitable.

“This has the ability to modernize money,” he says. “You have this ability to automate things—contracts and things like that. So you can say once the escrow on the house happens, the payment will be made, instead of having people shuffling paper around. I’ve always been big on automating things.”

The importance of blockchain, and especially cryptocurrency, may be more evident outside the US. 

“We live in America,” says Doug Pepe, a Washington DC-area law professor who has cofounded blockchain asset management company Mango Farm. “We have financial systems that are tried and true and have been around for a long time. You can have disagreements with polity issues, but you can be assured that if you want to send $50 to your friend, it’s going to get there.”

This isn’t necessarily the case in other countries. Cryptocurrency is “less important in the US, but more needed to avoid government abuses in developing countries,” says Diego Zuluaga, associate director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think tank. “Having currency that is outside the reach of tyrannical government limits their ability to exploit the population.”

Outside questions of direct government corruption, Pepe and others hope cryptocurrency will provide a solution—or at least an alternative to—monetary policies that result in the devaluation of national currencies. Money only has value because society agrees it’s a scarce resource. Since abandoning the gold standard, Pepe says, the US and other nations have made a habit of decreasing the value of their own currencies by creating more money. 

This is done with the intent of targeting a specified rate of inflation that is believed to incentivize spending and prevent market stagnation while avoiding inflation so severe that it would erode the public’s spending power. But it also means, Pepe says, that every time an individual works to earn money, the government effectively takes some of that value away from them through its monetary policy.

Bitcoin, Pepe says, is similar to the gold standard in that there is a finite amount of Bitcoin, and no one person or government can issue more. “One of the best use cases for Bitcoin is buying more dollars than you paid to get the Bitcoin today,” he says. “You’re foolish to hold dollars. You would be wise to hold Bitcoin.”

This isn’t to say dollars don’t serve a purpose in society, Pepe continues—he believes they are and will likely remain an important means of exchanging short- and medium-term value. But the existing US system, he says, is clearly troubled—a reality he argues is illustrated by wealth disparities that have emerged in recent generations as a result of stagnating wages and the imbalance between an increasingly small portion of society that accrues massive wealth, while the rest cannot.

“There’s something amiss with the way our monetary system is being run now,” he says, “where you have trillions of dollars being created out of thin air and being handed over to a small subset of the population in a way that debases the wealth of everyone else. It picks winners and losers.”

Outside the question of government interference, Black and Larson also believe cryptocurrency will help to create a more economically just society by removing barriers to entry that have historically held disadvantaged populations back because they are unable to pay for the middle-men who facilitate wealth-building transactions.

“All of these services that provide value to our economy end up raping us,” Larson says. “They’re just taking, and people don’t get as much value in their lives.”

How cryptocurrencies can establish verifiable value
Zuluaga believes we should take these claims with a grain of salt.

“Particularly if you’re a Bitcoin enthusiast—they tend to have a bias for seeing it as a silver bullet for everything,” Zuluaga says. From an academic perspective, he says, there is little reason to believe Bitcoin or Ravencoin will have any meaningful impact on the distribution of wealth, or on sociological power structures.

But that doesn’t mean it’s not useful in specific contexts he says, such as a means of exchange when parties are in different countries, as an investment, or as a means of facilitating transactions the parties would rather not have monitored by government.

Ravencoin, Pepe believes, puts even more potential uses on the table by introducing the idea of “tokenization”―the process by which real-world assets are converted into a digital asset tracked by the Ravencoin blockchain. Before the creation of Ravencoin, he says he had lectured on the potential of practical cryptocurrency applications, such as tracking the use of copyrighted materials like music or images online, documenting the ownership of data, or managing securities. 

However conventional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin weren’t well suited to these uses because they only tracked value, not the assets themselves. “I recognized as soon as I read the white paper that [Ravencoin] was going to be a project that will allow people to do all these things,” he says. 

Within a year, Pepe began to work on coding a set of tools to simplify the process of “tokenizing” assets in Ravencoin and he has since been working on customized Ravencoin-based trading platforms. The first project, which is already live, is a platform for trading artwork that already manages $127,000 worth of art.

Art, perhaps, isn’t the most practical application in a strict interpretation, says Adam Small, founder of IPAssets, another startup working in partnership with Pepe’s Mango Farm to launch and manage the Ravencoin art market place. Only a handful of people in the world purchase the kind of art where authenticity of ownership is a real concern. But Small believes the art marketplace is a critical use case.

Currently, most artists can glean value only from the initial sale of their work. Ravencoin, he believes, should help artists earn greater returns on their work by making it possible to verify the authenticity of work that is sold second-hand, or establishing ownership when an image of the work is used online.

Small says he realized the potential of blockchain assets while working in graphite refinement. In the mineral trade, he says, the complexity of international transactions and the lack of transparency in some regions of the world make it difficult to ensure that the previous owner of a purchase received their full payment—and that the purchased goods remained as advertised. And it’s not just minerals, he says. The movement of commodities and other goods and services around the world stands to benefit from a more transparent, decentralized system where all parties have the ability to verify ownership or authenticity of a product.

Securities, commodities, art—these things are just the beginning, Small says. “The idea of an asset is so broad, that I was talking to some associates the other day, and they asked what’s our total addressable market size. I said, how many assets are there in the world? Anything that is physical and digital can have an identity.”

This could apply to anything Small says―televisions, household appliances, the house itself. Larson can think of numerous other use cases, with applications as niche as airline miles or other reward programs, or as broad as verifying one’s own identity and reputation. Ravencoin could be used to verify the quality of work by a cosmetologist or plumber—professions currently regulated by government licensure. In the private sector, blockchain could be used to vet contractors or loan candidates. Some credit unions, Larson says, have begun to experiment with these processes internally.

“The more these systems talk the same language, brings us a world where we are able to manage our own trust,” Larson says. “We can digitally and securely verify the originator of a document, rather than looking at a birth certificate or scanning a driver’s license. You can check securely, and with great accuracy.”

Given the way cryptocurrency aligns with Utah’s ethos of self-sufficiency and fairness, Larson says he’s actually surprised by the limited way in which local businesses have embraced the technology. “It’s been very slow to grow, and just has not panned out as much as I thought it would,” he says, pointing out that only a few local businesses still accept Bitcoin payments.

When sharing their excitement about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, Pepe says it’s important “not to get ahead of ourselves. Blockchain, the whole space, is about the size of Home Depot.” For finance, the digital revolution is off to a slow start.""",cryptocurrency

investing,Bloomberg Opinion: GameStop Is Rage Against the Financial Machine,"I know, everyone is tired of hearing about Gamestop, but this was something I came across that I thought was actually quite well written and pretty spot on with most of the anger driven rhetoric I've seen on Reddit.  

I've copy/pasted because I know most of y'all don't have Bloomberg subscriptions.  

&gt; **Traders putting on the short squeeze aren’t motivated by greed. They’re engaged in an anger-driven uprising against the establishment.**

&gt;**Anger Is an Energy**


&gt;The saga of GameStop Corp. continues. By the end of another frenetic day of trading Tuesday, the stock had just topped its high from Monday. Between those peaks, it staged a fall of more than 50% on Monday afternoon. Colleagues have followed these extraordinary developments as they happened. I will try for now simply to process the single most important question: Is this just a weird technical situation, of the kind that comes along every few years, that can otherwise be safely ignored? Or does it tell us something important about market conditions as a whole?

&gt;GameStop's share price surged back to set a new high
Purely qualitatively, based on what I have witnessed, I think it does matter. The signal it sends is disquieting, if not surprising. It also introduces us to a new variant on an ancient market phenomenon.

&gt;The cliche is that market capitalism works on the balance between greed and fear.  The standard defense is as follows: If the greed to make money by beating the competition is matched by a fear of failure through making too many mistakes or cutting corners, then capitalism works. Nothing else yet discovered gives people such an incentive to work and create growth. Speculative bubbles happen when greed becomes excessive, or when fear diminishes too much. Easy money and easier trading with derivatives oil these emotions and allow them to run riot. The financial crisis of 2008 happened in large part because years of policy had convinced investors that there would be a bailout if they failed; they lost their fear, and greed took over. 


&gt;This feeds into the debate over whether we have a speculative bubble at present. Markets are pervaded by gloom and worry, so there is no lack of fear — even if confidence that interest rates will never rise is growing excessive. Meanwhile, there is little in the way of greed. Cryptocurrency has generated excitement, as has Tesla Inc., but in the main the frenzy over a historic opportunity to get rich, of the kind that was everywhere in 1999, is lacking. This is a different, worried world. The last two decades have stripped it of its positivity. The mood is nothing like the great bubbles of the past.

&gt;Instead of greed, this latest bout of speculation, and especially the extraordinary excitement at GameStop, has a different emotional driver: anger. The people investing today are driven by righteous anger, about generational injustice, about what they see as the corruption and unfairness of the way banks were bailed out in 2008 without having to pay legal penalties later, and about lacerating poverty and inequality. This makes it unlike any of the speculative rallies and crashes that have preceded it. 

&gt;On Monday, I argued that it was misplaced to take pleasure at the pain for the short-sellers who had attacked GameStop stock, and then been subjected to a “short squeeze” for the ages by traders coordinating on Reddit. I received a bumper crop of feedback. Here are some representative samples (leaving out many with unprintable expletives):

&gt;&gt;“You kind of miss the point of what is going on with GameStop. How much did Melvin pay you to write this garbage? shill. Literally trying to protect an industry trying to fleece jobs from low income workers. Sleep well chump.” 

&gt;&gt;“Watching entitled institutional shorts whine on TV and OP EDs that millennials equipped with margin accounts &amp; zero fees are collaborating on Reddit to target them is my new favorite sport. Looks perfectly healthy from where I'm sitting, which is on bull side :) plus 1 for the little guys.”

&gt;&gt;“Normal isn't putting the retail trader down for being independent while organized hedge funds force you to take their way or suffer in fear. Normal is the American dream and being able to make your own way. This isn't a casino. This is a riot.”

&gt;One respondent warned that the people squeezing the shorts aren’t “a herd of impressionable youngsters with Robinhood accounts. No. They are an experienced &amp; ruthless army of insomniacs followed by a silent legion of rapidly learning new traders. This is a new paradigm that won’t go away.”

&gt;Another told me I was a “dumb boomer” amid a screed of unprintable epithets. (Point of information: I’m just too young to be a boomer. I’m in Generation X, but it’s the intergenerational antagonism that’s noteworthy.) Another said that the short squeeze was just a way for millennials to recoup the money they had been forced to pay to bankers during the TARP rescue 12 years ago, and to put coronavirus relief checks to work:

&gt;&gt;“In other words, poor people have too much money and are now controlling the narrative. Damn those $1200 stimulus checks and $600 unemployment supplements. Too much liquidity, let's get these folks back to living paycheck to paycheck.”

&gt;&gt;“I know. Democratisation of the market is so damned inconvenient for those of us with money.”

&gt;&gt;“nobody cares about your hedge fund cronies!”

&gt;&gt;“Bloomberg defending the suits. Not surprised. They’re just mad the rubes are in on the joke now. Might this force the Fed’s hand? Too many regular people in on the game.”
 

&gt;This is all fascinating. In the space of 12 years, the role of the short-seller has turned on its head. Back in 2008, it was the shorts who upset the status quo, revealed what was rotten in the state of Wall Street, and brought down the big shots. They were even the heroes of a big movie. It was the Wall Streeters who attacked them.

&gt;Alienation has deepened since then. Short-selling hedge funds are now seen as part of a corrupt establishment, as is the media. The motives of anyone defending the shorts, or anyone wearing a suit, must be suspect. And there is a deep generational divide; those unable to own their own home and forced to rely on defined contribution pensions have a stunningly unfair deal compared to those a generation older, living in mortgage-free homes with guaranteed pensions. That percolates into anger, and a determination to right the scales by making money at the expense of corrupt short-sellers. 

&gt;We lack precedents for an angry bubble, so predictions are even harder than usual. But there are enough similarities with past incidents to raise serious cause for concern.

&gt;First, the little guys have had their success so far with the aid of margin accounts, and by using derivatives. We know what happens when these things are used to excess; even the Dutch tulipmania relied on margin debt and derivatives. Little guys (and everyone else) deserve safer tools with which to build wealth.

&gt;Second, “democratization of finance” isn’t new, and in itself is nothing that anyone can object to. The problem is that investment and financial planning are difficult, and require time. Regulate these things, and you no longer have true democratization. Leave people free to take chances, and you get disasters like the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000. That also followed plenty of hype about the success of the “little guy,” and the first great explosion of online discount trading succeeded in sucking an army of new retail investors into the bubble’s final climax. Unregulated “democratization” led to the little guy bearing the brunt of the losses.

&gt;“Democratizing” finance also leaves newly enfranchised financial citizens prey to spivs and frauds. I started my career covering the disastrous repercussions of one of Margaret Thatcher’s last reforms in the U.K. — giving people the right to leave their defined-benefit pensions, offered by employers, and take on defined-contribution “personal pensions.” Unscrupulous salesmen persuaded miners, firefighters and police officers to abandon copper-bottomed index-linked pensions for plans that came burdened with excessive charges. It was a repellent spectacle, and the bill for compensation was in the billions.

&gt;These points doubtless make me appear to be a complacent shill for the financial industry, talking down to the rubes. For the record, I’m still angry about the way workers were ripped off in Britain more than three decades ago, and about the way the little guy ended up bearing the brunt for the financial implosions of 2000 and 2008. But it looks horribly to me as though the same thing is going to happen again — and I don’t think the answer to today’s many ills is to empower poor people to bankrupt themselves with margin accounts and derivatives.

&gt;Anger, even more than greed, has the capacity to make us throw caution to the winds. Many of us have a lot to be angry about. If this carries on, and spreads beyond targets like a video-game retailer, I don’t want to see the consequences when history’s first angry bubble bursts.

personalfinance,First year into working real job - will I ever be able to buy a house?,"Hi,

I am a 32yo teacher in Germany and started my full time teaching position about a year ago (i took a long time studying).

I always had the goal of owning a house one day so I started a special down payment program with my bank where I get a very low interest rate if I save up at least 30% of the total house cost.

I currently have a net income of 3300€/month and after a year of employment I am not sure anymore if I'll actually be able to afford a house in my lifetime without sacrificing everything else. Here is a breakdown of the situation and I'd be thankful for advice:

|net income|3300€|will go up very slowly|
|:-|:-|:-|
|rent|750€|will go down in 1 year|
|down-payment plan|500€||
|savings|300€|currently at 4k, goal is 10k|
|investing|200€|ETFs|
|utilities|150€||
|insurance |350€|necessary medical|
|subscriptions / phone / etc|100€||
|transportation|200€|car insurance, gas, bike repair, ...|
|food|250€||
|work / self improvment curses|250€||

So currently I have around 250€ left every month for entertainement, cloth etc. My job is very stressful for me so there is absolutely no chance of getting a second job ontop (I'm working around 60-70 hours / week including everything). With my position there is a pension of around 70% of my final income, so I'm not worrying about having money for retirement.

My rent / utilities is a bit high because I'm living in an appartement big enough to house me and my girlfriend who is still studing to become a teacher. In about 1 year she is going to live with me again so my rent / utilites will go down substantially by then (hopefully).

When I looked on the market I did not find any houses for less than 250k€, typically it would be more like 300k€. I currently have 18k in the down payment plan, 4k in savings and 3k in investments. So if my calculations are right I'd need at least 75k in my down payment plan, which would take around 10 years at my current savings rate. But if the housing market stays on its upward trajectory houses will be more like 350-400k (they were 200k 5 years ago).

When I got into this job I was under the impression that I had a pretty good paying profession since I'm paid a lot more than most of my friends. Is my spending too high? Is there something I did not consider? Any advice is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Shady Chase Savings Account Practice,"I just wanted to relay my experience with a newly opened Chase Savings account.

At the end of December I opened a Chase Savings account as they had a $150 sign-up bonus promotion and interest rates have been so low I figured why not?  To receive the bonus you have to maintain a $10,000 minimum balance throughout the 90 day window to receive the bonus.  I transferred exactly $10,000 in, fees would be waived as long as $300 minimum was kept in the savings account and figured I would be golden to just let the money sit there for 3 months.

Today I checked my account and noticed the balance had dropped under $10,000 so I am no longer eligible for the sign-up bonus.  Why did it drop under $10,000?  Because when I opened the account my balance was $0 as my transfer into the account was still pending at that time and I was hit with a monthly fee since I did not maintain a minimum of $300 in the account.  

Obviously not the end of the world, but seems a bit ridiculous that I have to pay a monthly fee and that snowballed into me losing the bonus.  Maybe an oversight on my part to not consider the time prior to my initial funds being deposited, but still a bit frustrating.",finance

personalfinance,Is it better to trade in or refinance for a breed interest rate on an auto loan?,"EDIT: “Breed” was supposed to be “better” in the title.

So here’s what’s going on. Last March, my dad bought me a Toyota Corolla that after all of the dealer shit bullshit ended up being about $27,000. Unfortunately, my dads credit score is pretty bad, and we ended up with nearly a 15% interest rates with monthly payments on a 72 month loan being around $515. Since the car is about a year old, we were looking at refinancing, but his credit score hasn’t improved much. I’ve since turned 18 and have established my own credit score of around 650.

Here’s my question, would it be better to attempt and refinance, or trade in the car for a new one at the same price (The value of the car is about $15,000) and have me co-sign with him so that we could get a lower interest rate and lower monthly payments while also taking on what’s still owed for the first car? 

I don’t have much experience with finances so anything so any help is appreciated!

Edit: After having a chat with my he said he’d cover the payments until we aren’t underwater and then I’ll sign onto the car and get it refinanced. Hopefully that’ll make the best out of a bad situation, at least for me.",finance

investing,Fed (Powell) affirmed commitment to low interest rates and massive bond purchases,"[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/fed-meeting-live-updates-watch-jerome-powell-speech.html)

On bond purchases:
&gt;Powell, in his press briefing, said talk of tapering is “premature” and the Fed would have to see improvement towards its goals before it would consider cutting back on purchases

On Fed's affect on markets:
&gt;“There are many things that go into, as you know, setting asset prices. If you look at what’s really been driving asset prices in the last couple of months, it isn’t monetary policy,” Powell said. “It’s been expectations about vaccines, and it’s also fiscal policy.” “The connection between interest rates and asset values is probably something that’s not as tight as people think because a lot of different factors are driving asset prices at any given time,” the Fed chair added.

This seems like good news to me. This means the Fed won't pull back their printer simply because the market is over performing.

Powell's commitment seems like it will last a long time, for [he said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zzW_e2tyy0):

&gt;We are a long way from a full recovery.

What does everyone think? It seems this is what investors were looking for -- further commitment to low interest rates and massive bond purchases. Shouldn't the market be up today?",finance

wallstreet,$MAC Army Gather Here - This is where we ignite the rally!,"So here are a few quick notes on Macerich and then the plan of action to spread the word:

According to the ""short interest ratio"" (which is the days it would take for all shorts to cover at an average volume day), MAC (15) is MUCH higher than GME (6) or BBBY (11).This means that, compared to trading float and volume, MAC would have a much bigger price surge with any successful short squeeze than the others. For what it is worth, MAC is also a solid company with decent book value to hold longterm.  (Source: Key-Tie2542 - go read their posts/comments on MAC - very good analysis)

Here is another post of mine to learn more: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/l5vecr/macerich\_mac\_the\_big\_short\_squeeze/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/l5vecr/macerich_mac_the_big_short_squeeze/)

4. Buy shares and call options - EDIT - after buying shares, contrary to what some threads are saying, do not place a limit sell order way above the price.  This does not stop short selling. I previously had this wrong
5. DO NOT SELL.

personalfinance,"""Windfall"" and IRA contributions","Long story short, my dad (57) bought two annuities at $50k each 4 years ago. After recently getting more involved with his finances, we were getting worried that he didn't have enough retirement savings for him and my mom to retire comfortable (the end goal). We decided that since he's still working and able to work for more years (he works an office job), that it would be best to put the annuity money to better use than sitting in an annuity with very little gains. So now, we have this ""windfall"" and I wanted to make sure we were going about this the right way. Below is the plan and a few questions that we had:

* The $100k for the annuities came from a cash-out refinance. From my understanding, this doesn't trigger any extra taxes owed since this value is a loan added on top of the original mortgage, correct?
* The interest income from the annuities is taxable, but since we're withdrawing in the surrender period, taxes and surrender charge eat up into the principal and he's actually getting only $49,500 on one of them. This also doesn't trigger any tax implications correct?
* For the $49,500 sudden ""windfall,"" our plan was to contribute the $14000 maximum for 2020 &amp; 2021 for him and another $14000 maximum for 2020 &amp; 2021 as a spousal IRA for my mom (my dad's annual salary is around $95k). Since we don't expect any major salary increases and he's much closer to retirement, would a Traditional IRA (rather than Roth) make more sense for him and my mom? I've read through the wiki and this seems to be the way to go, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything.
* Since it's already past January, if he makes a 2020 Traditional IRA contribution now, is it too late to deduct the $14000 amount from his 2020 taxes? Will he have to deduct $28000 from the 2021 taxes? This seems like a huge deduction and I'm worried it might trigger some flags, though I don't know what since this is all legitimate.
* The other thing we wanted to do with the money was to refinance and potentially pay some points to minimize the interest rate. Te closing costs would be around $11,000 at the maximum. We don't really expect to be moving out of the house any time soon, so it seems like we'll at least break even. The lowest interest rate we've seen is around 2.375% 30yr compared to his 4.75% 30 yr (currently 26yr since he refinanced recently).
* The remaining amount would be to pay off credit card debt (which he luckily doesnt have too much of) and beef up the emergency fund.
* We're waiting til April to surrender the other $50k since the surrender period for that one ends at that time. We're not really sure what to do with this extra $50k, but likely it will go to the emergency fund again and slowly slip it into his 401k (by maximizing his contributions via payroll and using the $50k to replace the monthly income).

Is there anything we're missing? Any other possible options? One of his concerns is that FAFSA may turn down my sister for financial aid (which we do need) if he's keeping too much money in the bank. Is there a way to avoid this?

personalfinance,401 (k) Questions - Need advice.,"Apologies in advance for a very lengthy post.

Here are my questions:

1. I’ve forgotten what retirement age I entered while setting up my 401 (k) plan. How can I see/update what I added?

2. At the retirement age I added, would I be able to withdraw all of my 401 (k) funds penalty-free?

3. When I initially setup my 401 (k) plan, it was all pre-tax. I’m now moving the whole contribution to Roth. How does it impact the previous contributions I made as pre-tax?

4. I earn about $90k per year. I contribute 5% (as Roth) to my 401 (k). My employer contributes 4% (maximum that they can offer). Should I contribute at a higher percentage provided that I can still meet all of my expenses comfortably? Or should I rather put my extra savings in a Savings/Investment account and keep the 401 (k) contributions as they are?

5. As of now my 401 (k) investments fall under ‘Columbia Balanced A’ (CBLAX) at 100%. Does it matter which one(s) of the following I choose? If yes, what are best ones? 
Here’s the list:

wallstreet,"A letter to Wall Street, Politicians and the Men and Woman who are taking part in this.","To Whom it may concern:  

Wall street same as politicians have lived in a world with out consequences for years.  Not because noone cared, but because noone could see. We couldn't see the shady insider trading (which congress voted to make legal for themselves), we couldn't see the racism the self servicing legislation passed to make yourselves richer.  Noone could see what was going on.

Wall street has ran this play 100 times.  Short a company, let it run aground and take every dollar from the shareholders on its way to the bottom.  No one knew.  No one knew that the media pushing a certain agenda was a part of it, that regulation was a part of it. Now we can see.   They played their game, they were called on it.  They have been illegally taking naked shorts, they know they are against a wall.  They have no defense, GME, AMC, BB - we can see what's going on and that's not our fault. You've never had a problem taking money from us but now the tables are turned and you're complaining about this or that.  You took the gamble not us, now cover your shorts.

There is no bail out coming, do you think the FED is going to bail out a hedge fund who has been in the news the past week about how the little guy is going up against their predatory practices and now that you are suffering that you need help? Yea they aren't gonna touch this with a 10 foot pole. Not to mention, you got a huge bail out while we have been dying for another $600 after the $1200 we got a year ago.  

This isn't an attack, this isn't war.  This is us playing the game adhering to the rules YOU MADE, you just don't like when other people win.

You don't buy stocks, you trade them.  For someone to make money, someone has to lose money.  You're betting on everyone to fold. You like to think everyone is less verse in finance that how can this happen? it must be collusion, or manipulation but certainly not you being beat at your own game.

Wall Street won't go away, things are just changing.  And you can either get on board or lose.

We can hold out.  We can do the math, how long can you bleed money? How long can you float that daily interest? How long before you need to sell off your clients money to cover your bet gone wrong?

This isn't an attack, or a war.  It's the same game with new players.

That's it.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my credit card?,"So I got a credit card when I was 19 not knowing anything about credit. I currently owe about $5,700 and my interest rate is 21.99%.

I'm 34 years old, married with one child and I only started 3 years ago investing in my retirement because I've been living abroad, in different countries for many years and didn't have that option. So far I have a TSP (Thrift Savings Plan) account since I'm a federal employee, a traditional IRA from my previous employer and money in stocks. I feel like I'm little behind and would like your advice. At this point, is there anything I should do or any investment plan that would be beneficial to my future? 
Also, since I can't put any extra money on my IRA, is it a good idea to rollover the funds into my TSP or withdraw everything, even though there are penalties, and put all the money in stock market.

personalfinance,Employer not withholding federal income taxes - multiple jobs,"My wife and I both work full time and make over $150K/year combined.  She recently took a side job where she only works a couple of days per month.  She’s gotten a couple of checks so far and they have not withheld any federal income taxes.  I presume this is because, by their payroll company’s calculations (Paychex), she won’t make enough (at their office) to pay federal income taxes.  

Is there a way to get them to take out federal income taxes other than manually entering additional withholdings?

As a second question, we both claim 0 dependents/exemptions on our payroll taxes at our primary employers.  We do this to have the maximum taxes taken out so that we hopefully don’t owe anything to the IRS at the end of the year.  But for the 2nd (or maybe 3rd year) in a row now, we owe close to $3,000.  Why is this?  We didn’t use to have this problem.  The whole point of selecting 0 exemptions is to get tax withholding as close to being accurate as possible, right?",finance
personalfinance,EE Bond Questions,"I have a variety of EE Bonds that were purchased between 1991-2006. I'm having trouble understanding some things.

They have a set interest rate, but are guaranteed to double after 20 years. After that, they will accrue interest at the set rate until 30 years, is that correct?

If that is correct, I don't understand how the Treasury Direct website is calculating the bond value. Can someone explain? See example below.

* $50 bond purchased 2002 at 0.28% interest rate now valued $102. It hasn't been 20 years, so the value hasn't doubled, and the interest rate is so low.
* Second example: $50 bond purchased on 2003 at 0.28% interest rate now valued at $72.84
* These bonds are only one year different, but one has more than doubled and the other isn't even close. It doesn't add up in my mind. These numbers were obtained from the Treasury Direct website/calculator.

Above questions were answered, still have questions below:

\-If the interest rate is only 0.28%, wouldn't it make sense to cash it after the 20 years and put it into a savings account or CD? Even though interest rates are low right now, I could get 0.5% in a savings account. (I plan to use the money for a large purchase in the near future, not for long term investment)

\-The remainder of bonds are 1.08-4.0% interest, so I should just keep those in the bond for better interest than what a savings account could offer currently?",finance

personalfinance,Advice on Student Loan Repayment Strategy,"I am interested in hearing your opinion on my student loan repayment strategy.

Some background: I graduated college in May with $22,767 in three separate federal un-subsidized student loans. I began my job in July making $6,833 gross monthly ($4,574 after tax and 401-K contributions). I am 22, living at home, and paying my parents $400 a month for rent/utilities/food and with a plan to agressively pay off my student loan to become debt-free in order to start saving for a down payment. Interest on the loans has been frozen until at least Sept 30. Since I began paying $1200 a month in August, I have paid off $7,300, leaving me with $15,467.67. At the current rate, I will fully pay off my loan in Feb 2022, a year and a half after graduation.

My question is: Do you think this strategy is too agressive? Should I instead be putting some of the money from my loan into an additional savings/investment account/CD (especially while there is no interest accruing)? Am I doing it wrong by trying to pay down this loan which is not accruing any interest?",finance

personalfinance,In a tough situation regarding debt collection,"Hi, 25/PA. In 2019 I made a somewhat poor decision. My at the time Fiance needed a car and I obliged to sign as primary on the loan. Time progressed with the car and issues arose with the car and our relationship. The car was repossessed, leaving me/us with the remainder of the loan in our name. Roughly, 10-11,000$.  We setup a ""payment"" plan but against our best plan of action I wasn't aware the interest was a whopping 15%. The plan we had set in action was for her to just put down 100$/mo as that's all she could rummage on her own to pay off this debt. Fast forward till now where Equifax is now reporting the debt on her credit aswell, which it hadn't been for well over year and an ""oh crap"" moment sprung up on her end and I called the agency handling our account to see what was going on, as it is no longer showing on mine as it had been. Which is how I found out about this incredibly high interest rate. Speaking with the gentleman handing our account he told me I could pay it off in full for 85% of the balance, $10,848. I obviously don't have that and neither does she otherwise I would have quashed this ASAP. I own my own home but my income alone doesn't allow me to pay toward the debt. The gentleman I spoke to suggested refinancing my home to lump sum pay off the debt at hand or potentially loaning out from my 401K. I'm in a bind here and not sure what to do hoping I can get some shred of help in regards to where I can go from here.",finance
Bitcoin,Explaining $650K PT,"BTC has complete runway to increase to $650K under current conditions (and not accounting for inevitable QE and printing). A note to investors from JP Morgan also holds this expected price. 

Institutions are pitching Bitcoin as “digital gold”. The argument from Dr. Saylor, Microstrategy CEO, is that bitcoin serves a better store hold of value than cash and deserves a place on corporate balance sheets. 

The total value of all gold around the world is estimated to be $13.5T. Assuming BTC gradually grabs 100% market share from gold as the preferred safe haven of choice, value per coin is approx. $642k per BTC. 

Further money creation by the Fed and stimulus passage by the government increases that potential value. However, note that it is unlikely that gold will lose all its market to BTC in the near future due to its relevance in the gold standard over last few centuries.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Carrying Cost of Housing Has NOT gone up significantly,"I was a little surprised to see this, but I was running some numbers on a few properties and realized that the actual monthly ""carrying cost"" of houses hasn't significantly increase, even in areas where the purchase price has gone up a ton.

This post shows a house whos price has gone up from $105k to $495k in the last 22 years and my post.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/l6knim/in\_1999\_this\_house\_was\_105k\_today\_490k\_in/gl1qnya?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/l6knim/in_1999_this_house_was_105k_today_490k_in/gl1qnya?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

What I realized is that although the sticker cost is much higher, the *actual carrying costs* aren't that much higher (if any), and the actual ROI as an investment is significantly higher.

Let's run the numbers:

||1999 Par|1999 (Inflation -&gt; 2021 dollars)|2021 par|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Purchase Price|$105k|$165k|$490k|
|30yr Interest Rate|8.0%|8.0%|2.5%|
|Monthly Interest Payment|$667|$1,063|$969|
|Monthly Equity Payment|$68|$85|$870|
|Total Payment (PI)|$735|$1,148|$1,839|
|Taxes (estimate)/Insurance|$90/$50|$130/78|$300/$10|
|Total (PITI)|$875|$1,366|$2,239|
|**Total Carrying Cost (ITI)**|$807|**$1,271**|**$1,369**|

**From a ""Carrying Cost"" perspective (the actual net cost of servicing the property and debt), the 2021 house is only 7% more expensive, which is less than $100/mo.**

That means the houses are approximately the ""same cost"" to someone with plenty of cash flow.

Then the issue to buy the property becomes one of cash flow.

&amp;#x200B;

||1999 Par|1999 (Inflation -&gt; 2021 dollars)|2021 par|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Purchase Price|$105k|$165k|$490k|
|Down Payment (5%)|$5,250|$8,208|$24,500|
|Cash Required|$8,000|$12,500|$29,500|
|Total Payment (PI)|$735|$1,148|$1,839|
|**Income Required (payment = 50% net income @ 30% tax rate)**|**$26,000**|**$40,650**|**$63,050**|

That paints a little different picture.  More income and more cash is required to buy the house.  But once you have more cash and more income, less of your money is spent on ""carrying costs"" and more goes into equity.  That's both a good thing and a bad thing.  It's a very good thing if your income has scaled with inflation, but it's quite bad if you're in the threshold of people who can no longer afford the house.

Let's look at the outcome after 30 years of owership with a VERY conservative amount of equity growth and using some other assumptions I'm taking some minor liberties with inflation (don't want to use calculus) in comparing inflated 1999 dollars to today.

&amp;#x200B;

||1999 Par|1999 (Inflation -&gt; 2021 dollars)|2021 par|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Purchase Price|$105k|$165k|$490k|
|Cash Required|$8,000|$12,500|$29,500|
|Home Value After 30 years (3% annual growth)|$263,000|$406,000|$1,250,000|

As such, the actual financial situation of someone with a comparable income and cash flow is about the same using today's housing prices as using 1999 housing prices (inflation adjusted).

This **REQUIRES** that 1999 you invest the **FULL** difference between the cheaper (higher interest) home, and the more expensive monthly payments from today's loans.

And that's the crux.  As houses go up in price, there isn't a significantly bigger chunk of money going to carrying costs, but houses are accessible to less people and provide less flexibility for other investments during the life of the loan, but given average figures, the numbers are so similar.

But... tax benefits on owner occupied homes are HUGE.  There's very few other asset classes that allow you to take a 100% deduction on $1.2m in gains.

**The main conclusion I draw from this are:**

**TLDR;**

\- **Houses are not significantly more expensive than they were in the past on a CARRYING COST basis (Interest/Tax/Insurance)**

\- **The main issue here is that houses are** ***less accessible*** **to people with less cash flow due to bigger down payments and large PITI monthly payments**

\- **The high cost of housing today seems to be nearly 100% DUE TO LOW INTEREST RATES.**

\- **Tax breaks on owner-occupied houses are VERY significant.**",finance

Forex,Funded trader looking for advice,"Hey traders of reddit,

I am a fairly new trader (started Jul 2020) and have been fairly profitable (2-3%/month) until the past 2 months where I got greedy and ignored my risk management. I blew my account and decided that I need to be strict and disciplined with my strategy so I went ahead for the T4T and FTMO funding challenges (they help you a risk management and being accountable also helps me stick to my plan). I just passed the T4T $50k funding and proceeded to trade live with their monies. (Also passed the first round for the FTMO, waiting for their 2nd round) which brings me to believe that my strategy works to a certain extent, the fact that it can bring me that far in the assessments.

I started the first day by following my usual strategy which is to determine market sentiment from most recent economic data release for pairs I trade (mostly US, so I based on the most recent fed interest rates things are going to go as is, ECB possibly looking to cut rates, etc.). I followed up with some simple S/R trendlines with MACD for potential entry with appropriate SL/TP. I ended the day losing $1k and I've been pretty stressed about losing 4x in a row. Which brings me to my question. How do you, experienced/funded traders, handle the pressure of losing many times in a row and still manage to keep your heads up high knowing that your strategy does work for you? Maybe you can share some insight and perspective with regards to this topic. I appreciate any advice, new strategies I can test, etc.

Feel free to ask for more info if it helps you answer the question better. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,SIMPLIFIED Question regarding w2 box 1 wages with bonus questions on FICA,"I’ve run into conflicting guides and definitions with regards to gross wages, taxable wages, federal adjusted gross or taxable wages, etc. and can’t figure out which information is being accounted for in certain forms.

First question 

W2 Box 1 - Wages, tips, other comp. - is this net of FIT and FICA withholdings? My guess is not since it pulls into the 1040 before being calculated down to AGI where the tax rate is applied.

Second question

All things being equal, For purposes of deriving cash flow, if XX reflects...

1. [W2 Box 1] gross salaries of $100
2. [W2 Box 4] social security tax of $13 
3. [W2 Box 6] Medicare tax of $2
4. [1040 line 15] total tax of $20

... do I have enough information to get an accurate cash flow figure? My guess is yes since, generally, employers can pay 50% of FICA, but they can also pay up to 100% with the employee covered piece being tacked onto gross wages [W2 box 1], correct? If this isn’t correct, is there a way for me to calculate what portion was paid by employer vs employee if they strayed from 50/50 split? Lastly, if I do end up needing to know the employee vs employer split on FICA to derive employee cash flow, can I calculate this with a 1040 only?

personalfinance,Seeking Derogatory Mark Advice,"So about ~~8~~ [edit: 6] years ago I had an appointment at my local Health Department, for which I was billed roughly $100.  At the start of Coronavirus stuff of 2020, my credit dropped 50 points abruptly. I looked into it and discovered a new derogatory mark.  Apparently this bill back then had gone to Collections.

My issue is I am fairly certain I paid this bill. I remember quite distinctly I had fronted my mom money for an expense of her's, and by the time my appointment took place she had her finances worked out so when she learned I had this appointment she said ""oh lemme write a check for that!'.  It was really nice of her, which is part of why I feel confident this bill was paid; I remember in such detail lol.  I also could be trippin but I also visually remember handing  something to the lady in the office there...was it a check? Or was it a signature approving future billing? I don't remember tbh but I handed her something and it was paper.

I've never had a derogatory mark before so of course I looked into this and in the course of my reading I learned that my initial impulse to just pay off the [now $228] debt is, in fact, *not* the best thing to do for one's creditscore. I learned it's better to contest the derogatory mark and have it removed, than to admit to an overdue bill and pay it.

So a few questions.  First, is that advice true?

Secondly, if my mum did in fact write a check and that's not in my imagination, what are the odds I could (with her assistance) find proof of this through her bank? Could she just be like ""Hey did I write a check for x amount to x person in x year?"" And they be like ""Yeah here's proof"" ?

Third, if I can't secure proof of my own that I paid this bill, should I move forward with contesting the derogatory mark anyway?  I read somewhere else that 'the burden of proof', so to speak, is on the Collections agency to make a case, and that if its too much hassle for them to prove you owe money they will just drop the mark. Is that true?

Any advice or related banter will be appreciated and welcome.

-~-~-~-~-~-

Btw the timing of this mark just suddenly showing up on my report was weird to me.  It honestly crossed my mind that the state and other entities were at that time prob scrambling to collect $ however they could, given current events and the spooky state of the economy.  Like a supposed debt from [5] years prior just so happened to pop up within weeks of announcement of stimulus checks stuff.. Any merit to my hunch or nah? Think it was mere coincidence? Did this happen to anyone else? Is it normal for it to take so long ([6] yrs) for a debt to show up?  This series of questions doesn't matter so much to me but sorta wana know if my thought was crazy or not haha.  It was devastating to watch my credit drop 50 points all at once when I'd worked so hard to establish good credit and this just seemed so wack to me, but I also didnt wana discount this kinda thing could just be commonplace.

Its been a year and I still haven't handled the mark but now with interest rates so low I might want to finance something soon which has me frowning at this mark again and thinking I should stop procrastinating and handle it.

Update: Asked spouse what year we had that health dept visit.  He says it was late 2014.  That changes my timeline so that the bill was issued a little over 6 years ago from today and so therefore the mark showed up on my credit report roughly 5 years after the appointment billing. Given input from commenters it appears accuracy of my timeline might matter. I was a whole 2 years off sorry. Post edited to reflect new info.",finance

personalfinance,"Refinancing again, question","Hello! So I’m refinancing my mortgage again as rates continue to lower. I just want to make sure I’m not missing something here...

I’m lowering my rate by about .6 percent, and we’ve taken a lender credit for a few points to cover our closing costs because we don’t expect to be in our house long enough for a slightly lower rate to be beneficial.

Is there any downside to doing this that I’m not understanding? It sounds like this is a no-risk situation since my rate will go down and I’m not covering the loan costs. (Also our loan term is staying the same)

Thanks everyone

*Edit - Full numbers
I have a 297k balance on my loan, which is currently at 3.4%. Our lender will give me a $3800 credit to take a 2.7% interest rate, instead of the best they could offer which is 2.5%. This credit will fully cover the costs of refinancing, so according to the traditional refinance calculators my ""breakeven"" is basically 0 months.

As for retirement, I am putting in 8% into my 401k. My company matches half of 8% so I am getting the full company match but I also get an extra 2% into that account and 4% into another account since I am a part of our union.

CryptoCurrency,Wall Street has decided you're not responsible enough to buy GME. This is why we need DeFi.,"For years, the crypto community has pointed to government control over fiat money as the reason Bitcoin needs to exist. People need an asset that they know can't be arbitrarily printed or controlled by corrupt governments.

And after 12 years, this narrative is taking hold. The financial industry is starting to take Bitcoin seriously, investors and large corporations are putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet to reduce their dependency on the behavior of the US federal government.

**But the next fight is upon us.**

This week, the common folk of the internet discovered their power. They discovered that by working together, they can challenge the powerful entities of Wall Street.

And Wall Street hates it.

As of right now, Robinhood and most other trading products are in ""reduce only mode"".

Wall Street has decided that you're not responsible enough to buy the stocks that you like, so they've taken away your stock buying privileges.

Of course, hedge funds will still have access to GME and AMC. But not you.

**This is why Bitcoin is only the beginning of this revolution.**

It's not simply enough to be able to custody your own assets. You need to be able to trade them, to lend them, to leverage them. You should have access to the same financial instruments that the rich people on Wall Street have access to.

**This is why we need DeFi**

Nobody can turn off Uniswap. Nobody can turn off Aave. Nobody can turn off Synthetix.

Nobody can tell you that leverage-longing some shitcoin is irresponsible and you're not allowed to do it.

**This can be our moment.**

Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low (average \~$45/share with my later buys averaged in), and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*

First, thank you everyone for the comments and questions on [my first post on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5l413/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity/). Given the traffic and sheer volume of questions, I figured writing another post would be better (and actually something I can manage).

I wanted to focus this post on a few common themes I saw in the comments to the first post, as well as questions people were asking me directly, and related themes I saw on other posts and subs that I believe would be informative for this sub.

First, a simplified recap of the 1/27/2021 trading day as I saw it. The following is my interpretation of events, and may include personal opinions, assumptions, and outright errors. Apologies for the length, but I hope this helps some of the newer traders thinking about jumping into the water with these sharks. I honestly don't think that you should, but you make your own decisions. I'll just try to help provide some information to help if I can.

# Euro Market Hours: Retail Euphoria &amp; The Setup

After-hours and Euro market activity rockets the stock in an essentially unbroken streak from \~$146 to $365. GME long social media is going ballistic.

Volume is too low. There is no sell-side pushback. Allowing consolidation at these prices would be a major setback for the short-side, yet they are doing nothing on volume they could easily push back.

I smell a rat. This is too easy.

# 5am Eastern: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD)

If you ask most retail market participants about how quants with their algorithms, hedge funds with their trading strategies, sophisticated experienced traders, etc., conduct their operations, you will probably get responses about sophisticated programs and high frequency trading, fundamental analysis, risk hedging strategies, lots of math, etc. That is largely true, but it is critically incomplete. The most successful hedge fund managers also deeply understand that beneath the surface, the primal forces driving markets are fear and greed, and they know how to best leverage information asymmetry to play other investors--and especially retail investors--like fiddles.

As retail sentiment reaches fever pitch, Andrew Ross Sorkin gets a call from Melvin Capital just before the start of CNBC's Squawk Box, by far the most-watched pre-US market show and files a [breaking news alert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HYBo5teFTU) at the start of the show.

(Paraphrasing) Melvin Capital is out. They didn't go bankrupt but they came close and took a huge loss. Congratulations WSB, you've won and you've burned the house down, and now that the shorts are out this whole thing is going to crash and burn all the retail investors you dragged along with you.

""[Who's going to be left holding the bag](https://youtu.be/1HYBo5teFTU?t=146)?... uh, the thing that concerns me most, at this point, is whether **some of these investors will actually start to get out today**\--they'll look at this and say 'we won the game'--if that's winning, uhh unclear, you know, where the finish line is, uh in that regard, but uh, as much pain as they may have uh, created for Melvin Capital for example, umm, **my-my great anxiety at this point is the number of-of retail investors that have been jumping into this uhh.. in literally the last 24 hours who very well may get hurt, uh, far more, and lose far more than some of the hedge funds that were involved, uh in this**. Um, let's just show you where we are now...""

""**Where are the regulators**.. and is this just the beginning?""

Meanwhile, as if it had been choreographed and rehearsed, the Squawk Box team are outraged--absolutely outraged at what is going on, while a big graphic of GME price crashing off a cliff dominates 2/3 of the screen and social media is flooded with messages and posts skillfully crafted to stoke the fear.

In WSB, other subs, and other social media sites, dozens of bots start posting bogus messages purporting to mock the retail investors with messages like ""Thanks for the free gainz retards!"".

The fear is almost palpable coming through my monitor. People start trying to sell, then start asking why their market sell orders won't go through while they're watching a practically vertical dive on the GME chart next to Joe Kernan as he says ""If you think there's speculation in crypto \[...\] and-and-**now they're looking for the next mark, right**? They'll-they'll find another Gamestop, once they're done with Gamestop, but **in the meantime, there's gonna be BLOOD**"".

Congratulations Squawk Box--you beautifully played your part in engineering peak, nigh-hysterical fear among the less experienced retail investors, and basically shouted ""FIRE!!!"" in the market equivalent of a locked theater. I truly believe your feelings were sincere, and you truly do have concern for the retailers who have been and will be hurt in all of the volatility, but that made your actions all the more effective in driving many try to lock in losses. C'mon, you can do better--I've seen you do good work and am thankful for what you did getting good info out during the peak of the pandemic--please do some investigation before spreading only one side of the narrative handed to you by financially conflicted parties. You have analysts doing your background research--any of them could tell you the short interest in GME would take more than an entire trading day to unwind even if the buy-side of every single transaction that day was to close a short position and no new short positions were initiated. Also, any of them could tell you that it's unlikely Melvin Capital held 100% of all short interest in GME. Melvin leaving is not equal to all shorts being covered--and you didn't even get confirmation that Melvin actually covered! Get them to say it themselves on air rather than carrying their water and letting them ride on your reputation and providing cover from an SEC stock manipulation investigation.

Most retail brokerages don't open pre-market trading until around 7am. All those people could do was watch their positions bleed as GME plummeted over the remainder of the next 2 hours, hitting the floor of $182, nearly 50% down from the peak about 3 minutes before retail brokerages open pre-market trading.

Wow. I have to hand it to the short-side hedge funds. Some of your traders must have studied drama for their undergrad or something--that is almost perfect timing.

Almost, but not quite.

# Pre-Market Tears... of Joy and Relief

The engineered crash was probably intended to run right through the open of retail pre-market, with the idea of getting panicking retail to sell into the low liquidity environment for more violent downward price moves without the benefit of Limit Up/Limit Down halts, causing a stampede for the exits. Man, how many hours did you guys spend thinking this strategy up? I'm honestly impressed.

Two minutes prior to pre-market open, however, some deep conviction, deep pocket players, understanding the market mechanics and fundamentals behind the recent wild ride in GME started raking in the shares at discount prices they probably never thought they'd ever see again during this campaign. I'm sure tears of joy were shed, as they realized floor-to-close of regular trading gains of nearly 100%. Whoever you are, well played.

I would note here that those people could easily have waited for the engineered crash to drain the blood of the fearful retailers who would have punched out, which would have allowed them to lock in greater share volumes at even lower prices, but they stopped the crash early instead. I don't know if that was their intention, but a lot of retail people were probably saved because of that.

With the almost literally last-minute reversal, price rode green candles upward through the retail pre-market open, and many who would have despaired and punched out to lock in losses instead white-knuckled through the chop and held, with very bullish action through to the market open. Those who survived the day--good on you, I know it couldn't have been easy.

# Chamath

Let's let the man [speak for himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iYh_mc26SU) (and speak up for retail). Well worth spending 30 minutes to watch if you have the time. I have to give Scott Wapner credit--he asks tough questions and he repeatedly brings on guests that he know will go toe-to-toe with him with the gloves off to ensure that there is a good, vigorous debate representing diverse viewpoints. Be on the right side of history big boy, lol.

Skirmishing continues at lower volume than the last 2 trading days. Bullish patterns everywhere--buying up on high volume, straggling down on low volumes. Liquidity is running out. Short-side is rationing, saving ammo for the end-of-day push.

# Shenanigans, End of Day, More Shenanigans

At various points throughout the day, levers are pulled to flush retail positions out by margin calling profitable accounts across many of the retail brokerage firms, changing margin requirements with no notice.

Short-side attacks coincide with ominous warnings on news media about potential regulator action, short-side touts spreading FUD across mainstream media.

Short-side's rationed insufficient shares to make meaningful progress on the last tick of regular trading. This is key, as prime brokers of highly levered players pay a lot of attention to the status of accounts at the end of regular trading each day.

After hours it looks like more retail traders are dumped out of their profitable portfolios due to margin change requirements--right into the abyss of super-low after-hours volume. Had their brokers at least liquidated their accounts toward the end of the main trading day into meaningful trading volume they would have gotten much better returns. Dumping them into no volume means the last few accounts took massive losses vs mark to end of trading day market price. Thank, you brokerages, for protecting those people from themselves. Hopefully they took lower profits vs being dumped into the red.

Some people see the diving ticker and panic again.

One thing that was particularly irritating to me is that people were all over CNBC multiple times a day, making outrageous claims of how retail traders were slamming risk into the market via leveraged trades even as the retail brokers changed their policies in realtime to disallow use of any margin in accounts holding GME, and dumped those retail traders out of their positions. I knew what kind of volatility to expect, so I had maintained a net cash position in my account ever since buying, just in case something like this happened--thank goodness.

# Technical Analysis for the Day

I wish this sub would allow charts, but I'll describe instead.

On the daily chart, RSI has been in an ascending channel since April '20(!), and rocketed to 98+(!!!) at the end of the trading day. Price is dislocating wildly higher every day for the past 4 days into descending volume.

My read of the chart is that it shows massive buy-side dominance into worsening sell-side weakness and lower liquidity. I read this as mind-meltingly, parabolically bullish, and something that would not be possible if not for the distortion of the supercritical mass of short interest, and I guess this is what a short squeeze looks like when you have access to all the data retail fintech can provide. The technicals tell me to expect massive volatility, but also that this is possibly the most asymmetrical risk environment imaginable.

I feel bad for the retail shorts that I know were out there. I saw a few posts about people taking short positions because Andrew Left got on TV and told them GME is going bankrupt, it's going back to $20, and he's an expert unlike you reddit amateurs, and by the way about 30 other experts followed and backed him up over the past few days. For this reason I'm glad that many of the retail brokerage firms have disallowed shorting GME and other volatile names. I hope they got out before their accounts got obliterated.

# Lessons Learned

I wondered what kind of things you might see when billions of dollars were on the line, and I have to say that the short-side guys know how to go all-in and pull surprise after surprise out of the hat. They are good at manipulating people, letting them build up euphoric feelings only to slam them in the face with nonstop fear. They do it in media, and they do it in sudden price-crushing rushes, slamming the ticker down to try to get weak hands to fold. As I stated earlier, I am trading deep in the money, on capital I can afford to lose, and even I can't avoid feeling it. I honestly don't know how some of you trading on borrowed money meant for next month's rent can handle it.

The short-side players are running out of ammo, but they don't just go toe-to-toe in the market--they'll blanket media and even flood your discord server, message board, and social media with well-coordinated bot attacks. You will face those moments of stark terror--they are good getting people to feel fear. If you're thinking of getting into this trade--please understand that before deciding whether to jump in. You might not think that a stock that's been going basically vertical could leave long-side casualties on the field, but believe it--fear and volatility can get you to zero your account (or worse!) in any environment.

# FAQs from the First Post (comments and messages)

(answers are my opinions only--do not take as financial advice. I've consolidated common themes.)

* **I'm afraid I'm missing out on a unique opportunity to make returns that could change my life trajectory in a positive way. Should I buy in at this point?**

First, each person decides on their own what trades they choose to make. However, I will say this: Fear is giving you this anxiety. Maximum FOMO is when you see green candles going up until the fear makes you punch the buy order in. Maximum despair and fear of life-altering losses hits peak during deep downward price movements, making you punch out to avoid losing your entire position. Fear makes you buy high and sell low. HFT houses are full of algorithms designed to exploit fear through the price movement, and find gaps in your risk mitigation strategy (e.g. stop-loss hunting algorithms, etc.). If fear is driving you to trade, I urge you not to swim in low-liquidity waters with sharks who specifically make their money exploiting fear.

* **I am a regular investor holding broad ETFs or mutual funds for my retirement. I do not actively trade, but I am concerned that what's happening here might impact the broader market, and maybe even my retirement account. Have you thought of that while you're having all this fun? What about systemic risk?**

You may be surprised to hear that I, and likely many others have thought quite a lot about these things. In fact, I hold about 75% of my capital in the same type of boring IRA and 401(k) accounts you're talking about, and I maybe rebalance them a few times a year and don't even check the balances regularly otherwise.

As for what kinds of impacts there may be--in all honestly, no one knows. Specifically, no one knows because no one knows exactly what the levered hedge funds involved hold, how they trade, etc. The massive short interest in GME is basically a deliberately engineered market distortion that is now blowing off, and distortions blowing off are always scary, and can spell financial damage or disaster for the unprepared.

That, however, is part of the market. To paraphrase Dr. King and Keynes, the arc of the market may be long (and longer than you can remain solvent), but it bends toward efficiency, given the right conditions. The US stock market is pretty good in this respect.

Now I won't deny that these hedge funds are run by smart people, but they occasionally get either arrogant or too clever for their own good and get caught. In GME they essentially voluntarily engineered themselves into a short squeeze entirely on their own while no one was even looking. In fact, the only way the trade works is if no one ever finds out and GME quietly goes bankrupt. In the meantime, a legitimate fundamentals-based turnaround story came to light and just lit the fuse. They’re crying now about being cornered, but they walked into that corner themselves, then dug themselves in so deep that the only way out was GME bankruptcy, and sat there for a year just assuming GameStop would go bankrupt while no one was paying attention and they’d take their free money and walk. If this doesn't make sense, and you have a free 20 minutes and tolerance for mild profanity, I suggest you watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EUbJcGoYQ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EUbJcGoYQ4)

Anyway, That being said, market ""corrections"" are aptly named, even if painful, because they are, in essence, corrections of various distortions in the market. The longer they go uncorrected, the harder, faster, and more drastic the move when it does happen--with usually worse consequences (see the 2008 financial crisis, which was a distortion 10+ years in the making before blowing off).

* **It looks like maximum gains on this trade would have started if you bought in at $4. Should I be looking for names at &lt;$4 to find another opportunity like this? I heard some people made a lot of money on Hertz. Is this like Hertz?**

I have no idea. I wasn’t looking at Hertz at the time. Obviously it's different in that GME is not going bankrupt despite what some people on the news might say (honestly, I don't understand their apparent conviction on this given most of them profess to not even know any details about Gamestop).

The sense I get is that some people realized that many stocks had their prices artificially suppressed by the pure panic in the market at the time, and were likely to bounce back. Stocks crushed down to penny stock land could easily bounce back multiple hundreds of percent just by moving back up by $1, and if you had a good reason to think they'd survive, that's a pretty good deep value trade.

Some people seemed to jump on that bandwagon with the mistaken idea that you should basically just scan all stocks for things &lt;$5 today that used to be &gt;$20 or whatever and assume the 90+% drop will result in a bounce off the floor, even if it’s a “dead cat” bounce on the way to $0. DO NOT TRY TO TRADE THIS.

The theory is that a $100 stock that drops to $10 on its way to bankruptcy could bounce back to $15 first—a return of 50% if you time the floor and the bounce perfectly. In practice almost everyone who tries this loses all their money much sooner rather than later.

By the same token, people who “know” a company is heading to bankruptcy get their accounts wiped out when they short something on margin right as it hits a floor on the way down, get margin called on the bounce, and subsequently join the company in insolvency as they end up owing their broker more than they put in. Being right in the end is cold comfort at that point.

* **Could Gamestop just issue shares to bail out the short sellers?**

I guess it could, speaking entirely theoretically. That being said, consider the following:

They’ve already filed to issue $100mio worth of shares, or 500k shares using $200/share as a price assumption. I don’t know if they’ve begun to execute on that.

That was just to give them the runway required to take bankruptcy completely off the table.

As you note, at these prices, using stock to finance a turnaround is absolutely feasible.

There are, however, a few things to consider:

1. They have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. They need to be able to justify how issuing even more shares is ultimately beneficial for the company and shareholders. “Because our stock price is high right now” is not typically a compelling reason, though maybe these circumstances are an exception to that rule given the extremity of the price.
2. While a healthy balance sheet would be an improvement, debt is usually cheaper than equity when it comes to financing a company’s activities. If they can secure solvency with the $100mio stock issue already authorized, and leverage the healthier balance sheet and insanely improved market cap to instead borrow what they need to restructure, especially in this ultra low interest rate environment, that would be better for the company and shareholders.
3. They can’t just make a snap judgment to do so. It takes time, board approvals, regulatory paperwork that is public, etc. There is a lot of work and potential risk in this process—particularly for this company.
4. Even if they did this, the incredible total volume of short interest being squeezed means that in practice it would be hard for the share issue to change the trajectory of the stock. The main effect might be to terrify some retail longs into bailing out of their position depending on how the news is presented to them.

* **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ securities pricing theory/model means short interest has no impact on a security's price, short positions can be held infinitely so there really is no obligation to cover, so the thesis behind the short squeeze trade is invalid, etc. Mathematically long and short positions are the same thing.**

That may be true in some ideal theory assuming you are trading in some kind of mathematically ideal market using very specific assumptions, but you’re trading in a real market that includes things like counterparty risk, regulatory and contractual limits on ability to borrow (at least in theory--Hello SEC, threshold securities list??), interest cost, etc. that make trading in an real market different. I'll build on Box by saying all models are wrong, but some are useful--*within the bounds of certain assumptions.* The situation playing out now tells you that the short interest of GME is wildly outside the bounds of whatever models the hedge fund people are using to model position risk.

You can, in theory, infinitely roll your debt forward if you can continue to find willing lenders and are ok paying interest forever. Maybe this works out to be mathematically preferable to a squeeze to infinity.

But, step away from pure theory for a moment. We don't even have to look at empirical evidence in real markets. All we need to do is build a stochastic model of an equity market sophisticated enough to model margin limits and dynamic account balances tied to securities being traded as they are in real markets and you’ll see the probability of continuing to carry a short position converges to 0 over time. The only question is which happens first: you cover proactively, the underlying company goes bankrupt (and you cover for $0 less interest paid to borrow the stock), or you’re margin called and forced to cover with potentially unlimited downside. Take bankruptcy off the table as we have in the case of GME and you have one of two choices--get out or eventually get squeezed out. There is no such thing as infinite ability to roll borrowing forward in real markets, and if your risk models assume that I feel sorry for you.

* **Is this illegal? Will the SEC step in somehow?**

I am not a lawyer. I do not give legal advice. And, honestly, I have no idea. I can't think of any securities regulation that at least I may have violated, but I also don't have the ability to lobby the SEC on international news.

* **So what will happen next?**

I don't know, and most likely anyone who tells you they know is kidding themselves. All I see is a good fundamentals-based position I bought into at a reasonable but bullish valuation followed by the most bullish chart I've ever seen from a TA perspective. I have theories, but there are doubtless other people better qualified to opine on that.

All I can say is if you're in the trade, strap in and prepare for a wild ride. If you're watching from the sidelines get out the popcorn. The rate at which liquidity is disappearing means whatever is going to happen will happen soon (assuming the SEC doesn't step in with an extended pause in trading to bail out the hedge funds).

Thank you for reading, and good luck with your trades.

**\*Update from Original Draft, 1/28 Pre-Market\***

We're seeing tons of retail brokerages limit trading on GME to only allow selling, even when current positions and intended trades would be cash only?

Wow, I mean it kind of occurred to me in some sort of theoretical, abstract sense that somehow limiting large swathes of retail to sell-only was actually better than a general 2-way trading suspension, but who knew the short-side people could actually get retail brokers to do something so bonkers??  I guess you really do find a way to try basically anything when you're about to lose that much money.

If, like me, you're not a hardcore Libertarian, I think this pandemic shows us the \_value\_ of fiat currency and the fed's ability to lift people + companies up during a moment of crisis. Admittedly, some of the printing of money has been used bail out some folks not in need.  It's not perfect.

personalfinance,Paying Capital Gains Taxes &amp; Estimated Tax Payments - Trying to Understand,"I have a question regarding paying estimated tax payments as I've never had to do that before and not sure of when I should be concerned about it. From what I've read, if I expect to owe at least $1000 when I file my taxes for the 2021 year then I need to make estimated payments.

I already filed my tax return for 2020 so using that as a potential example for next year. I made 52k purely off of W2's where my work does the usual withholding. After my deductions 38k was taxable. I've ended up being owed $1.1k on my return.

This year I've made $1k so far on short term capital gains but there has been 0 withholding on it. Is it safe to assume roughly $120 will go to federal taxes and $50 to state (Illinois) if this is all I make all year? That should mean I shouldn't worry about filling out a 1040-ES for the IRS by April. I have no clue how Illinois works at all.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my mortgage with another bank,"Hey I bought a flat in Europe 2,5 years ago. I got a mortgage for 15 years with 15 years fixation. I thought it is good idea to pay debt ASAP, so I chose minimum length I can handle ok from my salary. The effective interest rate is 2,7%.

Currently I can get better interest rates with refinancing, about 1,3% effective, which I definetelly will do. But.

I would like to change to 20 years mortgage length with 15 years fixation.

I asked my current bank, but they just dont allow me to change the contract to 20 years. I tried to persuade them without effect. I dont even get why (why?), they dont explain it. 

They offer me a change to better rate, about 1,3% for 250€ fee. This would sink my monthly payment from 900€ to about 850€ and I would keep the rest period of 12,5 years. Also the fee for this change is low.

But I would really like to pay less monthly:
1. Since interest rates are so low, I dont save much by paying fast and I don't like to stick so much from my salary (2600 €) to the flat.
2. I could save more money, which I could invest. I earned very good on my investments before I got mortgage, I could afford investing back then.
3. Altrough I have emergency fund of 11 000€, I would be less stressed to know, that if I loose job, or if I would like to take time off to travel, I can do it. I am single. Currently my cash flow is just slightly positive and I don't feel good about it. Also I am quite young, 30 years, and I would like to have more cash to just enjoy life.

If I refinance, I have to do it with different bank:
1. closing costs would be about 3000€ and this repulses me, since I see it just like wasted money. I could get same interest with my bank, but I would have to keep the rest period and bigger monthly payments as explained above.
2. I would have monthly payment of about 560€, 20 years period with 15 years fixed. I would have also possibility to pay yearly 10 000€ extra payments without a fee.


What should I do? I can handle 850€ payments if I choose to refinance with my bank and I would have to pay only 12,5 years. But I explained what I don't like about it.
Or should I refinance with other bank despite high closing costs? I would pay less, but I also don't like the perspective of a mortgage for next 20 years. And that closing costs. 

I am a software developer I should never have a problem to find a good paying job. But I still can get sick or something and I worry too much, so having tight budget is stressing me a bit.

personalfinance,Credit Card Payment Plan VS Big Payoff from Fed. Return? Advice Needed.,"I'm a very new adult (M23) on my own with my finances for the first time and have two options to attack my 2400 balance on a credit card.

Due to not being able to work last year (i work in entertainment) and having to use my credit card more for things, my balance grew and I'm trying to get in under control. Thankfully, I found a job doing some contract work, but unfortunately, my current salary really only covers my rent+bills with only about 100 dollars left over for food and anything else. I've also had to considerably drain my savings and am down to about 1800 to my name in savings accounts. It's tight, but manageable for the time being. But that means I don't have cash left over for credit card payments.

My credit card company has told me I qualify for a ""Short Term Financial Relief Program"" that offers up to 12 months of assistance. Here's what the company representative told me about the program:

&gt;The APR on any Pay Over Time balance or on balances on Cards with a Credit Limit will be a maximum of 5.99% for 12 months.  
Your total monthly payments will be $42.00. You can always pay more. Enrollment will require first payment of $42.00 to be made today.  
While you are enrolled, we will not charge you late payment fees and annual membership fees (if applicable).  
If you have a Credit Card, your limit will be reduced, unless you’re over your limit.  A monthly spending limit will be applied on Charge Cards and adjusted periodically while you’re in the Program.  You can generally spend up to the amount of your monthly payment unless the balance is near, at, or over your limit.  
Reductions in your credit limits on Personal Credit Card accounts, may have an impact on your credit bureau score.  
Prescheduled automatic payments are required for Program enrollments.  
If your accounts are current, you will be able to spend, within a limit.  
If you’re being reported to the credit bureaus and make your payments on time, your account will continue to be reported as current if it's current now. Or if it's past due now, it will not be reported as further past due.  
Interest will be billed base on the balance at 5.99% APR.

Now, correct me if I'm wrong, this sounds like a high interest rate, so will I end up paying more money in the long run? And to be honest, I don't see how 42 dollars a month gets me to 2400 in 12 months. I'm bad at math, but not that bad... Does the payment plan, if I make higher than $42 payments a month boost my credit score?

Option number two I have is using my tax refund and stimulus payments. I am getting my 1800 dollar stimulus payments with my tax return as I didn't receive them with everyone else due to a name change issue. According to turbotax, i should be receiving $2640 from the IRS.

**Now my question for reddit is: Is there any benefit in doing a payment plan and putting my return into my savings/small safe investments in case of emergency? Or should I rid myself entirely of my credit card debt in one go? Any advice at all is greatly appreciated.**",finance

I will be in school fulltime afterwards until December. My current salary is 30k pre-tax for the half year. I just got my first semi-monthly paycheck, and I am pretty sure my job is withholding federal tax at the standards of a 60k/year salary. However, I am going back to school in July and am 100% sure I will not work after July for the rest of 2021. Therefore, my annual salary this year will be around 30k and to my knowledge, I am overpaying taxes now if my taxes are being withheld according to the 60k/yr bracket.

I know technically I can pay the higher taxes (60k/yr salary taxes) and receive tax returns early next year. However, I will be taking out student loans at the grad level interest rate (5.3%) starting July, and would like to avoid as much loans w/interest upfront as possible in July and not rely on tax returns early next year, even if it means only avoiding 1k or 2k of taxes.",finance

I attended therapy and received medication through the school but made no progress, and I can't afford other private therapists.

Now about a year later, I'm still left with the credit status of a sophomore and a GPA of 1.23.

I can't raise my GPA to the 2.0 minimum for federal aid without taking more classes, but I have no way of paying for them. I've applied for private loans but being 21 with minimal credit to my name I'm not approved, and I don't have anyone willing to cosign, so that's not an option either.

I can't see any other option than to drop out of my current school, as even part time tuition is 10k+ and the most I can personally get a loan for is around 5k. I'm thinking my best option is to start job hunting, I have a decent resume with 3yrs retail work and 2yrs in a summer camp director position. Maybe I can work and return to school, but I believe my old federal loans will start needing to be repaid 6 months after I drop out, so I kind of doubt I would ever be able to return to getting my degree, at least not for a couple years. I'm kind of just stuck here and I would like to know if there's anything else for someone with a low GPA, no money, and no cosigners to do here.

wallstreet,SEC Letter format for adjusting policies,"Hey Guys, so I thought I'd share this letter here so you can all spam the SEC on their policies and what brokerages can get away with now that there's so much attention on the market and activity. Feel free to adjust the letter and spam to [rule-comments@sec.gov](mailto:rule-comments@sec.gov) and put the subject as day trading rules. These are what I personally feel would help, but the main thing is we should have access to the market as we see fit:

Dear Commissioners of The SEC and Chairwoman Allison Herren Lee:

I will first provide the substance of the pattern day trader rule:

Anyone who buys and sells a particular security in the same trader day (day trades), and does this four or more times in any five consecutive business day period is considered a pattern day trader. A pattern day trader is subject to special rules. The main rule is that in order to engage in pattern day trading you must maintain an equity balance of at least $25,000 in a margin account. If you are flagged as a pattern day trader and do not maintain a balance of $25,000 your account will be frozen for 90 days. 

As a citizen of the United States of America, I am petitioning for the repeal or amendment of the pattern day trader rule. The rule, which is designed to protect unsophisticated investors from the high risk of day trading, is instead increasing risk by limiting the number of stop positions one can take, driving traders to more volatile markets such as futures and forex where no pattern day trader rules exist, and driving traders into offshore brokerages who do not adhere to the SEC pattern day trader regulations.

Additionally, this regulation among others is contributing to a divide in this country on who can utilize and invest in the stock market. Due to this tension the gap between the lower, middle and upper classes continues to grow as Day Traders also can utilize technology and programs to automatically buy and sell shares to secure a profit. As Americans, we should have the right to purchase and sell on the market to allow it to grow so we may also profit as desired and re-invest this profit into our economy. 

Most recently on the social media platform Reddit, users gathered on this forum together to purchase shares of GameStop Corp. (GME) and caused the price of shares to grow by 3700% which allowed users to secure a profit that they will invest in the economy. While I understand the basis for this rule, it does not protect investors anymore with the evolution of communication technology. As shown recently after gaining a profit, several applications that offer free trading were forced to remove Gamestop Corp(GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings INC (AMC) and void all orders placed on the previous day. This further demonstrates that the market is not about providing investors the opportunity to grow their income by investing as multiple brokers have removed the Reddit Markets from their platform and have expressed dissatisfaction and seek to file a complaint with the SEC about users communicating on forums and purchasing shares or seeking legal action. As of now, if one user has thousands of followers and posts a stock symbol each user is free to decide if they will invest, similar to those with subscriptions to Yahoo Finance, The Motley Fool or a Bloomberg Subscription and their stock recommendations. The driving force behind this decision was to spite a hedge fund seeking to make a profit which furthers the evidence of the growing disparity between the lower, middle and upper classes.

Additionally, If I open an account on multiple brokers, the highest risk is opening a margin with an account which is what can drive an individual into debt. As of now, if I sought to gamble, I can seek out the nearest Casino or Casino Cruise in the State of Florida to secure a profit with any amount of money and there is no policy in place to prevent me aside from being over the age of 18 and nor should there be. As I have worked to earn the money, I should have the right to spend or invest the money as I see fit without restriction. 

I propose the following actions to fix the problems with the current disparities in the market caused by NASD Rule 2520, create a truly fair market and address the risk to investors on the stock market. 

1) Repeal Rule 2520 and allow all traders to day-trade online and if platforms offer a program for automatically trading or application programming interface (API), they must fill out a form acknowledging they understand the risks they are taking.

2) Create new federal guidelines for Margins to be treated like a credit line where rather than based on leverage such as 1:10 it will be a fixed line of credit in the account minimizing the risk determined by the financial institution and based on creditworthiness. 

3) Institute a policy where brokerages cannot restrict the sale of any stock without first filing a notice to the SEC and allowing the Trade day to close and 2 business days to elapse and must publicly provide justification for removal from the market. 

I thank you for the time to review my email and hope you’ll consider the aforementioned actions, as this would be in the best interest of truly having a fair market while protecting our citizens and allowing them the opportunity to invest at their discretion.

Thank You,

stocks,Delta 9 (TSX $DN) ~5-8% short term opportunities,"**TL;DR**

**Delta 9 Cannabis** is a Canadian producer, cultivator and retailer. They have been trading on the TSX between $0.49 - $0.65 CAD over the last few months with a pattern of dips and rises in stock price of ~5-8%. The trade volume is relatively low. I have been buying in around $0.50 and seeing 5% returns in a few weeks, selling and waiting to buy the dip again. Prior to the pandemic. And since. In the Spring, the price dropped around the $0.40 mark. This isn't a huge play nor a long term buy. But its a quick 5% turn around. As of today, $DN is at $0.49.

**Background**
Delta 9 is one of Canada's oldest regulated grower. Prior to legalization, they held a growing license through Health Canada for Medical Cannabis in March 2014. These guys have been players in the game years before pot stocks were even on our radar. 

On December 4, 2019, Health Canada amended their Cannabis license to allow the Company to sell cannabis oils, extracts and derivative products in addition to the previously granted license for standard cultivation and license for sale for medical purposes. On February 16, 2018, the Manitoba government had awarded a license to legally retail recreational cannabis in the province to a consortium consisting of the Company and Canopy Growth Corporation. Recreational
cannabis was legalized on October 17, 2018.

**Current/Recent Production and Future Growth**
Like I said, I'm not touting this as a long term hold just yet. But its worth noting they look promising.

In Spring 2020. Delta 9 continued to invest inwards and increased its growing capacity to 25,000kg/year. (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/13/2015284/0/en/Delta-9-Receives-Approval-from-Health-Canada-for-Expansion-to-Processing-Area.html). 

Its market footprint is still relatively small compared to the other players in the game. Hence the stock price. 

**Phase II Expansion**

The Company is now working to expand its Health Canada licensed cannabis production perimeter to include additional buildings at its licensed production facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba (the “Delta Facility”) which will bring the total licensed square footage to approximately 135,000 square feet, from 80,000 square feet currently licensed by Health Canada. The Company anticipates there will be no cost to this licensed area expansion

Of note, they paused the expansion when COVID hit to focus on their current production capabilities. 

Delta 9 received approval from Health Canada for sales of cannabis oil products. They have already completed production of several initial batches of its “Odyssey” and “Oasis” lines of ingestible oils and will proceed with sales of these products in the medical and recreational use cannabis markets.

 
**Pre-Rolls**

In June this year they launched the “Bliss” line of pre-rolled cannabis products, which consist of blended cannabis flower, rolled in a cigarette format, or “joint”, for sale in the medical and recreational use cannabis markets. To date the Company has produced and sold over 75,000 cannabis pre-rolls.
 
“It is management’s belief that these products will become an increasingly important component of the medical and recreational use cannabis markets in the future.” said John Arbuthnot, Chief Executive Officer of Delta 9. “A continually expanding line of high-quality cannabis products is a major goal for the Company over this year and this is the first of what we hope are several milestones in our progress.”
 

**Products for Future Development**

Nanosphere Evolve Products
Delta 9 has acquired an exclusive license in Canada to manufacture and sell products made with the patented technology of Nanosphere Health Sciences Inc. (“NanoSphere”) for the delivery of cannabinoids via nanoparticle technology. The two companies are in the process of developing the first product for Canada; an intraoral cannabis oil containing cannabinoid nanoparticles.
 
The NanoSphere delivery system for cannabis works by nano-encapsulating active ingredients in phospholipid membranes for transportation through the skin and mucosa into the bloodstream within minutes. Cannabis applications of the technology include transdermal viscous gels, intranasal products and intraoral products, all of which provide rapid results, precise dosages and high bioavailability. The NanoSphere delivery system of cannabis can eliminate the need for inhalation or ingestion of cannabis, offering users a potentially safer and more effective method of consumption.

 
**Dried Sift Cannabis**

The Company is currently developing its “Sapphire” line of dried sift cannabis products for the recreational cannabis market which involves sifting the Company’s blended products and refining them, leaving more of the high potency resin glands and less of the low potency plant material. The final product is a yellow/brownish powder and has a potency that is up to triple that of the whole flower dried cannabis materials. The Company plans to release dried sift products in the recreational cannabis market in the third quarter of 2019. Management expects that retail pricing for these products will be up to $30 per gram.
 
Oils, Extracts, and Derivative Products
The Company continues to develop and expand its in-house oils production capacity and is working with partners regarding its strategy for new cannabis extracts and derivative products once the federal government finalizes its expanded extract regulations, which are expected to become effective in 2019. *(These were updated and expanded in June 2019. https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2019/06/health-canada-finalizes-regulations-for-the-production-and-sale-of-edible-cannabis-cannabis-extracts-and-cannabis-topicals.html)*",finance
personalfinance,Wife accidentally claimed Exempt on 2020 W4. Will just paying the taxes we owe take care of everything?,"Hey PF,

I started doing my wife's and my taxes yesterday - this is only our second year filing jointly. I noticed her federal income tax withheld was extremely low, and that's when we realized she must have accidentally claimed 'Exempt' for 2020 when filling out her W4 last year. Her company made everyone update their W4s last year online and claiming exempt is just a simple check box, which she must have accidentally clicked. It coincided with us getting married, combining our bank accounts, and her getting a raise, so neither of us really paid attention to her pay stubs during 2020.

Anyways, when I entered my W2 info into FreeTaxUSA, it was estimating that we'd get some money back. After I entered her info, it is now estimating we owe $7K. Obviously this was not ideal to see, but luckily we are able to cover that. My question is: After we pay that amount are we good to go? Or should we expect any inquiries or something from the IRS? We are also in the process of closing on a house, so hoping this doesn't slow down our lending or add any complication (we're newer to this stuff, not sure how it affects each other).

Thanks for any advice!",finance

stocks,Open three brokerage accounts. Mitigate counterparty risk.,"Today was a lesson in counterparty risk. 

When evaluating any investment I determine how much it is worth to me by evaluating three specific types of risks:

\-Idiosyncratic risk- factors specific to your security. For example, if the company performs well the stock should do well and if the company performs poorly the stock should do poorly) 

\-Systemic risk- factors that affect basically everything you could choose to invest in. For example, if the fed raises interest rates equity prices should fall which means that  even if the company you chose performed well it is still possible for you to take a loss.

\-Liquidity risk- if trade volumes grind to a halt for whatever reason you may need to \*pay\* more cash (ie. accept a lower price) when selling 

&amp;#x200B;

It is important to note, however, that my ability to realize the value of my position is dependent on how I handle counterparty risk. Although it is infrequent, there is always the risk that my brokerage/bank/girlfriend won't perform as expected. One way I try to hedge that risk is by maintaining redundant brokerage accounts with multiple institutions. Going forward, I hope everyone else will do so as well.",finance

personalfinance,"roth vs not, 403b (or 401k or IRA)","I'm aware of the difference, i'm more curious others' thoughts on what i should do right now, given my situation. **TLDR at the bottom.**

i worked for a while making $80k, and at the time, I maxed out my company's Roth 401k plus a Roth IRA (the logic at the time was that this meant i could sock more away. a 24k/y limit with all taxes paid, is more money invested than 24k/y pre-tax. i also like that you can basically get the money out ""whenever"" penalty free (5 years, instead of ""when you're an old coot""), so it's slightly more ""liquid"". although i know that's not an advisable strategy).

i've since done a little more reading, realized that may have been a mistake(?), and the reason most folks tend to do non-roth is that in retirement, you tend to ""make less"" (pulling what you need to live from retirement accounts) so your taxes are lower. but oh well. There's also an argument for doing a little of each: your ""tax bracket"" is only whatever you pull out of your non-roth accounts! so pull half and half and boom, you only pay taxes at the lowest brackets. 

so now, i'm making $40k/y (career path change, for the betterment of humanity and my own mental health), and i recently discovered that my employer offers a roth or regular 403b (it's the non-profit equivalent of a 401k), and i might as well max that out and live off savings (i also have 3y living expenses collecting dust in a savings account). 

but which should i go with, roth or not? arguably *now* I have a low income (lowest it will ever be?), so paying taxes on shit now makes sense. and i'd still be interested in maxing it out (to the ""higher effective"" roth cap). *but*, maybe i should consider the ""mixed"" approach instead, and maybe i doofed it up before, but now i should start a regular account instead of roth?

**TLDR**: used to make 80k and maxed out a roth 401k+IRA, but i guess a mix of both is better. i now make 40k and want to live off savings and keep maxing 'em out. should i start up regular (start mixing), or keep going with roth (lower income nowadays)?

* Remove subsidies from fossil fuel companies (potentially huge impact on fuel companies, drillers, refiners, car companies, and more depending on what subsidies are targeted)

* Redirect fossil fuel subsidies to clean energy initiatives and to incentivize green companies (great news for renewable energy companies, possible help for solar companies and installers?)

* Pause new oil/gas drilling leases (negative impact to fossil fuel drillers, and fossil fuel exploration)

* Massive grid improvements to deal with new sources of industry (utility plays here? Durable equipment plays for things like transformers?)

* Double offshore wind energy production by 2030 (wind energy play)

* A new civilian climate corps to help with cleaning forests, waterways (potentially good for fishery and forestry plays)

Forex,Why I chose Forex and why I’ve stayed with it.,"Although I think this debate is better heard on a stock sub, recent events on the NYSE do raise a couple of interesting issues. 

As much as I’ve been highly amused by the ‘David and Goliath’ nature of recent allegations of manipulation involving WSB and other stock/option groups, this doesn’t remotely concern me as a long-standing forex retailer. Not once in my entire life, for example, can I recall (as I said on WSB) a BBC finance journalist **laughing on air** while describing the GameStop saga during a live report on the BBC World Service- the busiest radio station on earth, listened to by a couple of hundred million people all over the world. It’s interesting, it’s definitely great entertainment, but it doesn’t worry me.

One of the absolute blessings of trading forex is **precisely** the fact that *retail forex traders have virtually zero impact on price*. I would go so far as to say that it’s the **Number One** reason I favour this market above all others. 

I invested in the stock market from about the age of 21 till I was 36, so let’s say roughly fifteen years. For the last six years of that I slowly started shifting more and more of my equity into forex until I had almost no stock positions left. Mostly medium-term holds for about 10% ROI per annum. Which was fine- I was young and just wanted stable growth. Plus I was doing fine working for Morgan’s and had no desire to complicate life. I still hold a small portfolio of positions on “the Four Horsemen” and other major bluechips and I’ve no intention of touching them- it’s risen in value quite nicely and has rode out the various dips. In that time I saw countless manipulations of stock prices, dozens upon dozens of short squeezes, along with ridiculous overvaluations and horrendous undervaluations. The whole thing became utterly tedious and I decided to drop it entirely. Not because I have any lack of faith in the long-term growth of the stock market but because I literally didn’t have time to juggle the damage being done to perfectly good companies by utterly external factors. It just got on my nerves. Far too many great firms also simply became slaves to the share price instead of concentrating on fundamental business structure. Same old story: Company X becomes the new Golden Child, a massive round of funding starts up, in come the suits, up goes the valuation. Then two years later Company X has become another stagnant, bored, fed up firm going nowhere now at the mercy of The Board and its controlling votes. 

The online retail share market has boomed since I first bought stocks 20 years ago, but I don’t have the patience to work through hundreds of reports again just to back a firm that is then nailed by some fund trying to make a quick profit through devious bullshit. 

Forex, meanwhile, has one long-term reality: the supply of, and demand for, a stable nation’s currency will be driven by factors that no bank or firm can fight without incurring tremendous risk and even larger losses. They might be able to inflict short- to medium-term damage or inflate a currency for a little daily profit, but in the long-haul a currency is worth what hundreds of millions or even billions of individual citizens say it’s worth. If shrewd central bank monetary policy in the EU creates conditions in which that economy experiences five years of growth there’s nothing a commercial or investment bank can do to stop it. And if they try, they’ll get crucified by governments whose entire national life depends on the value of their currency. 

In essence, the situation in forex is this: UK Plc has a board of directors: the UK government. It has 66 million main voting shareholders: its electorate. If the Board fucks up it faces removal at an election which will cost its directors both their jobs and their income and their reputation. Parties that screw up a currency have a tendency to be out in the wilderness for a very long time. So they take it seriously. Do governments get it wrong? Sometimes. Do they get it wrong on a regular basis? Absolutely not. 

In that equation, I don’t want retailers having a say any more than I want banks having a say. Just look at the average losses among retailers- upwards of 80% losing their money because they don’t have a clue how the global economy operates; incapable in most cases of spotting something as simple as a momentum shift, favouring quick trades with little rationale beyond short-term technical levels (perfectly legitimate and I do it all the time). But is that how I want the value of my entire economy to be managed? No. Do I want people like me controlling my currency’s value? No. 

The US financial markets are corrupt as hell, and anybody who wants to watch a riveting and absolutely shocking documentary about the corruption that links the Fed and White House and Wall Street **must** watch the documentary **Inside Job**. If you haven’t seen it then get it and watch it. Successive US administrations from *both* major US parties have not only failed to deal with the dire lack of rigorous protections but have actually made the situation worse. The 2008 crisis didn’t just cost people some cash, it wiped out millions of pensions and put millions of people on the streets and caused an unknown number of suicides which ripped the heart out of tens of thousands of families. How many high-ranking Wall Street directors were jailed? **None**. 

The power of Wall Street lobbies is now terrifying, but what does Washington continue to do? It gives jobs to people who should be in jail. This isn’t hyperbole; a lot of the individuals who’ve acted as cabinet advisers and technicians in the Fed should’ve been handed prison sentences but instead got immunity and government jobs. 

Forex is an imperfect market, but I’d rather speculate in a rational field than invest in companies which are flattened by hedge funds which don’t give a crap what happens to those companies as long as they earn 2% off of someone else’s misery. Do commercial banks piss about in the lower forex timeframes and take a nice slice of the action? Yes. I worked in one of the largest banks for long enough to know that what goes on behind closed doors among money market traders and analysts skirts the edge of legality on a regular basis. But can they do to the Pound or dollar or euro what hedge funds do to firms on a daily basis? No. 

Remember folks: “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent” (Keynes). Bank your small profits on forex and aim for long-term growth.",finance

stocks,All banks have to do to counter the retail frenzy is suspend the short borrowing rate,"The incentive for shorts to cover is the high interest rate - as time goes on, they have to pay interest on the shares they borrow. 


If banks perceive the retail hype as a threat to the hedge funds they back, it would be within their interest to protect said funds. The big threat to funds is obviously having to cover their short positions and cause the GME price to spike - so by removing the interest rate hedge funds are under no pressure to cover. No time pressure means they can cover as retail loses interest, whether it's in one week or one year. They might have lost billions on paper, but all they need to do is lie low and there will be little to worry about.


It was reported many hedge funds actually increased their short position, which makes sense and means they could actually end up on top after all of this ends. Retail interest is going to wane and having no incentive to cover means these hedge funds can just ride it out.


What do you think of my hypothesis? It seems like banks are going to make money no matter what (by owning GME shares, lending shares to short sellers, and backing hedge funds potentially).",finance

personalfinance,Any Downside to 0% APR Balance Transfer?,"My credit card company is offering to give me a check up to my credit limit at 0% APR but charging a 2% origination fee.

I have seen similar offers before, but always ignored them because frankly they sucked.

The first offer was 6 months APR with a 4% origination fee. That's just 8% interest. Like, that blows, I'm never gonna do that.

But now they're offering me 18 months at 0% interest with only a 2% origination fee. So, effectively, the origination fee is less than inflation. I don't really have any debt to speak of, pay my credit card balance off at the end of every month, etc. but to me this SEEMS like being loaned money at less than inflation. My plan would be to transfer myself a check for whatever amount, let's say 10k, and invest it in a large cap index fund like SPY. The dividend yield alone is almost equal to the origination fee.

Is there a downside I'm missing? Obviously I know that after 18 months they jack up the interest rate to epic proportions, but I'd just sell the stock, repay the balance, and pocket the difference. As long as I earn inflation I make a profit.

Is there some sort of hidden gimmick I'm not seeing here? Or are they literally just hoping I let the balance go past 18 months?",finance

Markets have been doing pretty well lately, so it's been harder for me to figure out where to place my investments. I think I might have too much in cash since interest rates are really low right now. I've been thinking about transferring more to investments (60/40 or maybe 70/30?). But I'm also wary of the coming of the bear market - there's too much hype around the markets right now, and people left and right are investing. Isn't this usually a warning sign of the end of a bull market? Perhaps things may be different now since interest rates don't seem like they'll change any time soon, so the market is probably the best place to put your money right now.

Are there other places I can let my money grow in? I think bonds are pretty low right now, and I do have some money in a bond fund. I'd be okay with CDs, but interest rates there are also super low.

personalfinance,Could use advice on refinancing our home.,"So my wife and I bought are house two years ago for $290,000 with an FHA loan and we've been working on refinancing to a conventional loan to get out of PMI and get a better interest rate.

The problem is I missed a student loan payment when I got layed off in March (I know I know, but we got it back to current in 30 days after unemployment came through after a few weeks of battling to get it from our state and we had our first baby in April.) Unfortunately, that impacted my credit score significantly to the point where we'd be better off refinancing with only my wife on the loan (although I remain on the title).

Is this worth it? Our broker thinks our house will appraise between $360,000-$380,000 based on the market and estimates we'll save $400 a month with just my wife refinancing. But is this worth it? Will I be at any major disadvantages not being on the mortgage?

A semi-valid point but in this case a centralized entity (Robinhood) not only moved the goalposts when they didn’t like the score, they prevented the other team from taking the field while the game was still being played.

If the Feds froze GME or AMC and no one could trade them, that would be one thing. This move literally just screwed the little guys so that Wall Street could reposition itself without interference.

So I was sure that this corrected W-2 wouldn't financially hurt me, but it would be inconvenient for me to try to amend my return or whatever I might have to do. Anyway, after downloading the corrected W-2 and comparing it side by side with the original, the only difference I can see on there is box 14 now contains a small amount that I donated out of my paycheck to a nonprofit. We did a thing earlier in the year wear you could have up to $30 withheld out of your paycheck to donate and the company would match it 100%. I did it because it was just a small kind gesture. I guess I could try to claim this on my tax return, but I don't really care. It was only $30, so it's not worth the hassle to me. My question is, am I obligated to provide my corrected W-2?",finance

personalfinance,How do I accurately calculate my wife and I's necessary withholding for California income tax?,"I posted yesterday about some mistakes that my wife and I made last year with regards to withholding, both federally and for California. Notably, my wife was accidentally marked as exempt from California state income tax on her DE-4 form.

We noticed this yesterday after she has already received 2 paychecks in 2021 with $0 California state income tax withheld. We paid our unpaid taxes when we filed yesterday and have fixed her DE-4 form as far as unchecking that box, but now we need to withhold enough for the rest of the year to make up for those two missed paychecks and ultimately cover our full tax burden.

***How do I calculate our California state income tax burden for 2021?*** I have not been able to find a nice calculator like the federal W4 calculator that the IRS provides. My understanding is that I need to calculate the total amount that has been withheld thus far, subtract that from our total tax burden, and then possibly add additional withholding on top of what is being withheld now.

* We both work and are filing jointly.
* I am claiming 2 state allowances for both of us.
* She is claiming 0 state allowances.
* At the moment, neither of us are withholding anything additional in state income tax.

Another quick question: **will we owe an underpayment penalty to California if we paid what we owed when we filed?** From what I'm reading, we just have to pay by the due date of April 15th, 2021, which we already have. FreeTaxUSA did not indicate that we will owe any penalties but I am not sure if it calculates that.

personalfinance,Advice for Rebuilding Terribleeee Credit,"Hey everyone, long time lurker, first time poster. I really want to start rebuilding my credit but I don’t know where to start. My score is currently in the low 500’s and there’s not a single positive thing on my report. I’m 25 years old and have basically been a negligent credit-user since I was a teen. I will hopefully be getting a new job soon where I’ll be making enough money that I can a commit a few hundred dollars each month to pay things down if that’s the best course of action. 

The only open accounts I have are my student loans, which I actually pay monthly. I have private loans through Sallie Mae ($1400/month) and federal ($100/month). 

Everything else is a charge off. I’ll start with the largest. 

VW Credit: 14k
This one is my biggest and scariest, and most complicated. Last payment was made in 2017, but VW never repossessed the car. I drive it daily. I have received letters from collection agencies regarding this matter offering to settle for around 50%. Should I attempt to go this route? Set a payment plan with the collection agency and pay it down? Does the collection agency have the title in this scenario and if I paid them would I receive the title? What confuses me is that the balance still shows up on the credit report under VW as owed, not under a CA.

Discover: 1k 
Last paid 2018. This is another one that has been charged off, and I have received settlement offers from collections agencies, but still shows a balance owed under DISC on the credit report, no collection agency is listed. Should I try a pay for delete with the collection agency?

Credit One: $600
Last paid 2018. Doesn’t show on credit report, but does show as a collection item for CA on credit report.

Any advise you saints could give would be greatly appreciate, I seriously want to set myself up for a better future and I know the first step is asking for help. Any other advise for also rebuilding credit is also welcome, I have a read up a bit on things like secured credit cards but I’m not sure if I should try to take care of the negatives first.

stocks,Sign The Petition: Retail Investors Demand Market Transparency! Make the Hedge Funds report their Shorts!,"**Sign the petition here: https://www.change.org/sec-amend-13-f**


Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know its published with a 1 month delay? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data that gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**


*Question 41
Q: What about short positions?
A: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.*

Most financial problems we have as a society stem from the government making the same mistakes. Instead of saying ""my bad"", they double down, triple down, and will keep doing it. We haven't even STARTED with the money printing. It will blow us away.

Here's a nice example: during the pandemic I agree with no home foreclosures. This means that people that got into financial trouble would not have to sell their house. This means that price pressure would be non existent, and prices would stay pretty high. But was that enough? No. Not only did rates have to go super low (I get this), but the Fed had to buy 1/3 of the mortgages. The result: huge swing up in prices. Do I believe that housing is a bubble? NO. Payments are very low. 

The bubble is not here yet. Over the next 6 months you will see a ton of people buy houses out of fear that they will be left out. And then, in 8 months, many of the people who haven't been paying will have to find a solution.

Guess what I think will happen? Yep, you know it. An additional drop in rates. 

The reason I decided to buy bitcoin is that I've come to terms that the government has inherited a corrupt, fucked system. Inflation is the least painful way out, but it is going to be very painful.

For all the people obsessed with bitcoin's price-here's how I dealt with it.

What is bitcoin? A system not controlled by a govt with a fixed supply that I'm comfortable with.

What does it compete with? Gold.

Do I think it's better than gold? yes

Do I think the demand will be bigger than gold? in my lifetime, yes

Do I think gold is going up? yes

What is the current value of bitcoin relative to gold? 1/18th or so.

Are they going to make more bitcoin? 11% left. Might find some lost keys

How about gold? Yup, a lot more will be mined.

What happened today? Corruption in plain view. A warning sign.",cryptocurrency

I live in a house with my BF that we co-own. Recently some health issues have come up with his lungs that have caused him to go on long-term disability for the foreseeable future. This means his monthly take home went from about 2700 to 2000 a month.

While i've been helping cover any shortfalls for a while now i just keep re-running his budget and if we get the car loan paid off it's going to make his life a lot easier.

stocks,Stock Market News for Today | GM / SQ / UBER | The Short Squeeze &amp; other Stock Market News [01-29],"**Stocks bounce back after Wednesday’s sell-off. GM, Square &amp; Uber rise while the stock market is still focused on the big short squeeze. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market having a bounce back day after the Wednesday sell-off, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/B6BpyXY) gaining 300 points, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/NpK8M1k) rising by almost 1% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QmbLhTF) adding 0.50%. Meanwhile the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n05j6wj) plunged almost 20%, but remains at very high levels above 30… so, really anything can still happen right now with such high volatility in the markets

We saw almost 60% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/mCmXv61) on average volume, with the number of companies above the 50-day moving average remaining pretty much the same as all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/r0jQrf5) finished in the green with Financials, Materials &amp; Industrials leading the way as Large-Cap Value plays [were](https://ibb.co/Zxc7tc4) mostly the flavor of the day, while small-caps lagged behind.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PQZxbwB) from yesterday, where we can see a big wall of green with a few exception in the big names that reported earnings the night before, with Apple which reported all-time record revenues and crushed estimates, Facebook that also delivered a solid beat and announced future buybacks &amp; Tesla which did miss on earnings but delivered another solid revenue growth for the quarter, losing more than 2.5% for the day, while Microsoft continued to march forward after a spectacular quarter alongside most of the other big companies.

We have seen a big shift in [stock](https://ibb.co/qRxktps) performance after earnings results, with most companies overdelivering in EPS &amp; revenues, but underperforming significantly afterwards, with the avg 1-day performance being almost a negative 2%, as we haven’t seen a negative 1-day performance since the end of the dot com bubble. I think the one big difference now is that most stocks have actually delivered great earnings and are profitable, but they are suffering from big run-ups from pre-earnings trading in a buy the news &amp; sell the event set-up. So, I believe now is not the time to chase earnings reports, stay invested for the long-term and you will benefit from great companies.

In terms of economic data, we saw the 4th quarter [GDP](https://ibb.co/86mVKsN) coming in at a 4% annualized growth, slightly lower than the 4.1% expected, as the economic recovery is still ongoing, but the rate of growth has significantly slowed down from the 33.40% we saw in the 3rd quarter.

We also saw jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/4Z8VBVj) yesterday coming in a little better than expected, dropping to 847K as the continuing jobless claims also dropped to 4.77M while the Kansas [FED](https://ibb.co/sQwLJNV) and the [retail](https://ibb.co/6JDDPw8) inventories came in better than the previous month.

On the other hand, we saw the new home [sales](https://ibb.co/0nMhSSz) rising by only 1.6%, less than expected but are still up over 15% year/year, while [wholesale](https://ibb.co/2kYz2WH) oinventories rose less than expected and the December leading [indicators](https://ibb.co/B2YRRZS) came in-line with the expectations.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Square](https://ibb.co/BtrN0QH) jumping more than 8% as Retail Investors turned to their Cash app to trade stocks that have been blocked by numerous trading platforms. I think Square has become a very good play on both the digital currencies &amp; stock trading, though they still have a lot of work to do to grow into their valuation.

We also saw [UBER](https://ibb.co/vPHDw3p) jumping more than 7% after Morgan Stanley pitched the company based on better-than-expected EBITDA for 2021, future disclosures on Uber Eats and the company being a very good re-opening play as their customers seem to have a healthy balance sheet that will allow them to spend a lot of money once the world re-opens. I also like &amp; own Uber as a good re-opening play, while Uber Eats also makes them a good stay-at-home stock, so a win-win.

Meanwhile, [GM](https://ibb.co/CMqQF70) announced they are planning to be carbon neutral by 2040 as they are planning to go all-electric by 2035 while planning to use 100% renewable energy to power their facilities by 2030 in the US. GM seems to be a very good play on the EV market, not only Tesla &amp; NIO, as they are also planning to bring to the market their Ultium platform by 2025, and I believe with their Cruise venture, [GM](https://ibb.co/k3TpZ56) has a lot of room to run up in the next years.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US Futures are pointing to a red open with the Nasdaq futures down more than 1.6% and are set for the worst performance since late [October](https://ibb.co/L8hQHH0) as we [await](https://ibb.co/rMmF3RL) to get the Consumer Sentiment Index, a couple of other economic numbers &amp; some FED speakers later in the day while the world is still on pause watching the short squeezed stocks developments with some of the trading [platforms](https://ibb.co/BT7V52k) planning to resume buying capacity on the stocks that have been the headlines of the year until now. One simple advice I’d give everyone, watch out and don’t be the last bag holder remaining, do take some profits by at least taking your cost basis out, because no one really knows when this will end or if and big players like the SEC will come down with restrictions or who knows what other measures.

personalfinance,Mortgage refinance opinions,"Hi everyone,

My fiance and I started the process of looking into refinancing our home. I am on the fence of what to do. Our current mortgage is $143,455 left ($152K) at 4.5% 30 yr. Mortgage started 10/1/2018. We have our taxes and fees built into our payment for a total of $1368. 

I was hoping our home appraised for more, due to what similar houses on our street have sold for. The same model house 3 houses down sold for $178k. Our home was completly updated by previous owner when we bought. The mortgage broker did not send an appraiser, instead only ran comps. Our appraisal came back at $165k. 

We can lock into 2.875% for 30 yr again ($645.89 monthly principal &amp; interest). The broker included all closing costs into the new loan. Which we would do, since we're paying for our wedding later this year. So we want to keep as much cash as possible. Now to what concerns me. Here are the details of new mortgage:

House balance - $143,455
Estimated pre-paid items (new escrow) - $5,111.92
Estimated closing costs - $4,543
PMI,MIP - $2,677.50
TOTAL - $155,787.42

Our current escrow acct is non-transferable, so we would get a check for roughly $4,000. We could take this and apply it to the new mortgage. New monthly payment would be $1,225.

I was hoping the appraisal would be higher to be able to remove PMI. However that is not the case. So our new terms would be higher mortgage balance, back to 30yr, but with lower interest by a significant amount, and lower payment. I don't like how we're kinda losing equity. We definitely don't see ourselves living in this house for long term. 

My thoughts are to pass on refinancing at this time. Maybe wait until we can remove PMI for good, which should be later this year or early next. It seems silly to give up equity and essentially start our mortgage over to save $35k in interest over the lifetime of the loan for a house we most likely won't be in the next 5-7 years. I may ask the broker the run numbers on a 25 yr, but that still doesn't solve my concerns. With the feds keeping rates low and keeping their level of asset purchases, the 10 year should stay relatively low in the near term. 

What are your opinions on this?",finance

investing,An explanation of why @RobinhoodApp non-nefariously restricted trading,"[update:  here's another way to start to understand this situation if what's written below is too dense  
Anthony Denier, CEO of Webull on the Robinhood/GameStop situation  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM]  

This explanation is from Silent Cal @KralcTrebor

https://twitter.com/KralcTrebor/status/1354952686165225478

Ok - here's my best explanation of why @RobinhoodApp restricted trading in the short-squeeze stocks.

Spoiler: the story isn't the Ken Griffen called Janet Yellen who instructed DTCC to raise margin on Robinhood to force them to shut down the speculative buying.

Here goes ...

Robinhood (RH) is a broker. They don't execute stock orders themselves. They sign up customers, route their orders to executing brokers, and keep track of who owns what. RH is also its own clearing broker, so they directly settle and custody their clients' securities.

Yes, RH is paid by Citadel to handle executing some of its order flow. This isn't as nefarious as it sounds - Citadel Equity Securities is paying to execute retail orders because they aren't pernicious (like having 500x the size behind them).

RH customers buy and sell stocks. Those trades don't settle (settle = closing, the exchange of cash for security) until T+2, two days later. Depending on the net of buys/sells, RH is on the hook to pay or recieve that net cash. That's credit risk.

NSCC is the entity that takes that credit risk. It matches up the net buyers and sellers, post-trade, and handles the exchange of cash for security. To mitigate the credit risk that one of the clearing brokers fails, they demand the brokers post a clearing deposit with them.

The NSCC is required to do this by SEC rule, tracing to Dodd-Frank.

Here's the details: https://sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc-an/2018/34-82631.pdf

Everyone posts, and if a broker fails, then NSCC takes any losses out of that broker's deposit, then some from NSCC, then from everyone else (the other brokers).

This is a post-crisis idea encoded in Dodd-Frank that making everyone post collateral reduces the credit risk and systemic risk and such.

So how does the NSCC clearing deposit get calculated?

It's basically Deposit = min( 99% 2d VaR + Gap Risk Measure, Deposit Floor Calc) + Mark-to-Market ... math and jargon!

Let's use an example. Say Fidelity has clients who bought 2bn of stock and sold 1.5bn of stocks. First, net down buy/sell between customers in the same stock.

Say that leaves 1bn buy and 0.5bn sell. Run some math to answer ""that won't move more than X with 99% odds in the next 2 days."" Let's say that's 3% of the net, so 3% * (1bn-0.5bn) = 0.15bn = 15m. That the 99% 2d VaR.

Next, we ask ""is any one stock net more than 30% of the net buy/sell"" ... and if it is, then we take 10% of that amount and add it as the Gap Risk Measure. So if Fidelity customers bought 200m IBM, then add 20m to that 15m. That's Gap Risk Measure.

Deposit Floor Calc is some thing that looks at the 1bn buy and the 0.5bn sell and does a small calc and adds them, so that if the first calc (99% 2d VaR + Gap Risk Measure) is small, then this floor will keep the overall from being tiny.

Then, last, you add Mark-to-Market. Basically if your customers bought IBM at 140/shr and it goes to 110/shr before it settles for cash at 140/shr, the NSCC has 30/shr of credit exposure to the clearing broker and that amount gets added to the required collateral posted to NSCC.

There are some other items, but that's the basic idea - full details are here: https://dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/policy-and-compliance/NSCC_Disclosure_Framework.pdf

The NSCC sets the framework, but it is spelled out in Dodd-Frank that they have to do so by law.

These deposits are held in the Clearing Fund at the NSCC.

Financials are here: https://dtcc.com/legal/financial-statements

They had 10.5bn in the Clearing Fund as of Sep 30, 2020.

This is the regime post-Dodd-Frank. NSCC updated it's rules in 2018 to improve the VaR calc and to add the Gap Risk Measure.

How did this impact Robinhood?

Well, let's say Robinhood had $20bn of client assets starting 2021. Those customers used to trade $1bn/d say. What is the context for Clearing Deposit? Say 2 days it's a little unbalanced and it's 1.2bn buy and 0.8bn sell. Ok, that's probably around 12m, maybe 20m deposit.

If they take in $600m of new deposits and say $400m wants to buy GME. Plus of their $20bn existing, say there is $400m of GME buys over the past 2d. Then the picture could look like 2.0bn buys and 1.0bn sells, which might normally be 30m deposit. But volatility went up. A bit.

Now 99% 2d VaR is much higher. It should be 20x higher for their net portfolio, but the formula will smooth it out some. Maybe it's ~4x bigger. So just on VaR, they have to post 120m now. That they should have.

The Gap Risk Measure is what kills them.

If GME is over 30% of their net unsettled portfolio, then they are required to post 10% of all the GME buys. So if that's 800m, they have to post another 80m. And there is no limit to it. As long as their clients are up P&amp;L, the mark-to-market covers it.

But if RH takes in 500m of new money and 300m buys GME, then at minimum they are looking at posting 30m+ from just that exposure at NSCC. They cannot use client money - RH has to use their own resources to post. And if GME stock drops, RH has to post the loss pre-settlement.

This would also explain why RH drew its credit lines and said vague things about clearing requirements.

Robinhood Is Said to Draw on Bank Credit Lines Amid Tumult
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult
(alternative URL:  https://archive.is/sLhsm)

The policy goal here is to avoid the central plumbing entities from taking credit risk. In reality, such regulations raise costs and create barriers to entry. It raises profits for entities like DTCC (which owns NSCC and is itself owned by Wall St)

RH offered to open up stock market investing more broadly. They succeeded, clearly. But the regulations didn't change - there are still pro-Wall St, pro-incumbent rules and capital requirements. It's one of the most highly regulated industries in our nation.

So @aoc is right to ask how it can be that Robinhood stopped its clients from buying certain securities. And what she'll find is that the reason is that Dodd-Frank requires brokers like RH to post collateral to cover their clients' trading risk pre-settlement.

And it isn't the Fed or SEC who sets the rules. It's the Wall St owned central clearing entity itself, DTCC, that makes its own rules. So when the retail masses decided to squeeze the short-sellers, in the middle of crushing them, it was govt regulations which tripped them up.",finance

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow futures extend losses as Wall Street’s volatile week continues

&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to drop 300 points at Friday’s open, extending losses with Dow stock Johnson &amp; Johnson falling after the U.S. drug giant released data about its one-dose coronavirus vaccine. The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks.

&gt; The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly.

&gt; # 2. J&amp;J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants

&gt; J&amp;J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&amp;J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&amp;J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses.

&gt; U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket.

&gt; # 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading

&gt; Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively.

&gt; # 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure

&gt; Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency.

personalfinance,Our Student Loan Conundrum,"Hello everyone, looking to get your 2 cents on this interesting student loan situation that my wife and I find ourselves in.

First, some background: my wife and I are both dentists and both own our own practice. We graduated dental school the same year and both have considerable student loans left to pay. She has $197,000 in loans remaining and I have around $220,000 (we both started around $330,000). We have been paying things down at a reasonably comfortable clip so far, but here is the kicker:

Before covid and before things shut down in March, she did the responsible thing and refinanced/consolidated her individual federal loans through a private company, bringing her interest rate down to 4.5%. I, who was much more lazy at the time, dragged my feet on refinancing, and now all of my individual federal loans are at 0% with no payments until September 2021. 

So here is where I would like your opinions: Do we put all of our money into paying off her consolidated private loan that is still gaining interest at 4.5%, or do we throw all of our weight into paying into the principal balance of my loans while they are not gaining interest? Or both?",finance

I am looking to purchase a second home in my area for $100k or less, and use my current home as an investment property. I live in a smallish urban area and $100k would give me a larger home (purchased my first at $63k, 2b1ba at 5.75% int). Our current monthly payment is $643/m (including escrow) and at around 4% interest rate plus expected escrow, the 2nd home would cost approximately $690/m-$750/m. 

Rentals for the size of my home sit comfortably at $700-800 depending on the cleanliness of the home, which my home is clean and very livable, just not a ton of space. The rental market is large in my area. I expect to charge $750/month for the home. But I assume it will take approx 3 months to find a tenant? 

My spouse and I take home a little over $5.2k every month. We have a small savings, which mostly will go towards the closing costs and small updates. I have created a monthly budget including all normal expenses plus the added mortgage/escrow payments. I have also added a small increase in the amount we save each paycheck by $100.

personalfinance,"Negative Points (Lender Credits) on Mortgage Refinance Question. Broker says I cannot go with the option I want due to ""anti-steering laws"" (credits exceed the amount due at closing).","I am in the process of refinancing my primary residence. I rent out rooms, and file taxes accordingly, so I'm ""house hacking"". The mortgage broker's site showed loan options with very large negative points/lender credits. [Here's a screenshot of the ones I am interested in.](https://i.imgur.com/Dls9Evg.png)

I told the broker I wanted to go with the 2.99% option as it has -2.8% worth of lender credits (I get $7k at closing). Mortgage broker said sure, does a hard pull on my credit, then calls me up and says that to adhere to ""anti-steering laws"", Quicken will only let me take out a mortgage with the minimum rate that has no cost to me. He then proceeded to steer me towards the 2.69% option with only -1.4% worth of lender credits (I get $2k at closing). 

His justification was that it is illegal to give me a mortgage for a higher rate if there is no cost to me for the lower rate. I told him that the break even point for me is years in the future, and I was willing to pay the 0.3% spread for the extra $5k. 

I looked up what I assume to be the law he was citing and saw nothing prohibiting this transaction:



[PDF page 188 \(page 780\)](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2012-title12-vol3/pdf/CFR-2012-title12-vol3-part226-appI-id377.pdf)
&gt; 4. Creditor’s flexibility in setting loan terms. **Section 226.36(d)(1) does not limit a creditor’s ability to offer a higher interest rate in a transaction as a means for the consumer to finance the payment of the loan originator’s compensation or other costs that the consumer would otherwise be required to pay directly (either in cash or out of the loan proceeds)**. Thus, a creditor may charge a higher interest rate to a consumer who will pay fewer of the costs of the transaction directly...

I checked out [Fannie May](https://guide.freddiemac.com/app/guide/section/5501.6), and they explicitly allow lender credits to be used towards principal reduction:
&gt; Lender credit may only be used as a credit towards the Borrower's Closing Costs. In the event the lender credit exceeds the amount of the Borrower's Closing Costs, the following requirements apply:

&gt; * The lender credit must be reduced so it does not exceed the amount of the Borrower's Closing Costs, or
* **The amount of the lender credit that exceeds the Borrower's Closing Costs must be applied as a principal curtailment to the Mortgage, and must be clearly reflected on the Settlement/Closing Disclosure Statement.** (See Section 6302.32 for delivery requirements for Mortgages with principal curtailments.)

I'm sitting on the loan disclosures now and have a bad taste in my mouth as I feel he used the bait-and-switch on me. I had explicitly asked him about the negative points prior to starting the refi process and he said there is no catch, first thing he does after doing a hard-pull is tell me about the catch and proceed to steer me away from the loan I want to avoid breaking anti-steering laws.

So, is my mortgage broker just wrong? Intentionally lying to me? Or am I misunderstanding the law. Is there any way I can get the 2.99% loan I actually want?

TL;DR: Mortgage Broker says I cannot get a loan that has too large of a lender credit if there is a lower interest option with less credit. He says too large is legally defined as credits that eclipse the costs due at closing. I can find no such law. Is he right?",finance

My paystub for the bonus shows \~$18000 going to 401k on a pre-tax basis. The remaining \~$2000 is then taken as taxes, split between Federal, Employee Medicare, Social Security, and State income. So the net pay comes out to $0.

As I understand it, the main downside for her is that her credit score will not benefit from the mortgage payments, so we would need to build her credit in other ways.

Should I leave my wife on the loan to build her credit and lower my DTI, or should I leave her off to take advantage of the lower interest rate?

EDIT: I spoke to my lender. Her name will be on the title. The loan would remain unchanged if I died as long as she kept up the payments. I’m increasing my life insurance coverage to make sure that she is able to afford it. 

We are using the savings and my disability payments to pay down her student loans faster, and I have already added her as an authorized user on my airline credit card.

personalfinance,dividends and Vanguard questions,"other than a mortgage with a stupid low interest rate, i find myself debt free. both cars paid off, zero credit card debt, no other loans, and a sizeable emergency fund in the bank earning a very very low amount of interest. i have 4% matching 401k at work also maxed out.

i am in my early 50's, wife early 40's, and we've never really had the money to ""invest"" before, but now we do and i know practically nothing about it. ive gone through the wiki, and have settled on some vanguard funds that i am trying to decide on, VTHRX, VTSAX, VSMGX. the plan would be to put around 3k a month into the fund.

my questions are:

how do you get your money out? can it be accessed at any time and just transferred into my bank account or is it trapped for a certain amount of time (ignoring tax implications, just want to know how easy it is to get my money back).

dividends, how are they paid, do they automatically get invested back into the fund, or do you receive a check in the mail, or ?

from the research ive done i think i am making decently sound choices, the questions are more about the mechanics of how it all works.",finance
personalfinance,re-fi a 2nd time make sense in certain situations?,"original purchase/loan: $245k condo, 30-year fixed  @ 4.875% $196k loan paid down to $180k over between 2-3 years.  condo current value $345k.

15 mos ago refi to 15-year fixed @ 3.375% $186k loan with fees rolled in.  Balance is now $174.8K.  break-even point is about 2 years.

plan has been long-term hold, currently primary residence but want to rent out eventually and buy another property elsewhere with renters paying down mortgage on condo until paid off, then maybe sell it.

second guessing myself now about the 15-year.  if interest rate of a whole point lower can be locked in (say 2.375%), is it worth re-fi again to either 15 or 30 fixed?  or should i stay with what i have?",finance

Is there somewhere better to leave this money sitting than the savings?

dogecoin,Why Dogecoin value is Stalling,"For those of you wondering why the value has stalled:

Many brokers, pre-Dogecoin explosion, would allow their investors to deposit funds directly from their bank into their brokerage accounts.

This process doesn’t happen immediately, but the market is ever-changing. The broker’s solution to this was to hold its own reserve of funds to offer as an “instant deposit” to its investors so that they could claim shares at prevailing rates rather than having to wait 5 business days for their bank to confirm a transfer of funds.

In other words, those who deposited funds into their brokerage accounts and immediately began investing were using the broker’s funds.

Given the recent surge of new users, it makes sense that brokers are now struggling to come up with the money to offer as instant deposits for their investors, so brokers like Robinhood have limited what you can use your instant deposit towards while others have outright stopped offering instant deposits.

Brokers are allowing instant deposit to be used towards shares of stock because the stock market is federally insured, and the government will bail out investments up to a certain amount (I believe $500k?), whereas cryptocurrency is NOT federally insured and brokers risk losing millions if the market bubble that’s forming pops (I can also explain what a “bubble” is and what it indicates in relation to the market if need be).

So no, brokers are not intentionally keeping you from buying your beloved DOGE. They simply cannot afford to allow immediate purchasing of DOGE.

Most likely, when people’s deposits start clearing and they can actually use the funds they requested to put in, the value of DOGE will start soaring momentarily again. Be wary though, as sudden spikes can cause massive sell offs (as much as you guys are advocating against it) and cause a nearly equal decline in price. The equal and opposite reaction may also spook other investors into selling in fear of the losing their investment, especially those who bought during a spike.

My advice to the DOGE community: start creating uses for DOGE coin to generate demand!

If there’s no use for DOGE, it is simply seen as a vehicle for profit and we will eventually see a massive sell off when the value peaks high enough. Once that happens, prices will tank tremendously which c o u l d generate more traffic but will most likely encourage others to sell as well. There will not be any need for the actual currency, and once it is pumped to the moon it will be dumped into the ocean.

Investing in DOGE right now without demand originating from somewhere other than the demand for immediate profit is pretty much akin to gambling and should be treated as such. Be careful with what you put in, and be prepared to lose it all.

If you bought low (0.02 and under), you may want to sell off your initial investment and allow the rest of your coin to generate profit. That way if DOGE does tank, you won’t actually lose anything and you’ll be able to hold confidently.

Keep in mind I’m not a professional finance manager, I’m simply a 21 year old with some basic Econ education under my belt. I won’t blame anyone who won’t heed my advice, and I wish the best for all of you out there putting your savings and lifelines on the line to both help yourself and help others.

Stay safe out there doges! And for the sake of everyone I hope DOGE reaches the moon 🚀🚀🚀

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: Just learned that the majority of the stock market is crashing due to European restrictions on US market trading put into place due to fear of volatility.

This essentially means your favorite stock is on discount right now. If you're on Robinhood waiting for your deposit to clear, you can use your instant deposit in the meanwhile to buy into stocks that are currently low and make money between now at the time your deposit clears. When your deposit clears, you can sell the stock (if you want) and put into $DOGE.

This is a risk all on its own, also keeping in mind that the market for stock trading will be closed over the weekend, so again stay safe and stay informed! Love u guys &lt;3",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,How to allocate extra savings and budget surplus?,"Me

* 30, single, no kids (and no plans for them)

Salary 

* 106,000/year - no bonuses, typically receive a ~5% raise every February/March

Budget

* I won’t go into a detailed budget breakdown, but currently have about a $600 surplus per biweekly paycheck. In a few months I’m planning on relocating to a lower cost of living area, no change to income (remote worker) which will save me another $600/month or so on rent.


Debts 

* Car Payment - $8000 @ 0.9% (fixed rate)

* Private Student Loan - $41,000 @ 2.72% (variable rate tied to LIBOR, capped at 9%)

* Federal Student Loan - $9,000 @ 4.41% (fixed rate, currently at 0% through October 2021)

* Federal Student Loan - $12,000 @ 3.15% (fixed rate, currently at 0% through October 2021)


Savings/Investing

* 401k - 5% of my salary + 5% employer match (current balance ~$33k)

* IRA - Maxed yearly (current balance $13k)

* HSA - Employer deposits ~$40/paycheck (current balance $3k)

* Emergency Fund - $10k, no active contributions

* PCT Fund - $8k, no active contributions (would like to take time off to do the PCT in the next 1-3 years)

* Unallocated liquid funds - $14k


My goals in the next few years are to buy a house (low cost of living area, you can get more house than a person could reasonably require for ~$250k), to start flying airplanes for fun, and hike the PCT (costs ~$8k and takes about 6 months of no income).

My question is what to do with this unallocated $14k currently sitting in Ally earning 0.5%. It would be satisfying to pay the car off as this would clear another $449/month in my budget, or throw it all at the variable rate loan. However both of these are pretty low rates, and given prevailing economic conditions I would be surprised to see LIBOR rise enough to make the variable rate a serious concern in the next few years. It’s tempting to use it to start flying, but feels irresponsible to continue to be carrying so much debt in the meantime.",finance

personalfinance,Where to Store Savings for a House Project Goal?,"I'd like to build a garage but construction is VERY expensive.  Rather than take out a loan and pay it back over 5 years, I'd rather put money aside for 5 years and then build.  I don't want to lose value in a savings account, but I'm also not sure if I want to put it all into the stock market.  I've owned my home for a little over a year so I'd rather not take on any more debt.

Since it's not emergency savings I'm ok with taking on more risk.

Here are some options I'm considering:

A. Open a separate savings account, try not to think about the 0.4% interest rate failing to keep up with inflation  
B. Buy bonds or CDs

C. Put money into a brokerage account and buy an index fund

D. Take out a loan

I'm leaning towards an index fund.  If I'm closing in on my goal and we have a repeat of '08, pushing things back a year or two wouldn't be the end of the world for me.

Also, my emergency funds are hitting 6 months worth of expenses, are there any other options to consider aside from a savings account that can protect against inflation?

wallstreet,Email template for the SEC regarding visibility amongst institutional investors,"Hello,

I am emailing today because I wish to speak on behalf of the people. We (retail Investors) demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F.

We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data that gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


Filing of Form 13F - A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format.


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**

It is essential to us, the people, that the transparency requirements for institutional investors are looked into and hopefully restructured.

Thank you for your time.

dogecoin,THE ENLIGHTENMENT,"This is the story of my enlightenment

Yesterday night something extraordinary happened. In my dream, I was in a void engulfed in darkness. I screamed and shouted, but no one answered my call. Then I heard a barking from a distance. I tried to get closer to the source of the barking, but I tumbled in the darkness and fell. I tried to get up, but it seemed that gravity was pushing me down. When I thought all hope was lost, I was suddenly lifted up and was blinded by a warm golden radiance. As my eyes adjusted, I saw that it was the OG Doge himself, the 100 story tall Shiba Inus with amazing biceps and abs. Doge had lifted me up with his paw, and bought me to eye level. His side eye and my eyes interlocked for what seemed to be eternity. Being speechless the whole time, I finally had the courage to ask him “What do you want from me?” Doge answered with one large BARRRKKKK that separated my soul from my body and sent me flying between galaxies. All of a sudden, I woke up from my dream breaking in sweat.

I felt different. I felt warmth, and my mental acuity was astounding as if I had done a line of cocaine. I heard a ping from my phone, and even before I checked the notification, I knew what it was. It was a notification telling me my dogecoin investments has gone up by 500%. At that moment I knew what Doge had meant by his bark, and what my destiny entails. That I must not only invest in dogecoin and hodl, but that I must also show others the way of the doge. I have decided to dedicate my life to becoming a dogecoin guru.

I am in the process of creating a professional course with a cheap price of $2000 doge a semester that’ll teach you the way of the doge. Since you guys are my reddit friends that already believe in doge, I’ll make it $1000. Doge is currently waiting for us in Mars, where he will teach us how to overthrow the corrupt institutions.

My analysis is to pay attention to these companies. $PFE, $MRNA, $AZN, $TMO, $UPS, and $FDX.

Thermo-Fisher is a science equipment company, that produces deep freezers, which are needed for the Pfizer vaccine. Moderna, Pfizer, and Astrozeneca, seem to be solid choices while we are in this COVID economy. UPS and FedEx also seem like the correct stocks for the logistics portion of the vaccine rollout.

personalfinance,Unsure whether investing or paying off certain debts are the right choice right now.,"Just so y'all have as much info as possible, I'm in my early 30's and make approximately ~70k a year. My wife makes approximately 50k. We bought a house 5 years ago and put a bunch of money down on our house to avoid PMI and so we wouldn't have to have as high of a mortgage, which ended up being around 250k. We have about 100k left of our 250k mortgage. We don't have a super lavish lifestyle, so our plan is to potentially pay off the rest in 2-3 years. Currently we have about 40k in our bank account. I guess that's sort of unwise but she switched jobs during covid (she used to make a little more but covid changed her old career field very much for the worse) and since there was some uncertainty with our finances I got kind of scared and wanted to just sit on a bunch of money in our savings instead of moving it to the house or somewhere else just in case her new job didn't work out or anything happened with my job.

We make more than enough to cover costs and who knows we may even see a bump if there's another stimulus or from our tax return or whatever, so I have some money to comfortable invest or use wisely but I have no idea what's the smartest, safest choice.

I have a 401k as of the past 7 years I've been doing the max match with in my company and my wife has a separate IRA. I also have an old debt of 70k. We paid off all our other debts so it's just those two, my debt and the house, but there is a weird thing about the 70k debt. When I got out of college I had a lot of issues finding a job and my credit tanked because I couldn't pay for my loans. When I got my job I called them because I always intended on paying once I found a decent career so they made me a deal if I put money down and signed up for like an autopay thing with a credit card where they made the interest rate 0% and I can pay it on a credit card (I think it went to collections) so I've been doing that the past few years. It's on a credit card (which means interestingly I can get flight points or credit card bonuses on it and it helped rebuild my credit which, since we've been really good for the past 7 years my credit is muuuuch better) and it's 0 interest. Also, I've spoken to them about settling several times and they could do it, and they said they would for like 15-20k but then apparently the forgiven amount I'd get taxed on and end up having to pay like an additional 12k anyway or something come tax time since it'd be considered income? I'm not 100% sure how it works but what I gather is if I took the deal I'd pay up front, which I'm fine with, but then come tax time I'd have to pay a bunch of the forgiven amount or something which means settling for 15-20 would be more like 20-30. It's 0% interest and on a credit card so while I would like to get rid of it, in uncertain times I wouldn't call it a priority necessarily.

So on one hand we could put money on the house but we're very far ahead and post refinancing (we got a really good interest rate) I'm not sure we would save a TON on the interest by paying off the rest of the house but this other loan is 0% interest on a credit card and it feels as though I could settle it for a much smaller amount?

Then of course there's a lot of stock activity right now and I'm not looking to invest in like GSE or whatever but I'm wondering what makes the most sense if we want to take some of this 40k out of our savings and put it somewhere? Just onto the house? Some kind of smart investment? The interest free debt I have from college? We have no kids, really not sure we'll ever have any but I just want to be smart with this money since I have 2 large and sort of unique debts plus some money to potentially use or invest.

dogecoin,Buying power on Robinhood,"Hey y'all, I'm trying to buy DOGE and join in on the hold train but I'm getting frustrated. My buying power is $200 right now, but Robinhood is telling me I can't buy DOGE because I don't have enough buying power, yet I can buy other stocks despite this. Is this Robinhood being shady as hell and what can I do to get around this??

EDIT: Damn, y'all are quick to reply and I truly appreciate it - thank you!! I understand now, and I am pretty miffed about this. I deposited another $50 and it looks like it won't be available until Feb 5th. I'm here for the ride with all!!",cryptocurrency
dogecoin,"If you’re thinking about selling bc you don’t have profit after a day, read this","All these people stressing need to realize how far we’ve come in a day. We went from 1 percent to 8 percent! Yeah, sure, we haven’t surpassed 8% yet for an extended period but we still did it.

Think about what’s happening in the world now. Think about how much control the government and wall street has. Think about what these applications and sites have been doing to keep us under. 

Even with those circumstances, we’re still maintaining a minimum of 4%! Which is still a lot considering how hard people are working to try to stop us.

Dogecoin was never meant to be used for a short profit. Even the invention itself was meant to be more people friendly and accommodating. If you want to be in this to ONLY gain profit for yourself, you’re here for the wrong reasons. This doesn’t change overnight.

Most important thing is that we’re still more ahead than where we started. A lot of people can’t buy coins or have to wait days till they can start. THAT’s when you’ll see the true power we have here.

In the meantime, relax. Don’t stress. This is a temporary setback. We have a huge advantage because of how many people are invested in this.

THE MOST IMPORTANT thing you can do is keep your doge. Don’t exchange or sell. Just keep it. When the price is lowered, put money in. Any amount. Even $5 dollars. Break the transactions up and do multiple of them. Don’t panic. You will lose out if you sell, even if you see at .10 or .05 or 1. Anything. Because with the way the world is going and how fed up we are of not having control, we will change the world. You just need to believe!!

Of course this is not financial advice.

But besides patience, the best things for you to do next is HOLD HOLD HOLD, purchase below the current dip of .004. Let people know about this, spread it on social media, and get Elon Musk on board. He has clear interest in us, we just need to prove why we’re worthy of investing on. If half of us only care about fast profit, let me ask, would YOU want to help?

We got this BUT it’s up to us. Don’t fumble the ball during the last quarter of the superbowl, because that’s essentially how important this is.

personalfinance,Help with the math for my situation. Paying mortgage vs investing.,"46 years old.  I did dumb things when I was young, ran up credit cards and didn't invest.  I fell behind in the retirement game.  My wife and I have gotten our stuff together so to speak, and I'm happy to say we are in a much better position these days.

In summary: we now have 3x our annual salary as our 401k balance.  We both max out our 401ks / roths now, and have learned to live without that money.  We are not eligible for for an HSA account.  We've been hardcore paying down all debt - student loans, car payments, and credit cards are all gone.  The only debt we have left is a mortgage at 3.96.  24 years left on a 30year mortgage.  Getting rid of debt is empowering, and we've learned to use ""debt money"" in a virtuous cycle to pay down more debt.

So here we are, with some extra cash and no obvious place to put it to good use.  On one hand we could invest it, but we're feeling we should diversify out of stocks since that's where all our savings are now.  We've talked about gold as a security blanket, we've talked about real estate, we've talked about buying into funds that are less aggressive.  But we could also use those funds and start making some seriously large dents in our mortgage.

It's easy to justify paying down car payments and credit card bills as those interest rates are so high, but with a mortgage at 3.96, I think it's right on the line with the other ""safer"" options we've been looking at.  The thing that's really making me question the mortgage is that the new tax laws really put a damper on the ""you get a deduction for mortgage interest"" thing.  A mortgage doesn't really pay you back with the IRS like it used to.

So how do I figure out the math in this situation to figure out which is a better option?  Hit the mortgage hard and truly become ""debt free"" (something that has a bonus emotional perk to it), or invest that money elsewhere and keep the mortgage ""forever""

Thanks for the help!",finance

# Option Analysis

Since it's Friday, I'll keep this short and simple. On Sunday night I'll be making another post that will cover a much broader range of data to prepare for the week. The objective today is to get a general idea of what's going on.

Here are the aggregate numbers for the most popular NTM/OTM options -

|Type|Strike Price|Volume|Covered Calls Volume|Open Interest|Open Interest Change (24hr)|Open Interest % LEAPS|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Call|$5|302,914|302,914|750,280|164.36%|43.01%|
|Call|$7|178,382|178,382|650,039|N/A|51.57%|
|Call|$10|198,960|198,960|727,640|N/A|41.71%|
|Put|$5|37,384|N/A|216,167|108.53%|50.04%|
|Put|$7|10,764|N/A|84,215|N/A|64.70%|
|Put|$10|1,469|N/A|7,935|N/A|53.79%|

^(What is LEAPS?) [^(Long Term Equity Anticipation Security)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leaps.asp)

Here are the aggregate numbers for LEAPS -

|Type|Strike Prices|Open Interest Total|% of Total Open Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Call LEAPS|($5, $7, $10)|961,418|85.21%|
|Put LEAPS|($5, $7, $10)|166,915|14.79%|

Here are the aggregate numbers for Short Term Options -

|Type|Strike Prices|Open Interest Total|% of Total Open Interest|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Term Calls|($5, $7, $10)|1,166,541|89.19%|
|Short Term Puts|($5, $7, $10)|141,402|10.81%|

^(Short Term Options are option contracts that expire in less than 12 months. In this case, the dates range from 29 January  to 16 July.)

What we can learn from these numbers -

1. Long term market sentiment for $NOK is *extremely* bullish. **85.21% of LEAPS options currently in circulation expect the price of $NOK to rise above $5, $7 and $10 over the next 12+ months.**
2. Short term market sentiment is also *extremely* high. **89.19% of short term options currently in circulation expect the price of $NOK to rise above $5, $7, and $10 over the next 6 months.**
3. There is still a relatively high volume of Put Options at $5, which may be part of the reason we see such high volatility around that price. Beyond $5, the ratio of Puts to Calls gets slimmer, which will likely lead to better stability as prices rises.
4. Today's option volume was very high for Calls, and 100% of those Calls were covered. I wouldn't expect much gamma ramping (sudden upward jumps in price) as we go forward.
5. Trade volume of shares was \~350 million today. This is significantly lower than the weekly highs which exceeded 1 billion. This is likely why we saw only small movements. There were also quite a few sell-offs as the price reached a high of $5.22.

# Nokia's Growing Business

I'll keep this section short and sweet like I promised. All of these links come from [Nokia's Investor Relations News](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-and-stock-exchange-releases/).

Here is Nokia's [Financial Calendar](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/12/22/nokia-corporation-financial-calendar-for-2021/). This is good stuff to keep track of if you are investing for the long haul.

I'm just gonna list off a handful of big things that have occurred so far in January 2021 -

* [Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world’s first 1T deployment](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/01/27/nokia-and-elisa-push-network-boundaries-with-worlds-first-1t-deployment/)

The list goes on and on. There is *so much more* that isn't listed here. A lot of these new developments will start taking effect in Fiscal Year 2021 and 2022, which can lead to major growth.

# Finances Summary

For a full look at the finances and a comparison with Qualcomm and Ericsson, check out [Part III](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l714e7/part_iii_i_want_to_briefly_go_over_nok_financials/). I'm just gonna summarize what was said over there.

||$NOK Data (Converted to USD)|
|:-|:-|
|Book Value|$47.43 Billion|
|Total Debt|$6.43 Billion|
|Repayment of Debt|$542 Million|
|Free Cash Flow|$2.35 Billion|
|Net Revenue TTM|$890 Million|
|Operating Income|$2.09 Billion|
|Market Value|**\~$24 Billion**|

In Part III we did a comparison between Nokia, Qualcomm, and Ericsson. Based on the numbers, it's pretty apparent how undervalued Nokia is compared to the competition - both of whom boast very similar finances. I again urge you to read [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l714e7/part_iii_i_want_to_briefly_go_over_nok_financials/) on the finances for a better explanation.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

# TL;DR

Market sentiment for $NOK is extremely high as we get ready to move into earnings week. Trade volume of shares has gone down, while option volume and open interest has trended upwards.

Financial data and press releases from Nokia indicate that the company is expecting to perform very well in the long term, with an abundance of new business coming in.

I would again encourage you to read my other posts. They all include TL;DRs for the lazy.

personalfinance,Traditional IRA money I can't deduct: withdraw vs recharacterize to Roth vs ignore,"I (27M, income ~105k) made a $6,000 max Traditional IRA contribution in March 2020, alongside maxing my 401k. When I made the contribution, I thought that my AGI would be under the income limit for deducting Traditional IRA contributions from your AGI. (For my situation (PSLF), minimizing AGI is very beneficial.) After an unexpected promotion, my AGI for tax year 2020 is just over the can't-deduct-anything limit ($75,000), despite using all AGI lowering tricks I know that apply to me ((traditional 401k, max HSA, $300 CARES Act charity).

As a result, this $6000 is being ""wasted"" in a Traditional IRA with Vanguard, as I can't deduct it and it doesn't get the benefits of a Roth. My initial reaction was to recharacterize the $6000 Traditional contribution to a Roth, which would not affect my AGI but would give me Roth advantages down the road. However, I learned that recharacterizing requires you to pay taxes now on all the earnings since purchasing. As I invested the $6000 right at the bottom of the March crash, my napkin math says my $6000 investment is up 58.5%, $6000 to $9508. That's $3508 of gains that apparently would be taxed.

A second option is to leave it be, so I don't have to pay taxes now on the gains, but then I think I get double taxed at retirement, as I paid taxes now to put money in a traditional ira that is taxed again at withdrawal? 

However, I don't need that money in retirement accounts, as I'm maxing my 401k very early in life and I can stick with a federal government pension. A third option is withdrawing the money now, but the IRS rules are confusing me. In [IRS Pub 590a](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a) it says:

&gt; **Contributions Returned Before Due Date of Return.**
&gt; 
&gt;  If you made IRA contributions in 2019, you can withdraw them tax free by the due date of your return. If you have an extension of time to file your return, you can withdraw them tax free by the extended due date. You can do this if, for each contribution you withdraw, both of the following conditions apply. 
&gt; 
&gt; * You didn’t take a deduction for the contribution. 
&gt; 
&gt; * You withdraw any interest or other income earned on the contribution. You can take into account any loss on the contribution while it was in the IRA when calculating the amount that must be withdrawn. If there was a loss, the net income earned on the contribution may be a negative amount.

&gt; In most cases, the net income you must withdraw is determined by the IRA trustee or custodian. If you need to determine the applicable net income on IRA contributions made after 2019 that are returned to you, use Worksheet 1-4. See Regulations section 1.408-11 for more information.

However, I can't find many online posts talking about this option. In addition, I searched through Vanguard's site, and I can't find a form to specifically request this type of withdrawal. (I found forms for recharacterizations, excess contribution withdrawals, and rollovers, but not same-year withdrawals.) Of course, I can manually withdraw $6000, but that doesn't have the fiduciary calculate and withdraw my gains as well to fulfill the IRS regulation.

I tried calling Vanguard today, but after 2 hours on hold, I had to give up and figured I'd ask here if anyone has experience or advice on the best way to proceed in this situation. Thanks!",finance
dogecoin,Doge only hit a small delay before the biggest rally in crypto history 🚀🚀🚀,"Will try to keep this short and sweet for my cavemen brothers and sisters feeling like the bone is falling off the cliff! Let’s kick this off.

To start off, everyone knows what happened to GME due to Robinhood meddling where they shouldn’t have and they are going to get what they deserve.
This doesn’t change the fact Robinhood is one of the easiest stock apps to get involved with for newer traders. From this point on we will refer to traders as good bois. 
🐕DON’T DISCOURAGE GOOD BOIS FROM USING ROBINHOOD!!🐕
This only discourages those who don’t know enough about the opportunity of obtaining bones to get involved with stocks.

Any good boi with half the peanut size brain of a caveman knew to get involved with the DOGE on the 28th when the scandalization with GME was getting all the publicity and they limited GME trading. Those archaic microcosm fucks who bought into DOGE before then and have over 1million+ shares were simply from the past and are what us average cavemen evolved from. They have now become the pillars of what HOLD is defined by.

On the 28th of January DOGE hit an 800%+ growth and before they knew it Robinhood 
re-shit its already soiled pants from the day prior. They knew they wouldn’t be able to contain another GME style explosion and were losing they’re marbles. They felt as if all the infrastructure that is the Wall Street stock exchange was about to come crumbling down. 

EVERYONE who owned any stock in DOGE was celebrating! 🥳 “it keeps going up and it’s not stopping. My small investment just doubled-tripled-quadrupled! I CAN’T WAIT TO BUY MY NEW CAVE!!” And all the Neanderthals saw that it was good, and they held firm for the upcoming surplus injection that would be the 29th of January.

For the average caveman who felt like he just single handedly brought home a wooly mammoth to feed his clan for the next year, he either slept so peacefully knowing the gains were only going to continue tomorrow or adversely woke up with the most anxiety his little brain could handle as he opened his app.

The dips through the night were not terrible, most saw it as a few lesser intelligent starving cavemen simply needing to eat... the sellouts...

The morning of January 29th...

Robinhood has done it again, “in a post on there website Robinhood said they’ve temporarily disabled “instant deposits” for cryptocurrency purchases, that means that users won’t be able to purchase digital currencies with money they add to their accounts until deposits settles, which could take up to 5 business days”

The biggest crypto pump in history had just been halted because “Robinhood wanted to impose restrictions on massive rallies in both bitcoin and DOGECOIN...”

FRET NOT, CONTINUE TO HOLD!! Though the payout has been delayed, it will only benefit us. By restricting the rallies and making new good bois wait 5 business days for new funds to hit the market. The first 5 days after the 29th will begin blasting DOGE off to Alpha Centauri.

The news of the heroics of DOGE are spreading faster than a California wildfire!
The GameStop short squeeze was simply the kindling and injection fluid to power the Dogecoin rocket, because of GameStop even your 92 old grandma has heard the media and knows or has asked about what’s going on with stocks right now. 
There are more individual investors than ever before trying to get involved with the most talked about cryptocurrency since BITCoin and Ethereum. The frosting on this wonderful dog biscuit, they all have to wait until at least February 4th to get involved, and until then everyone else who missed the first wave on the 28th gets to hear about the success of the DOGE on day one!
Those who missed out on Bitcoin, GME and resent not making the decision to invest will jump at the opportunity to get into a low risk crypto that has already seen so much success.

The first 2 weeks of February we are going to see the fastest growth of any cryptocurrency on the planet. All those who felt like they’re losing out on their gains because they didn’t sell at .08 have no reason to worry. The reason stock is slowly dipping is because Robinhood temporarily restricted injection of new funds into the stock, so only those who were already holding a cryptowallet stuffed with bitcoin or GME profits are able to buy in before early February!

Hold, Hold, HOLD! The motherlode of all bones is nigh.

8) Why sell? This stock can be bought with PENNYS. PENNYS!!!! To some (myself included) a few hundred or thousand dollars is a LOT! But think about the long term when $1 is considered a STEAL compared to the average 32K of Bitcoin which is going up every day.

9) Bitcoin didn't have a boost from reddit like dogecoin, and its the ONLY currency so far to gain this amount of coverage from media since bitcoin/etherium.

10) I'm not an expert on the stock market, but I do know that a meme about a frog (peepee) changed the course of a presidents election, so regardless of anyones political beliefs, a meme of a dog could damn well do the same thing.

I expect to make under the 19.5k limit and am looking for how to properly add deductions to my W4 since I've been lazy in past years and have just waited until April for my refund on federal/state. 

Am I right in thinking that if I continue to allow normal tax withholdings, I lose out on the chance to add that money to a 401k, even though I get it back next April due to my low income bracket?

If so, using the W-4 deductions worksheet I'm not seeing where a deduction exists to let the IRS know my income bracket is low and so I would like avoid the withholdings now. Have I missed something here?

dogecoin,"How I bought Dogecoin, a short guide for newbies by a newbie","Hello everyone this is by no means the go to guide simply how I bought doge as a someone completely new to crypto, I probably was stupid about how I went about it but you know it's a learning process. Again just how I did it.

TLDR steps below
So I like most people probably have seen 'buy doge' pushed as a meme and decided to hop on the train in case it blows up. I started by making a Kraken account, it was kind of a pain because it was pretty slow and I had to reload pages several times not to mention I didn't set up 2fa right away and it still asked for it when there was no way to do it(try incognito and if it works its a cookie thing, they tell you but just a heads up)

Was getting kind of fed up with Kraken so I searched for a different site and ended up making a coinbase account. I came to find out very shortly that coinbase doesn't offer dogecoin after I verified my account which took much less time than kraken. I ended up going back to Kraken and this time better luck verifying my account and making headway.

Then, even though they sent me an email saying I could add funds, they still wouldn't let me so I had the dumb idea of just sending money(USD coin) from coinbase to Kraken by making an address on kraken and then just copying and pasting into the send order form on coinbase, took at least 30 min. Finally I had money in my Kraken account  and I was finally able to buy that sweet sweet doge(after trading usdc for usd)

TLDR STEPS:
1 Made a Kraken account(Kraken is slow)

2 Made a Coinbase account

3 verified both(Kraken is very slow)

4 Added funds to Coinbase because I couldn't add to Kraken

5 Made address on Kraken

6 Used 'Send/Receive' at top right of Coinbase, copy and pasted address from Kraken

7 Bought Dogecoin

8 ?????

9 Profit


Again not the go to guide just how I managed to buy doge, probably shouldn't listen to me because I'm dumb and new at this but thought it might help other newbies. Also sorry for how choppy it probably is, I had a long week and pretty long day.",cryptocurrency

stocks,Current Markets and Why,"Evening everyone,

I am about to tell you the problem with the current climate in two words. Liquidity crisis.

For the past few days the shorts were slowly liquidating their positions in other stocks, to pay the interest associated with shorting. By doing so there is a dip almost everywhere. There has been talk that all the brokerages that stopped or restricted the purchase of certain securities is in cahoots with the hedge funds. That is likely true when 40% of RH's revenue comes from Citadel (guys involved with shorting GME) but I am here to explain how a transaction works and the relation to liquidity. Because just as much as we want to get at the big guy, we also have to think about the broader market.

In every transaction there is always a winner and loser. If the losers can't pay then the broker has to pay out of pocket to the clearinghouse (this makes the brokerage the loser as well as you, you have to pay it back). The problem here is not just retail. There are funds and perhaps even the Fed buying up GME to prop up the price. Level 2 data recently will show you the orders are in the thousands at a time for GME, at the price of $300 retail orders consist of maybe 1-3 shares. Another issue is people are taking out their savings into this stock. RH from my understanding has a relaxed margin requirement and most of their customers are in their 20s. With relaxed margin, young individuals looking for quick easy cash are borrowing the money and gambling with it. When they lose and can't pay because they over leveraged, the broker is on the hook for the money. Also another issue is the calls being exercised yesterday. If they were to be exercised then the brokerage has to issue those shares to them, but with the demand and there being no shares to offer they are desperately trying to buy whatever they possible can. It explains why there was only the ""Sell"" option available. While they lost at their own game, it doesn't take away from what may occur to investments outside of GME or any other meme stock, **if a large part of margin borrowing ends up defaulting**.",finance

Bitcoin,Endgame: The Unraveling,"The GameStop/Robinhood saga is the first sequence of events that will start the entire unraveling of the financial system. This is my prediction for how it plays out:

Put yourself in Robinhood’s cofounder Vlad Tenev’s shoes, the second most hated man in America today. By restricting trading on $GME, $AMC, and a handful of other stocks, you have destroyed the past 7 years of your sweat, blood and tears and torpedoed your IPO. Your reputation is now in tatters. You’re no dummy, nothing could make you decide to restrict your subscribers in purchasing these stocks- unless you can’t fill these orders because logistically, you weren’t able to procure these shares.

I believe that the best explanation of this is by Silent Cal @KarlcTrebor https://twitter.com/kralctrebor/status/1354952686165225478?s=21 The TL;DR of it is that it comes down to a liquidity problem. They basically need to post collateral for every buy order that isn’t balanced out with a sell order. They only have 10.5 billion in their clearing fund. So when everybody is buying $GME and not selling, well, they run through that pretty quick. Which explains why they had to draw on additional lines of credit this morning. And even with that, they had to limit the purchase of these shares. 

Regardless, whatever the reason, the above is irrelevant, because the narrative is already set. It took already disillusioned public on the wrong end of a K-shaped recovery and gave them yet another villain, along with Melvin Capital, Citadel and Wall Street. People hate being told what they can or cannot do, and this only increases the buy pressure for $GME. The number of members on Wallstreetbets went parabolic, and the messaging have gotten really focused. The message is this: Buy and hold $GME until the shorts give up their shorts. They have the entire country on their side. Everybody wants a piece of the action. Basically, everyone has figured out that all they have to do is hold. What CNBC and the financial media is missing is that it is no longer about profits and financial solvency for the majority of the holders. It has become a matter of principle now. This fractured country have been looking for something that they can unite against for once. People want justice. They want to see people go to jail. They don’t care if their shares go to $0. They want to see hedge funds go bankrupt. Trust me when I say that the price will hold until something changes.

Now, the shorts have not unwound their position. I don’t believe for a second that Melvin Capital has covered their shorts. Doing so would mean that they are bankrupt and they would have to liquidate all of their long positions. It is obvious that they are doing every trick in the book to manipulate the market to try to drive the price down but for the reasons already discussed, has not and will not work. We know this because the short interest is still at 121%. They can’t cover their shorts because doing so at these prices mean that even if they liquidate all of their other holdings and blow up, it wouldn’t be sufficient to cover. If they liquidate their similarly leveraged long positions, it likely would trigger a sell-off leading to a cascade of liquidations spreading to other larger hedge funds since they are all essentially copy-pastas and run the same playbook. It will quickly cascade to the level of large investment banks like Goldman Sachs like a series of dominos and then we run into a huge liquidity crises like what happened in March of 2020, except bigger since EVERYBODY are leveraged even higher now than they were in March. The market will crash 90%+ as everybody liquidates everything. This will set off the “dollar-wrecking ball” and the “dollar milkshake theory” that Jeff Snider and Brent Johnson have been talking about. It will be a financial Armageddon for the entire world. Pension funds, endowments, 401k, 90% of people’s retirements are going to go *poof*.This is what will happen if the “unlimited infinite squeeze” is allowed to happen and if people were allowed to buy as much $GME as their hearts desire. This is Scenario #1.

You see, if your are Melvin Capital, you can’t cover because you can’t go bankrupt. Because if you do, then you are the last Jenga brick that brings down the entire tower. Luckily for you, your “parent” hedge fund Citadel has Ben Bernanke as a senior advisor, which means that there is a direct line of communication between you and the highest levels of government, namely Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen. The conversation basically goes like this: “Hey, you need to do something because otherwise, we are going to blow up the entire financial system. You have the weekend to come up with a plan.”

So what will they do? To me, they only have one option. Scenario #2. Obviously, they won’t allow the infinite squeeze to happen, as it will cause the financial Armageddon that is Scenario #1. Therefore, they will have to stop trading on $GME and maybe $AMC and a handful of others on Monday- and this will likely come directly from the SEC. They can’t directly bail out Melvin Capital because it will be political suicide for the democrats. They will likely make Robinhood and Melvin Capital the scapegoats out of convenience. They will “punish” these two entities in an attempt to satisfy the public’s bloodlust by dragging Vlad Tenev and a handful of others in front of a congressional hearing and liquidate Melvin Capital. They will introduce new rules to restrict short selling and also ban options trading to retail investors citing “systemic risk”. They will “buy out” the retail investors who own these shares at likely Friday’s closing price of $325 to “protect the retail investor”. The Fed will print the money to do it. They will THINK that this will placate the public’s anger. But more importantly, they will prevent an imminent financial meltdown.

The American public’s anger will not be placated by the above move. There is so much latent anger built up from the Great Financial Crisis in 2008 that this will only add fuel to the flame. Except the anger will be directed at the establishment. The 40%+ that voted for Trump is already mad at the establishment. This will unite the rest of the country under the same cause. The facts that Ben Bernanke is a senior advisor at Citadel and that Janet Yellen is paid $800,000 in speaking fees from Citadel and Nancy Pelosi bought Tesla call options before Biden announced his new EV initiatives will be amplified. Burn it. The Fuck. Down. And inspired by Wallstreetbets the public have awakened to the realization that they actually have a weapon. Their savings. Ironically, they will weaponize the very stimulus checks that the governments are handing out. The psychology will be “If we can’t get rich, we’ll make sure you can’t either.” They will organize better (remember Wallstreetbets is now a 6 million strong army) and either try to continue to try to blow up short sellers or get more creative, or just simply withdraw all their savings from the stock market and engineer a sell off. THIS is the civil war. It is not right vs left. It is the renegades vs the establishment. And it’s champions will be the likes of Dave Portnoy, Chamath Palihapitya and DeepFuckingValue.

To prop up the market and prevent the entire financial system from melting down, the Fed will have no choice but to do QE infinity and continue to prop up asset prices and now with Janet Yellen in the Treasury, the debt will be directly monetized in the form of direct payments. This will finally cause the inflation, even hyperinflation that Lacy Hunt has warned about if the Fed were to directly monetize the treasury’s debt. Once inflation starts, like a horse out of a barn, it will be nearly impossible to rein it in without turning into Scenario #1. It will spiral out of control and cause incredible amount of pain to EVERYONE, globally, as every Central Bank will have to do the same if the US Fed monetizes the national debt. Once this happens, people will end up owning bitcoin not out of any moral justification or idealism that maximalists espouse, but because it will be the only thing that people will accept for payment for goods and services as the USD is destroyed as a store of value. This is Scenario #2. It will make Scenario #1 look like the Garden of Eden.

I hope I am wrong. But these are the only two possible scenarios I see. I am personally rooting for Scenario #1. At least we can come back from a Greater Depression. Scenario #2 will be a lot more painful for everyone involved. I rather people come to Bitcoin out of choice rather out of desperation. Either way, we’ll know Monday. Good luck Wallstreetbets. I am rooting for your infinite squeeze. Godspeed.",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,"Thoughts On What Creates Value (Long Piece, Sorry!)","You may be wondering why Robinhood was purposely limiting initial deposit transfers today on dogecoin. If all of these people had been allowed to purchase, doge would have likely reached at least dimepuppy, because so many people wanted to buy that apparently couldn’t.

You understand? This is still market manipulation, just slightly more covert in nature. Robinhood is counting on limiting new customers until the trend dies down and hopes that by the time account transfers will be possible in 5 days, that hype will have died down and volatility will have reduced.

What is giving doge it’s current rise and falls in value, despite the lack of limit on the coins available? You are watching the value of human sentiment as we speak. In other words, your voice online is still powerful no matter what the value of your doge is. The US dollar bill itself has value because at some point, we decided a paper that could be printed trillions of times and doesn’t have some kind of cap outside of regulation by the federal government could somehow purchase a much rarer item with a cap like gold or platinum.

As a culture, we decide the medium and what determines value. Which means that true value always has and always will come down to the people. And that’s why r/wallstreetbets was able to do what they did.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Case Study #EP2: DeFi,"Dear Redditors,

I've been reading a lot about DeFi lately and I thought about sharing some information about what DeFi is and what it consists of, especially for beginners.I’ve started the Case Study series with 2 coins of choice ([ADA and VET](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jve3mz/case_study_ep1/)), however, this time I’ll focus on DeFi as it is getting a lot of attention in the last few days, especially because of the GME stock case (check r/wallstreetbets if you don't know nothing about it). Most of the people don’t know what DeFi really is and we should try to educate them since we believe it is indeed the future of our economy and financial system. If this post gets attention, I might make more case studies explaining in a more detailed way what you can do thanks to DeFi.

I also want to promote discussion within the community, all of us are here for a reason and I don’t think pumping Doge is that reason. I want to learn as well as there’s still so much stuff to know. **Fool is one who wants to learn what he already knows.**

DeFi is expected to grow further in the coming years as you might be noticing in the last months.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Decentralized Finance?**

DeFi is the movement that allows users to utilize financial services such as borrowing, lending, and trading without the need to rely on centralized entities. These financial services are provided via Decentralized Applications (Dapps), in which a majority of them are currently deployed on the Ethereum platform.

DeFi is a set of products and services that acts as a replacement for institutions ranging from banking, insurance, bonds and money markets.

In order for DeFi Dapps to work, it usually requires collateral to be locked into smart contracts. The cumulative collateral locked in DeFi Dapps is often referred to as the Total Value Locked.

&amp;#x200B;

**Decentralized Finance vs Traditional Finance**

It’s tough for the unbanked to compete on a level field. The DeFi movement is about bridging these gaps and making finance accessible to everyone without any form of censorship. DeFi opens up huge windows of opportunities and allows users to access various financial instruments without any restriction.

&amp;#x200B;

Banks enable money to move around the world by providing value transfer services and much more. However, banks are managed by humans and governed by policies that are prone to mismanagement and corruption.

DeFi seeks to build a better financial landscape made possible by the advent of the internet and blockchain technology, particularly in three key segments of the banking system:

&amp;#x200B;

**Payment &amp; clearance system:**

Remittances involving banks worldwide typically take a few working days to complete and involve all sorts of fees. There may also be issues with documentation, anti-money laundering laws, privacy concerns, and more.

Cryptocurrencies that powers the DeFi movement allow you to bypass intermediaries who take the lion’s share of profits of these transfers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Accessibility:**

The World Bank estimates that as of 2017, there are 1.7 billion people who do not own an account at a financial institution and more than half of them are from developing nations.

Accessing DeFi Dapps only requires a person to have a mobile phone and internet access, as opposed to going through lengthy verification processes. The World Bank estimates that two-thirds of the 1.7 billion unbanked have access to mobile phones.

&amp;#x200B;

**Centralization &amp; Transparency:**

There is no way for regular investors like us to fully know what financial institutions do, however we did get a glimpse the last week with everything that is happening at wall street.

It will be different with DeFi. DeFi protocols built on top of public blockchains such as Ethereum are mostly open-sourced for audit and transparency purposes. They usually have decentralized governing organizations to ensure that everyone knows what is happening and that no bad actors can single-handedly make bad decisions.

DeFi protocols are written as lines of codes which run exactly as they are programmed to, and any flaws quickly become evident as it is open for public scrutiny. At the end of the day, DeFi’s biggest strength lies in being able to cut out intermediaries and operate with zero censorship.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Ecosystem**

DeFi Dapps stand to revolutionize traditional financial services by removing the need for any middlemen. However, it should be noted that DeFi in its current state is still highly nascent and experimental with many projects being rapidly improved upon daily.

**How Decentralized is DeFi?**

DeFi can be centralized, semi-decentralized and completely decentralized.

**Centralized**:

Characteristics: Custodial, uses centralized price feeds, centrally-determined interest rates, centrally-provided liquidity for margin calls.

Examples: Salt, BlockFi, Nexo and Celsius

&amp;#x200B;

**Semi-Decentralized** (has one or more of these characteristics but not all)

Characteristics: Non-custodial, decentralized price feeds, permissionless initiation of margin calls, permissionless margin liquidity, decentralized interest rate determination, decentralized platform development/updates.

Examples: Compound, MakerDAO, dYdX, bZx

&amp;#x200B;

**Completely Decentralized**

Characteristics: Every component is decentralized.

Examples: UniSwap, SushiSwap

&amp;#x200B;

**DeFi Key Categories:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Stablecoins**

The prices of cryptocurrencies are known to be extremely volatile. It is common for cryptocurrencies to have intraday swings of over 10%. To mitigate this volatility, stablecoins that are pegged to other stable assets such as the USD were created.

Decentralized stablecoins are created in a decentralized manner and are governed by decentralized autonomous organizations. Its reserves can be publicly audited by anyone. Stablecoins are important in making DeFi applications more accessible to everyone by having a stable store of value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lending and Borrowing**

Borrowing from banks comes with other restrictions such as having a good credit score and having sufficient collateral to convince the banks. Decentralized lending and borrowing remove this barrier, allowing anyone to collateralize their digital assets and use this to obtain loans.

&amp;#x200B;

**Exchanges**

To exchange one cryptocurrency to another, we can use exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance. Exchanges like these are centralized exchanges, meaning they are both the intermediaries and custodians of the assets being traded. Have you ever heard of “not your keys, not your coins”? Users of these exchanges do not have full control of their assets, putting their assets at risk in case the exchanges get hacked and are unable to repay their obligations.

Decentralized exchanges aim to solve this issue by allowing users to exchange cryptocurrencies without giving up custody of their coins. Without storing any funds on centralized exchanges, users do not need to trust the exchanges to stay solvent.

&amp;#x200B;

**Derivatives**

A derivative is a contract whose value is derived from another underlying asset such as stocks, commodities, currencies, indexes, bonds, or interest rates. Traders can use derivatives to hedge their positions and decrease their risk in any particular trade.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fund Management**

Fund management is the process of overseeing your assets and managing its cash flow to generate a return on your investments.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lottery**

Putting a DeFi spin onto lotteries allows for the removal of custodianship of the pooled capital unto a smart contract on the Ethereum Blockchain. With the modularity of DeFi, it is possible to link a simple lottery Dapp to another DeFi Dapp and create something of more value.

&amp;#x200B;

**Payments**

A key role of cryptocurrency is to allow decentralized and trustless value transfer between two parties. With the growth of DeFi, more creative payment methods are being innovated and experimented.

&amp;#x200B;

**Insurance**

Insurance is a risk management strategy in which an individual receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company in the event of an unfortunate incident. While most projects have gotten their codebases audited, we never know if the smart contracts are truly safe and there is always a possibility of a hack which may result in a loss.

dogecoin,"If your coins are not in a wallet, you are not in control.","Everyone saw how hard the internet pumped meme stocks last week and the people that run the exchanges don't want to get caught with their pants down like Robinhood did and get sued for not being able to handle the demand. There are also a lot of whales that run these exchanges that are buying up DOGE from all the panic selling going on because they know it's going to go nuts as the demand continues to increase. The meme is too powerful, and they are robbing the weak hands that got in the past few days. My prediction is that Robinhood and other easy to use apps may delist or restrict dogecoin sales even further once the real rally starts similar to how they delisted GME when it was hitting ATH. This is shady shit, but if u hold and start putting doge into an actual digital wallet ( example: [https://exodus.io](https://exodus.io) or the ones @ [https://dogecoin.com/](https://dogecoin.com/)) instead of listening to robinhood shills on reddit u will come out on top. The people that got in early before the last rally like myself know this because they are now so far IN the money that these tiny 50% dips are barely a dent in our gains and the HODLing continues, all the way to a dollar and beyond.

&amp;#x200B;

If your coins are not in a digital wallet, you are not in control. Would you hand some random guy on the street your real wallet stuffed with fiat money? smh.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: there's too much demand and the whales that run the exchanges are buying from green panic sellers before it takes off similar to the $GME meme so they can sell it right back to you when it's breaking new ATH next week and beyond.",cryptocurrency

# **Wall Street braces for bumpy trading in the week ahead as the GameStop short squeeze unfolds - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/wall-street-braces-for-bumpy-trading-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-unfolds.html)**
*****
&gt; Earnings news from Amazon and Alphabet, the important January jobs report and Washington’s discussion of stimulus could all be important to markets in the week ahead, but none of it is likely to get more attention than the short squeezes driven by retail investors.
*****
&gt; Stocks had a rocky week, with the S&amp;P 500 down 3.3% to 3,714. The S&amp;P was down 1.1% for January, its first negative month since October and a warning for the year, according to the old Wall Street adage.
*****
&gt; “We were due for some type of decline. We’ve been straight up since October. It’s not unusual that we’re backing off a bit,” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities.
*****
&gt; Trading could remain bumpy in the coming week, as the S&amp;P 500 struggles to hold above 3,716 its 50-day moving average and a key technical level.
*****
&gt; “This is the first time we’re at the 50-day moving average since early November,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “It’s just a level we haven’t seen in a while and it’s an important first line in the sand of whether the market uses this as a pivot spot to bounce again.”
*****
&gt; “The buy the dip mentality doesn’t die easy, but if you break that [50-day], that portends something else,” he said.
*****
&gt; Massocca and others see little impact on the broader market from the phenomena of retail investors piling into stocks that are being shorted by big investors. Fueled by no fee trading, retail investors created a flurry of trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment. If the stocks rise, in theory, the firms that are short sellers will have to buy stock to cover, and that activity could drive the price even higher in a so-called short squeeze.
*****
&gt; GameStop was the poster child for that trade this past week. GameStop shares closed 68% higher on Friday, bringing their gain for the week to 400%. The retailer’s shares hit a high of $483 on Jan. 28.
*****
&gt; “This is somewhat isolated,” Massocca said of trading in GameStop and other shorts. He said it may not be a phenomena for that long since there aren’t that many heavily shorted stocks. “I think they may be hunting new names.”
*****
&gt; The short squeeze story has garnered broad interest, in the general news media and from Washington.
*****
&gt; Lawmakers from both parties are eager to look into the fact that Robinhood and other online brokers restricted trading in the hottest short names when trading was frenzied. Robinhood said it was responding to SEC rules on net capital requirements and clearinghouse deposits that brokers have to comply with.
*****
&gt; “This was the busiest week for earnings reported with 82% of the companies reported better than expected earnings. It’s a really good quarter, but obviously overshadowed by the short squeeze news,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; He said some of the biggest tech names have been lagging, like Apple and Microsoft.
*****
&gt; “The combination of demanding valuations and short squeeze news has overshadowed a really good performance of corporate earnings so far,” Grohowski said. “We’re constructive on the market. Fundamentals do look encouraging to us.”
*****
&gt; Strategists have expected a pullback in the first part of the year, and many say it would become a buying opportunity. Hedge funds did sell long positions in the past week, but firms like Morgan Stanley and Barclays say the de-leveraging is not likely to have a big impact on stocks.
*****
&gt; But for investors who end up buying in at the end of the short squeezes, they could feel some pain.
*****
&gt; “I do think this isn’t going to end well,” said Grohowski. “These kind of one way trades they don’t end well particularly for those that come later to the party.”
*****
&gt; “I think this will be one of those,” he said. “GameStop is not worth what it is trading for today. I do believe at the end of the day the value of a company is important and it’s going to be driven by fundamentals. These dislocations and distortions of value, they will correct and many will be hurt by that.”
*****
&gt; But Grohowski said it’s encouraging that the surge in retail activity was driven by younger investors.
*****
&gt; “We’ve wanted for some time for this younger generation to be more interested in the financial markets and equity investing,” he said. “I know a lot of experienced market participants were not anticipating it being this way. It’s not just a one time kind of distortion.
*****
&gt; “I think this is thought-provoking in terms of a way a younger generation might be looking at investing, by their rules, not the rules of the traditional market participants,” Grohowski added.
*****
&gt; He expects the January employment report to get some attention Friday, and it should be weaker with just 50,000 to 60,000 jobs added.
*****
&gt; He said the markets will also monitor the progress of stimulus discussions in Washington, as valuations have risen on expectations of a package coming soon. President Joe Biden has proposed $1.9 trillion in spending, but Republicans are not in agreement.

&gt; # How Stocks Perform in a President’s First Year

&gt; 2021 kicks off the first year of a new four-year presidential cycle. One of the most popular questions we’ve received lately is how have stocks performed historically during this political year.

&gt; For starters, the S&amp;P 500 Index historically has gained 6.8% per year during the first year of the four-year presidential cycle, but stocks have done better when the president was re-elected than when someone new occupied the White House. This makes sense, as a new president could bring new policies and potential uncertainty. Additionally, stocks do better during years three and four under a new president, while they are much weaker early in the cycle.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breaking down all the quarters of the four-year presidential cycle shows that the first quarter of the first year in the cycle is one of only two quarters with a negative average return.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Bigger picture, historically the fourth quarter of the year has been the strongest of the year, with the first quarter the second best on average. Don’t forget, the third quarter is usually a weak one. Please note, below is for all years, not just the first year of the cycle.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.27.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We will take a closer look at February returns next week on the blog, but it is worth noting that when a new party is in power in the White House, historically stocks have struggled from late January until early March. “It is interesting, but from around the time of the inauguration to several weeks out, stocks tend to be pretty weak,” according to LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “It may be as simple as new leadership could bring with it new policies and added uncertainty”.

&gt; # Will GameStop Stop The Bull Market?

&gt; “In the short term, the market is a popularity contest. In the long term, the market is a weighing machine.” -Warren Buffett

&gt; The incredible action from some of the most heavily shorted names has investors everywhere wondering what it all means? GameStop (GME) specifically has taken the country’s imagination by storm, as the stock started the year under $20 per share and this morning nearly hit $500.

&gt; Please note, we aren’t allowed to discuss individual equities, and in no way are we recommending any stocks in this blog, but from a bigger perspective, what is happening here? Basically, individual investors are using message boards like Reddit to find some of the most shorted stocks, then they all pile in at the same time, forcing large institutions to cover their shorts, and thus producing massive buying pressure.

&gt; LPL Research doesn’t think these parabolic moves reflect an overall unhealthy market, but institutions covering shorts at sizable losses may be removing capital from some big cap names. “While these developments could be another sign of excessive optimism in certain segments of the equity markets, we do not believe they represent a sign of a broader market bubble or indicate a major correction is forthcoming,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Don’t forget, overall market breadth is extremely healthy and the credit markets are functioning just fine—we don’t see a repeat of 1999 like some are claiming.”

&gt; Lastly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, after a 72% rally in the S&amp;P 500 Index (and more in small caps and the Nasdaq), maybe it is simply time for a break. After all, the current bull market has tracked almost perfectly the start of the 1982 and 2009 bull markets thus far, and both of those took a break for a few months starting around this point in the cycle.

&gt; # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks at the End of 2020 and Now

&gt; In the table below, we show the 20 stocks in the Russell 3000 that currently have the highest short interest as a percentage of float. It should come as no surprise that GameStop (GME) still tops that list with 122.97% of float short as of the most recent data for mid-month. That is even after a 21.36 percentage point drop from the end of 2020 when 144.34% of shares were short. It was also the most heavily shorted stock then. The runner-up is Dillard's (DDS) which currently has 83.04% of shares sold short compared to over 90% at the end of 2020. Again, despite that sizeable decline in the percentage of shares sold short, it was also the second most heavily shorted stock one month ago. Of the rest of the top 20, there are six other names with lower short interest than the end of last year. Looking across the rest of the most heavily shorted stocks, Sumo Logic (SUMO), American Well Corp (AMWL), and Sunpower (SPWR) are the stocks that have seen their short interest as a percentage of equity float rise the most. In terms of stock price performance, SPWR has been the one with the biggest rally having doubled YTD. The only other stock that has doubled YTD in this cohort has been GME.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012921-Short-2.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we show the stocks that have seen the biggest changes in the percent of shares sold short between the end of 2020 and the most recent data as of January 15th. Those currently in the top 20 most shorted stocks are highlighted in gray. Across the entire Russell 3,000, 1,777 stocks have seen their short interest as a percent of short move lower in the two week period from the end of December to mid-January. As shown, even after the massive short squeeze that has taken place, GME is actually not the stock that has seen the biggest decline in shorts. Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) holds that title with a 22.62 percentage point decline. That is even though the stock has experienced a relatively smaller move than some of its peers. Granted, a number of other stocks like nCino (NCNO) and Berkeley Lights (BPYU) to name a few have actually moved lower so far in 2020 and have also seen their short interest decline significantly. On the other end of the spectrum, WW International (WW) has seen its short interest rise the most.

&gt; # Funding Markets Full of Cash

&gt; US funding markets are awash with liquidity thanks to ongoing QE purchases by the Fed and the progression of fiscal policy since the end of the year, as well as normal seasonal tailwinds that see more liquidity after year-end balance sheet constraints would roll off. Funding markets refer to collateralized, short-term lending via repo and related wholesale cash transactions.

&gt; Government money market funds that are allowed to conduct repo operations as well as buying Treasury and Agency debt are seeing roughly typical inflows, but those come on top of record share of overall money market funds. As a result, repo rates have been plunging. The secured overnight financing rate, which tracks the volume-weighted general collateral repo rate has fallen to 3 basis points above the bottom of the Fed Funds target range. While repo rates falling below the Fed Funds target range wouldn’t be a catastrophe and some parts of the market have gotten there, it’s not in the FOMC’s interest to have funding rates trading far outside its target policy rate range on a regular basis.

&gt; The solution already exists, of course: the NY Fed has a standing overnight reverse repo facility first introduced back in 2013 which is likely to start draining cash as investors seek higher returns than the repo markets offer. Reserve scarcity, which roll-off brought to bear in 2018 and 2019, is now reserve plenty, and so many reserves exist that the NY Fed will start draining them with reverse repos. Reserve balances will continue to grow this year thanks to QE purchases and an expected decline in the balance of the federal government's transaction account at the Federal Reserve.

&gt; # Federal Reserve Rebukes Hawkish Rumors; Reaffirms Support

&gt; It has been a busy past 12 months for the Federal Reserve (Fed), after the onset of the global pandemic prompted historic stimulus from monetary policymakers. With the economy showing signs of being in the early stages of expansion, some have speculated that the Fed may begin to slow the pace of its asset purchases. Recent comments from some Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members that have hinted that the Fed’s bond buying program could be reduced by the end of the year, has signaled that other policymakers may be thinking that way, too.

&gt; Adding fuel to the speculation, the 10-year Treasury yield has been climbing, breaking above 1% for the first time since March 2020 as the economy has expanded. Meanwhile, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, breakeven inflation rates—the yield difference between Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasuries—have risen to levels not seen since 2018, suggesting that inflation expectations are heating up, although levels still remain largely benign.

personalfinance,Best way to pay off my debt?,"Hiya! I’m 26. Work full time at $12/hr, 40 hours a week bringing home $398/week after taxes. 

Still in school full time and over 50% complete on my bachelors degree in Business Administration. School is a combination of Pell Grant and Loans with a typical student refund of $100-400 every 8 weeks. 

I have an emergency fund of $10k in a money market account at my credit union. This is partially because of my severance package and 401k from getting laid-off during the start of the pandemic. 

I currently have $8k left on my car loan @11%, and credit card debt. I’ve racked up some during my layoff from a 6k emergency dog surgery and from a major car repair of 7k. 

I currently save $50/week (since beginning my new job) in my savings account current balance is $500. Expenses is limited as I own my home free and clear (inheritance). 

What should I do to pay off this debt? Use all of my emergency fund except $1k as Dave Ramsey recommends? This emergency fund helps my peace of mind and keeps me calm as 10k has always been my goal (8 months of expenses). 

Interest Rates: 
Car Loan: 11%— 8k balance
Credit Union Card:  13%— 7k balance 
Airline Card: 22%— 3k balance 
CareCredit: 28%— 6k balance (interest free until 2022, dog surgery). 

I’d like to start focusing on retirement and throwing as much as possible towards it now so I’m able to retire at 59.5. I also would like more freedom in ability to travel (with a Hawaii trip planned for Sept 2021 if COVID is under control).",finance
dogecoin,Cashout? Right before our moment of triumph? I didn't wait 7 years for a few extra bucks,"Our whole lives we were told that the things we believed in would fail. We were told not to bother, don't get our hopes up, don't dream, don't hope....in 2014 I invested $200 into another 'failing' idea - a joke coin, a punchline....essentially, a waste of money from many others point of view - I proudly hodl'd....a friend who bought at the same time got out a year ago - he sold it all for some etitanic something coin and he was out. ""You must do what you feel is right"" was the advice I gave....I then stated loudly,

""I HODL!!""

Over the past 7 years we have been told countless times that Dogecoin would NEVER, EVER hit $.01! When it hit $.02 over a year ago I sniffed at the DogeCoin to USD calculator and said...

""I HODL!!""

Time went on, I kind of forgot about cryptos and focused a bit on small stock purchases here and there and working on my podcasts. When I started my podcasts I was told, ""it's a good idea but why bother, you can't compete with the bigger players"" , ""you will never get a huge following"", etc. i started noticing that the same criticisms that our little ShibeCoin got vs BTC, ETH, etc, I was getting with any idea that challenged the standard system. I am not saying my podcasts rival an audience like Joe Rogan or someone with 100s of thousands of listeners but the bottom line is when I wanted to stop my podcasts I chose to say

""I HODL!!""

Last month when we saw DogeCoin appear to stabilize at $.01, like many of you Shibes i thought it might be time to cash out - I was tired of believing, I was tired of the punchline being ""It's all good, I'm invested in DogeCoin!"" and I even forgot for a short period of time that 1 Doge is equal every single time to 1 Doge. While browsing Instagram one of my friends who posts 100% memes (you know the friend, we all have them) had a nerdy little quote we have all heard a billion times,

“The moment you're ready to quit is usually the moment right before the miracle happens. Don't give up.”

I then stated,

""I HODL!!""

Since I had a Robinhood account, I added funds and added to my DogeCoin collection. I bought a good amount and put my faith in it again.

Then I forgot all about it since we got Covid - my mind was elsewhere. Thankfully we are back to normal but yesterday morning I opened my Robinhood app and saw $.02.

Do I sell? Cash out and grab the USD and run? It would be a great profit.

Then it went up more.

The other night we hit $.07 - $.08

If I cashed out fully, I would have a lot of fiat money to play with....enough to make any investor happy with the payout....

I thought about it and it was tempting but i thought about what it would mean to cash out....it would mean turning away from Dogecoin, it would mean ending this journey...I decided that we are about to see a rise never before seen. Crypto is new territory, the rules of the experts are nonsense. They apply everything towards fiat - we are a new establishment and WE are making the rules. For the moment we use Fiat to compare but those moment are ticking away.

I believe DogeCoin has proven itself to be a valuable coin and just like BTC it will take some time to integrate it into our world but for me, I am waiting for a higher payout before selling off my beloved Shibe. Maybe it will go down to $.0002 again....that's the way the game can work but I have faith that at the end of the day, 1 Doge will ALWAYS equal 1 Doge....

personalfinance,Changing W4 Information,"Hello All.  Hoping someone can help me here.

 I had to adjust my W4 because my daughter is not a dependent anymore.  Was planning to change my deductions from 3 to 2, but the entire form was different.

I followed the instructions on the new W4 and submitted.

I received my first paycheck afterwards and there was a lot more federal tax withheld than before.

I used the IRS tax calculator with this latest withholding and it projects that I will have a $6700 refund at the end of the year......I do not want that.

How do I adjust line 4b in the W4 to get about $5000 of that back in my check and not in refund? 

Thank you for your assistance.",finance
dogecoin,Weekend update and some other things,"Doge will chill until the next pump . It could happen as early as Monday , but realistically you could be waiting weeks for the same levels to retrace. Hold steady if you are confident and not betting your life savings, it should eventually regain traction and pump up. If something can go 750% in one day; it can do better.

Meanwhile however if you do have other funds or are looking for a more safe investment, you should look into other alt coins . Why I am saying this is not to send interest in DOGE elsewhere but because if you are realistic and sensible, you should have a diverse and safer investment portfolio than 100% DOGE. 

You could go with bitcoin which will pretty much always safely appreciate at a good percentage . However obviously it’s a high price , and there are better opportunities for profit in crypto than Bitcoin for smaller retail investors ( like us ).

Ethereum is next in line, and actually I think this price even today has a lot of growth potential but if you don’t get into Ethereum soon , the entry point may end up being too high .(I’m looking for an entry under 1300, and a target of over 2000$ in the short term )

So that leads me to alt coins. There are plenty and surely I am only spreading my own personal bias, but these are the coins that Dogers can still get into.

Uniswap ~ 17$ today 
Algorand ~ 0.69 today ( niiice )
Tezos - 3$ today 
Stellar - 0.31 today


All the above coins have great growth potential and a low price entry compared to the value the coins could have in the future. More so, Algorand and Tezos allow staking at near or over 6% interest rate per year, which is a phenomenal interest rate, especially if the value of the coins increases over time as well. 



These are safer investments but not completely safe or guaranteed to do anything but in my opinion , much safer than DOGE coin , but I still hold DOGE as well , mostly for fun and in the off chance that it does hit 1$ one day. 


this post has been long, and I don’t know how many will appreciate or read it, but good luck out there, this isn’t financial advice , just some type of words from an autist ape 🦧",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I am left with 56% after income tax withholdings in New York. Is this normal?,"I just started a new job and even though I got a significant pay raise from my previous job and I expect to be paying more in taxes, at the first glance it looks like I am overpaying right now. 

Started on Jan 11, 2021.

My salary for 2021 is 200,000 with a 30,000 sign on bonus. I got my first paycheck yesterday (Jan 11 - Jan 15 &amp; Jan 16 - Jan 31, usually paid bi-monthly).

**Salary Earnings**

|**Jan 11-Jan 15**|3,787.88|
|:-|:-|
|**Jan 16-Jan 31**|8,333.33|

**Taxes (Salary)**

|**NY (FLI/EE)**| 61.94|
|:-|:-|
|**NY (Withholdings)**| 847.56|
|**NY (City Withholdings)**|491.44|
|**FED (MED/EE)**|175.82|
|**FED (OASDI/EE)**|751.79|
|**FED (Withholdings)**|3,011.38|
|**Total**|5,339.93|

**Taxes (on 30k Bonus)**

|**NY (FLI/EE)**|153.30|
|:-|:-|
|**NY (Withholdings)**|2,886.00|

|**FED (Withholdings)**|6,600.00|
|**Total**|13,209.30|

&amp;#x200B;

So after earning (salary + bonus) $42,121.21 so far this year, I paid $18,549.23, (44% total taxes/SS/Medicare withheld). Does this sound right to you? I realize NY state has one of the highest income taxes in the country, plus there is the city tax as well, but I paid way less in my last job (had around 64% left over after taxes instead of 56% earning around 130k).",finance

personalfinance,Auto Loan Payments Through a Local Credit Union Questions,"Got a car loan through dealership in 2016.  Experience with the dealership was awful, they were super shady about everything- however, family was moving and I was desperate to get a car immediately at the time due to a move/job change/new baby.  Dealership placed loan with a local credit union.  The credit union grants me no access to what I owe or how many payments I have left online, via e-mail, or via mail.  No statement, no coupon book, nothing.   I do get monthly e-mails to remind me to pay them (thanks for that LOL).  

The only thing I can do is pay online each month through their ""Make a Payment"" functionality on their website.  I do not get any kind of bill.  I've paid for over 4 years so I want to know how many payments I have left.  I call this place a few times and I always get the same answer, go to our website to see this information.  Well their website is my blank open credit union account with no money in it that they required I open so that I can make my loan payments to them (even though I do not ever use that account and there's no money in it).  So anyway, over the phone their numbers make zero sense.  They say I have an outstanding balance of $20,600, but I have 12 payments left.  My payments are $580.  My credit records show a balance of $21,100.  I ask them for a written record of what I owe and how many payments and they say to go to their website where that information isn't located.  I called them 6 months ago and it was 18 payments left and \~ $24,000 left.  

Question 1: Is this even legal?  Is my experience typical of auto loan credit unions or is this a shady one I'm dealing with?  They are a ""federal credit union"" located in Nebraska.  It seems really shady to me.  My wife's loan through Ford Credit, they couldn't wait to send us documentation.  

Question 2: Do they even have a valid debt?  They aren't willing to show me any documentation of anything in writing willingly and they just use misdirection to a useless website that has no information.

Question 3: I assume I really owe them $20,600 since that's consistent with my credit report- what's going to happen after I make 12 more payments?  I'm kind of hoping they've screwed up somehow and the payments will just go away...too much to hope probably?  20,600 / 580 = 36 payments.  Maybe they've got another loan somewhere tucked away for the other 24 payments?  

Thanks for any help or tips.",finance

I came across this thought and wanted to run it by the community:

I wonder what is going to happen to BlockFi Ethereum interest rates when ETH 2.0 staking happens.

Will that cause a spike or a decrease? If Eth Staking offers a higher yield than ETH yield on Blockfi, will people move out of Blockfi and these other yield farming platforms?

dogecoin,Hear me out. We can make Dogecoin the #1 currency in the world.,"TLDR: Get AMC to adopt Doge. It will be the world's greatest joke! Doge as the the number one global currency.

Dogecoin has an advantage over every other coin and currency in the world. The dog!!

People all over the world love dogs, thats pretty much the only thing every country could universally agree on. There's always gonna be a need for a global reserve currency. Every country gonna battle to have their leaders on the global currency. But everyone can agree on the dog.

The dog is more recognizable than the visa logo.

The doge is a mascot. Everyone loves sports and sports wouldn't be sports without mascots.

Compared to the Galactic Federation, Earth is just a tiny backwater town. And what do small backwater towns do? ELECT A DOG FOR A MAYOR! To prove to the Galactic Federation that the Earth can get its act together is to come up with a universal currency everyone can agree on. Its gonna be that dog!

Meme crypto is a joke currency, whats a bigger joke than convincing the whole world to use a dog on its global currency?

Doge needs to be adopted, and damn it, let's get AMC to adopt doge as a form of payment in 2021! That's how we start this. Remember Rick and Morty and the Mcdonalds Sezwan sauce. We can get AMC to adopt Doge in 2021. It will set in motion a series of events--the setup to the greatest punchline in history.

Why? Because a big enough joke is eventually taken seriously! Boris Johnson was a comedian until he got elected as Prime Minister of the UK. The phrase ""President Trump"" Circa 2012 was a joke until it stopped being funny. A global dog currency is a joke until the day it stops being funny.

Dogecoin as the global currency is entirely possible. We just gotta make it funny. That's OUR GME.

Make this our Battle Cry:
ONE DOLLAR ONE DOGE
ONE DOLLAR ONE DOGE
ONE DOLLAR ONE DOGE
(Because people will use it as payment if it resembles the dollar)

If we can get AMC to adopt Doge within the next several weeks (AS A JOKE...)we can set in motion a chain of events in creating history's greatest punchline. 

WSB with GME became about more than making money. A large chunk of retail investors were pumping money into GME to stick it to Wallstreet, it was more than just making money. Doge is about more than just making money. Let the whales get out now. Let the pumpers and dumpers exit. We're here to create history's greatest joke.

Have faith that the value of your doge is not in the numbers on the screen. Its in the doge logo. Lets get AMC to adopt doge in 2021. Doge army if you're listening, get AMC to adopt Doge.

Can you guys up the vote on this, pin it, copy and paste it, we need to orient and unify our troops with with a goal, and that goal, right now, today is to get AMC to adopt Doge.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I buy? vs. rent in high cost area,"Hi all, I'd like to know if you think my financial logic is sound. I'm getting a lot of pressure to buy a house but I don't want to jump into buying just any house.

I'm currently renting a house in a high cost of living area. The equivalent mortgage and property tax would be almost 2.5x our rental payment. The buy vs. rent calculators put the breakeven point at 16 years.

We have two young kids and high childcare costs, which are necessary to support our careers. We make above-average income and have decent retirement savings (thanks Fed for pumping the stock market), but no spare cash in our monthly budget or cash for a down payment, unless we worsened our childcare, and/or reduced contributions to retirement accounts.

It would be nice to buy a house to put down roots for our kids, and to be able to invest into a home we own (upgrade, remodel, landscape, etc.) Given the 16 year buy vs. rent breakeven duration though I think we should only buy a house that we really like that we can envision staying in for at least 16 years.

The problem is those houses are 50-100% more expensive than the value of the house we're renting. So for the time being I can't justify leaving our rental house, which is quite decent, all things considered. Another way to look at it is the houses that are clearly better than our rental house in all dimensions are all substantially more expensive (50-100% more). I'm not excited about increasing our housing costs 2.5x to buy a house that isn't clearly superior to our current home, that may be worse in some areas.

At the same time, my mother is pressuring me to buy a house (she would help with a down payment), and my wife would like to feel more settled, especially for the kids. So I'm torn. Additional factors are I'm loathe to take money from my mom because I don't want to give her leverage over my family, and my wife's parents bankrupted themselves with real estate speculation during the last bubble. Home prices in my area are at all time highs still.

What should I do?

What _I think_ I know so far:
- Cryptocurrency is the future, currently unregulated and relatively unexplored. Allows easier international trading and lower transaction fees.
- Bitcoin is the most reliable currency, that currently is at an unusually high value due to Elon's tweets.
- Dogecoin is a meme and shouldn't have been taken seriously. Promotes push and pull mentality, which isn't healthy for crypto.
- GME may have shone light of how the stock market is rigged to favor the rich, which may result in an influx of new crypto investors, myself included.
- NiceHash is an easy way to get started. Payouts in Bitcoin.
- GPUs must be clocked specifically for mining (lower core clocks, lower power limits, higher RAM clocks)
- Do not risk more than what I'm willing to lose.

- I should HODL as much as possible, right?
- What's the deal with reddit moons? It seems people are talking a lot about them recently.
- What's the tendency of mining? What I make in a day will slowly decline?
- How do I convert one cryptocurrency into another? Is it advisable to diversify?

economy,"Concern/questions about the economy if GME, AMC, etc. reach endgame","Hello my fellow Redditors. This is my first time posting on Reddit although I've been lurking for quite some time now. After about a week of following the WSB movement fairly closely a few friends and I started discussing what would happen if GME actually reaches a ridiculously high price of $5k or $10k...or even if it doesn't. Even if these hedge funds were forced to cover at the current price ($325 as I'm typing this), the current market cap is $22.67B. Considering that these corrupt assholes shorted around 140% of the GME stock, there is just no way that they'd be able to cover. Right? Which leads me to believe that even if these giant hedge funds go bust and liquidate to cover, there would still be an outstanding amount of shares that would have to be covered. At that point would the federal government have to step in and cover the rest of the shares? Who's going to pay the people holding shares?

personalfinance,Employer will not take out state taxes out of paycheck.,"Title. 

Live in Minnesota and work in South Dakota (USA). South Dakota does not have a state income tax, Minnesota does. AFAIK, as a Minnesotan I am to pay state income tax even though I work in another state. My concern is that my employer is not reporting wages on my W2 for another state, so if we submit a state income tax return for Minnesota there will be a mismatched amount. We want to make sure we are filing our taxes correctly. We’ve been told to e-file federally and then mail in our state earnings, but that, in general due to the unreliable nature of USPS, is not really an option for us. Any help would be appreciated, and please let me know if there’s anymore information that you all need.",finance

Some of the obvious plays on inflation are certain cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Stellar), commodities (Gold, Silver, Platinum), and mining companies (higher profit margins).

dogecoin,Dying Flame,"In the beginning the ashes from a cigarette held by a wealthy hedge fund manager drifted across the city sky witnessing humans interact and the impossible feats of architecture they were able to build. Slowly the little ember drifted, riding the swift breeze until finally landing in a dry patch of grass in some woods nearby. The small ember slowly started producing more and more smoke until a group of teenage youths came across this slowly glowing ember and decided to mess around with it. Each one took turns blowing on the smoking patch of grass until a small flame had appeared. Filled with awe an excitement the teenagers began grabbing sticks and twigs to further propel the growing flame. They caught sticks on fire and started dancing and frolicking around in the dim forest until they were exhausted. Not yet fully content, one of the youth decided to experiment and see just how big the fire could get. He lit the dry brown grass and watched in awe just how fast it spread. He moved onto a bush and in minutes it was fully engulfed in flames. The other members of the group decided that they had enough fun and wanted to leave. But the boy with the flame was stubborn and wanted to stay. The other members left scared at what might become of the rising smoke that was quickly accumulating. The boy decided to light an entire tree on fire. For half an hour he persisted but to no avail. One of the teenagers from the group came back to see what the boy with the flame had accomplished. He decided to pitch and help in his goal to light the tree on fire. Slowly they began piling sticks, twigs, and dry grass around the trunk of the tree. They lit it on fire hoping it would incinerate the giant tree. Slowly the base of the tree was engulfed in flames but wasn’t burning at the rate they had hoped. Soon the rest of the group came back amazed at what two people could do if they worked side by side. Together they each put in an organized effort to burn the tree towering over them. Eventually the flames rose to the top and the tree was covered in a raging blaze. Filled with joy they celebrated what they had accomplished. However as they looked around, they slowly began to realize that not only was the tree on fire, but so was the surrounding area. A real life portrayal of hell was standing right in front of them. Quickly they left the scene and watched from afar, observing the damage they had caused. The fire department came along and drowned the flames with water, slowly the smoke had dissipated from the original outbreak of the flames. As the commotion had died down, all the teens had left to go home except the boy with the flame. He went back to the scene and to his surprise he saw a small but intense ember that had somehow miraculously survived the efforts of the fire department extinguishing the flames. The boy with the flame decided that what he had witnessed was only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what he could accomplish with a small glowing ember. Even if the others decided they wouldn’t collaborate with him another time to recreate the unintentional inferno they had made, he was sure he would find others that would be eager and had faith to join and be a part of a collaborative effort. To all my HODLers, don’t let the small flame die out. Be the boy with the flame.🔥",cryptocurrency

investing,"Concern/questions about the economy if GME, AMC, etc. reach endgame (posted in r/economy too)","Hi everyone, I've already posted this in r/economy but I thought I'd drop it in here too. I've been on Reddit for a while but I never posted until today. I wanted to post on WSB but I did't have enough karma. 

After about a week of following the WSB movement fairly closely a few friends and I started discussing what would happen if GME actually reaches a ridiculously high price of $5k or $10k...or even if it doesn't. Even if these hedge funds were forced to cover at the current price ($325 as I'm typing this), the current market cap is $22.67B. Considering that these corrupt assholes shorted around 140% of the GME stock, there is just no way that they'd be able to cover. Right? Which leads me to believe that even if these giant hedge funds go bust and liquidate to cover, there would still be an outstanding amount of shares that would have to be covered. At that point would the federal government have to step in and cover the rest of the shares? Who's going to pay the people holding shares? I can only think back to 2008 where the federal government bailed out these large hedge funds after they defaulted. The thing that worries me here is that we're only talking about GME.

CryptoCurrency,The bullish case for dogecoin,"There seems to be a lot of FUD surround the idea that Dogecoin doesn't have a hard cap supply like bitcoin. I wanted to explore this idea and the part it plays in Dogecoin's long term success.

The less a PoW coin rewards its miners, the less secure a network becomes. As bitcoin gets closer to zero rewards per block it will rely more heavily on high transaction fees to pay miners. However fees could potentially drop dramatically as more and more bitcoin gets traded exclusively in DeFi, held in trusts like Grayscale or transacted on L2 with lightning.

If the transaction fees on the bitcoin network aren't high enough attack vectors will become increasingly cheap. PoW chains cost money to run and without that flow of income miners move to something that pays them. Dogecoin had mined its initial supply in 2014 and ran into this problem, so the controversial decision was made to create a fixed issuance to pay miners for that longterm security.

My rough calculations show Dogecoin's inflation is 3.9% per year. At the moment this is almost exactly the same as Litecoin's . The main difference being that dogecoin's supply will perpetually increase at a linear rate meaning that it will take 25 years for the inflation rate to get below 2% and another 50 for it to get below 1%.

For comparison at current prices Litecoin ($132.69) currently creates $350 million of new coins per year rewarded to miners where as Dogecoin ($0.026) creates $130 million worth. 

Dogecoin is merge mined with Litecoin. This Binance research article is worth reading on the subject [https://research.binance.com/en/analysis/merged-mining](https://research.binance.com/en/analysis/merged-mining) . Dogecoin may be the key to subsidizing Litecoin's security long term.

Doge is the lighthearted antidote to the distaste of crypto's holier than though attitude. It's a coin you can mine forever. It is a strong meme that has lasted the test of time. It might not beat bitcoin for store of value, but it has a better monetary policy than the USD and that's enough for me. 

Much wow.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"An updated and semi-comprehensive guide to buying, selling, and earning interest on Cryptocurrency in New York State (NY)","New York state is one of the hardest states in the US to get involved in cryptocurrency, thanks to the Bitlicense. I want to discuss some of the best places to buy, sell, and earn interest on your crypto in the Empire State, since there are no updated guides to navigating crypto in NY.

A lot has changed in the past year, so I am going to list the platforms I know work in NY state, so you don't have to go through the same arduous and complicated process that I did. **Keep in mind that this post is subject to change.**

# ""What major exchanges are offered in NY state?""

From my experience, you have three options:

# Coinbase

At the time of posting, you are able to buy and sell the following crypto in NY state:

BTC, ETH, BCH, LINK, LTC, XLM, ALGO, ZRX, BAT, CGLD, CVC, ATOM, DAI, MANA, ETC, NU, OMG, OXT, ZEC, USDC, AAVE, BAL, BAND, BNT, COMP, GRT, LRC, MKR, REN, SNX, UNI, WBTC, YFI, MATIC, SKL, ADA, OGN, NKN, RLC, ICP, MIR

You are able to DCA using Coinbase, but if you are working will small amounts of cash **I do not recommend using Coinbase to DCA; the fees are astronomical.** If you wish to save on fees, you can use Coinbase Pro which offers trading at much lower fees. You cannot, however, DCA using Coinbase Pro. There is also a **network fee** for withdrawing your crypto to an external wallet.

# Gemini

At the time of posting, you are able to buy and sell the following crypto in NY state:

BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC, LINK, ZEC, BAT, DAI, OXT, FIL ,AMP, COMP, PAXG, ZRX, BAL, CRV, MANA, KNC, MKR, REN, STORJ, SNX, UMA, UNI, YFI, AAVE, ENJ, BNT, SKL, GRT, 1INCH, LRC, SAND, INJ, LPT, BOND, CUBE, SUSHI, DOGE GUSD

Much like coinbase, you are able to DCA using, but if you are working will small amounts of cash **I do not recommend using Gemini to DCA; the fees are astronomical.** If you wish to save on fees, you can use Gemini Active Trader which offers trading at much lower fees. You cannot, however, DCA using Gemini Active Trader. Another advantage to Gemini is that it **offers 10 free withdrawals per month**, which Coinbase does not offer.

# Bitstamp

I do not personally use this exchange, but they are clear to operate in NY State. At the time of posting, you are able to buy and sell the following crypto in NY state:

BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, BCH, XLM, LINK, OMG, USDC, PAX

**There is no DCA option at all** for Bitstamp. Instead, you are able to deposit your fiat and trade, with **fees similar to that of Coinbase pro.** There is a **flat withdrawal fee** that is specific to the coin you wish to withdraw.


# ""What if I want to DCA into certain coins without crazy fees? What are my options?""

Sadly, there are not many options for DCAing into coins for NY state residents. Rather than using an exchange, we can use crypto brokers to DCA using a different fee system called a ""spread."" Most platforms in this category are not available to NY state residents, but I have found three that have worked decently well:

# AnchorUSD

This platform is relatively new, and offers crypto brokerage services similar to that of Voyager or Uphold (both of which are not available in NY state as of the time of posting). At the time of posting, you are able to buy and sell the following crypto in NY state:

BTC, ETH, LTC, LINK, ADA, DOT, XMR, XLM, XRP, ZEC, NANO, BAT, XTZ, DOGE, GRT, USDC, USDT, BCH, ATOM, EOS, ETC, DASH, UNI, MKR, YFI, SNX, OMG, ZRX, KNC, REP, REN, AAVE, DAI, COMP, TRX, FIL, KSM, WAVES, ICX, CRV, LRC, QTUM, MANA, SC, BNT, GNO, ANT, BAL, NMR, BAND, SUSHI, SKL, MATIC, UMA, NU, OCEAN, LSK

You are also able to earn interest on the crypto held in their wallet, which is paid out daily. The interest rates vary depending on what crypto you are holding. You are **able to DCA by setting up recurring purchases with no additional fee, except for the spread**. In my experience, the spread offered typically has the **price per coin about 1% higher than the major exchanges** at a given moment. The fees are much lower compared to Coinbase or Gemini. However, **there is a $15 purchasing minimum**. There is also a **network fee to withdraw** your crypto to an external wallet. Keep in mind, this platform is very new and your funds might take a while to clear. I have successfully bought and withdrawn my crypto from this platform, but it took a while for my funds to clear.

# CashApp

CashApp makes it very easy to DCA into BTC and with near-immediate withdrawals. **However, the only crypto supported is BTC.** You have the option to create recurring purchases and has **a fee of around 2%, although it decreases with higher buying amounts**. There are **no withdrawal fees** either. There is a **$10 purchasing minimum**. I purchase with a debit card every day, and only have to pay the 2% fee at the time of purchase, then immediately withdraw for free.

# Swan Bitcoin

I have not personally used this service, but according to their website they offer services to NY state residents. The app seems to work much like CashApp in the sense that you can **only purchase BTC**, but can set up DCA purchases at a lower rate than DCAing using an exchange. Their **fees seem to be similar to CashApp**, but do not seem to offer near-immediate withdrawals. From my understanding, **BTC purchases are automatically withdrawn to a wallet of your choice once a week, with no fees.** You can withdraw manually, but this might incur an additional fee.



# ""What if I want to purchase some low-cap altcoins that are not listed above?""

If you're a newbie, I would not recommend this section to you at all, but if you are ambitious, there are a few routes you could take. You can either try a non-KYC crypto-only exchange, a decentralized platform, or a centralized anonymous swap system. I will list out the ones I know about, but I am sure there are more out there you can try.

# KuCoin

KuCoin is a **crypto-only exchange that you can use without KYC**. In addition, it **does not block US IP addresses**, so you are free to trade on the platform without the fear of being shut out of your funds. **KuCoin offers so many coins** it would be pointless to list them all out here. Since it is crypto only, you would **need to deposit crypto or stablecoins to trade into the crypto of your choice**. The easiest way is to buy BTC, or ETH using the platforms listed above, or get USDC from Coinbase and transfer it over. 

KuCoin also offers **staking, soft-staking, and lending services** so you can lend/stake your crypto for passive income. The lending service is peer-to-peer, so someone needs to accept your lending offer at your listed rate in order to earn interest. Staking requires you to lock your funds for a given period to earn interest. Soft-staking is simply leaving the coin in their staking wallet to earn interest. 

There is **no DCA option** (unless you use their built-in trading bot), and there is a **flat withdrawal fee** that is specific to the coin you wish to withdraw.

# Uniswap (or other DEXes)

This is a great option for trading **ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum**. Platforms like Uniswap can be **accessed with most Ethereum wallets** on the market right now. Simply connect your Ethereum wallet to the DEX, and trade away. Nearly **any ERC-20 tokens on the market are up for grabs** using this method.

However, you will **need to pay fees using ETH**, and these **fees could be quite big** depending on how clogged up the network is.

# SimpleSwap

Another **crypto-only platform**, SimpleSwap makes things easy by simply **sending your crypto to a given wallet address, and receiving the equivalent value of another crypto of your choice to the wallet address you provide**. I know that sounds sketchy, but I have used it myself and it worked fine. SimpleSwap lists too many coins to mention here. The coin pairings are **given at market rate, so there are no fees**, per se. 



# ""What if I want to earn interest on my crypto? What platforms can I lend on?""

Aside from AnchorUSD and KuCoin mentioned above, there are not too many crypto lending platforms allowed in NY state. In addition to KuCoin and AnchorUSD, I do my lending on two additional platforms:

# Celsius Network

My personal favorite lending platform, Celsius offers high APYs on the following crypto in NY state:

BTC, ETH, USDC, CEL

Because NY state has crazy regulations, Celsius Network is only able to offer yield on the four mentioned above. You are also able to **take out a loan using your crypto as collateral**. Interest is **paid out and compounded weekly, every Monday.**

# Nexo

Nexo is similar to Celsius Network in that it can provide crypto lending services and take out loans. Nexo offers lending for the following crypto in NY state:

BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, USDC, PAX, TUSD, DAI, HUSD, BCH, LTC, EOS, BNB, XLM, PAXG, LINK, TRX

Nexo offers many coins, but slightly lower yield compared to that of Celsius. **Interest is paid out and compounded daily.**



# tl;dr

My recommended major exchange for larger purchases: **Gemini**

My recommended platform to DCA: **AnchorUSD** or **CashApp** for BTC

My recommended platform to trade low-cap altcoins: **KuCoin**

My recommended lending platform: **Celsius Network** and **Nexo**

I have been in the crypto space for a while, but I am just one person, so if there is a platform that I missed that might fit one of these categories, please comment and I can add it accordingly. 

As always, DYOR and this is not financial advice or a shilling of any particular company or coin. 

This took me a long time to put together, and I learned all of this through a lot of trial and error. I hope this helps out any fellow NYers navigate the crypto world much easier than I had to.

Cheers!

investing,Sectors with the most growth potential over the next 10-20 years,"I have been looking to invest in sectors that I believe will have the greatest chance of significant growth over the next 10 to 20 years.  Here is a list and a quick reason for my thinking about each sector: 

Electric vehicles/renewable energy- The future of automobiles is electric.  Almost all major auto makers are producing some line of electric vehicles, not to mention TESLA and NIO as fully eclectic companies with massive growth last year. 

Marijuana- The mj industry is still just beginning compared to where it will be at in 20 years from now.  More and more states will legalize allowing for huge growth especially if it is legalized on a federal level.  When/if it is legalized on a federal level, I  believe both the medical and recreational  aspects of mj will take a bigger role creating more consumers. 

Healthcare- According to AARP, 10,000 people turn 65 everyday in the United States.  Life expectancy will likely continue to lengthen creating more revenue on average per person over their life.  This number will only increase in the coming years as well.  Advancing healthcare technology such as stem cell research for example will continue to innovate and create new treatments and cures creating a bigger market and more growth.  

Autonomous technology-  Self driving cars, robots, AI, are all growing industries.  They are the way of the future.  Technology is advancing at an exponential pace creating exponential growth.  Self serving cars for citizens as well as self driving semi trucks are coming very soon.  There are companies already testing self driving semi trucks and they will possibly wipe out the human trucking industry within the next 10 years.

personalfinance,"Parents in legal trouble for tax fraud, my income is good but unorthodox, need a car. What are my options?","Been dealt a pretty shitty hand over the last year, but things are starting to look up-- and I'd be able to make them look up much faster if I can get a decent car.

I'm 21, credit score 660. Lived in the same apartment for nearly three years. My rent is currently $764 and will be dropping to $500 in August when I move into a house with my partner and another couple. Car insurance is still covered by my parents for now. No derogatory marks on my credit, but not a whole lot of history either. Recently opened my first card (a secured card) but haven't gotten a chance to use it yet. 

My old car is in title issue hell, related to my parents' tax fraud.) I want nothing to do with any vehicle in my parents' name given their legal problems &amp; cosigning is not an option for the same reason. I need to get myself completely independent from them, and this is the last step to doing that save for car insurance. 

My job evaporated with Covid *but* I was able to stay afloat from unemployment long enough to grow my YouTube channel &amp; get through the waitlist to do a litany of delivery apps-- my main gigs are Shipt and Postmates, which I've been doing for about 5 months, but I've also been approved for Instacart as of last week.

I've been borrowing an old F-150 from family for a few months now. The truck gets *shit* mileage so I don't drive as many deliveries as I could be, because it absolutely chugs gas and eats into my profits pretty majorly. I've also had to repair it once and still need to repair a headlight that has water leaking in from somewhere. 

The catch-22 is that if I don't drive, I can't make money, but because I'm driving the truck in a spread-out city, I barely make enough to pay for the gas, and it's essentially wasted time. Still, I've been doing it on and off for about 5 months now. But the truck has to go *now* as its registration has expired and the title is in the possession of the federal government. I'm at risk of getting pulled over and ticketed every time I drive it, and I honestly don't even trust that my parents are being truthful that the insurance is as they say it is. I'd already been driving it sparingly due to the MPG, only doing so when I needed the extra money, and while I've driven more this month to save for a down payment, it's still nowhere what I would be with a proper car. 

A friend did drive me to do orders in their Civic for four hours to help mitigate gas costs, as well as to get me a good idea of how much I stand to make when I can accept orders further away from my house (I live in a very large, spread out city.) Four hours of orders paid me $120, and this was 8 orders, most small, with a lot of $5 or even $0 tips. The Civic did ~30mpg and only used around 3 gallons of gas, but the car I'm looking at is a hybrid that gets ~45mpg city and 40 highway, so I could expect even less fuel cost. I would also be driving longer days (and accepting some further out promo orders) when I'm driving by myself and not on someone else's free time.

I had covid last month and didn't make any money. I claimed unemployment for those weeks and got the extra $300 per week. But it's going to show a gap in my paychecks; both from Shipt/Postmates as I couldn't drive, and YouTube as I didn't upload. When I did resume uploading, I experienced a bunch of growth. My subs nearly doubled &amp; my YouTube check went from $300 in November to $3000 in January. 

This is obviously great, and why I feel comfortable putting a grand or two down on a car. But it's also got me worried, because the income is so new and has been inconsistent, both due to the illness which I have recovered from, and because of the truck's gas mileage and mechanical problems which will obviously be solved by 
getting a decent car.  

I got preapproved for a car loan from Carvana through CreditKarma. They have approved me for the car I'd like (12.9k sticker, 14.8 out the door) with an $1100 down payment (which I have ready to go) and a $290 monthly payment. The APR is around 16%, but given my situation and limited credit history, I'm ready to swallow this pill. I need to start somewhere, and I need a car I can depend on, and that will use as little fuel as possible.

I know that financing a car with this credit &amp; my income situation is not the ideal move, but I do not want to get stuck with something that breaks or have to compromise gas mileage and reliability that I could get by financing a car in the $13k range, esp at risk of having the car blow up on me in two weeks if I was to buy something cash. &amp; put plainly, I'm tired of dumping cash into the F-150's gas tank when I could be spending 1/5 as much on gas &amp; saving the difference.

I went over my analytics and I can expect future months to do around $700-$900 if my impressions fall back to what they were pre-spike; if I get to enjoy the spike a little while longer, it will be more. Patreon has been growing as well, so that number will increase. I fully understand that these four income sources are relatively fluid and could make me more or less money at any point, but I've gone and figured a worst-case-scenario.

If I had nothing but shitty days on Shipt ($70 per day 4 days a week = $280/wk = $1120/mo) + slow YouTube month ($500/mo) + Patreon doesn't grow ($140/mo)... I'd still be making nearly $1800/mo. If I have a good month, it would easily be 2500 or 3000, and gaps can always be filled in by Postmates/Doordash orders at night or just driving more Shipt. 

I've really been thrown to the wolves and left to figure shit out myself the last couple of years. My friends have been very helpful and supportive to a point but none are in the fucked up situation I've been put in and some things are just beyond their experiences. It's shaken every aspect of my life from student loans to my car (that I paid for in cash, purchasing from my father) and I'm doing the best I can to figure out how to get myself stable, comfortable and happy. 

Am I making a reasonable decision? Will Carvana approve me under this circumstance or am I gonna have to wait until I've been at this a few months? Any other options/suggestions?",finance
personalfinance,Inheriting parents home with a large mortgage remaining,"Hi all,

with COVID things have been especially tough on my family (parents). They want to transfer the home to my name to

Dogecoin is an inflationary coin, that means there is no limit to how many coins can be produced. As the suppliers (miners) pump more coins in, they can just immediately sell and bring the cost down for us who are trading for it. (An imperfect analog would be the relationship between the USD and Federal reserve) This is why people keep mentioning the lack of a cap and how the price will inevitably go down, and how hype will result in a pump and dump.

**The Solution:**

Why doesn't the USD hyper inflate? Because people *actively use* the USD. If we want Dogecoin to actually reach one dollar (which is a long term goal, don't kid yourselves) - we need to get it actively circulating in online communities. This is where Dogecoin can actually beat out other cryptos, as it has exceptionally speedy transfer times. As it circulates as an internet currency, it actually has *value* as opposed to being simply a trading intermediary for fiat money.

We have a HUGE community now, so rather than using that influence to hype ""BUY BUY BUY"", we should be using that influence to push online services to accept payment through DOGE. (Keep holding though). Hell, even make a meme out of it - Pornhub already accepts it and we could maybe start with that ""online sex"" niche through only fans or something else. Idk, any suggestions on specifics would be welcome, but the general idea is sound.

Hate on this if you want, but I'm not trying to be a downer, just pragmatic. I've got 40,000 coins and am in this for the long haul, but we need to be smart about this rather than reactionary.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,I need a honest answer to this Bitcoin question,"I amp as pro bitcoin as anyone.  I have hodling since early 2014, without ever selling so much as a single Satoshi. I truly believe in everything about it.  I just need someone to get me a honest answer to a possible (and I feel likely situation).  

When bitcoin threatens world governments power, by threatening is monetary policy, what to keep them from colluding and banning it?  With taxing at extremely high rates, threats of jail time for holding, threatening businesses who accept it, etc?

solar,Thoughts on Home Solar Quote in DC,"Hi all-

New to solar, looking to get a residential system installed on my roof in DC. Leaned about how good the SREC market is here (currently trading at $435 per SREC) and I want in! Here’s the quote I’m considering:
$26,120
10.68kW system
$2.45/watt (pre-tax credit)
24 x REC Alpha 445 watt panels 
SolarEdge 7600 inverter
SolarEdge P505 power optimizers 

Based on my research, seems like a high quality panel and a pretty low price per watt. If I can generate about 12 SRECs a year, making $4800-$5000 a year, plus offsetting my electric bill of about $1,200 a year, and including about $6800 in tax credits (the 26% federal tax credit), I should be able to make back the up front costs in just over 3 years.

personalfinance,Is there a way to find out if I had a Roth IRA from my previous employer years ago?,"I'm moving from a W-2 to 1099. I have been doing solo work for more than 1 year now but it's been on and off.

Four or so years ago, when I was working for small claims firm as a file clerk. I remember my lawyer coworkers handing me some type of form. I left the job since but even after a year, they keep sending me a manila envelope that, if I remember correctly, displays paychex or shares.

So leads me to my question, I can try to contact them but I don't want to look stupid. I simply want to find out what that was for, if this is the case, do I have some kind of secret account where I've to accrue some savings? How likely is this? I don't remember if there was anything else taken from my check (besides the obvious, fed etc. taxes) so then can I just open a Roth IRA and maybe see if I have something that way by using my social as a reference?",finance
personalfinance,Help a young person learn about short term taxes?,"Hello, friends! I had a couple of questions regarding taxes regarding trading/stock income. I have searched and just wanted to confirm. Each question will be a bullet point.

* Is my understanding correct that no matter what trades occured in a year, win or loss, only the gross profit is taxed as income?

ie. Start at 5k, few trades later you have 10k. 5k is taxed.

OR

ie. Start at 5k, move up to 10k, lose 4k in a bad play. 1k is taxed.

* Are these taxes filed only on federal returns, or do income taxed states take a cut as well?

* Is there a website where I can plug in my expected work income and profit from trading that would spit out what I'll be paying in taxes, factoring in tax brackets and stuff?

* Related to the last question, is it as simple as ""put 25% of tax profit aside"" because my paychecks are having roughly 24-25% withheld?

* If I wanted to, I dunno, withold taxes? Is there a way to submit my share of taxes to the IRS ahead of time? Is there any disadvantage to letting money sit and cutting a check or bank transfer at tax time?

* Also related to the past few questions.. if I can indeed submit advance payment to the IRS, and submit more than I should be getting taxed, then I'd simply receive the excess as a tax return? 

Sorry, I'm just trying to wrap my head around this stuff. Ive done my own taxes for the past couple years via online tax places, but every year it seems there's more to learn.

CryptoCurrency,"What is stopping the federal government and financial institutions from imposing a ban on businesses accepting cryptocurrency, especially if a national, ‘regulated’ crypto is instituted?","Question in title. I have recently started buying crypto and have a ledger nano S. I’ve been putting a good amount of money into BTC/ETH/XRP and I will be investing some in Doge likely as well. My only concern is the question I’m raising, especially after seeing what India officials are discussing (banning private crypto). Any explanations would be great.",cryptocurrency
dogecoin,The Economics of Dogecoin.,"So there has been a lot of negativity from sellers and lurkers. After the sell offs I was sad to see that so many people got scared off. I've been thinking about more than just a $1, $10, $100 Doge. I've been thinking about the Economic evolution of humanity.

So here is some analysis:

Fiat Currency &amp; Crypto currency are the same in concept, however, they are technically different (in terms of minting, mining, application, large scale use, inflate rate). At the end of the day they are both currency. A means of exchange. Not a security, not a stock, not a company, but a measurement of value.

Lets have a look at Dogecoin. There are currently 127 Billion Doge circulating. At its peak this week. The market capitalization reached $9Bn dollars. Each time a new block is mined the reward is 10000 Doge. It will inflate maximum 5Bn coins per year, every year, forever. It is currently deflating (gaining value against the dollar) much faster than it is inflating.

Comparatively: There were $3.964 trillion circulating by November 2019 (seasonally adjusted). Of that, $1.705 trillion was currency and the rest of the amount was deposits. If you’re looking at money which isn't hard cash the number is about $90.4 trillion. The total market capitalization of the USA is 30,436,313 million. That writes out to $30,436,313,000,000 USD per year. The Dollar will inflate infinitely.

Now lets take in to account a rhetorical example:

What if you created Dogecoin in 1862? It was a literal coin and also had paper currency which was used absolutely everywhere. It has an assigned value that inflated and deflated as time passed and there was need or want for it. On top of that every year thousands, tens of thousands, millions of new Doge were minted and printed. It conducted all transactions no matter the where, how, or why. Its use then grew for 160 years. Congrats, thats the Dollar we know today.

Finance bros, Suits, Economists they're all asking ""But what really IS a cryptocurrency? Is it like a stock? Why does it have value?"" They don't even realize that would be like asking ""What's a dollar bill?"" In my opinion, Doge is extraoordinarily the closes cryptocurrency has gotten to wanting to be like Fiat. It's popular, people want to own it, they especially want to use it, everyone looking to the future knows it can be something magnificent.

""But what about the structure??"" You might ask. Well here's the Deal. In the US the FED mints new bills every year by the trillions. Every nation in the world has a Central Bank that mints their currency. Doge doesn't have a government it has something infinitely better: Developers and the Internet. Doge doesn't have a Central Bank printing new coins. It has thousands of independant miners. ""Wait what? No Government and no central bank just a bunch of randos I don't know setting the scrypt and mining the Doge? How the hell do I know they're not gonna just hoard it all for themselves?"" The answer to that question is a word that everybody hates: Inflation.

Let me create another rhetorical example. (Disconsidering governments, politics, and central banks) What if every person on earth decided to start buying and using the one of the most inflated currencies in the world: The Venezuelan Bolivar which is currently worth 10c USD? The sudden interest for VEF would skyrocket and it's value would deflate immensely in relation to the Dollar. It would spike constantly, crash constantly, each time peaking higher and crashing lower as more individuals kept buying on to VEF and giving value to it. Eventually it would match with the dollar as it gets exchanged. Fast forward five to ten decades from the point they were matched, a globally linked economy using VEF would have a value unimaginably higher than before. Every person, with an ever exploding population on earth would be using it.

That is what Dogecoin could be. Dogecoin isn't a pump and dump because there's no colluding main interest group to gain from it. It's not a pyramid scheme because there's no one at the top waiting to steal you money. When it spikes, many new people buy, many hold, some sell. It crashes. Those who most recently joined either continue to hold, buy more, and wait for the next spike. Those who bought at a high keep holding through the dip. It spikes again, EVEN MORE people including those who profited on the last spike buy. It crashes again. Each time there is a spike and a crash. The monetary and functional value that people give to Dogecoin increases. We are essentially speedrunning the life cycle of an emerging market currency. Just look at the stable price of Doge after every one of these cycles. IT ONLY GAINS VALUE.

Dogecoin isn't a joke anymore and anyone who is laughing at it will probably be dead from old age in 20-30 years. It can be the future of an interconnected economic world where your money is safer than it ever has been before. It has the hype. It is innovation that drives economies. People believe in Blockchain. People believe in Cryptocurrencies. People. Believe. In. Dogecoin.

personalfinance,Hoping for some advice or spotting something that I'm missing,"Shortly before covid19 hit I had just opened a small food service business which wiped out my savings. I was making an immediate \~$3k/month profit which seems okay to me for a new business.

The business was shutdown through the early months of covid19 eliminating all income. 

I was hit with major health issues and could no longer partake in the day to day of the business once I could reopen and now staff costs eat up all of the would be profit. 

I fell into the trap of living off credit cards while being unable to work, plus a few business costs that were needed. My debt isn't anything insane all things considered. It's at about $20k. 

My income is under $1000 a month. Bills are about $300/month and credit cards end up being about $500 paying just the minimums. Leaving me with little to nothing left over depending on the month.  I'm already on EBT for food and have a lawyer in the process of getting me on actual disability. I own my house outright so there is no rent to speak of. 

I haven't been able to make a dent in cards yet even with all the covid relief I've applied for (low interest rates, forbearance etc). I've tried obtaining loans but my credit went from 770 to 570 seemingly overnight when I was attempting that making it impossible to secure any type of loan. 

I have a prognosis of about 10 good years left health wise. I would like these years to not be absolutely miserable.  I have no family or support to speak of outside of professionals. The health issue has caused driving to be dangerous and legally is no longer allowed so transportation is another major issue. I'm forced to uber/lyft to the majority of doctor appointments which isn't exactly ideal or cheap. That either goes on cards or is taken out of the remnants of the monthly income. I live in a suburban hellscape without public transportation. 

I'm looking at ways to relieve financial stress. Anything that could help me with the credit card debt that I've missed. Some sort of additional income. Some sort of low interest loan option or equivalent to get rid of the cards. As it stands I'm just waiting around in hopes of disability to go through. I would still rather not rely on that  

I'm much more of a lurker than a poster but I do appreciate anyone who reads this or offers advice. I will be unlikely to respond much unless it's direct. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Turning 30 this year. What’s my next move?,"I’m coming here because I need some advice about what to do next. I have been good about locking down my budget and saving, but my life circumstances have changed pretty drastically in the last year. I’ve been single for the last 7 years, but that has now changed and we are preparing for marriage by December. My anticipated gross income for this year is likely to be \~40k, 28k of that comes from my $13.80/hr wage (yearly raise coming in March, probably substantial due to knocking my metrics out of the park) and the rest comes in steady incentives that I am confident I will receive based on past performance. Before anyone starts telling me to not budget based on my incentives, chill, because I don’t.

Expenses:

Rent (includes utilities and internet) – $550/month (split with roommates, gf and I don’t, can’t, and won’t cohabitate)

Phone - $51.25/month with T-mobile, unlimited everything

Various insurance (renter’s, health, dental, vision, life) -  $121.98/month

Groceries - $100/month. This one tends to fluctuate. This month I probably spent double this amount and could use some tips on reining it in.

Eating out (I can’t help myself) - $50/month

Supplements - $50/month

Loans/credit:

Student loan - $34.82 monthly payment, $2700 balance

No CC debt, I run as many expenses as possible through my cards and pay my balance in full monthly. I have a credit score of \~790, and I don’t have any secured debt to my name.

Savings:

Roth IRA – 15%, once I have maxed contributions for this out, I will start moving some % to 401k

HSA - $50/month

You are likely wondering what other saving I have done or am doing. I have a $5000 emergency fund that I keep in a CD for easy access. I figure by the time I actually have an emergency I won’t mind taking a small interest penalty. My HSA currently has about $4000 in it. I also keep $1000 in cash in a safe at home and I have a miscellaneous savings account for random unaccounted for expenses that I currently have $1000 in. I also keep a well-stocked pantry and have about 5-6 months of food and 3 weeks of jugged drinking water on hand at all times, and I keep a similar timeframe’s worth of non-perishable necessities like toiletries and soap. I am thinking of opening a side investment account besides my retirement account, but I have zero experience trading and I’m kind of intimidated by the prospect of it. Another thing you might be wondering is why I don’t have a car payment or fuel expense. This is because I don’t drive. My parents are toxic and never taught me. I am able to get by on getting rides from friends and neighbors to get to where I need to be, and I work from home. I’m working on getting my license now, and I anticipate getting it in the springtime. This raises another big question for me, which is whether or not I should purchase a car right away or keep doing what I’m doing until I get married. Currently I have $1500 saved up for a future vehicle, and I am not sure if I should continue contributing. I also keep $200 in cash on me at all times, and I keep a random $100 in my checking as a buffer for random ACH transactions I might have forgotten about.

This is where I want to start talking about my girlfriend’s (26) finances. I am definitely the more financially savvy one in the relationship. I don’t want to get too specific with her exact budget since we have decided we will handle our own stuff until we get married, but essentially, she is living not far from paycheck to paycheck and has about $5000 in medical collections outstanding with no other credit history. We are trying to figure out the best way to resolve the collections debts. My hope is that she can first negotiate the collections down substantially, and that she will be able to pick up enough extra work to pay everything off and start saving. If for whatever reason this is not possible, we were thinking of using her car (paid off, worth about $8k) as collateral on a secured loan to take care of whatever is left over. Ideally I’d want to put both our names on the loan because having a secured line will boost my credit, and using my credit will get her the best interest rate possible. The other thing we are thinking about doing is opening up a small $300 secured card to start her off on building a positive credit history. She also has no savings of any kind.

Finally, I have considerations for the marriage. We want to be as cheap as possible. I have a lot of newlywed friends who said they were able to do theirs on $5k, so that’s what I am shooting to save up. I will be working overtime this year to get us the amount needed for the wedding and all the trappings like rings and such. We will be renting, and I am reasonably sure that when we do get married the overall rent burden is going to decrease between the two of us.

So to sum up, here are the different options I have worked out for my extra income. Keep in mind that I anticipate an extra $800-1000 per month in incentives to play with as well. Let me know which ones you feel I should go with or prioritize over the others.

1. Open up a side investment account with $1000. Keep adding over time.

2. Go hard on the prepper stuff and get a year of long-term food storage, along with other self-sufficiency items like clothing, shoes, non-perishables, etc.

3. Continue saving for a vehicle with a down payment of $5k to ultimately purchase something reliable, or possibly as a down payment to lend for something 2-4 years old. (I am leaning toward this one to make sure me and the mrs are covered when her car bites the dust)

4. Pump the emergency fund some more to have about $10k in total liquid assets.

5. Add more to the retirement fund. I am currently sitting at about 16k, which I feel is weak for my age. Employer contributes 3% when I contribute 6%, and I am currently contributing 15% for a total of 18%.

6. Add more to the HSA. I don’t feel the need to do this since my OOP max on a family plan will be $2000, which means we’re already covered for 2 years. OOP max for me individually is $1500. My employer also contributes $750 a year here.

7. Pay off the student loan and be debt free. I am leaning against this just because the interest loss is so minimal that I feel like it’s more beneficial to keep the credit line on my credit report for longer, but maybe I’m wrong on that.

8. Pass over $1000 to the future wife so she can have an emergency fund.

9. Start saving for a home. I plan on using a first time homebuyer program where I only need $1000 down and 100% LTV will be financed.

I would also like to continue building my credit. One of my goals right now is to increase my overall credit limit to $30k. This is because I have a $10k card on a 6% interest rate (I do loans and we get an employee discount, woohoo), and this will be the ONLY card I use for emergencies. The idea here is that if I have to max out this card in an emergency, I will cut up my 3 other cards which are vastly inferior anyway so that my utilization won’t go above 30%. Currently I have a credit limit of 26-27k and I am wondering what card I should add to my deck. I am thinking of getting something with Mastercard because I only have Visas and I think it’s good prudence to have more than one processor. What cards would you guys recommend that don’t have monthly fees?",finance

Bitcoin,"Hear me out, this is a must-read for all bitcoiners: ""Endgame: The Unraveling"".","&gt;  ***""Endgame: The Unraveling"".***

https://medium.com/@fatherdoctorbitcoiner/endgame-the-unraveling-ccbbb5cd567b

The piece is mind-blowing in many ways, describes the situation that lead to this moment and the few possible scenarios, and have this clear: Any final scenario will be historic.

Bitcoin addressed here:

&gt; To prop up the market and prevent the entire financial system from melting down, the Fed will have no choice but to do QE infinity and continue to prop up asset prices and now with Janet Yellen in the Treasury, the debt will be directly monetized in the form of direct payments. This will finally cause the inflation, even hyperinflation that Lacy Hunt has warned about if the Fed were to directly monetize the treasury’s debt. Once inflation starts, like a horse out of a barn, it will be nearly impossible to rein it in without turning into Scenario #1. It will spiral out of control and cause incredible amount of pain to EVERYONE, globally, as every Central Bank will have to do the same if the US Fed monetizes the national debt. Once this happens, **people will end up owning bitcoin not out of any moral justification or idealism that maximalists espouse, but because it will be the only thing that people will accept for payment for goods and services as the USD is destroyed as a store of value.** This is Scenario #2. It will make Scenario #1 look like the Garden of Eden.

Also, regarding Bitcoin, one of the many ways this is relevant to Bitcoin users is this one:

Robbing Hood is going down, one way or another, next week or next month. There are hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of users holding what they may believe is ""Bitcoin"" there, it is not, but just an IOU. You can't even withdraw or transfer Bitcoin from there, you have to ""sell"" it for fiat first.

If you have ""Bitcoin"" there: DO SO NOW, get out whatever you have in Robbing Hood, in any way, before it blows up. You can continue holding and  supporting GME, AMC, etc. on more trusted platforms and  Hodling Bitcoin on your own hard wallet (""Not your keys, not your coins"") or on decentralized exchanges:

investing,An inside track on why WSB holding on GME and AMC is a good thing.,"*\*\*As a techie working for an investment firm these are my views and opinions*

# Three things all investment firms must do to calculate the exposure &amp; associated with their portfolios.

**HOW IT'S PRICED**

Financial instruments are priced using standard sets of formula ( you can find these anywhere online. )  These formula require in puts like interest rates, FX rates and bond yields as inputs.  To price on any day you use the rate as taken from the market data on that day.  The past is fixed, going back into the historical data will give you the old price.  The present is in motion so your accuracy depends on how quickly you can get the most up to date variables to put into your pricer.  


**SEEING THE FUTURE**

Because the future has not happened, the pricers need predicted trends of data as inputs in order to price future dates.  Whatever the key variables are for your pricer ( rates, yields etc. ) they must be forecast using a predictive model.  Executing the model and generating a future trend allows you to input the future rates of interest into your model.  But one predictive trend of rates is not enough.  You need to run the same prediction thousands of times over and take an average price.

**THE COST OF PREDICTING THE FUTURE.**

Each time a set of future rates are predicted they differ slightly from the previous run.  Each time you predict a set of rates the average on any predicted date changes slightly or a lot.  The amount each prediction differs from the average is called the deviation.  You should stop simulating when you reach a point where the average is only affected by a tiny amount ( for eg. .003% ) .  This is your convergence point.  If you multiply the time it takes to simulate each trend by the number of trend needed to converge you discover the cost of computing the future.  If you need 200K worth of AWS cloud power to predict the next 20 mins to only 70% accuracy then it may not be worth trying to see ahead.   Firms typically produce monthly capital and daily credit exposure reports.  In addition they may forecast PNL 5, 10, 30 years into the future.

# How WSB are scaring the funds and winning their war.

**THE MODEL IS BROKEN!**

The **models used by firms have been around for decades** and the method of forecasting ( Monte-carlo sims or Jump to fusion ) are also decades old.  It's stale.  Hedge fund Chads don't understand the math and they usually employee maths/tech geeks to do the dirty work while the chads cream the largest bonuses in the firms.

**Thanks to WSB these models no longer serve their purpose!!! They cannot factor in a HOLD of epic proportions!**

**THE HUNTERS ARE BECOMING THE HUNTED.**

Fund traders are under pressure to perform, the market has not been generating enough volatility or wealth for their greed.  The current bull run is a product of Trump allowing major corps huge tax breaks, which in turn fuel huge stock buy backs, which in turn fuels the market.  Massive repo lending is rampant to keep the books in the black.  And after seeing indexes rise to unprecedented levels everyone is now poised for the fire-sale!

WSB, particularly on GME, completely turned the strategy on the hunter.  No one can predict what the ""MOB"" will do next.  One wrong step could bankrupt a firm!

**THE FUTURE IS UNWRITTEN NOW.**

The models cannot cope.  Chads cannot produce accurate forecasts because any ticker could be the beneficiary of a unforseen buy frenzy.  WSB is getting between the bully and the victim.  **Diamond fists are landing heavy blows.**  Imagine a 1890s prize fighter standing ""orthodox"", fists out, chin back, *""according to the book""*.  This privileged and arrogant bully has stepped into the ring Roy Jones Junior at his prime! The funds are being made fools of

**THE FUNDS RUNNING TO THE REGULATOR!**

The funds now want the little guy taken out of the game because it isn't fair that the firms don't know how to factor that behavior into their dated business models.  It was OK for the funds to benefit from misery because there was no rule obstructing them from doing that.  But it's not OK for the little guy to simply buy and hold, because that hurts the fund's game.  Shorting is risky with potentially unlimited loss!  But despite that being a known fact, the firms should be allowed to exit the squeeze because ""We didn't mean to lose money shorting!""

In one word HOLD!",finance

My wife and I will be changing jobs and moving to a new down; with very different incomes.

I estimate my wife’s taxable earnings to be $225k and my taxable earnings to be $70k.

The online W4APP is the dumbest tool in the world, and is literally only useful if you ALREADY are receiving paychecks and have a withholding amount.

I’m trying to figure out:

1. How much fed tax withholdings would my wife incur assuming I am working for the above salary?
2. How much fed tax withholding would my wife incur assuming I have 0 income?

My wife currently makes $50k taxable wages. With this substantial increase in just forecasting income to combine with our current budget so that I can determine a safe amount of monthly mortgage payments.

Any help on how to do the calculations would be so fantastic!!

Edit: thank you folks! By manually calculating an amount using MFJ rates and adding the additional withholdings from form W-4 OR by using the online tool and entering $0 withholdings to get to the end, I got an estimated bi-weekly tax bill that is the same!

investing,Regarding influential data factors,"Unimportant preface:  


I've been looking into neural network AI lately, and in short they take in some data, process it through various equations and variables, and spit out however many numbers you ask them to.  
They start out absolutely clueless, and they get better as they're trained with more data.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Important preface:

&amp;#x200B;

I know that an AI will likely never be powerful enough to predict stock price changes beyond normalizing the curve of a price over time graph, or worse, pure chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, I am going to create this AI, even knowing that when I see the strike rate for the training processes it will almost certainly be a sub 60% accuracy; no better than chance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hypothesis:

&amp;#x200B;

Bear in mind I'm a novice in the field of investing and likely won't do any for several years, my current theory is this: the information given to the AI will include % rise/fall in the past trading year (or max term for new markets), % rise/fall in the past month, % rise/fall in the past week, % rise/fall between the last closing price and the one prior to it. The output or response the AI will give will consist of 2 outputs: how sure it is the price will rise and how sure it is the price will fall. This information will then be processed with some basic high school math to return information to the user in a way that is useful.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Concerns:

&amp;#x200B;

Just one aside from what was mentioned in the preface; this isn't enough or isn't useful data that is being fed into the system. While an experienced human might be able to use this data to inform a hunch or recognize a pattern, AI aren't blessed with gut instinct or familiarity. When it comes down to it, AI are a complex probability formula.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Study plans:

&amp;#x200B;

I want to create various modelling methods (mainly to better learn AI software creation) that use different data inputs, and with each of those train them in different ways, eg, across the whole exchange, across a specific few similar companies, across companies tied by their trade/industry, across one individual company.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Research and feedback:

&amp;#x200B;

I have just two simple questions, along with a thank you to those who have read this far.  


1. What numerical or other non-abstract information do you find useful in decision making of whether to buy, sell, or hold on your investments?
2. When trading, do you prefer to focus down one company, one trade/industry, or do you allow for any stock provided you can see a trend and be sure of your investment? Or perhaps some other definition of what you will trade that I haven't mentioned?

Any answers to this would be very useful to my work here and highly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

The research I have already done is mostly reading page after page of reports, stories, successes, and failures, and of course understanding what kind of mess allowed for the folks over at WallStreetBets to manipulate the market so strongly.

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond reading, I have been paper trading FTSE in the past month and it has taught me that most of what I was told about spotting trends is nonsense, and that is really does require human experience. In week one my pretend £5,000 took a significant hit, and now at the end of week 4 I'm yet to break even. I will definitely be continuing on paper for at least 12 months more, and hopefully expanding to other markets as well as learning shorts, options, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

&amp;#x200B;

While the experiment is yet to be conducted, I will preemptively  conclude that it will be a failure for the prediction side of things, as well as conclude that it is impractical to use an AI for any financial decisions beyond finding the best WiFi contract for the lowest price.

There is no reason for me to believe that my bank balance could do anything but decrease if the AI was in control.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate:

&amp;#x200B;

I will not be using an AI to guide my financial decisions as that would be more irresponsible than drunk driving.

The main purpose is to educate myself on AI production as well as the stock market, and start looking for algorithmic ways of trading that can make reliable yet small returns.",finance
Trading,"Everyone's got guns, but do you have bullets? Well, here is some good ammo for you! Anatomy Of A Short Attack - This a repost of an older article but it will blow your mind because of how accurately it can be applied to today's situation with GME stock! Please read carefully!","Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

**Typical tactics include the following:**

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.

Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

**Media Assault -**

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the *Wall Street Journal*, *Barrons*, the *New York Times*, Gannett Publications (*USA Today* and the *Arizona Republic*), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in *USA Today* during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven *USA Today* editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

&gt;When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

[VIDEO IS RIGHT HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=dehurlock)

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.

**Analyst Reports -**

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

**Planting moles in target companies -**

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

**Frivolous SEC investigations -**

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

**Class Action lawsuits -**

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc. -

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.

**Pulling margin from long customers -**

The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover. (Click here for more on [Pulling Margin](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS8PullingMargin.html)).

**Paid bashers -**

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for [Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS16ConfessionsOfAPaidStockBasher.html)).

***This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.***

**How Pervasive Is This?**

At any given point in time more than 100 emerging companies are under attack as described above. This is not to be confused with the day-to-day shorting that occurs in virtually every stock, which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume.

The success rate for short attacks is over ninety percent-a success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies. It is estimated that 1000 small companies have been put out of business by the shorts. Admittedly, not every small company deserves to succeed, but they do deserve a level playing field.

The secrecy that surrounds the shorts, the prime brokers, the DTC and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators, but the total is measured in billions of dollars. The problem is also international in scope.

personalfinance,"Should I double my car payment while student loans are paused, or attack student loans?","Car has a lower interest rate (1.99) but it is not on forbearance like the student loans are. The interest rates are higher on the student loans but spread across 7 loans. Some closer to 3.00, some closer to 5.00 interest rates.

I figured, double the car payment to work down the car principal while the student loans have no payments and 0 interest rate until September. Then switch back to focusing on student loans when forbearance is over. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,No point to savings accounts over checking with such low interest rates?,"My main bank is Chase, but I have my savings in a Synchrony ""high-yield"" savings account at a mere 0.55% APY. Used to be 2% but it's only gone down since January 2020.

But also, Chase savings pays essentially no interest (0.01%). Given this, there isn't any reason to put my savings into a withdrawal-locked savings account, right? Best to close out the Synchrony savings account into a second Chase checking, gaining instant access to emergency funds?

CryptoCurrency,"Why cryptocurrency is important. WSB, GME, Inflation, Corruption, Crash, Bailouts, etc","This is a longer post but I thought I would put my thoughts onto paper.  When I tell friends about cryptocurrency they always have lame no research criticism.  They also do not understand why it is important so I will tackle my view.

1. They say it has no value.  Bitcoin and crypto is the only competition to central banks, government currencies, the stock market, and the established Ponzi scheme that is our everyday money.  They print money with no end and distribute it into housing, stocks, etc.  The rich have more of these things then the average person so the money printing continues to increase the inequality wealth gap.  The money printing needs to keep increasing or there is a crash.  Interest rates need to be set just right or there is a crash.  If there is a crash the rich establishments get bailed out and the everyday investor loses their money.  The years following a crash the everyday investor also pays more in taxes to pay for the bailouts.  Wealthy companies somehow weasel out of taxes with overseas tax laws.  With all this going on why bother.  Why not just use an alternative now that we have it.  

My point is that bitcoin is the only competition to this scam that affects everyone.  Lets imagine google created a currency not tied to any government.  It is also the most secure database the world has ever seen.  It is also global, borderless and permission less.  Anyone can opt in without permission.  No transactions can be censored.  It cannot be shut down.  It runs completely independent of google or any other central authority because a central authority over money will always be incentivized to print more of it helping themselves and debasing the rest of the supply.  OH and it already has millions of users.  HOW DOES THAT HAVE NO VALUE!  THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SUPER IMPORTANT INVENTION DOES IT NOT!

2. They say it is used for illegal purposes....  Dude why would you use an immutable database that shows all your transactions.  Law enforcement can sudoku their way back to you.  If you wanna do something illegal use cash, or a gold bar.  Something that can not be easily tracked back to you.   

3. They say you can not buy anything with it.  One friend even compared it to apple pay... ""How is that any better than apple pay?""  This is also a joke.  Gold is not used to buy anything.  You do not walk into a store with a gold bar/pick axe and chop a piece off to pay for something.  Gold does not have value because you can buy things with it.  Gold has value because people believe you can use it for jewelry/electronics and it is rare.  Bitcoin can be used to buy things it is just not widely used as it is better to keep this asset that is finite.  It has the technological advantage over gold so it will be better integrated in the future as well.  Bitcoin has a greater use case and is much more scarce.  As for the apple pay argument these two things are not in competition at all.  Apple pay uses a government currency like USD to buy something.  It is not an investment.  It is not a competitor the central banks.  It is not anything like bitcoin.

4.  They say you can create an infinite amount of different cryptocurrencies therefore bitcoin is not scarce.  You can create another bitcoin but you can not copy its network.  All the people keeping the network secure makes bitcoin the most secure cryptocurrency.  You can create another internet.  Congratulations you created internet2.  You and your mom can connect to it and share a video from one computer to another.  When you want to return to the real world you go back to the one and only real internet.  

5. How does it help the WallStreetBets situation?  Well if you haven't noticed the wealthy established have scam after scam on their side.  Even when they lose to the average retail investor they weasel their way out of it.  Brokers block buying but not selling.... WHAT!  How is that legal.  Guess we should use the alternative that is decentralized exchanges.  If companies used cryptocurrency for shares instead of the stock market all buying and selling can not be censored/blocked.

6.  They say its a Ponzi scheme.  A Ponzi scheme is when new investors join and their money goes to old investors.  The new investors do not make their money back until they get money from even newer investors.  If you buy bitcoin you are taking bitcoin from the previous owner.  Therefore you take their spot in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Instead of being under them giving them your money you are replacing them.  Instead of losing your money and waiting for it to come back you are holding bitcoin.  You are holding an asset that has a limited supply.  Saying this is a Ponzi scheme is like calling buying and selling land a Ponzi scheme.  

Anyways just wanted to get this written down.  I know my writing kinda sucks so if you want to show your friends feel free to edit this to sound a bit better and more profound.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,2020 Tax Return,"Ok. So, trying to work through my taxes this year is turning into a nightmare. I work in restaurants and was laid off at the beginning of the pandemic, filed for unemployment and received the max benefit and chose to have the max amount of taxes withheld (NYC). I moved to Ohio in August for a new job and am filing taxes as a resident of Ohio where I still live. I have never owed any money before, but after entering all my wages and 1099 for unemployment I am showing as owing over 1k in federal (going to be offset by a 1k stimulus credit) and almost 3k in NY state taxes.

personalfinance,"First time home buying, what about a townhouse?","So to start, I am Canadian. I make a decent enough wage, above average for a single income, but I support my wife/daughter and thus below average for median household income. Currently I have virtually zero debt, a bit of cash saved and in about 3 months, I will have no debt and 2-3 full months emergency funds.   


Of course the entire world has been tossed into a paint mixer so nothing is guaranteed, but I am looking at saving for a ""starter home"". Canada offers a new home buyer credit that provides 5% down on a purchase (which requires you to put 5% down) of an existing house. Currently, I rent a 3 bed, 1.5 bath in a fourplex, so 1/4 of the building, in a bad area for the low price of $1100 a month. I was reading about the price-rent ratio, specifically if you are under 10%, it is foolish to rent and you should buy, over 20% you should rent and a purchase is a poor idea. A SFH in my area, that based on my income qualifies for the first time home buyer credits, would need to be a max of 4 times my annual pre-tax income, or around $280,000 max. Mortgage rates would put my monthly (actually bi weekly) at around $1400 a month, assuming I put the minimum 5%, got the 5% credit and had a decent market rate on a 25 year mortgage.  


All this said, most SFH homes start at $300,000 and very quickly go up. Anything under $300k is either requiring a ton of work, in a bad area or both. In my ""crappy"" neighborhood, SFH are staring around $350k, 3 bed 2 bath homes that need renos/updating. A recently posted, 64 year old 3 bed 2 bath 900sq/ft home with a decent sized lot is on the market for $375K and it definitely looks about 64 years old inside!  


Despite my burning desire to have a detached, SFH, I feel like that isn't going to happen. I don't mind my current rental property and $1100 is a screaming deal even considering the rough area, but I have a postage stamp sized yard, crappy insulation/windows (3-400 a month in utilities in winter) and my landlords eventually want to sell. So I started looking at townhouses with a preference to those in a duplex (1/2 a duplex) that tick my boxes. I would love to have a decent yard/patio and a garage. When I look at the market, more options open up in the sub $250k range for units like this, even some sub $200k. On $250k, I qualify for first time buyers credit of 5% and I would look at putting anywhere from 10-20% down total (includes 5% credit). Assuming 10%, on $250k I would be paying about $900 a month for the mortgage instead of $1100, but I know other expenses would need to be factored.  


My biggest concern is buying half a duplex and the neighbors. I have lived in duplex units/condos/apartments for 10+ years now with minimal issues, however all those have been single owner buildings. My last duplex, the neighbor was a decent enough guy and the landlord re-shingled the roof, removed a dead tree from my yard etc. In a half duplex I would own, I am concerned about the neighbor being more of a renter, or a first time buyer that transitions to renting the unit, making maintenance a hassle with them. The alternative is to buy the ""half duplex"" then if and when the chance comes up, buy the other half of the duplex to rent it myself, turn it all into a single family home (obviously that has its own challenges) or sell my half and get a single family dwelling. If I went down the ""buy to sell later"" route, It would be 6-10 or more years from now. Since that is getting close to my daughter leaving home, it might simply be ""downsize my life"" into an apartment or condo, but I don't know. I do know I don't want to live in my current rental for 10+ years. Like I said, my landlords are decent, but wanting to retire so they are putting less effort into the units, which means they aren't exactly in great shape.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr considering saving to purchase first home, specifically a townhouse unit in preferably a duplex to simplify maintenance, put open to other options price dependent. Curious about pitfalls, things to watch for or just general advice.",finance
Bitcoin,The Genius Of Michael Saylor,"This may end up in being quite a long post so please bear with me.

First a little background, in early 2018 I set up a company in the UK which since the beginning has been profitable, rather than take out the profits as wages or dividends, since July 2018 I’ve been using company profits to regularly buy Bitcoin.

For those who are interested in the technical aspects of how to do this it is quite simple. Bitcoin purchases can be made by a director of the company using their personal account at an exchange and then the company paying for the bitcoin via the DLA (Directors Loan Account) facility. As long as the company owned Bitcoin is ring fenced from any personal holdings, i.e. a separate wallet or address you’ll have no problems. In terms of accounting, I log all bitcoin purchases as an ‘Intangible Asset’ just like you would if you bought a domain name or trademark. When my end of year accounts are produced by my accountant the Bitcoin is shown as Investment at the price paid from the exchange (not the current book price).

I’ve been doing this for two and a half years now without a problem. Obviously save all the receipts and emails and make sure that the bitcoins are ring fenced and you should have no problems. By following this method (in the UK at least) your company can now legally own and hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset just like Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy is now doing.

In addition to this in May 2020 the government offered all companies something called a Bounce Back Loan where the company could borrow up to £50,000 at a very low interest rate. It was perfectly acceptable and within the rules to use this money to buy Bitcoin, which was around £8,000 at the time. For anyone that took advantage it's worked out very well.

In summary so far, it is possible that any business can buy and hold Bitcoin as part of their assets which is what MicroStrategy has recently started doing.

However there is a huge difference between what I have been doing and what Michael Saylor is doing and this is where things begin to get interesting.

As MicroStrategy is a $5 billion dollar plus company, they have the advantage of being able to issue corporate bonds which currently pay 0.75% interest, i.e. MicroStrategy has access to nearly unlimited amounts of near to free money. This money can then be used to buy Bitcoin at very little cost to the company.

In this respect MicroStrategy is not a special case, every company with a $1 billion market cap has access to the same facility, it’s just that MicroStrategy was the first to the Bitcoin corporate party.

Once other companies cotton on to this, we are going to see every company use this method to buy Bitcoin as a strategic asset at negligible cost. Those that do it first will be those that achieve the biggest gains.

So what we are going to see is that companies with near enough unlimited access to very cheap money start bidding up the price of Bitcoin, more and more companies will be chasing a ever smaller supply of Bitcoin.

Eventually I predict that Bitcoin could for a short time go ‘No Offer’ where Bitcoin is not available for ANY price. The mania of Dec 2017 will look tame in comparison to what is about to happen.

Under any normal circumstances such a situation would be cooled down by the Federal Reserve by increasing interest rates to a level where the trade was no longer seen as a one way bet. However the Fed have boxed themselves into a corner where even a 100 basis points increase could make the US Government not only be able to carry out its stated programs but could quite easily lead to a debt default aka bankruptcy. In other words the Fed is powerless to stop this from happening, and if anything will hasten it by further lowering interest rates either to zero or negative (in which case companies insanely would be paid to take out loans to buy Bitcoin).

What I have outlined above can’t be stopped and is going to happen this year.

It’s a genius play by Michael Saylor and the returns for MicroStrategy and long term holders will be off the scale.

As a side note…. We must also remember that all US dollars are created as debt, so when someone borrows $1000 it is created into existence by a bank. The key thing is that only the principle ($1000) is created but the money needed to pay the interest on the loan is NEVER created…. So where does the money come from to pay the interest? By creating more debt of course…. In order for the system to function properly a steady supply of new debt needs to be created so that not only the existing principles can be paid but also the associated interest as well.

What does this mean…..

Well in 2021 lots of businesses will be in survival mode, there will be no appetite for new debt (outside of the Saylor play) for expansion or new equipment. Without new debt being created the current system  will collapse as there will not be enough dollars to pay the interest on the outstanding debt. Therefore I predict that vast amounts of new debt (money) will be taken on by the government and handed out in the form of soft loans, grants, stimmy cheques, helicopter money, UBI, etc, etc.

The massive money printing required to keep the system from falling over as GDP tanks will also add fuel to the fire in terms of the price and demand for Bitcoin.

In synopsis…..

TLDR…. 1) It is easy for a company to own Bitcoin. 2) A perfect storm is brewing, nothing can be done to stop it, the price of Bitcoin has no upper limit, not only are we going to the Moon but to distant galaxies far, far away. Buckle up as things are going to get very interesting very quickly.",cryptocurrency

Many of us that are buying doge now don't see doge falling as time passes, due to its uncapped nature and ever more acceptance in the world as a legitimate currency. Doge coin will not become the new bitcoin as it has inherit inflation built in, but it definitely has the opportunity to become the new dollar or euro of the world that we control as being the initial adopters and holders of this coin.  My plan is to sell at peek once its become unsustainable, and then re-buy all into doge once it inevitably drops again to new ceiling.

2. My Student Loans - $28k, 6.25%, graduated payment plan currently at $200/month, although in forbearance through Sept 2021 because of COVID

4. Auto - $14k, 4.4%, $300/month

She wants to pay off the auto loan, because currently the student loans are in forbearance during COVID (and who knows, Biden might even do forgiveness), whereas we're still paying on the car every month.

I'd much rather pay off the student loans, especially hers. Those are very long term debt with high interest, whereas the auto loan will be paid off in about 3 more years.

I also understand that your platform is not for longer prose, so I have done what I could to keep the word count down, but I apologize for the length. I would love to discuss further with anyone interested in discussing currency exchange, as I don’t claim to know everything, and I understand that it is entirely possible that my understanding is incorrect about the subject or I failed to register a differentiating variable. Thank you to those who do read. 

I studied Economics, Finance, and International Business in regards to FOREX, and I was hoping to be able to dissect your venture. I understand that you all are excited, but the most important thing that I hope to bring attention to is that the concept of “Hold Never Sell” is extremely volatile. Not 100% catastrophic, but can be very dangerous. I understand that there has been a great deal of success in regards to GME, but the success of GME is mainly attributed to the shortsale behavior that required Hedge Funds to buy at Stop Loss values, driving up the prices further. (This is not present for your cryptocurrency). Firstly I will explain exactly why your currency (and any intermediary currency) is prone to the dangers and pitfalls of human behavior. Then I will discuss the negative mentality that I have seen, and lastly hope to discuss with you how you can continue your project in a manner that best works for everyone involved, instead of quickly inflating into the ponzi scheme that many accuse this community of being. 

Now, before you cast me aside as a naysayer or pessimist, I ask you to read further until the end. The prisoner's dilemma, as I’m sure most of the business students have heard of in your fundamental economic principles class, is the paradox of decision analysis and serves a great deal to explain the nature of the social aspect that can easily be applied to a “pump and dump”. To better understand what I am referring to, please look up the prisoner's dilemma chart, and place yourself as one user and everyone else in the market for dogecoin as th either user. As you can see, it is better for you in both regardless of what your opponent may do to sell early, but the overall best strategy for all involved would have been holding as far as value is concerned. As for the more mathematical scenario of a “pump and dump”, I will demonstrate with a short proof. Currencies with small backing, such as your currency, are statistically vulnerable to large influxes of capital. The value of the market of your dogecoin currently nestles a little below 9 billion dollars, or 9,000,000,000$. That does sound like a lot, and indeed, it is a large sum of money. However, as of January 6th, there is around 2.1 trillion dollars in circulation, or 2100000000000. *(Additionally, The United States dollar retains its value through the 143.3 million people required by federal law to use US dollars for their taxes. The demand for the dollar will always exist as long as that population exists and remains unchanged, and there is of course additional demands for the dollar through the many different international and domestic uses that governing bodies may utilize.)* To continue my proof however, with 9 billion dollars, your currency is susceptible to large sums of money pushing and pulling the value in one direction or another. A long speculative investment of 500 million by even one investor would easily spike your currency value to your desired levels, but upon seeing the 5% direct unrealized gains and the likely surge in popularity also driving unrealized gains, the rational speculator would then remove her 500 million + gains immediately after the fact. Infact, this immediate profit taking, combined with the lack of necessity for the currency itself, would likely yield disastrous results for the currency as a whole. Why doesn’t this occur as frequently on more established entities, well the answer is pretty simple. Scale. Large companies such as those traded on public indexes have cash volumes too large for significant speculative power. 10 dollars of dogecoin pushes dogecoin up further than a hundred dollars would push up Apple. 

Now of course to the part where I discuss your “Buy never sell”. DogeCoin is not a commodity. It is not finite by design, but instead operates in a manner similar to the United States dollar in that more can be added or subtracted if need be. Copper is a prime example of a commodity that people hold onto in times of crisis in particular, as there are many uses for copper and it is a finite resource. A community that holds a Buy Never Sell ideology on copper will likely be rewarded to at least some extent if they are large enough, but the first to break their pact will be the most rewarded. The price of copper per ounce will inevitably reach such points as being too pleasing to pass up, and as one breaks, they will relinquish their stores of copper, decreasing the price and spooking many of the others in this ideology. (A strong community can withstand some of this, but it is certainly an unnerving period to its climactic end.) To be a fiat currency is both an advantage and disadvantage, but the most important aspect is that Dogecoin does not hold an intrinsic value, and more dogecoin can indeed be mined. Most obviously, at some point in time in the very beginning of your project, there was likely someone who owned several million in your currency, but was unable to sell it regardless of the price. This serves to define the very pitfall of fiat currencies, in that their value is only what people place upon them, and in the case of dogecoin, there are more being introduced into circulation every year. *(Of course the argument can be made here that as it is the same quantity added every year, and with inflation, there will be diminishing additions every year. This would mean that coins will become more scarce over time, despite there being more added, thus increasing its value.)* This would increase the value of DogeCoin over time on a fixed growth model, but my counter to this argument would be that DogeCoin does have administration that is not infallible to change. They may increase or decrease the quantity supplied, and that in itself represents risk not dissimilar to the mere existence of the Federal Reserve. You are also taking the gamble of time. If the demand for dogecoins decreases, the diminishing returns will hardly serve to increase demand even if it is a means to scarcity.

Now to how you can utilize your strengths and overcome your weaknesses. As a fiat currency, there is no limit to the entrants of your community. Those asking for a cap to the amount of dogecoin are asking for the wrong thing. Yes, you would see explosive returns, but doing so would likely cause the destruction and profit taking behavior that everyone expects from ponzi schemes as people rush to collect from the now limited currency. Forget the concept of Dogecoin reaching the thousands in trade value with the dollar. Instead, if you are truly interested in maintaining the value of your currency, take proactive steps to merchant and trade in it. Don’t engage in the “Buy Never Sell” behavior, but instead try to find ways to buy and sell your currency in exchange for goods and services directly. Pay your neighbor 300 dogecoin to mow your lawn. Accept Dogecoin when someone uses it instead of venmo to pay you back for buying dinner. To you small business owners, find ways to accept dogecoin and other cryptos in virtual sales. To the Entrepreneurial, accept dogecoin for the service of assisting companies in being able to accept dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies in online transactions. Petition large corporations to accept this currency. Sure, the value of your currency will never reach parity with Bitcoin, or even Ether, but it will be far more stable and would likely last far longer than its older siblings. This is the only true way to avoid being a “Pump &amp; Dump” as it removes the explosive factor, encourages true growth, and maintains the necessary demand allowing users to exit and enter the market without deteriorating the value of the currency. 

And if I had to put a better estimate of what your targeted value should be, you should realistically hope to see true parity with the dollar in the next 12 - 16 months. However, if you follow the slower growth pattern, your final goal should be nothing more than 10 dollars per coin at absolute maximum, with five being a safe 3 year goal. Again, the more important goal being that, like the US dollar, the value of Dogecoin be allowed to float against it and benefit from the many stipulations that are imposed on government backed currencies but not imposed on the intermediary currencies. (IE stimulus packages.)

If you read the entirety of this paper, thank you for your time. I wish to be able to discuss this further. Also, if there is a mistake or I am missing something, please feel free to ask, I must have edited around a page and a half out of this in order to make it shorter for you all, so I would not be surprised in the slightest if I there is a case where I introduce a point, supply with evidence, but then do not fully connect my evidence as airtight as I should have. I hope you all have a wonderful day!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Saving for mid-term goals (i.e. 2-5 years away)- should I use a savings or investment account?,"Hi all! Reaching out for some advice on the most effective way to save for some upcoming financial goals for my boyfriend and I. We recently sat down to take a comprehensive look at our financials and realized we are in a good spot to take the next step on saving for a wedding and a house. 

**Background**

- Both of us make approx. $80K a year.
- We are both contributing 10% of our paychecks to our company sponsored 401K plans (both exceeding the employer match contribution).
- We both have met our targeted emergency savings amounts (full 6 months of expenses each) and have majority of those balances sitting in high-interest saving accounts.
- We just finished paying off our federal loans (yay!) and currently have no credit card debt.
- We recently set up Roth IRAs and will each be contributing $6000 per year to these.


Our next financial goals to save for are a wedding in around 2-3 years and buying a house in around 3-5 years. We have identified the dollar amounts we are aiming for and plan to put a good chunk of each paycheck towards these goals. Our question is....what is the most effective way to save for these goals? 


My initial thought is to keep the wedding funds in our savings accounts since we will want to take it out in a couple of years, but if there is a lower-risk investment option that makes more sense than that I would rather go that route. Our ""high interest"" savings account rate is pretty low these days as most are. I'm thinking since we have a bit longer on the house it makes more sense to invest in something like an index fund/ETF. But all of that being said, I'm feeling kind of stuck and not sure what the next move is.

Any insight is much appreciated!",finance
