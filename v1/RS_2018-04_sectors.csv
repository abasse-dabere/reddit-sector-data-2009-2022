personalfinance,Credit card interest fluctuations,"I’ve got some questions about credit card interest that I’m hoping someone can shed some light on. My credit is classified as Good, somewhere in the mid 700s according to various agencies. 


Do all credit cards only offer interest rates of around 24%? I’ve only been building good credit for about five years now but this is all I seem to be offered. Is there such a thing as a low interest credit card? 

Also, I have one credit card I use regularly, but don’t usually carry much of a balance. I’ve never been late on a payment, and will semi regularly pay off the entire balance at once. Yesterday I charged a TV, so around $700, and Mint notifies me that the credit company raised my interest rate!! It’s only by about 0.25% but still. That adds up. 

Are these things common? If not, why are they happening? Thanks!",finance

gaming,Please help me remember this old DOS game,"I remember it being a 3rd person fantasy adventure game. The graphics were great for the time. I must have played it in the early 90s.

I vaguely remember the main character having a ponytail. The game began with the character arriving at an abandoned town. There was a tavern, a church (I think). A little girl (I think) skipped about, and she would help us if we found her toy (doll or stuffed animal, I don't remember which).

I think that the character had to transform into a mouse or another small animal in order to progress into a certain area of the game. 

I remember there was a suit of armour that we found somewhere, but the main character was too weak to wear it, and walked around very slowly with the armour on. There was a lake were a lady appeared (as in the legend of King Arthur), but the main character would become scared and flee before being able to interact with her.

I was very intrigued by the game, but I was a kid so I wasn't able to progress much. I would love to revisit it now. I looked around for information over the years, but never found anything on the game.

personalfinance,Student loan consolidation,"Hey all!
I’m considering consolidating my private student loans and am wondering if I should do it now or pay them off further and consolidate later. I have five loans that total ~120,000, interest rates are 4.5% (variable), 6.9% mixed, and 6.8% and two at 8.8% fixed. If I consolidate all but the 4.5% interest rate loan, then I get a 6.5% fixed rate (with automatic payments and if I don’t set that up they bump the rate to 6.75). 

I have the following questions for you guys:

How will this affect my credit score?
Is 6.5% fixed a good interest rate?
Should I wait to consolidate when I have the principle loans paid off more?
If I consolidate now and want to consolidate in the future (a few years), will this also negatively affect my credit score?

Thanks!

EDIT: For those interested, here are the amounts for each loan:
1: $13,000 at 4.5% variable
2: $47,000 at 6.9% mixed
3: $15,000 at 6.89% fixed

personalfinance,"[California, USA] Need advice on how to manage 300k student loan debt.","I have about $320,000 in student loan debt from law school; I consolidated my loans (all which are federal Dept. of Ed. loans) with Navient at a 7.25%interest rate. I was paying $688/ month on the income-based repayment plan; my application for renewal was just approved again for 2018 and I am waiting from Navient to re-calculate my monthly payment (I'm not delinquent). As of now, my monthly payments are not even close to covering interest. I graduated in 2013 with less than 200k in student loan debt and it has ballooned since then.  

I take home about 6k/ month after taxes. My apartment is 1500/ month (cheap for Orange County), and my car payment is 388/ month. My other fixed monthly expenses include cable ($150), utilities ($80), car insurance ($70), and my current loan payment of 688. After a few other miscellaneous expenses (granted, probably spending more than I should be--for example travelling to visiting my family across the country about twice a year), I'm saving about $1500/ month. 

Here's my question: Does it make more sense to stay on the Income-Based Repayment plan to qualify for loan forgiveness after 25 years, or should I buckle down and dump $3k/ month into paying off my loan for the next ten years?

personalfinance,"Been scammed out of rent money, need options","I'll make this brief with my throwaway account because it's pretty embarrassing. 

My gf and I have been scammed out of $3000 which we threw down for rent + deposit on a rental house. We *thought* we were doing everything right, but now we can look back and the red flags were unfortunately pretty obvious.

I need to know what my options are as far as getting my money back. The $3k was an ACH transfer from my BECU to their Navy Federal CU account. Obviously I need to call ASAP tomorrow to report a fraud claim, but should I even be holding my breath to get even a temporary debit back to my account? Leading up to this, the scammer who was posing as the landlord, told us the transfer didn't go thru, so I called my bank to get it sorted out. Not an hour later they called us and told us the transfer went thru. And to me it seems like that would be the difference in getting it back.

By the time we talked to the *real* landlord and found out we had been scammed, he told us this isn't the first time this has happened, and that it was even being federally investigated. I don't know if that makes a difference, but I suppose it's a relevant detail.

personalfinance,Is refinancing my student loans worth it?,"I have several student loans with a 15 year payment period starting in mid 2008, so I have been paying on them for 10 years.  My interest rates are abysmal, and I know I should have refinanced them before, but I didn't, and now I am wondering if it is worth it to do so, since I now have started aggressively paying them off and should be done with them in the next 1.5-2 years.  Here is a breakdown of my loans.

* $28,357.58 - 12.250%
* $17,838.96 - 7.750%
* $4,792.56 - 11.500%

Total: $50,989.10

Below are the student loans I have already paid off, if that makes a difference.

* $2,625 - 2.350%
* $3,500 - 6.800%
* $5,500 - 6.800%
* $5,000 - 11.500%

Since the beginning of the year I have been putting $2800 a month toward the loans, which is ~$1600-$1800 overpayment each month, and I plan to continue putting that amount toward them until they are gone, as well as another $5k-10k per year when bonuses come around.

So my question now is, is it worth it to refinance my loans at this point?  I make about $130k a year, and my credit score is ~800, it looks like I can pretty easily get a fixed rate under 5% or less.  I just don't know if the interest on the refinanced loan will be frontloaded or something and my payment will be going mostly to interest or something silly like that?  Forgive my lack of knowledge around this subject, that is why I am here asking.

Do you have suggestions? Should I reconsolidate, or just pay off the highest ones and go from there? I've been working on my unsub loans the whole time I've been in college, I only have two left as you can see. However, I do have some higher interest ones at 4.5+. The average interest rate according to excel is about 4.08. I know if you consolidate you get the average interest rate +.125 so I'm guessing that would be around 4.2% on all my loans. I have $10600 in my bank account that I currently keep for emergency situations and will probably be transferring that over to a high yield savings account here in a month or so.

Would it even make sense for me to consolidate? Or should I just continue to pay them off little by little starting with the highest interest rate ones. Currently I'm working on #4 and #9.

investing,FirstEnergy plays?,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-01/coal-generator-that-trump-tried-to-save-files-for-bankruptcy

http://www.powermag.com/troubled-firstenergy-companies-seek-bankruptcy-protection/?pagenum=1

&gt; FirstEnergy Corp.’s competitive arm FirstEnergy Solutions (FES) and several key subsidiaries, including FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Co. (FENOC), on March 31 sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. FirstEnergy said the move would facilitate an “orderly financial restructuring” and accelerate its strategy to become a fully regulated utility.

&gt; In a much-criticized move, FES on March 29 also filed an application for an emergency order with the DOE under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, urging Energy Secretary Rick Perry to “find an emergency condition exists” in PJM’s region, and to force PJM to compensate at-risk merchant nuclear and coal plants to maintain stability of the grid.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-of-firstenergys-power-generation-businesses-file-for-bankruptcy-1522621469

&gt; The bankrupt FirstEnergy affiliates operate seven power facilities in Midwestern power markets where aggressive competition from cheaper gas-fired and renewable energy sources has undercut the economics of traditional nuclear and coal plants.

&gt; The FirstEnergy Corp. parent company isn’t part of the chapter 11 case, nor are other company subsidiaries that operate in regulated electricity markets. But creditors are considering asserting claims that the parent failed to honor its financial obligations to the bankrupt units, a person familiar with the matter said.

&gt; The company’s collection of coal and nuclear plants had been flirting with bankruptcy since last year when FirstEnergy announced it would exit competitive power markets and refocus on its regulated businesses.

&gt; As part of the bankruptcy, FirstEnergy Solutions is seeking to scrap its unprofitable contracts to buy power from wind- and solar-power plants. The company is asking a bankruptcy judge to step in and rule that FERC can’t force FirstEnergy to continue to honor the deals. 

&gt; FirstEnergy Solutions, which had 2017 revenue of $3.1 billion, plans to pursue a “dual-path exit from chapter 11”—either via a creditor-supported chapter 11 plan or the sale of some or all of the assets—according to court papers.

https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/coal-nuclear-plant-operator-files-for-bankruptcy-asks-trump-for-a-bailout/

&gt; Although FERC denied Perry's proposed rule in January, FirstEnergy is banking that Perry, and by extension the Trump Administration, would be willing to issue an emergency order to keep its plants running under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act. According to the DOE, that rule is meant to ensure grid operations during emergencies.

&gt; The rule was used six times between 2000 and 2008, in response to California's 2000 energy crisis and Hurricane Katrina, among other events. The rule wasn't used again until 2017, when the DOE permitted a coal generator to continue operation for four months at the Grand River Energy Center in Oklahoma while a new gas generator came online. It was also used in June 2017 to permit the limited run of two coal-fired generators in Virginia.

Based on my preliminary DD, FE is making a late/slow transition to natural gas plants. I'm still trying to determine how much revenue/profit FE's subsidiaries were contributing to FE.

FE severed their ties with FES the day before the bankruptcy filing (including denying FES from accessing FE's bank accounts), but it looks like some of the creditors are insisting that FE should be responsible for their bankrupt subsidiaries' debt.

I'm expecting the market to react as if FE itself is filing for bankruptcy in the short term.

In the long term, the question is how will those bankruptcies be handled (with creditors wanting to go after FE), if FE's subsidiaries can get government bailout using a rule that has been used before, and if FE can shift their business to avoid being crushed by cheap natural gas and stagnant electricity demand.

So here is my story. I owe taxes from last year still and I just had my taxes done for this year as well. I owe about $1500+ now for last years taxes and want to start paying them off now that I have a job again.

I was wondering if it would be best to start up a payment plan with the IRS to avoid and garnishments or levies on my bank account? Or could I just simply start sending chunks of money to the IRS each week/month of whatever I can afford at the time? For ex. Sending $150 one week and $300 the next if my budget allows it?

Also if I cannot pay off this years tax debt right away should I put as much money towards this years first before making payments towards last years debt? Or should I just let this years go into collections as well and it will all add together? Like will last year and this year combine to make a total that I owe the IRS? Or are they separate since they both have different interest rates so they are different entities? 

Last years debt is about $1500-1600 now and has collected interest for the past 12 months, and this year is $865. I have a child on the way so trying to save as much money as I can during this process so I am seeing what the best way to approach this is.

I refuse for it to be spunked up the wall stupidly, so I'd greatly appreciate some constructive advice please.

Options:

1. Pay back both sets of parents for lending us money for the ceremony and reception in a faster manner. Originally planned with them that we could pay them both back in full in 10 weeks total. I personally believe we should stick to the original plan and can have the money working smarter in other ways.
2. Place the lump sum in a ""higher"" interest savings account, which we still already have open from a previous savings scheme, which allows one to continue depositing funds (unlike a term deposit), however, a 90 day notice period is required to withdraw any amount. Interest rate is 1.80% pa and interest is paid monthly. No account keeping fees are paid. This could be the beginning of alterations needed for our house, or an official honeymoon next year.
3. Deposit the sum straight into the mortgage figure to reduce the total amount.
4. Place the lump sum in an offset account which is attached to the mortgage. The amount in the offset account effectively ""reduces"" the total of the mortgage which is apparently supposed to then result in lower amounts of interest paid. The funds in the offset can be withdrawn at any time, just like a normal savings account.

I am more partial to option 2, because in reality, we are better savers when the savings account is detached from our ""everyday"" account so we don't get tempted with withdrawing small amounts for little, frequent, unnecessary pleasures. I'm also a little skeptical about the dent options 3 or 4 could make in the mortgage, seeing as how the mortgage is ~84 times larger than the gift.

personalfinance,First time having money to save...but this feels like a REALLY bad time...,"So, quick background:
 My wife and I have had a relatively rough go over the past 10 years.  Over that time, she has gotten her law degree from a really good school, and I have picked up a master's from same.  However, both of our industries (law/media) have sucked over the past 10 years. Honestly, over that time, I don't think we've had more than 6 months at a time where we were BOTH full-time employed.  Also, we have 2 kids now.

BUT NOW!  Things have recently clicked over the past couple months.  We're both working, we're both in government jobs.  We even get to commute together!

Since we've gotten good at it, we can live off one of our salaries, and are working on saving the other in various means.  By the nature of our jobs, we're automatically contributing 6% of gross to our pension system (it's compulsory).  I'll be vested in mine come September, my wife not for 5 years.

We plunked down $2,500 in each of our kids' 529 plans and will be contributing about $250 each per month going forward.  We've also set up Roth 457 plans for ourselves (it's like a government worker's 401(k) but with no match but also fewer penalties for things like early withdrawal).  Going to be tossing in about $450 each per month in those.  We still have about $1,900/month to find homes for.  

Looking into online savings or maybe some sort of money market something-or-other since we don't have an emergency fund (going to build up about 6 mos).  We also have very little debt.  We've paid off all credit cards.  We have a mortgage that is very affordable (we fell into a super-lucky buy-a-house-in-city-with-issues grant and a very good lender).  We have a shitload of student loan debt but that's all on IDR plans and we're government workers, so hopefully the 10-year public service thing will not get killed by current admin.  And we owe about $10k on one of our two cars, but we owe that to my parents (they needed to get rid of a car, we needed one, we just set a plan up), not an actual car loan.

We've also been looking at saving for a down payment on a bigger home (needed), and having some money to invest and see what it does (maybe a brokerage account of some sort?).

**Here's where I need help:** Just this morning, there are articles out like [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/29/cramers-game-plan-if-you-cant-take-the-pain-do-some-selling.html](this) and [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/01/bank-of-america-the-market-is-right-in-the-eye-of-the-storm.html](this) and [https://www.ft.com/content/71ebfe74-35d8-11e8-8eee-e06bde01c544](this).  Our 529/457 plans have only been open a couple weeks, but we've already lost a total $120, which, I know, doesn't seem like much, but since we've never been able to ""invest"" in anything before, and while I'm pretty well read on the economy, it's different when it's real money that belongs to you!

So, what I'm trying to figure out is, since all signs point to a recession within the next year or two (we have one every 10 years at about this time), and fiscal/trade policy in Washington has been...less than clear, other than the Fed raising rates (which is bad for an economy)...what the hell should I be putting money in?  Our 457 is currently all in a Vanguard Target Date fund, and the 529s are in similar type funds from TIAA (70% in a ""regular"" fund, 30% in an ""aggressive"" fund).  Should I pull back into something more bond-heavy?  Should I just ride things out and continue current plans and ""buy the discount"" as it comes along, knowing that I'll (hopefully) recoup losses on the non-discounted investments I make?  Should I buy a more comfortable mattress to stuff everything under? Should I go whole hog into index funds or buy every neat-sounding IPO that comes along?

I guess what I'm trying to accomplish here is, now that I have the opportunity to make some money ""work for me,"" I want to make sure I don't screw it up.  This is new territory for me.",finance

personalfinance,I have been paying off my car early. I just discovered today that my payments were not going to principle only but instead were going first to any interest that would be accrued by the end of the 4-year loan. Is there anything I can do?,"The biggest reasons to pay my car off early is to avoid interest, to get rid of the debt, and to lower my monthly bills. 

My initial financed amount was $14,765 and because I was 20 with very little credit history, my interest rate was 11.13%. It is a 4 year loan. 

Fast forward 2 years to today, and I have a new job that allows me to make higher payments. I do it for the reasons stated above. I took a closer look at my account today to find out there's a small checkbox when making one-time payments, and it just says ""principal only"".  Turns out, the extra money I have payed (about $3450) first went to pay off the interest that I would have accrued in 4 years (approx $1650) so I only paid $1750 in principal. $1650 went to interest that I technically haven't accrued yet.

Obviously, if in paying early (expect to be paid off 2 years early) this seems like wasted money. Is there anything I can do? Am I SOL because I didn't read the fine print?

Bitcoin,5 Pro-Blockchain Bills Passed in Wyoming,"Great summary [HERE](https://soundcloud.com/mindtomatter/ltb-361-the-wyoming-way) on the Let's Talk Bitcoin podcast (Well worth the 45 minute listen). Also check out the [Wyoming Blockchain Coalition](http://wyomingblockchain.io/), and their [Telegram group](https://t.me/wyomingblockchain) - a very talented cast behind this coalition. 

Summary of the 5 bills that were passed [HERE](https://www.ethnews.com/wyoming-legislature-goes-all-in-on-blockchain-cryptocurrency-bills). This is positive news about regulation of crypto in the States. Well done and shoutouts to everyone who participated in this.

TL:DR

- Wyoming led the way when it passed the nation’s first LLC law in 1977, and it can again be first by offering the ability to register LLCs on a blockchain.

- Virtual currencies would immediately become exempt from Wyoming's money transmitter laws, which would pave the way for virtual currency exchanges to resume operations in the state.

- CLARITY in defining blockchain-based tokens. Utility tokens would immediately be exempted from Wyoming's securities laws

- To allow for blockchain-based records storage, shareholder management, and shareholder votes

- To create a property tax exemption for cryptocurrencies, like the exemptions that exist for cash, gold, and silver. Even if cryptocurrencies are exempt from Wyoming's state taxes, this does not mean that they will be exempt from federal taxes

personalfinance,"Have an extra $10k or so, pay off loans or make extra investment?","My wife and I have our budget established to try and maintain a certain minimum amount in our checking account.  I tracked spending and expenses for 2 years and we've adjusted our budget such that excess income is all directed towards investment accounts and as a result our checking balance stays relatively constant month to month.  

Over the past few months our checking balance has begun ticking up again, as we've both seen salary increases and modest raises while some of our expenses have decreased.  Our checking minimum target is $10,000 and we've seen the account swell to about $23,000.  We're already maxing out employer matches on our 401k, maxing Roth IRA contributions, and depositing what we thought would be the excess amount to a brokerage account.  Our debts right now are about $13,000 on low interest car loans and student loans.  Interest rates are all 2-3%.  Our total monthly payments on these loans are about $900.

I'm planning on readjusting our budget to make better use of the excess cash flow, but not sure what to do with this relatively small windfall of sorts.  In the long run it seems the ""smarter"" choice would be to stash in investments and continue paying off the low interest loans as scheduled, but the emotional win of getting them all off our ledger and seeing the $900/mo increase in cash flow is pretty appealing as well.

personalfinance,Roth IRA contribution advice,"Hey guys - I am pretty confused about whether I should make my 2017 Roth IRA contribution or not and would greatly appreciate any advice or insight from those who’ve faced similar situations.

Background: I’m a current first year MBA student, financing the full program cost with federal/private student loans. I don’t have much $ left in the bank and dumping $5500 into a Roth IRA account would be difficult, but not impossible. 

Dilemma: Due to getting married this year and  my expected income when I graduate, 2017 will most likely be the last year I would be eligible to contribute to this account. The thought of keeping $5500 in cash to get out of debt sooner/have disposable income when I’m back in the real world, sounds nice, but I worry I’m being short sighted and that the potential for interest free compounded returns in the Roth IRA will more than make up any interest I’d eat on $5500 in additional loans.",finance

Lets break it down. I am about to finish a MS program (Engineering w/ median starting wage ~  70 - 80k, ~5k/month). My wife and I have a family of 4. We are foster parents of two children. We receive roughly $1600 in monthly assistance to care for them, and medical/dental/vision insurance is provided (both continue till they are 18 if adopted). We need to remain in the city county to continue having these kids, I can't move until adoptions happen. My wife will receive a bit over 200K (projected) in inheritance. We have 74k in debt. About 4.5k of that is a car loan and the rest is student loans between the two of us. The weighted mean average interest rate of all the debt is 4.710%. I have about till August-September this year (2018) before my current income and living situation ends. This seems like plenty of time to work the angles and get a good job. My field is high demand. Here are my plans:

- Pay off the debt (~125k left)
- Stash away an emergency fund of 25k (~100k left)

Here is where I split:

- Rent and invest ~100k in index fund

OR

- Put down 100k on a home on a ~400k home (3 bedroom), and 1.5x the mortgage per month to scale down principal (~3k/month).

I am inclined towards buying a home. I have a family and intend on remaining within the home for 7 - 10 years. The cost of renting a 3 bedroom (another child likely to come) is between 2250 - 2750. 

Any thoughts? Will edit for additional details have to go for now.

EDIT:

My wife does not work. She is by choice a stay at home. Our current situation is stable, but that will no longer be the case come september.

I tried searching for this topic but didn't find my exact issue.

I have a Southwest card through Chase with a pretty high balance (about $12k).  I feel like we're just treading water with it.  We pay about $300-350 a month, but after interest, I feel like we aren't making much progress.  In the past I've had some luck when I contacted creditors and asked for reduced interest rates in order to pay my balance back.  Chase, however, said the only way to do this is to close the account entirely.  That would be a pretty big chunk of our available (though not currently available) credit, and our credit scores might take a hit.  So my primary question--Is it worth closing the account to get a grip on paying down that debt?  I hate having it hanging over our head.  I did look into the Chase Slate card, but I doubt I'll get approved for that since our utilization is so high. 

Unsure if this is relevant to my question, but just in case--we do have quite a bit of credit that we're currently paying off (it's been a rough year after a move).  I would estimate about $1500 a month in payments, BUT we have a couple 0% promotional purchases that end in July and both of our cars will be paid off by August.

ethereum,The Inflation Problem,"Bitcoin set out to solve the problem of a centralized organization (The Federal Reserve) controlling the printing of money. Bitcoin solved this problem by giving the right to print money to Code, because Code is Law. At the same time, it decided that a hard cap was a desirable feature. 

But the problem of centrally-controlled money printing wasn't solved by creating a hard cap, it was solved by putting code in control of the minting of new money. The hard cap is just a designers-choice that was made.

Having reasonable constant inflation that is controlled by code is an equally-viable answer to the centralized money printing problem. 

***Inflation is a good thing*** 
There is a reason why it exists. It allows economies to grow, without people hoarding all the currency. 

*This is especially important for ETH*

ETH gains its value through it's *network*

If we cap ETH supply, then people will hoard ETH rather than spend ETH, and if people hoard ETH, then it is less financially viable to produce new dApps, or innovate new smart-contracts, or create anything of value on the ETH network, because no-one is paying ETH to do those activities.

""The interesting case is if the fork reflects a fight between two groups about what the future of Bitcoin should be -- in other words, a rebellion in the Bitcoin community, where a subgroup decides to break off, because they think they have a better idea about how the system should be run. In that case, the two branches are rivals and will fight for market share. A-coin and B-coin will each try to persuade more merchants to accept it and more people to buy it. Each will want to be perceived as the ""real Bitcoin"". There may be a public-relations fight, where each claims legitimacy and portrays the other as a weird splinter group.

The probable outcomes is that one branch will eventually win and the other will fade away. These sorts of competitions tend to tip in one direction. Once one of the two is viewed as more legitimate and obtains a bigger market share, the network effect will prevail, and the other becomes a niche currency that will eventually fade away.

I graduated medical school in 2009, finished residency in 2013, and have been chipping away at the then $280,000 in loan debt accumulated during years of deferred federal financial servitude.

My current loans are broken up as follows:

* Consolidation Loans (consolidated 2006) 4.5% APR - $53,778.41

* Stafford Loans 6.5% APR - $145,204.66

* Total - $198,983.07

* Monthly payment - $2680 (IDR)

* Time to pay off (calculated from a loan calculator/spreadsheet) ~7.5 years



SoFi Options (using $200,000 to round/average and data from their site):

* 5 year    $3638.35/mo 3.25% APR  $60,359 savings

* 7 year    $2756.84/mo  4.00% APR  $47,085 savings

* 10 year  $2084.84/mo  4.375% APR  $28,479 savings


I emailed SoFi about discharge on death and disability, and a rep emailed me back saying they would do so (contrary to what I thought in the situation of private loans, but maybe because they hold them as student loan debt?). My wife and I are moving for a new job for me where pay is close to equal to slightly higher, but we would like to be able to afford a larger home (four boys) and property is more expensive closer to this job. 


We are thinking of doing the 10 year option, then paying more/extra payments as often as we can budget, and this would give us the ease of a lower monthly payment and house affordability where we're moving, plus could reduce that 10 years to closer to the original 7 and still save a lot. We have a minivan lease currently, and once that's over plan to buy a used 3 row SUV we can pay for outright, which will cut $490 from monthly expenses at that time.


Additional student loan payment costs include $300/mo on wife's student loans (balance $7282.30 average 6% APR) and a private loan of mine that's about $5200 at 7% APR, both of which I hope to pay off with proceeds from our house sale this summer.

personalfinance,Savings after... savings?,"I'm starting my first job and was trying to make a budget. I don't have student loans or debts. I already plan to put a set amount into an IRA account, and max out my 401K. After subtracting that amount, state/fed/other taxes, groceries, commuting cost, healthcare, rent, and utilities, I figured how much money I have left over. 

I want to also set aside money in a savings account in case of emergencies. I was wondering how much I should be setting aside of this leftover amount (percentage wise I guess) so I could budget the rest for fun stuff (going/eating out, concerts, trips, etc.)",finance

This is assuming I’m paying the card off on time and in full each month. Basically I pay my car loan the same but with my credit card instead of cash and then pay the card the loan.",finance

personalfinance,Goodwill Letters Worked!! 🙏,"So i had been disputing items on my credit report for well over a year now (Jan 2017). I had successfully been removing negative items on my report by disputing them as fraud/inaccurate. However when it came to my student loans for several 2013 late payments, that became a bit tricky. Federal student loans are insured by the government so they HAVE to report payment history accurately and cannot remove any credit reports as a courtesy (at least thats what the rep told me). After disputing with the bureaus for over a year with no luck, i decided to switch tactics. I came across Goodwill letters and decided to give it a try. It was a longshot but i thought to myself, what do i have to lose? So my process was as follows:

Got a name and addresses of all the Ceo's and executives of the company--&gt;Mailed a certified Goodwill letter---&gt;Got a call from a rep in the customer advocate dept and said she'd look into it---&gt; Got a callback two weeks later saying they're gonna be removing the late payments for me and im gonna be receiving a confirmation letter in the mail! 

I felt so ecstatic. Because of this, my credit score was able to skyrocket 80 points and I'm finally in 700s. I'm gonna be buying a house within the next year so I'm gonna continue building my credit even more to get better interest rates. But more importantly, Goodwill letters do work! I was extremely lucky enough to get them removed by sending off one campaign of letters and not several. So If youre gonna be doing Goodwill letters, be prepared if you dont get your desired result on your first campaign. It may take a couple. Be persistent, follow up and good luck ☺.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance or not based on my rates?,"I'll make this simple and sweet.  Here's my loans:

Private loan: $8,248.07 - 12.25% interest rate - $180 a month (about 5 years left)

Private loan: $41, 277 - 8.8% interest rate - $425 a month (about 14 years left)

Federal loan: $21,432.47 - 3.5-6.8% interest rates on various sub-loans - $315 a month (about 7 years left).


I used Laurel Road and was given an offer of:

5.85% interest rate on a 15 year loan with monthly payments of $609.51


Is it worth it to refinance with Laurel Road?  I feel like I can still keep pumping $900+ in when I can to bring that yearly amount down.  My current plan is to pay off the 5 year loan with high interest rate as fast as possible, then snowball that money into my federal loans, then finally snowball that entire amount to knock out all my loans in 9-10 years.  However I don't know what saves me the most money and pays off my loans quicker.",finance
personalfinance,What is this sub's take on the future of pensions?,"My title pretty much says it. With pensions in the private sector as good as extinct, would it be foolish to count on a pension from a federal job? I recently got a job with the VA (haven't started yet, so I can't talk to colleagues about this). The starting pay is very low, but I'm trying to be optimistic by telling myself that at least there's a pension and good benefits. Am I kidding myself? I'm 26, so I have a long way to go till I retire.",finance
personalfinance,Using a financial gift to reduce parents AGI and tax burden,"I am trying to help my parents reduce their tax burden by lending them some money, which would be a start to fixing their finances.  A note before I start:  I trust my parents completely, they just don’t know how to save and take advantage of financial vehicles.  They are the last people who would ask me or my siblings for money, so this is proactive to try to help them secure a future.

My parents claimed marketplace healthcare for my mom during 2017.  My dad is self-employed and his income is heavily seasonal, so they thought they would be able to claim the Premium Tax Credit for 2017, using form 8962.  Turns out they also had some debt relief that must be counted as income (got a 1099), resulting in too much income to be able to claim that tax credit and could now be facing a substantial tax bill.

The maximum AGI they can have to still claim the credit is ~$64,060, or 399.9% of the federal poverty line.  Their AGI is currently $69,162 (including self-employed business deductions).

My idea is to gift them ~$6500 to make a traditional IRA contribution.  They made enough to contribute the maximum plus catch up for being over 50 (both are over 59.5), and neither takes part in an employer-sponsored 401k or other kind of savings plan.

This would reduce their AGI to allow them to claim the premium tax credit, and my dad could withdraw the IRA in the future, claim it as income and pay the tax on the distributions and interest in a future tax year, and return the money to me as a gift (which they wouldn’t have to claim since it’s &lt;$14K).  Then the only money he would owe is to me, to make up for the taxes paid on the IRA withdrawal.  I get the benefit of another investment avenue, and could choose to take it back sooner or later depending on when I need it (but before he turns 70 due to distribution requirements).

Am I missing anything here?  Any pieces of tax code that I am overlooking?  Just looking for a gut check on my logic.

Edit: They nor I would have to claim the regifting.
Edit 2: Parent's are over 59.5.",finance

personalfinance,Trouble understanding new student loan repayment terms,"I have a private student loan that was recently sold to Navient (previously owned by American Education Services).  I’m having some trouble understanding my new repayment terms. 

The loan is ~$16,500 unpaid principal.  At AES, my minimum payment due was ~$150, and I was paying an additional ~150 toward principal for a monthly automatic debit payment of $300.  Payoff date was 2031.

The loan was sold to Navient.  The direct debit was uninterrupted, still $300 from my account on the same day each month.  However, when I got my first bill from them, it says my minimum payment due is $300.  Interest rate is the same.

On my account page, it says my “repayment plan” ends June 2023, which is what will happen if I continue to pay $300/month, but directly underneath that it says my estimated payoff date is November 2031, which is the original term of the loan.

Can they just increase my minimum payment by $150 and shorten my repayment period by 8 years?

I’m currently going over my budget to figure out where I have some wiggle room, knowing I could always stop the student loan overpayment if I really have to.  I’d hate to lose that option.",finance

Are there any limitations to how many times I can refinance my loans? A quick search shows I can get rates back in the low 4's again.

Also, should I be rushing to pay these off as soon as possible? As it is right now, I'll have them paid off in 4 or 5 more years, but I'm almost breaking even after all my retirement savings, and bills.

personalfinance,Does it ever make sense to sell your house because its at an all time high and go back to renting for a year or two?,"General question:  Does it ever make sense to sell your house because its at an all time high and rent for a year or two?  If so how is the best way to calculate if its right decision for you?  
  
Specific to me:  For this exercise lets take all human elements way such as family, job change, life events etc.  I lived in the same condo since 2007 (refinanced in 2012).  In its current amortization I pay $370 /mo towards principle and $600 to interest  ($970 mortgage).  The interest rate on this 30 yr mortgage is 4.25%  I also pay a $400 /mo HOA and my taxes are around $2000/year.  
  
I have about $80,000-$100,0000 in equity.  In my years living here I have never seen these condo units worth so much (there are 150+ units).  I was trying to determine if it made any sense at all to sell my condo now and pocket the $100k in a 12-24 month CD or something and rent for a while.

I've recently come to learn that I'm not suppose to have this credit because on my 1098-t, the amount in box-5 is greater than the amount in box- 2. Not only that but I have to add the difference between box-5 and box- 2 as income.

personalfinance,Warning for people using Northwest Federal Credit Union,"I doubt there are many people here using this Credit Union, but just in case I thought it would be good to post a notice.  

NWFCU has completely overhauled their checking and savings accounts.

The Savings account which was .25% has been lowered to .05% unless you sign up for their new Kasasa Cash checking account.   
https://www.nwfcu.org/banking/checking-savings/savings-and-clubs

The Money Market account rate under 25k has dropped from .45% to .15%  
https://www.nwfcu.org/banking/checking-savings/money-market

You will need to convert your checking account to either a Kasasa Cash or Kasasa Cash Back account to receive any realistic dividend.  
https://www.nwfcu.org/compare-features-our-checking-accounts

The Kasasa accounts have the following stipulations:  
&gt;When your Kasasa Cash account qualifications are met during a Monthly Qualification Cycle, (1) Balances up to $15,000 receive APY of 2.00%; and balances over $15,000 earn 0.25% interest rate on the portion of balance over $15,000, resulting in an annual percentage yield for this tier ranging from 2.00% to .48% APY depending on the account’s balance. When Kasasa Cash qualifications are not met, all balances in the account earn .05% APY. 

So basically the credit union has changed to a rewards checking product.   I'm not sure how I feel about this personally since there are better options for rewards checking, but the requirements on Kasasa Cash Back are pretty easy to meet.

It is more of an issue that I did not receive any communications from the CU that this change was occurring, so it came as a bit of a surprise.",finance

personalfinance,Question about REPAYE and federal loan consolidation,"I am a graduating med student with about ~$350k in loans with about $10k from undergrad in subsidized and unsubsidized with the rest of it from med school spread over unsubsidized and grad plus loans. I read a lot on white coat investor and these forums about debt consolidation and REPAYE. I already filled my taxes to get $0 payments for first year of repayment.   

My question is basically what is the advantage of federal loan consolidation, especially if your loans are all under the federal direct program. The main advantages I've seen discussed are: 

1) To roll non-PSLF eligible loans (I.E. Perkins) into the direct program for PSLF 

2) To forgo the grace period and enter repayment early  

My loans are all under federal direct, so as far as I know they are all eligible for PSLF. Also, I took time between med school and college so my loans from undergrad of $10k will enter repayment as soon as I graduate in may. At the moment I don't see what the advantage would be for me to consolidate. My hesitation to consolidate are mainly due to:

1) wanting flexibility to pay off high interest loans like grad plus

2) avoiding signing a new MPN for loan consolidation because I am not sure how that will impact PSLF as the future of this program is uncertain. I will be in a long training program so PSLF is something I hope to take advantage of.  

I would think that by not consolidating I would have 18 months of zero payments rather than 12 for at least for the med school portion of my loans since I would have 6 months of grace + 12 months of zero dollar payments. However, since virtually every resource recommends consolidating so I guess I must be missing something. I was wondering if consolidation would be helpful in my case. 

Tl;dr Is federal loan consolidation worth if you already have all your loans under the federal direct program?

Anyway to get to the point, I don't have a job, so my only source of money is birthdays and whatever is left over from paying tuition each semester. Do you guys think it is a good or bad idea to use some of the leftover money to start paying some of the unsubsidized loan? If nothing else, maybe just the interest?

Last thing: when I went to check the payment page, Nelnet (my loan servicer) listed the fact that for payments made within 120 days of disbursement, ""your payment is applied to the original principal balance which, in turn, reduces the amount of your loan."" What does this mean for me if, say I were to pay $50 now, or wait until 120 days after and pay the $50 then, what is the difference?

personalfinance,My experience buying a new car from a dealership as a first time buyer (U.S),"Here is my 2 nickels of advice for interested car buyers.

Back story- I had been looking to buy a certified pre-owned car for the past month, I looked at different warrenties from different brands, costs, reviews, and of course price. After doing my homework I finally settled for a Buick Encore 2016 base model. It was going for around $15,000 with under 15k miles. And honestly, I was happy with that price. It was right on my budget. But wait! This Easter weekend buick decided to have an over $4,000 cashback offer on new cars and the prices for the New Buick encores online were actually cheaper than the 2 year old used ones. The advertised price for a new Encore was $14,995. 

This is where all those youtube videos on how dealerships salesmen work, prevented me from being a huge sucker the dealership. First, the salesman was great, knew the car front to back. Had that confident trust worthy look, and about 5 sales trophys in his desk so I knew I was dealing with an expert. So after the test drive, he started asking what monthly payments I could afford and if I ever bought a car before. This is usually done to assess their starting price. I tell him that I was going to buy a used one for 15k and that since this advertised price was the same I would rather buy it new. Which lets him know if the price is not right I would walk away and give him an idea of what monthly payments I wanted around $300 a month. What he didnt know is that I had a preapproved quote from capital one on that exact 2018 car from another dealership. 

The salesman runs my credit and says you have been approved congrats! And only $370 dollars a month! I'm like  well were close on the price but too far off. At this point I notice he didn't tell me my interest % or how many months. I then tell him I'm a buyer closer to $300 a month on 60 month loan. He looks at me like I'm crazy and says, your approved for $370 in 75 months. At this point I stop smiling and just stare at him. Then I say, well we are completely on different price ranges I'm no longer interested. He counters with wait wait we can work out a deal.

Heres a big lesson: always know the months, interest, and total price before a down payment and before a trade in. I did not do a trade in.

I tell him, we are thousands of dollars off what the advertised price is. Have a good day, then he tells me what do you mean? So I pull out the phone calculator and put 370x75= over $27,000 for a base model advertised at $15,000. He states their most of been a mistake and runs back to the office. Brings back an offer for $350 a month over 75 months. Again ridiculous price, and I ask him why is their car advertised at 15k if their selling it over 24k. He tells me I didnt fully qualify for the promotion bla bla bla. So I ask him what is my interest rate? He states its 7% which is huge on a new car. And I pull out my capital one quote at 4.5% and tell him if they are affiliated with Capital one bank. Which they were, that instantly dropped my interest 2.5% and my credit score is not great at 650. So then he brings out the old paper with 370 a month on it and writes down $17,999. I ask him if fees are included and he said no so I ask how much is taxes, plates, fees he estimates it at $2,600. So I tell him no. He then writes $18,999 total price with fees included, gives me a pen and tells me to sign. 

Advise # 2 have an older friend or relative with no shame to come with you as the nay sayer for these pressure situations. 

I brought my dad I look at him and ask him if I'm better off buying the certified used one at 15k. He nods his head and I tell the salesman It's still out of my price range sorry for wasting his time. He then tells me to write down a price all because of the pressure for which I fell for. I wrote 18,300,he told me to sign and that he will give it to his manager for approval but I stop him.

Advise #3 nothing is final until you sign so if you say the wrong thing, pull it together and go back on your word like I did.

I cross that price and tell him to show me what I would be paying a month. After yearly interest was added it came out to be around 310 a month for 75 months and $23,000 total. At this point I'm exhausted, its been 3 hours and I feel the pressure after saying no so many times to a professional salesman. I'm done looking at total price and converting plus it is easy to visualize numbers at this point so I tell him if he can lower the payment to 300 a month for 75 months a $750 savings. He goes to his manager and he agrees. But I still don't sign. My dad tells me I can still go lower since his manager has not came to see me in spanish. 

Advise # 4 speaking a different launguage may help you out.

I tell him ok, I'm at my budgets limit can he make it 72 months instead and I'll take the car home, he shows some resistance but goes back to his manager and it gets approved! Thats 3 payments $900 dollars less and one year less on a annual interast loan 72 months is 6 years 75 is 7 years which might be a savings of $200 additional dollars. I decide I'm happy and tired lets buy the car.

Addiional tip. Once I got the actual loan agreement I see the dealer gave me the full $4,250 cashback which made me wonder if they just lied initially to beef up their profits so demand the full cashback they offer from the start I would say. And also I refused the additional warrenties and gap insurance which would have added $50 to my monthly payment or $3,600 total. That is completely up to you, do research on warrenty and gap insurance. Also have an insurance quote before you walk in the dealership. I had a $110 dollar monthly offer from progressive and It is my first insurance policy not under my parents name. I'm a 24 y.o. male and I got ""full coverage insurance"" required when financing a car.

After everything was done, I payed a little under 19k for the car with fees included. Total cost with interest is around 21,500 if I decide to take all 72 months to pay it off and I do believe I left some $ on the table. And I put a down payment of $1'000 in free money since the cashback was counted as a down payment therefore I didnt need to put one down, and once you out it down they can easily make it disappear. 

Overall I'm happy, the car is amazing, interior for a base model is great, and its fun to drive. The payments are well within my budget and I will probably attempt to pay it off in 2 years so I don't pay interest.

Last words, be informed, be patient, and give your self time to think. Know your limits, fight the price and you might save 9k dollars from the original offer. It went from over $27,000 to $18,700 with some money left on the table. Total for the car only was $16,600 without fees vs advertised price of $14,995 so I could have saved an additional thousand or so.

So they gonna plea. But they not gonna get a good deal. Why, because its a slam dunk case. It's too blatant, as can be seen from the faking of non-existent executives, faking of ""partnership"" with Visa, Mastercards. The ICO, obviously, is never registered with SEC which is in clear violation with the regulations. Considering its a financial crime, money laundering charge is also a given. 

They will be charged with wire fraud, money laundering, illegally operating money service. They gonna make a deal with the prosecutors and plead guilty, and they gonna get 4-7 years depending on the actual damage caused to the investors, whether they were ""remorseful"", whether they can repay the investors for the damages, and the bias of the judge. 

There is a slight chance that they might have useful non-public information on other ICO scams in the US depending on how well they are connected in the ICO scene. If they have some juicy stuff that the prosecutors find useful for the inevitable crackdown on other ICOs, they might be able to secure a deal for a lesser sentencing recommendation and might even get one of the charges dropped.

Meanwhile, SEC will file a civil suit against them, which SEC will win and with restitutions and penalties all their scammed money will be stripped. If they bought vernicles, properties with any of these tainted money they will be confiscated by civil forfeiture as well.

I'm in need of some advice. My SO and I have been trying our best to pay down our debt. I have around 1,400 left on my used 2007 Ford Focus and then I'll be in the clear. 

He has a very very old Dodge Dakotah that runs, but is about to give out any second. It is paid off completely. A few years ago he bought a very reliable Volkswagen in order to be able to see each other when we were long distance. He has 7,000 left on his Volkswagen.

Now, he is in need of a new truck. He uses his car for work and does a lot of side work as an electrician so it's a necessity. We have around 3,000 dollars that we are trying to decide what to do with.

Our options (we think) are:
1. Pay off my Ford Focus and trade it in. Use the money from the trade in and the extra cash for the down payment. I would then buy the Volkswagen from my SO and take over the payments for him. It is a lot nicer car than I own, but not sure if taking on that debt is worth it.
2. Use the 3,000 to pay down the Volkswagen, trade it in, and use that money for a down payment on a truck. I continue to drive my Ford Focus.
3. Use the 3,000 as a down payment for a new truck, and just get by until we are able to pay off his and my car and divert more money toward a new car payment. 

Any ideas? We are unsure of what to do. Our interest rates are about the same on both my Ford and his Volkswagen.",finance
personalfinance,Why is the US mortgage market so... simple?,"From what I've seen, it seems that 90% of the US mortgages are either 15- or 30-year mortgages with 5- and 10-year adjustable rate mortgages making up the majority of the rest.

Why are the choices for American homebuyers so limited?

In Israel, one can choose from a variety of mortgage components. Fixed rates, variable rates that change every 1, 2, 5, 10 years, rates that are linked to the national bank interest rate (similar to Federal Reserve rate), rates that go up and down in accordance to the USD or Euro, and more. Even the average homebuyers combine 3 or avenues when choosing a mortgage (1/3 of the mortgage in each avenue for example). Many people take 5 or more avenues and it's extremely rare to just take one. You can choose however many years you'd like in each avenue and combine at will.

financialindependence,Advice for married medical student,"Hello everyone, 

I've been lurking here and reading up on the bogleheads wiki and figured I would post my situation here and see how I can optimize our situation. Briefly, I am a married medical student at a mid tier school. My wife and I are both in our mid 20's. 

Her: Total compensation $82k/year. 

Assets: 
10k in emergency fund (1.5% APR savings account)
~5K cash on hand to cover monthly expenses
Her Roth: $2700
Her 401k: $2200
My Roth: $1000
Investments are allocated into index funds based on the three fund portfolio often recommended by bogleheads. 

Liabilities: 
$42K student loan at 6% fixed taken out for medical school. Anticipate taking out an additional $40k per year for the next two years to finish school. 
$3700 student loan at 7% fixed, also taken out for medical school. 

Expenses: Car is paid off, so no vehicle payments other than gas/maintenance/insurance. Otherwise, we're spending about $2200 a month for all rent/food/utilities. 

Currently, we're putting 12% of her gross income per month into her 401k to get the company match. Additionally we're putting 5% of gross income month into her Roth IRA, and taking 5% to pay down the student loan with the higher interest rate (7%). 

My question is, does it make sense to put more money towards paying off/limiting student loans since we would basically be making a guaranteed 7% initially, then 6%? 

Obviously, we would continue to put enough into her 401k to get the full company match, but instead of putting the money into a Roth, we would put that money towards student loans instead. Any advice/critique/information is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,"I Co-own a home with my ex-girlfriend. Should I buy her out, or should we sell the property?","Hey all, I'm in need some of advice. I'm not exactly the smartest when it comes to finances, but I'm slowly learning. I'm trying to decide if I should buy my ex-girlfriend out of the equity in our home or sell the home with her. 


Some background knowledge about me that you'll most likely need to give any advice. I currently make $107,000 a year in salary.  My current mortgage payment is $1,535 with $187 towards PMI on a 2,000 sq ft townhome. Cost of living for an apartment in my area is about $1,300 for a 600 sq ft studio apartment.


Two years ago my SO and I purchased a home together for $280,000 with a small downpayment on an FHA loan with a 3.25% interest rate (I think that rate is correct, if not it's ballpark).  Fast forward to now; we are breaking up and I need to decide if I want to buy her out of her equity in the home. I called my current mortgage lender today to apply for a refinancing loan and was caught off guard with some facts.  My home is evaluated for $320,000 - $330,000 right now, and my current loan amount is ~ $264,000. This could immediately open up some new options depending on whether or not my loan amount ($264k) is equal to 80% of the new appraisal price, because I'd possibly qualify for a better loan without PMI. Depending on the appraisal price I could have to fork some out of pocket cash towards my principal in order to achieve this. The lender told me that even if my home was appraised for $325k and I paid the $4,000 out of pocket to meet 20% total loan payment (325k * .80 = 260k -- 264k - 260k = 4,000) I'd be looking at a 4.25% interest rate and a mortgage payment of ~ $1650.  I'm really at a loss as to how this even makes sense. I've looked at some figures online briefly, and with the numbers I've put in things are showing that a 30yr fixed with the same interest rates above would come out closer to $1,300 a month.


Now.. that's only one side to my story. The second is the buyout price. We have an agreement in place which states I'll owe her half of the appreciated value of the home. For estimation sake, lets say we'll use the same $325 appraisal value from the above example, so I'd owe her 325 - 280 = 45 / 2 = 22.5k on the home alone. She owe's me some money for bills that I've fronted over the last two years, and I also owe her half of the original down payment ($5k). There's also furniture and things in the home which I'd most likely end up keeping. Lets round that up to a 25 - 27k buyout price


So the tricky part is this.. I don't have that money saved up. I'll either have to take a separate loan out for the buyout price or include this buyout price within my new refinanced mortgage.  With the real estate market looking the way it is and with the growth I've already seen on this home in the past 2 years, I really don't want to let this home go unless it's the intelligent thing to do.  


Please give me some advice! Thanks!

I graduated 3 years ago and I'm just now finding out about this.

The terms on the loan were weird too, every other student loan is monthly payments for 10 years this is quarterly payments for 2 years +1 additional payment.
I called my college to confirm that it was real and after a few phone calls I did get confirmation on this.  Additionally, the debt is not listed in my accounts on my credit report.
I have the contact information for the debt collector but I wanted to get some information first. What I'm trying to figure out is do I have any form of recourse on this.

I am in a bit of a dilemma and need some advice. I currently work for a title 1 school in science education, and will round my 5 year mark in Aug of this year. I have ~32k (@6.8% interest) in federal student loans that will qualify for PSLF and TLF. The question is... which one will be better in my current situation? Care to double check my math?

TLF 
32k - 17.5k = 14.5k 
If I pay off this 14.5k, using a car loan calc I would wind up paying 285/mo over the next 5 years. Under my current IBR I pay 216/mo. So realistically, I ""lose"" 4140$ (69$x60 months). But I would gain flexibility in the ability to move to a non PSLF job if I choose. Or if I wind up making more money at any point over the next 5 years, that 4k number would actually go down, since I would have to pay more on IBR anyway, right? 

Does this math seem sound? If I take the TLF this august I become ineligible for PSLF (unless I work another 10 years in the field.) I lose out on ~4k, only if my income and job stay the same. Higher income=less lost.",finance
personalfinance,About to get married &amp; I want to start researching/getting ready to buy a home,"I'm getting married at the end of this month and my fiance and I have a goal to buy a house sometime by mid to late next year.  My dad is a commercial real estate agent and my fiance's father is a mortgage loan officer, so we have some good resources at our disposal, but I want to start doing some research on my own.

Here's where we stand financially (my fiance + me combined):
$45k in savings
$50k diversified in the stock market (primarily mutual funds).  This is liquid...I could sell out and have the money in my account in 2 days.

Annual combined income: $150-$160k

No debt.

My credit score is ~800.  My fiance's credit score is around 750.

We're probably going to move to the Sacramento,CA area when we buy a home.  I'm thinking our price range will be around $400-$600k.

Here are some of my questions:
&amp;nbsp;   
 **Down payment:** Should we be shooting for a 20% down payment?  I'm hoping to have around $100k set aside for a down payment, so that would put me in range for a $400k-$500k home.  We'll obviously want to make sure we still have an emergency fund set aside, so we don't want to use up ALL of our savings.

**Closing costs:** Is there a rough estimate for how much closing costs are usually (as a % of home price)?  I'm assuming we'll need to pay that up front as well.  What's included in closing costs?  Real-estate agent fees, and taxes?

**Loans:**  My fiance's father in law will be able to help us with this, but are there any special loans or anything for first time home buyers?  And do both our credit score's matter or should we just use whoever's credit score is the highest?

**Monthly payments:** I've been looking at homes on Trulia and I noticed that homes that cost around the same amount can have different estimated monthly payment costs per Trulia.  For example, a $500k home could have estimated monthly payments between $2000 - $2500 per month, so obviously its not just interest rate x home price.  What else goes into this?

**Lastly and MOST IMPORTANTLY:**  Do you guys have any general words of wisdom for me?  I'm going to be doing researching and educating myself over the next year when I have down-time.  Any useful words to the wise would be greatly appreciated!  If you only want to answer one question, this would be what I would ask!

1. sell house, move into apartment, use equity in house to pay off debt (maybe including car), once credit gets better (only negative is utility) buy a house. Note* I was military so I qualify for VA laons and so I don't HAVE to have 20% down on the next house.

3. Take retirement loan to pay huge chunk of the CCs and then pay that back while continuing to pay off CCs and get a house in almost exactly 1 year when I have it all paid back (essentially same as above, but trading CC interest rate (16% on worst one) with potential growth rate of retirement fund)

personalfinance,H&amp;R vs Turbotax AGI flow-through differences,"I have non-taxable scholarships that I report as part of my income so I can deduct tuition expenses and take advantage of educational credits that are available.

Last year I used H&amp;R block but have decided to give Turbotax a shot just for the heck of it and I found that there is a difference in the state returns. (Federal result in a small diff of ~$3)

This difference is in the AGI that flows through to the state tax return. H&amp;R uses the AGI that includes the tuition expenses that was covered by my scholarship while Turbotax somehow starts off with an AGI that doesn't include my scholarships. (~10k diff)

With a lower starting AGI, my state tax liability goes from ~$440 to $0. I don't know why there is a difference in the way that AGI flows through to the state returns. Should I just use the program that results in higher return?",finance

personalfinance,I had $7000 and my identity stolen from me via a fraudulent TurboTax client,"Last year I decided I would file my own taxes with TurboTax instead of using an accountant for the first time, so I looked on Google shopping and a semi legit looking shop called ""TaxProCorp"" was selling TurboTax deluxe for cheaper than most stores.

I wasn't really thinking critically and have seen big disparities in software pricing on stuff like copies OSs, Microsoft Office (OEM copies and such) ect from more obscure resellers and didn't think anything of it so I bought it and downloaded a client that was 100% legitimate looking and seemed to be totally identical to normal TurboTax. Needed to download updates and everything and got back fully convincing rejection emails when I filled out one part wrong and needed to resubmit. I even got signed up for a TurboTax drip marketing campaign afterwards exactly like you would expect. 

Fast forward to today and I realized that I didn't ever receive my 2016 tax refund, something I frankly forgot about entirely. I looked up my refund status in both the federal and state systems and found that my state refund had been claimed but couldn't get a status for my federal return. Meanwhile the actual TurboTax website says my own email never had a return associated with it. I looked up the vendor that sold me it and their phone number is non-functional and the address they listed is a virtual office. I realized that the drip emails I had been getting were also from a phishing email.

I am guessing it is too late to get last year's refund back but I still want to try  and don't know what to do. The IRS website has forms to submit but none of them seem to apply to this weird edge case and I can't find how to talk to a an actual person. These guys also have all the financial and personal information that you would submit in your tax return so I'm worried they will continue to fuck me over somehow.

personalfinance,Strategies to be financially responsible yet not get killed with taxes?,"Early in 2017 I decided to get serious about crushing all remaining debt, with a stretch goal of achieving financial independence in the next few years.

I sold off some stocks at what seemed like it should have been the top of the market (which turned out to be false,) and completely paid off the mortgage.  This freed up enough cash to max out 401(k) and HSA contributions in an attempt to shelter as much income as possible from taxation.

Despite doing so, I just finished filing Federal and State returns for 2017, and shed a few tears upon seeing the amount of money handed over to the government in taxes.

Other than taking on debt or additional expenses just for the sake of being able to write it off, what other strategies are available to lessen the tax burden?

personalfinance,What are my IRA options,"Hello PF,

For the first time; I did IRA this year.. I opened a Fidelity Roth IRA account and contributed 11,000 (5,500 for 2017 and 5,500 for 2018). I went with Roth IRA as I liked the fact that I can take the principal at any point of time and I get taxed on interest. This portability kinda works for me as I may have my retirement in my home country and I may move before the 59.5 cut-off (I'm 32 rightnow if that matters). 

I filed my tax returns yesterday and found my Federal Gross Income is very close to IRA limits for Roth contribution. If I sell my vested shares this year; I would go past the max salary limit for 2018 (189K for Married &amp; Joint filing). 

I spoke to Fidelity and they gave me the option of excess contribution retraction and recharacterization of fund as Traditional (however I was told this option involves paper work every year I file tax). 

Hence; I'm leaning towards retracting the funds. When I asked the agent about my options for Traditional IRA; I was told it depends on my employer 401K plan, money I make out of it etc..  

My employer provides 100% match upto 4% of 401K (also with Fidelity). 

Would be great to know my IRA options. I'm already contributing about 14,000 towards 401K (traditional) and want to do the rest in IRA for the portability.

I closed out my Tesla short a little early and did not make as much as I could have.  The markets have been extremely skittish, up, down, up, down, like a porn star, lately, so I have had a tendency to grab profits when I have them.
Furthermore I have been saying for weeks that there would be a bounce in the stock when they came out with their March production numbers, because everyone knew they would be bad so everybody bet against them and could be counted on to close out after the report came out.

But the market as a whole looked bearish.
So I shorted GM.  There is a subprime crisis in cars happening and the interest rate hikes are hurting sales.

Tuesday, GM comes out with this bullish-sounding report and climbs 3%, so my short gets buried underwater.  I am pissed.
But first of all, I decided not to close out (buy back my shares) because the market has been up down up down up down.
And second, just because I am pissed off, I buy a put on SPY.  exp on Friday (April 4)  strike price 260.

I’m looking to refinance my Sallie Mae loan of $12000 (originally was $24000) which have a glorious interest rate of 10.125% (variable, keeps going up every 3 months).  I was supposed to have this loan paid off in 2023, but I’m refusing to let my interest pile up that high.  My monthly payment is supposed to be ~$500 (yes, seriously).

To combat my interest rate, I’ve been paying off ~$2000 USD a month.. so I’m looking to have these loans paid off completely in 5-6 months at this rate.

I’ve been pre-approved with SoFi to refinance my Sallie Mae loan. They’re tentatively offering 4.75%, 5 years, and $226.45 monthly.  I’m still planning on being aggressive with my repayment, but to be honest fuck Sallie Mae.

I think I need some perspective here. 

My personal repayment plan is aggressive, but 10.125% variable is also aggressive. They increase this every 3 months and I’m pretty sure it’s because I’m paying off my loans too fast. 

Should I refinance? Should I not? Any thoughts on SoFi?

personalfinance,Paying $2100/mo to student loans. Can I profit by refinancing to a longer term?,"Hey all,

I graduated last year from an expensive engineering undergraduate program with about $138K in student loan debt. I received no help from my parents (not that I expected any) so I've been stuck paying off this amount. Thankfully I landed a relatively high paying salary ($77K after bonuses) so I was very aggressive in handling it and continually made payments of a little over $2K/month.

When I first graduated I had a number of individual smaller loans (including Parent Plus loans) that ranged in interest rates from 5% to 8%. I refinanced right away using one of my parents as a cosigner at a 7-year variable rate of 3.8%. Over about the course of a year this had risen to 4.7% and it was absolutely depressing me considering the fact my interest rate kept rising and I still had a balance of about $110K.

About 8 month ago I decided to RE-refinance my loans yet again and because of my great credit and my cosigner I thankfully got an incredible rate of 3.18% FIXED for a 5-year term from a lesser known company (they offered me the best rate they had possible). My monthly payments are now $2030/month for the next 4ish years.

I realized a few days ago though that I could easily make much more than 3.18% on the market if I invested these funds instead. I called up the same loan provider and asked what my options would be for a lower monthly rate. My current balance sits around $100K. These were the two options they gave me:

7-year Fixed: 4.09% with monthly payments of ~$1370

10-year Fixed: 4.45% with monthly payments of ~$1030

Now let's say I decided to convert my loan into one of those. Would it make sense to take the additional $800 or $1100 I would save each month and just sock it into index funds or other investments? I would guess I'd actually be coming out ahead over that 7 or 10 year period (assuming favorable markets) and not to mention I would have that money liquid for the opportunity to use on more lucrative investments down the line. Would the increase in interest be worth it? With such a large amount ($100K) each 1% increase would equate to an additional $1K I'd have to pay in interest in just the first year.

If it is a good decision, which refinance plan would be best? 7 or 10 year?

personalfinance,"Given these numbers, can I afford a house?","I'm strongly considering purchasing a house by myself and want to review the finances of this to confirm I can do it since I'm breaking some of the guidelines. I know you guys get this question a hundred times a day so I'm sorry in advance.

Finances \-

**Emergency**: $10k

**Savings**: $40k

**Salary**: with current 401k contributions, taxes, etc I take home $3700/month

**Hidden Finances**: I've been with my company for several years and receive a year\-end bonus typically at 8&amp;#37; and I also receive year\-end wage adjustments typically 2.5&amp;#37;

House stuff \-

**House**: $240k, but will go up to $255k

Given the current market it will go higher than that so my personal cut\-off is $255k before I give up on that house. All numbers from here on out will assume price of $255k.

**Taxes**: $5200

**Givens**: 5&amp;#37; down payment, 4.75&amp;#37; interest rate, 30 year mortgage, 1&amp;#37; insurance \(PMI\)

**Closing Cost w/ 5\%**: something like $25k all said and done

**Expected Monthly cost**: just shy of $2k

So assuming worst case scenarios here I'm looking at 55&amp;#37; of take home going to the house, this is considerably above the recommended 30&amp;#37; but I understand that.

Adding other monthly expenses \-

**internet**: $100

**groceries\+gas\(commute\)**: $340

still need to get **electricity/heat** numbers for this house but let's say worst case: $400

**phone**: $60

**Monthly total w/ House**: $2,900

Reasons why I think this still will work:

1\) My free time is spent playing video games and working out \(I'd be setting up a home gym which is one of my main attractions with having a house, gym costs will be somewhere south of $4k\).

2\) Even with home gym costs accounted for I leave this ordeal with around $10k Savings, still have $10k Emergency, and have somewhere around 20&amp;#37; of take\-home money I can still play with.

For comparison, apartment costs in my area are between $800\-1400 for a single\-bedroom. $800 is obviously bottom of the barrel, historically apartments I go for have been in the $1,200/month range. **So Monthly difference between an apartment vs house ends up being somewhere around $1400 taking into consideration different electricity/heat costs.** Basically double the price of a high\-end apartment to get entry into a sorted\-out house that appears to just require basic maintenance for the near future. 

I have seen reasonable condos in my area that are potentially obtainable around $200k which are also another thing I'm considering, the trade\-off though is that even with the lower mortgage cost the average HOA fees in my area are $325/month which ends up really not being that much of a savings difference per month.

Are there any other Monthly expenses I'm not thinking about?

On paper this appears doable, what am I missing?

Living with someone is not an option to save money.

My area is certainly in a housing bubble spurred on by short supply of houses and uncertainty over interest rates. I am paying a premium to get into a house at this time and I accept that \- I know there is a bubble but it is impossible to know where we will be in 7\+ years \(7 years average time spent in a house\) plus I view buying a house more as a personal investment vs a financial investment.",finance

personalfinance,"Read all contracts, every page!(I need help)","Sorry for the long post

Hey everyone, I’m a long time lurker, but avid lover of this sub. It’s been helpful to me in recent years to get into a better position financially. A recent post has got me thinking about my current financial position and has me asking a few questions that I wouldn’t have thought about before.

A little background:

I currently work full time and attend college full time. I am married, but my wife is an immigrant that has only recently received a temporary work permit and is in search of employment. She is a college grad, but her work permit being valid for only 1 year has made it harder for her to find employment outside of fast food. We aren’t hurting enough yet for me to force her to take a minimum wage job. I attend a local university (mostly online or night courses), and often have little time for personal activities, but when I do, I usually like to work on my house or motorcycle.

My current salary is just under 25$/hr, with a four day work week. I am technically salaried, but have to account for my time as hourly. Generally that boils down to about 51-53k a year gross, or 30k after my retirement contributions. My employer matches at 5%, so I try to put in an additional 11% (that’s about the most I can contribute and still cover all bills/live comfortably) After all taxes and other deductions are pulled, this comes out to roughly 1130-1150 a paycheck. I do receive tuition aid from this employer, which pays around 50-75% of my tuition (depends on the semester), but I do end up paying anywhere from 100-1500$ for tuition and fees/books out of pocket. I am not in a position where I can ask for a raise as all raises are time schedule based, and I will not be due for another increase for about 2-3 months. We live on a pretty tight budget, eating at home for all meals, but do splurge for pizza night or date night twice a month.

My mortgage comes in around 1250 a month, and after all is said and done with utilities, internet, food/ that looks more like 1700 a month. We have a very low interest rate on our house (thanks to a VA loan), and I would like to pay more on it, but here’s where my problem/questions come in.

Back in 2015, I was single and living expenses were cheap. Rent was all of 200 a month (living with a friend) and  I was making nearly what I am now. I had an 04 Pathfinder that was just about on it’s last leg at the time. I had been doing all the regular maintenance and repairs myself (I am a certified mechanic if I didn’t mention), but the time/costs of repairs and poor mileage were starting to get to the point that it was interfering with my commute to work and school. (I live between my school and work, about 30-45 minute commute in either direction).

Me being dumb, thinking it was a great financial move, I decided it was time for a new car. I wrote out how much my car payment was per month, how much I was spending on fuel, and how much I was spending on maintenance. If I remember, that number came in a little over 400 a month. I decided that meant that if I could find a vehicle for under 400 a month, I would be saving myself money, and if I bought new, that would save me time in repairs. (to be fair, I wasn’t really wrong on the time in repairs side, but still stupid in deciding to buy new in my position). I knew I was deploying for several months and figured I could use that extra money to pay off the car while it sat at my parents, being started every other week to keep the seals good.

 I bought a brand new VolksWagen Jetta, gas engine that gets about 40mpg consistently (all of my driving is highway from home-work/ home-school/ work-school, etc…) and signed for payments of 320 a month after my trade in. This was my first time buying new, so my negotiating skills were nonexistent. I didn’t try to negotiate a better price, add on options, or anything. I figured listed price was what you got.

Here’s where it get’s dealership level of sketchy. They handed me the paperwork and started walking me through everything. One paper they handed me clearly said “lease” in the title. I told the guy I was buying and not leasing, to which he replied that the paperwork was the same and it would just be adjusted when he entered it into the computer. Again, stupidity, I didn’t ask questions and drove away in my brand new car.

Well, I deployed, and went to make my first payment online to see that it was listed as a lease. This meant I couldn’t make any extra payments towards the vehicle. As pissed as I was, my ability to contact the dealership was limited, but when I did get in contact with them they told me that it was easy to convert the lease into a buy option. I would just have to come in when I got back to sign the paperwork and it would get converted. So, I played the waiting game. And that’s when Sep. 2015 happened. VolksWagen got into trouble for the diesel emissions scandal, meaning that all Volkswagens pretty well dropped in price.

Again, more dealership sketchiness

When I traded in my Pathfinder, I got 2500 dollars towards my Jetta. Great! The vehicle was barely worth that and had enough issues I couldn’t get that trying to sell it. Well…

Being as pissed off as I was, I went to the dealership to try and sort out the lease and pay off what I could on the car and hopefully work my way closer to the value of the vehicle. I owed around 18k at this point (original tag price was around 24k), and just wanted to be able to pay it down to the value of the vehicle so I could at least have that going for me. I was told by the sales associate that they could convert the lease to a sale, but it would raise my monthly payments a few bucks since it would be a shorter term. No big deal. Then the sales manager came in and explained that there was a 2000$ charge added for converting before the end of the term of the lease. I lost it.

I made a scene in that dealership about how fucking over a soldier was just despicable, and how I should of known they were just preditors for people in my situation (young and dumb). I went on about the phone conversations I had while I was deployed about being able to swap the lease and no mention of any upcharge. The manager, rightfully shocked, told me that he could wave this fee. I calmed down a bit and went in to sign the paperwork for buy-out. Well…

Rather then letting me remain with Volkswagen financing, they called around and pulled my credit 8 times in one day to find a bank that would finance. I had great credit (740’s) when I went in, and only good credit (710’s) when I left. No big deal, I can fix that making payments and making a call to see if I can’t get some of those credit checks dropped.

I went to make first payment at this credit union and found that they tacked on the $2000 dollars to the loan, pretty much the equivelant of me just giving them my Pathfinder for free, and now that everything was signed, I was now back to owing 20k on the vehicle. I’m still not sure how to fight this, because I only had a verbal statement to go off of, and again, being young and dumb, I only read so much of the contract to feel comfortable with what I was signing for. READ THE ENTIRE CONTRACT PEOPLE. LEARN FROM MY STUPIDITY, PLEASE.

This credit union is not my primary credit union. They have been far less than helpful. They charge a 10$ fee for payments made in person, and a 5$ fee for payments made online. I found that by linking my credit union with this loan, I am able to avoid this fee (thanks google), but the credit union wasn’t willing to offer up that information on their own.

Well, time has moved on some, I’ve calmed down, and am financially far more savvy now then I was 3 years ago (thanks in part to this sub), but I do have a few questions.

When I make extra payments, the credit union uses this to push back the loan. Meaning that If over 2 months I make 3 months worth of payments, I do not have to make a payment on the third month. Great and all, but not necessarily helpful for me unless I was expecting some sort of financial hardship. A recent posts comment mentioned that for some loans, you need to specify how much of the extra payment should go to principle. Is this true for auto loans? I have looked at the credit unions website that I used to make payments, but it doesn’t offer any such options. Do I need to call every time I make a payment?

Finally, I have about 22k in savings, and about 3k in emergency funds. I want to bulster my emergency fund so it would last us (my wife and I) for 90 days without a paycheck, but in order to do so, I need to have more expendable income. Should I take my savings and pay off the rest of the loan? When my wife finds employment, do we dedicate all of her pay to paying off the vehicle?

-OR-

Do I pay it off to the value of the vehicle and sell it, buying something used with the money that would be saved?

*there’s some reasoning to this thought that I could use some opinions on*

I currently owe around 18k on the vehicle, but it books for closer to 9-10k in its current condition/mileage. I still have yet to have any problems with the vehicle, and it’s fuel economy is great. But if I paid off the 8k, sold it for 10k, then used 5k towards a reliable used vehicle, I could potentially save myself 5k+ interest, while also eliminating my car payment and freeing up some income.

Any input would be nice

TL;DR- Bought a brand new car when I was single and ready to mingle. Didn’t pay enough attention to what I was doing when signing, got boned. Got married, bought a house, and now living on one income we come in tighter then we have to each month because of the vehicle. What do?",finance

personalfinance,"Got a new $45k/yr job with loan forbearance after grad school: invest the money in retirement fund, home improvement, or pay off $60k in student loans?","My wife is about to graduate and has secured a 2-year federal position that offers loan forbearance. Over the past 2 years, we have been living off my income alone and feel that we can continue to do so for another 2 years, which means we must decide what is best to do with her $45k/yr gross income.

Option 1: Prioritize student loan payments while the interest is stalled so that in 2 years, we can have 0 student loan debt. This will likely use up all of her net income.

Option 2: Invest half the money in home improvement projects that would add value to our home, which could help bring the value high enough so we do not have to continue paying mortgage insurance ($1400/yr). Invest 1/4 of the money in student loans and 1/4 of the money in my wife's retirement account (currently &lt;$10k).

Option 3: Invest half the money in retirement and half in paying off student loans.

EDIT: At the end of two years the student loan interest rate will likely be above 6%.

hydro,I need some advice on the dutch buckets I'm about to setup,"Hello fellow hydro growers! 

I'm about to put together some dutch buckets on my balcony, just like mhpgardener has done right here: https://youtu.be/nXy32Dr4Z4A

With several buckets in a row, all top fed with a hose from a reservoar with a drain going back after the buckets fill up.

But Mr.mhp here is just putting perlite in his buckets, and I've been looking at a bunch of videos and believe there's several other ways one could do this.

For example Mr. Animal Farm here: https://youtu.be/i3TmEFZIq3s

He's putting a mix of peat moss, vermiculite and perlite (and also som fertilizer, which I probably won't) in his big ""selfwatering bucket"" (which isn't selfwatering since he has to fill it up with hydronutes by hand, but anyway, it seems to work really well!)

My question is this: what kind of problems could I encounter if I go with the peat/verm/perm mix? PH-imbalance? Particles in the reservoar? What else? 
What would be the benefit of going either way? Should I use something else entirely maybe? 

Im open for ideas, suggestions and discussions. There's a few weeks left until the setup is going out, since it's currently -2C outside, so I have time for revisions to my plans! 

Cheers, and happy growing!",energy
personalfinance,Have you had car dealers play games with you on interest rates?,"So this past weekend I found a relatively rare car that I wanted, that was at a good price, so my wife and I drove 2 hours to a large “no haggle” dealership chain to look at it.  Car drives nice, clean title, the price is fixed “no haggle” and I’m not trading a car in, so I’m thinking the transaction is straight forward. 

I tell them I’m putting 20% down and interested in financing the rest. Wife and I both have good credit, 720-760ish depending on credit bureau so I’m always used to getting good rates on cars. The dealer comes back with 7.99%. I said that I thought that was high and higher than we’re used to, so the finance lady leaves,  comes back and says basically “well I checked with my manager, and we’re confident that we can get you 5.99%, will you agree to buy the car?” And I said “I love the car but I think I can get a better rate at my credit union” and so they leave again and take us to see the finance manager who says he managed to get us 3.99%. So we signed the deal and bought the car. Is this common? 

I’ve heard of people with poor credit getting hit with dealer markups on credit at shady “Buy here, Pay here” type places, but I’ve never had to negotiate my rate before at a reputable car dealership. In fact the last car I’d bought at a (different) large chain dealership, they shopped for the best rate,  and got me financing through a credit union at a rate  that my own local credit union was never able to beat.   Which experience is the more common these days?",finance
personalfinance,Any disadvantage to switching banks for my savings?,"I've been doing some looking recently at moving the vast majority of my savings from a local bank with a minuscule interest rate to one with a much higher one, like Discover or Ally. I would still keep my account at the local bank so I could have easy access, but most of my money would be moved.

My question is, would there be any consequences down the road for me if I did something like this?

I didn't really see any downside to this originally, but in talking to my parents and a few other people, they said it's a positive when looking to get a loan for something like a house in the future, to have a good, long relationship as a customer with your bank and that moving most of my money from them may affect that relationship.

Is that something I should be concerned about? Are there any other potential consequences from leaving my local bank? Are there any positives to staying with my local bank that I'm not seeing?",finance

personalfinance,Quick tax question,"Hello,

although I have an additional few thousand from other sources so my income would be approx 15k.

My question is this, does the IRS consider

personalfinance,"Deep in debt, No idea where to start, Need help","So, I'll try to be as to the point as possible. 27 yo, married w/ 2 yo and 11 mo. We are current on all payments, but not making much headway, just semi-staying afloat. Through poor budgeting and getting my wife through school w/o her working, we've built up a bit.  

&amp;nbsp; 

But everyone has to start somewhere right? So here I am trying to figure out what to do, I'm just not 100% what to do.  

&amp;nbsp;

CC Debt (DISC and AMEX) - $37609 ($474/month minimum on DISC, $204/month minimum on Amex)  
Disc - 19.24% interest  
Amex - 16.24% interest  
My fed student loans - $12258 ($123/month minimum) - 6.875% interest  
Wifes fed student loans - $48406 (currently have NOT started repayment on these yet, but it's coming)  
Wifes private student loans - $11535 ($112/month minimum on first, $50.11/month on the 2nd) - 7.590% interest on one, 11.590% on the other  
Lease $515/month, 18 payments left  
Mortgage $1184  
Bills (phone, util, internet) $563-680 depending on time of year  

&amp;nbsp;

Our gross income from last year was $70980  

&amp;nbsp;

I have no idea how to make this work. I know the idea is to put everything I can towards one, however I can barely afford minimums on everything, and that is without putting anything towards my wifes fed student loans.  

&amp;nbsp;

This situation has had me in a state of frozen fear and depression for a while once I sat down and put pen to paper and realized how much I (we've) colossally screwed up.  

&amp;nbsp;

We have stopped using both CCs,  and are trying to do what we can budget wise. With 2 kids and the expense of day care in our area, neither of us can really get a 2nd job, or it would just go to the day care alone. I do what side work I can, but with me working 6 days a week and her 3 12 hour shifts a week, theres only so much we can do. Currently our family helps watch our kids when were at work, so we feel we cannot ask them to help more than they  are.  

&amp;nbsp; 

I know this is the sum of some very poor spending and living above our means. We're making adjustments to our spending accordingly. I'm just trying to find out how to begin to get out of this hole if we can barely afford minimums.  

&amp;nbsp; 

One thing I have looked at is using National Debt Relief or Freedom Financial to get settlements on my wife's private student loans and the CCs, however I realize they will want me to go into default and stop making payments and try to settle w/ the CC companies later. I assume there is a risk that the CC and loan company could decide not to settle and instead take us to court over it.

personalfinance,Debt refinancing and some chunk cash,"Hey there r/personalfinance peoples.

I am looking for some advice as to how to proceed.

So where I am at now is I need about $5000.

I have a close friend who went through his credit union and was financed a 5k 'auto-loan' using his car title as collateral. He was approved for 215$ p/m payments at 24 months. So I was hopeful to get the same treatment.

I went today to open my account and then went through the process of getting a loan but then a bump in the road. To get the loan I need to have met one of two criteria. 

Either A: I need to have had at least one auto loan in my life

or B: make $1500 p/m income.

I met neither of these criteria. I make about $1200 p/m.

So my credit union lady suggested that I take out a loan using the same method with another bank that has a lower requirement or take out a title loan with one of 'THOSE' kinda places and either way come back and refinance.

I have been so far unsuccessful. Banks I have talked to won't accept me for the same minimum income requirements, or they just flat out don't do auto collateral loans.

So now I am stuck looking at one of 'THOSE' title loan places. 

My questions to you all is, should I be trying this? 

Should I look for other alternatives? 

If I were to go with the bad guy title loan, would I get a good refinancing option if I go to refinance with the credit union? 

Or will the credit union raise the amount i'll owe significantly in comparison to what I would have just originally had to pay to correspond with the high payback rate of the title loan from 'those guys'? 

Should I just take out a small title loan then pay it off fast so I have met the 'have taken out a previous auto-loan requirement'?

I've tried standard loans but all places deny me based on having little to no credit.

Right now my goal with the money is to consolidate debt. I just wanna pay off my credit card so I don't have to keep paying monthly interest rates. Pay off a small collection to comcast. and use some leftover money to put into my car to keep it running well.

I have to get back to work because i'm on break now but i'll periodically check in. Thanks to those who have read and I'm down to answer any questions. Sorry for typos.",finance

My specific data is located here if anyone is interested: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Educational+Process+Mining+%28EPM%29%3A+A+Learning+Analytics+Data+Set

So far I've been working in R to arrange all the data to be viewable/usable, but I have zero experience working with
a) such a large data set
b) applying machine learning techniques to nonlinear time series sets

I've been dilligently working in DataCamp and other online resources to supplement my R knowledge, but I haven't encountered anything to help me wrangle time series logs like the ones in this set. If anyone has any recommendations for machine learning techniques that could be applied to this type of data to point me in the right direction I would be extremely grateful. My main interest is if some of the measurements could predict scores or final grades for the assignments, but I'm unsure what the scope of that would entail. My current plan now is to group the data into three subsets based on which students took the final exam, pick two contrasting students (high grade/ low grade) from each subset and chart their path to look for consistency in their measurements of the Educational Process recordings. 

I can happily provide the R code I have so far for basic usability (github link: https://github.com/Alecd2/EPM-Dataset-2).

The professor stated he will purposefully be taking a hands-off approach to this project to treat it like a job assignment, but my severe lack of experience is making this a pretty difficult task. Thanks to anyone who read through all of this!",technology
financialindependence,Trying to get mega backdoor retirement accounts set up for FIRE. Thoughts?,"32, single, no dependants, 150k/yr, MCOL city     
Accounts: $50k cash, $180k retirement accounts (120k pretax 401k with PRIOR employer, 50k Roth IRA, rest HSA). I plan to also max out my HSA.    
-$220k mortgage @4% for a dual-townhome worth about 300k, I rent out the other unit which covers most of the mortgage.      

**Thoughts:**    
I have a lot more money in cash than I would like, but am hoping to invest in a fourplex before interest rates shoot up too much, which would give me a little positive cash flow into the second place.    
I am roughly planning on retiring around age 50, but is largely dependent on eventual dependents and how quickly I pick up additional rental properties, so I would need some method of pulling money out before the 59.5 age.     
It seems like it makes sense to get as much money into a Roth now as possible, since I am younger I have plenty of time to make large gains tax free. I am slightly aware there are other methods to do this but it is still hazy to me.    
Fund net expense fees for a S&amp;P500 fund: PriorEmp: .015%, CurrentEmpy: .030%, Personal Vanguard: .040%     

**Questions:**    
1. Do my numbers look right?     
2. To get the mega backdoor Roth to work: I get 4% matching, ~3.5% profit sharing, and avalible to me a 401k, Roth 401k, and taxable through Fidelity. I assume I want to put [$55k - 18.5k - (150k x .04) - (150k x .035)] = $25,250 / 26 into a taxable 401k account, then call and transfer that money each paycheck into a Roth IRA. Is this correct?     
3. I assume I leave the 18.5k a year in the Roth 401k vs moving to a Roth IRA, since the plan expense ratios for the company are a little lower than what I would get personally?     
4. Should I do anything with the 120k sitting in pre-tax 401k, (100% S&amp;P500 with .015% net expense ratio)?",finance

personalfinance,Drowning in Credit Card Debt,"This is a touchy subject for me because I don’t usually go looking for advice, but I’m a little in over my head. 

I was living overseas for a while and kept my credit cards (3) open and empty. Naturally my credit score increased, and so when I moved back to the States out of necessity, I received a lot of offers for new lines of credit, and, foolishly, accepted some. I figured it would keep me going while I got settled, found an apartment, etc. 

Started a new job, which in the beginning doesn’t pay well, but was expected to get much better. I figured that would take about 6 months, and after that my income would finally be a little better than just ok. 

It took almost a year and a half before I started to see decent paycheck, and I, again, foolishly, used my credit cards to tide me over. It’s only been in the last two months that I’ve been earning more than my expenses. 

The problem I find myself in right now is I have maxed out my credit cards (7 of them), my credit score is in the mid 500s, and I can only budget for a little more than the minimum payments on each card. 

I took on a roommate, so I have a little extra money coming in, and I’ve cut back on other expenses such as cable, internet, and so forth. 

The interest rates on the cards range from 0% to 26%. The minimum payments every month total about $600.

Ideally (or at least I think ideally) I would consider a personal loan to pay off all the cards (close to $12k), but my credit score is keeping me from doing so. 

The next option I considered was using a debt consolidation company to see if that would lower my payments, negotiate balance reductions, and be a little more structured. My personal objection to that is the fact that I spent the money, I made the decision to use the cards, and so I should responsibly pay it all back. I’m also concerned about the impact on my credit, but as low as it is, I think any damage would be negligible. 

Finding a second job would be of little use as I work as many hours as I can as it is, and my schedule is unpredictable. I also frequently travel for work so it’s hard to imagine how I would be able to successfully work somewhere else as well. 

Any advice regarding personal loans, debt consolidation companies, which cards to try to pay off first, etc, would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Where Do I Start? I'm 24 and I want to re-take control of my financial life, get my debt under control, and start saving for my future.","This may be a little long winded, so bear with me.  Any advice, suggestions or personal experiences are very appreciated. 

I am a 24 year old that wants to get my life back on track. 

I did a really good job in the last 5 years (18-23) racking up debt and just generally being incredibly financially irresponsible. 

I know I owe a great deal of money in a lot of different areas, and I don't know where to start.
My main goal is to start rebuilding my credit (currently around 480).
I know some of my debts, but others could just be floating around out there. Random phone numbers give me anxiety because they are more than likely debt collectors. 

My known debts are:
Around 5K left on student loans. The Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) has been seizing my tax returns for the past few years to pay down this debt.
 
Roughly 26K in legal fees and restitutions from a crime I committed. I have the contact info for the county clerk, which offered a $20 dollar a month payment plan when I got out of jail (for 26k?). Like all my other debts, I have ignored them, So I am assuming it has been sent to collections?

Unknown/debts in question:
I was evicted from an apartment and at the time owed three months back rent so I am assuming that is still floating around.

Aside from my government college loans, a roughly 3k fee was owed to a Greek organization I was in during college.

I honestly do not know what else could be out there, I went through a lot in the last 5 years including addiction, jail time, and several other things and financial responsibility was far from being a priority for me.

My main questions are:

1)**How do I track down all the debts that I owe** and how to react to debt collectors? Do I answer and see what they have to say? (its only down to 2 random numbers so I am assuming it is the legal fees, my most recent debt)

2) What should my priority list be? I dream of having a stellar credit score so I can someday make larger purchases like a house.

3) Should I apply for a credit card, or worry about the basics? I have got my personal life in order so I know I can handle the basic principles (pay on time, every time) but with a credit score this low, I fear my interest rate will be counterproductive.

My Income is $2,000-$2,200 a month, with $800-1,000 of that being for living expenses (Rent,car insurance, groceries, etc.)

I may add more questions as they come to me.",finance

personalfinance,Update - insurance denied $25k medflight from husband’s stroke,"TL;DR: insurance denied huge claim, learned lots about employer managed insurance and got claim paid.

My husband (super fit, healthy, 40) had a stroke at the end of 2016. Insurance denied paying for the medical helicopter used to transport him from a rural medical center with no neurological team to a stroke treatment facility. They said the flight was not “medically necessary.” I appealed twice and was denied both times. All other $225k in claims from his treatment were paid.

Update: we were going back and forth with the medflight company about what we owed. We would get a bill, call and email them and be promised a follow up with the amount we owe. Lucky for us, our medflight case manager was terrible and never followed up, just kept sending us a $25k bill. I finally got fed up after the bill was sent to collections and found a contact email on their website, hoping that someone other than our case manager could help. The President of the company called me the next day, which happened to be a Sunday afternoon. He immediately started researching and pulled it out of collections. He said he runs into this all the time and explained how company insurance plans work. He wrote a letter to my company and I contacted HR. Within a few weeks, I received a phone call that the claim would be paid in full.

Here’s the key things I learned:
1. The employer has 100% discretion over what is paid by the plan. Employers pay insurance companies to manage the day to day, but it is the employer’s ultimate decision. It’s best to assume the employer is unaware that claims are being denied and see if HR Benefits can help you. Don’t let your employer hide behind the insurance company (Blue Cross, Aetna, etc.) if you have a valid reason for a claim to be paid.

My employer partially funds my insurance, but I pay a ton of money each year to have coverage. I have paid to have full coverage and deserve that service. 

2. Don’t give up. We were almost $25k poorer because I didn’t know what to do.",finance

personalfinance,To buy a house/condo or not to buy.,"Hey,

So, I've been churning on this question for quite some and I have actually been searching for a house/condo for purchase in a really hot market - BUT - I really don't know if this is the 'right' thing to do. I know right is relative, based on individuals risk tolerance and desires, but I'm trying to gather as much feedback as possible.

OK,

So here's the scenario, I have a low down payment, but Canadian mortgage rules allow someone with less than 20% to still get a mortgage - with added mortgage insurance. So I'm okay there. Let's say our interest rates are about 3.24%. Possible chatter about interests rates very very slowly rising in the coming years.

I've been pre approved to borrow a maximum of 625000, and my down payment is around 45,000(35,000 actually if you subtract closing costs)

Now I've been eyeballing condos at top price of around 570,000. I'm restricted to an area and that is the approximate price for the type of unit I need.

My question is twofold, is it better to buy sooner while the market is rising, if you can afford it - with a budget stretch OR is it better to wait for a larger down payment. Second part, what kind of risk am I opening myself up to in the future with this type of borrowing? (High mortgage purchase price / possible, but not certain, rising of interest rates?

Thanks! Looking forward to everyone's input.",finance

personalfinance,Financed Motorcycle want to upgrade. How should I go about it? (IE),"Hello /r/personalfinance! 

A few months back I bought a motorcycle. I took out a loan as the interest rate was fairly low which I am still paying off.

Now, I'm looking to upgrade it (debating between the [Kawasaki Z900rs](https://cdn.rideapart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ruiz1712142749-A-770x440.jpg) or the [BMW R Nine T Urban G/S](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4S71yCD7Jos/maxresdefault.jpg) if you're curious.)

Now, if I sell my current motorcycle I can pay off the loan in it's entirety and request a new one for the new bike. However the main reason I took the loan was that I didn't want to dip into my savings.

Is paying off the loan and taking a new advisable? Would a bank allow me to take yet another loan and pay both off? Maybe expand my existing loan (increasing my monthly re-payments in the process)?

Or am I just better off waiting the 3.5 years I have left and pay off the loan normally to then upgrade?

**Goal:**
Retire in ~20 years with $1.5m (2018 money) in retirement.

**Background:**
Married, ages 28 &amp; 32, 6 mo child., live in rural(ish) Michigan.

**Combined Income:**

$138k salary + $30k variable (quarterly profit sharing, stock options, ESPP).

**Debts:**

$7,530 (6.5%), MOHELA student loan.

$16,841 (3.5%), 2014 Honda Odyssey (45k miles).

$248,158.56 (4.25% locked), mortgage, no PMI, assessed $312k in January 2018.

$0 Credit Card Debt, pay off weekly.

**Spending:**
Mostly under control, getting better. We usually have 300-500 extra dollars each month after all our expenses are paid. It varies, sometimes I see shiny things on amazon I want, or the kid needs medical treatment. Actively working on improving. 

**Assets:**

2009 Jetta, my daily driver, paid off and have title. Will drive in to ground.

$16,000 emergency fund.

**Retirement:**

$153k combined Roth IRA &amp; 401k, in various Vanguard &amp; Wells Target Funds.

Contributing $11k annually to Roth IRA, both in VG Target 2045 funds.

Contributing $16k annually to 401k. Wells is our only option through work, we’re both contributing to Wells Target 2045 Funds.

**Analysis:**

Monthly expenses could be whittled down to $4-5k per month in an emergency, so our first goal is increase our emergency fund to $30k. We have two big vacations planned, if stock prices stay the same we can cash out Options in September and fully fund both with cash, yes this is a risk, if it’s not feasible at that time we’ll have to get creative. Next would be pay off MOHELA due to the high interest rate, establish a few funds for misc car and home expenses, then pay off the Odyssey. After that, set up a 529 plan for the kid, and eventually bump up 401k contributions.  

**Goals In Order:**

Bump emergency fund to $30k

Christmas Vacation 2018, $2k

Italy Vacation Summer 2019, $3k (in laws are paying for lodging, which helps)

Pay off MOHELA (6.5%)

Establish Home &amp; Car Maintenance Fund, $5k

Establish “New Car Fund,” $10k

Pay off Odyssey (3.5%)

Establish Bathroom &amp; Kitchen Improvement Fund, $5k

Establish 529 Fund, TBD

Increase 401k Contributions, TBD",finance

I borrowed money from a joint savings account my wife and I have that we are using to buy a house.  I was going to pay that back using my tax return, but my return is much less than I expected (I goofed).  In order to pay back the money, I want to withdraw some of my Roth IRA contributions.  Research here showed me that I could withdraw contributions (but not earnings) tax/penalty free, as long as I fill out IRS form 8606.  Ok, that's good.

However, in doing that research, I learned that if you make over $10,000  AGI and are married filing separately, you are inelligible to contribute to a Roth IRA.  Well, last year my wife and I filed for 2016 married filing separately. My wife and I (married in 2016) both have Roth IRAs that we have contributed to throughout 2017.  Does that mean we have to file jointly this year?  Our combined AGI is below the phase-out limit if we file jointly.  I feel like I'm not wording this well.  Our taxes are a little bit of a mess this year, so it is financially better for us to file separately this year... but if it invalidates the contributions we made to our IRAs, then maybe we have to file jointly?

But with the way that politics has been affecting the markets recently and probably are going to for the next 3-7 years, there's absolutely no guarantee I'll end up net positive in a couple years when I start wanting to take money out for school if I do go.

A third option is to pay off the debt that I have, but I'm lucking out on the interest rates on that. I have about $17,000 left on my car at 2.49% (Payment is around $265/mo) and about $3,000 left on student loans at around 3.6% (Payment around $51/mo).

I only sold the house last month, so I'm comfortable sitting on it and trying to figure out my options for a few months, but I still feel paralyzed with indecision. Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,New Credit Card,"I'm looking at getting a new credit card down the road a little bit to be my everyday card for purchases of items that I don't get better rewards for on a different card (e.g., Amazon card: 5% back on Amazon, TD Cash Rewards: 3% restaurants/2% groceries, Discover It: 5% rotating, PenFed Pathfinder: 3x points on travel). Right now I use CapOne Quicksilver for my ""everything else"" purchases (1.5% on everything), but looking for recommendations on cards that might offer more. I'm considering the Citi Double Cash since it's effectively 2% on everything. Any other comparable cards? Sign up bonuses also make an impact on my decision. 

I have a FICO score of ~796, no missed or late payments, low utilization, so I'm not too concerned about getting denied for any particularly stringent cards. I just got the Pathfinder in March but don't plan on getting a new card for another couple months so the hard pull shouldn't be too big of a ding at that point.

personalfinance,"Paying off remaining debts order / tax return, Advice requested!","Hello everyone!

My wife and I are working to payoff our remaining debts, hopefully within this next year, typically I would tackle the high interest loans first but given a large tax return I am curious what your advice would be for my situations.




Debt|Total remaining | Payment | Interest
---|---|----|----
Loan 1| $5,800.00 | $288| 9.5
Loan 2| $4000| 147| 19
CC 1| $2580| 370*| 0 for 7 months then 30
CC 2| $1861| 90 | 22.

*Minimum payment is 80 for CC1 but paying off 370 a month to have it paid off within 7 months.

Tax return : 6500

My original thought was to knock out Loan 1 although it has a lower interest rate than Loan 2 merely due to the payment being larger fuel that I could toss at loan 2 however if I knock out CC2 and Loan 2 I would only have Loan 1 and CC1 left to pay off. My thought process behind Loan 1 is as I mentioned before, larger payment that I could apply to the other loans to pay them off quicker what do you recommend?

personalfinance,Graduating Law School &amp; Need Perspective,"I am 25 years old and about to graduate law school.  I sit for the bar in July, and will begin working in September at a law firm. I need some perspective on how my finances should break down and what kind of goals I should have with regards to saving and paying down student loan debt. As well as what I should expect for expenses.

I have roughly $100k in student loan debt, and she has around $30k. My first job will pay $77k for the first year (step up raises for each year after) with a $5k signing bonus. Although my wife does not have a job yet, she is a registered nurse with a bachelor's degree and has worked the entire time I've been in law school. We expect her salary to be in the $50-55k range as a rough estimate. When I start work, I *should* have ~$3k in my savings account at the time I start work. In addition to my $100k in student debt, I will probably have to take out a bar loan to get to September. The bar loan interest rates are higher because they are private loans, and generally are 8-12% interest, and the loan will be no more than $16k but I will probably only take out $10k. I currently pay $1200/month in rent for my wife and I, and we are looking to keep rent the same, although it may be between $1200-1500 month do to relocation.

My question is, what should be my main concerns? My wife and I want to buy a house at some point in the next few years, luckily for us, home prices are reasonable where we are moving. Our max budget would be $225-50k (and we can get something nice). Cost of living is relatively low as well. I also have to commute to work (no public transportation) and it is about 40 minutes each way. My current car works, but I don't know for how long as it is outdated, so I may have to purchase a car in the next couple years. I already plan on getting something used and inexpensive, but I know that is another house payment. 

Basically, I am worried about biting off more than we can chew. I know that we are making a decent bit of money, and that we should be able to live comfortably if we make the right decisions. I am looking for advice on what those decisions should be.",finance

I'm an experienced journalist based in Birmingham, Alabama, where I'm a statewide investigative reporter for [Reckon by AL.com](https://www.facebook.com/ReckonAL/?ref=br_rs).

I'm doing this AMA to give people the opportunity to ask questions and have a conversation about my reporting on Etowah County (Alabama) Sheriff Todd Entrekin and the way he has, in his own words, turned the responsibility of feeding inmates in the county jail he oversees into ""a business."" Because of how a state law dating to before World War II was written, Entrekin was able to [personally pocket](http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/03/etowah_sheriff_pocketed_over_7.html) more than $750,000 worth of funds allocated to feed inmates over the past three years, and he and his wife bought a $740,000 beach house in September. He also [arrested a young man](http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/02/man_arrested_on_six_charges_fo.html) on a drug trafficking charge four days after I published [an article](http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/02/alabama_sheriffs_pocket_tens_o.html) that quoted him speaking critically about Entrekin, but the charges were dropped and the man [was released](http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/03/man_arrested_after_criticizing.html) from jail shortly after I wrote about his arrest. Entrekin [maintains that](http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/03/beach_house_sheriff_defends_in.html) he has done nothing wrong. But federal officials and lawyers with decades of relevant experience say the practices [may have run afoul](http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/03/alabama_sheriffs_keeping_jail.html) of federal law, and current and former inmates and civil rights advocates have for years claimed that the [food served](http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/03/inside_etowah_county_jail_nigh.html) in the jail Entrekin runs is inadequate and low-quality.

My reporting focuses largely on Alabama’s justice system, particularly its prisons, jails and law enforcement agencies, and the legal and institutional frameworks upon which they are built. I also write about corruption, societal concerns and the impacts of punitive policies on under-represented and minority communities across the state.

personalfinance,Is it better to put my income (after expenses) towards investments (long term) or towards paying off debt quickly?,"My friend and I were just having this discussion and I'm now really curious what the answer is.  It seems like every personal finance book, podcast, etc. says to pay off debt quickly, starting with the highest interest rate debt (which makes sense).  But what if the interest rate on the debt is lower than what my investments should return.  If I mainly invest in a market ETF, and plan to hold it for the long term, it should conservatively return 7% annually.  Therefore, my thinking was that every year I should still be profiting the spread between my market gains and my interest payments.  So is it worth it to pay off debt with low interest rates, i.e. below 7%?  Some examples might be paying down low interest student loans immidiately or keeping money in the market ETF and making the minimum payments on the loans.  Or if I were to buy a new car for $20k, would it be worth it to get a low interest rate loan, and make min payments every month, or just pay 100% in cash (assuming both are viable options)?

CryptoCurrency,Verge (XVG) Mining Exploit Attack Megathread,"To reduce the multitude of posts on this topic, this megathread will take their place and include existing information and any further updates.

####Summary  

On April 4th, suprnova mining pool operator ocminer [posted this thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.0) notifying the crypto community and verge team that the attack had happened and how it worked.  

&gt; There's currently a &gt;51% attack going on on XVG which exploits a bug in retargeting in the XVG code.
&gt; 
&gt; Usually to successfully mine XVG blocks, every ""next"" block must be of a different algo.. so for example scrypt,then x17, then lyra etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Due to several bugs in the XVG code, you can exploit this feature by mining blocks with a spoofed timestamp. When you submit a mined block (as a malicious miner or pool) you simply set a false timestamp to this block one hour ago and XVG will then ""think"" the last block mined on that algo was one hour ago.. Your next block, the subsequent block will then have the correct time.. And since it's already an hour ago (at least that is what the network thinks) it will allow this block to be added to the main chain as well.

This attack given the malicious miner almost 99% of the effective hashrate, giving them the ability to perform a 51% attack and rapidly collect block rewards from thousands of blocks.  In response, some exchanges have disabled deposits and some pools have disabled Verge support as they cannot currently compete.  

The Verge development team has said they will not rollback the chain, and has [pushed an attempted fix that has been controversial](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3256693.msg33949269#msg33949269) about whether it will work and what unintended consequences it may have.

personalfinance,The best time to look for a job is when you have a job - solid evidence from the Federal Reserve,"There is an old piece of conventional wisdom, that the best time to look for a job is when you already have a job.  A recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York provides solid evidence that that is the case:

**[Do the Employed Get Better Job Offers?](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2018/04/do-the-employed-get-better-job-offers.html)** (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)

&gt; . . . We want to compare how job offers received by the nonemployed compare to those received by the employed . . . The most striking result is that there are very large wage differences associated with these offers: on average, employed job seekers receive hourly wage offers that are 39 log points (48 percent) higher than those received by the nonemployed. Even after controlling for the observable characteristics of the job seeker and the employer offering the job, the employed receive wage offers that are still 22 log points (23 percent) higher, on average. 

That's a big difference - a very big difference.  There follows some discussion on why exactly the difference is so big.  (My own experience suggests that people who are already employed only look for jobs that are strict upgrades from their current position, so are more selective in what they apply for in the first place.)

That obviously is not good news for those who are unemployed.  But it suggests a few general ideas to guide the job search.

**Don't quit a job until you have an offer for another in hand.** ([As stated in the PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/leaving_job#wiki_before_resigning_or_if_you_are_at_risk_of_being_let_go.2Flaid_off).)  It's not just that being unemployed is *really* expensive - although it is - it's also that your prospects for finding another job are worse than if you stuck with the last one.

**Consider starting early in looking for the next job if it looks like layoffs or an unlivable work situation are headed your way.**  Waiting until you get the pink slip is a really bad idea.  Even if the layoffs never materialize, you'll have expanded your business network by meeting with other potential employers.

**Consider taking interim or temporary work while engaged in a long-term job search.**  ""What are you doing right now"" is a terrible question if the answer is ""nothing"".  Being full-time looking for new work looks good on paper, but see the statistics cited above - it's bad for job offers.  Taking a temporary position, even something like an unpaid internship (you don't have to tell them how much you're currently making - or not making), can improve your position in negotiating a new position.",finance

So here we go...

I am trying to refinance my auto loans. I don't have a huge loan but I think I could save a little money with a lower APR - right now ~$12k at ~5%. 

I applied at RateGenius - originally before i applied they advertised 2.99% through credit karma. I know advertisements can be misleading - so this part is on me, thats fine.

They did a hard check for the application. The came back to me with ""fully approved"" loans @ 2.4-2.5% options (with varying term lengths). I was okay with that - its half of the rate I had now. No fees or early payment penalties so that sounded okay to me. 

I asked them to send me the documents. They said sure - but then the next day, I get a call from them saying the rate is now 3% if I set up auto pay and its like 3.24 (or maybe 3.5) if I don't set up auto-pay.

This all seems fishy to me, is it normal for them to suddenly change the interest rate on me after they sent me a ""fully approved"" quotes? They already had my full/hard credit report? what could have changed?",finance

gaming,Far Cry 5’s Ending in Context: An Examination of the Series and Choice,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This was something I started writing that I had planned to delete when it was done. But the more I wrote the more I had to say and the more detailed it got, and before I knew it I had a mini-article. Hopefully some of you will enjoy reading it and be inspired to discuss below!


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To examine Far Cry 5’s ending and why its different, and in my opinion weaker, we must understand the Far Cry series itself. The Far Cry series is one that I admire for its ability to seamlessly mesh deep, philosophical and geopolitical questions with fun, over-the-top gameplay. This starts with FC2 where the first rumblings really begin by examining the complex nature of humanitarian aid, arms dealing, crime and civil war in the African theater. A deeply unexplored region of the world when it comes to gaming. However it really takes off with FC3.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FC3 has been examined again and again for its narrative; one that is wholly unobtrusive but refreshingly deep. The journey of the main character Brody is the journey of the player – literally and metaphorically. Brody is transformed from a caricature of the American college student – wealthy, immature, and unworldly, into a reflection of the typical gamer, a blood-thirsty, murderous sociopath totally focused on achieving a single goal. Victory. So consumed with improvement which enables him to become a better killer that the entire game puts a focus on pumping drugs into your system like they’re candy. Now I’m not trying to say all drugs are bad, but grinding up some plants a half-naked tribal person told you about and them immediately shoving that concoction into your system to gain what is essentially a drug-fueled super power… that’s intensely self-destructive and reckless. And then the game ends with that as a self-reflection – He cant leave the island even if he saves his friends. He’s too far gone. The gamer is too far gone. He has fun in an environment that is totally hostile, just like the player.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The game explores what it means to be civilized. What it means to take joy is the killing of other people, and what it means to us, as our identity as gamers. It’s a moment of self-reflection for both the main character, and the player. This goes hand in hand with an exploration of the hero’s journey. A single goal that drives us, but how far is Brody, and the player, willing to go? Once he picks up the gun, how does that affect him and does it end “well?” There are no clear answers, only reflection and thought.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;FC4 continues this trend with the examination of what it means to be a dictator, and the multifaceted problems facing many third world and developing countries. What is control worth? Pagan Min is a dictator, and while he might not be typical his attitude is very analogous to many real-world dictators of the past and present. He’s eccentric, violent, and self-absorbed. He uses his power to benefit himself chief of all, and ensures above all things that the country runs smoothly because that’s his source of income. He does this through fear, violence, and oppression. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So that’s when the player arrives – typically someone from a Western first world country just like the character himself Ajay Ghale. We almost universally value freedom over oppression, and choice over control. It’s how we’re raised. So, when Pagan Min is presented as an obstacle to our personal mission, and our political philosophy, we set out to take him down. But if you’ve beat the game you know that the choices you’re given to replace Pagan Min reflect how complicated the issues really are. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The countries main resource is the raw form of heroin – poppies. That’s their export upon which their government exists. In conjunction with this they have a strong, fundamentalist religion, as a lot of developing countries do. When it comes to replacing Pagan, you have the option of the progressive party which turns the country into what is essentially a giant drug cartel, or the traditionalist party which is as oppressive to the freedom of its people as Pagan himself, with the added benefit of being firmly against governmental development; they are anti trade and pro isolationist. No matter which you choose there is a cut scene that plays in a particular village, showing the leader of your choice engaging in what we’ll call questionable ethical decisions.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Given this perspective the player might ask; is Pagan Min really so bad? Yes he is oppressive, violent, and selfish, but he has control. He maintains a stable government, and a working country. They produce, they have services, and they have protection as long as you aren’t speaking out against the government. The player’s choice invites more turmoil into the country than if they left Pagan Min in control. There is almost certainly a civil war in the countries future as a result. This problem parallels real life problems facing political unrest in third, and second world countries in a time when it is more relevant than ever. What do we as a country do when we replace a dictator? Is it right to interfere in another country and seek to stop a perceived atrocity even when history shows this leads to even more bloodshed in the near future? There is no clear answer.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I pretend Far Cry Primal doesn’t exist. Moving on.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Enter FC5 and its story. Focused on extremism, and extremist rhetoric and thought. FC5 is a tonged-in-cheek exploration of the American identity. What does it mean to be an American, and how is that joined with the ‘Murican identity? I’m not going to go into a complete deconstruction of the Americanism of the game, because I think that’s pretty clear by a mission in which you drive a semi-truck painted with the flag, flames, and a bald eagle, with twin 50. Cal MGs mounted to it. Its fun. The ‘Murican identity is fun, and the game embraces that.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But hand in hand with that identity is extremism. Christian extremism in the form of the Seed family, and specifically Joseph Seed. The game opens with you being given a choice – fight extremism, or leave. The mantra of the game is made clear repeatedly, that “…Not every problem can be solved with a bullet.” Something that both the Sheriff your closest ally, and Joseph Seed himself says to the character at different points in the game. The “hidden” ending is that you do nothing, and you walk away choosing that the blood shed which would occur if you stood against extremism isn’t worth the peace you have now. You drive away and nothing happens. If you choose to stand against Seed, the choice entitled “Resist” the game begins.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It begins with you pitted against a religious cult who murders, steals, and forcibly converts the populace of Hope County, Montana. All because Seed is preparing for the end of the world, which he believes is on its way as evidenced by your actions fulfilling his prophecy. From here what the Deputy, and the controlling player does is generally pretty uniform across everyone I’ve talked to; you ignore him. What he spouts is nonsense, religious extremism that only serves to make his fall all the more sweet as you slowly prove him wrong by liberating town after town, outpost after outpost, and kill his “family” one member at a time. The important thing here is the framing – the game does nothing to enforce that Seed is anything but exactly what the player thinks he is – a crazy person. A religious fanatic and a murdering psychopath. There is even a point where you learn that he killed his newborn child because he believed it was God’s will—this doesn’t do him any favors in the mind of the player for obvious reasons.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And then there’s the end – Surprise, he’s right! The world IS ending. As you beat the final boss and move in to arrest Seed, he says some prophetic stuff which I ignored and don’t remember word for word even after playing the game through twice, and then boom – a nuke detonates behind him. After this is the final “mission” a short drive where you desperately move through a burning landscape to try and reach a fallout bunker nearby. When this was occurring on my first play through I thought the entire thing was a farce—I thought I had been drugged by the so-called “Bliss,” a drug made relevant through the entire game for its mind-altering properties. But no. Its real. The world ends, and the game ends with you and Seed alone in a bunker, with you handcuffed to a bed as he forgives you for all you’ve done, calls you family, and points out how right he was.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the context of the ending you might ask, as I did, what does this mean? I toyed with the idea that maybe Seed was in control of the nuke. Maybe he was the one who set them off to bring about his own prophecy? But the more I thought about this the more ridiculous I realized that idea was. There is no indication that he would have control over that kind of weapon, and realistically, and even unrealistically speaking, he wouldn’t. I was trying to rationalize. To force what the game as telling me into a narrative that I could swallow and accept. But when I played the game a second time, and really paid attention, no… He’s just… right. Now what does that mean? Is he REALLY talking to God? The game seems to be suggesting that and a fundamental lesson of story-telling is that everything happens for a reason and that there is no coincidence unless you’re TOLD its coincidence (or it’s a genre like mystery where the term red herring exists for a reason). Everything is the writer’s choice. Everything is planned. So, while it may be unpalatable it does seem to be the suggestion.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To me this throws everything the game has told us up until this point into question. What is the message? We’ve spent the entire game basically making fun of extremist thought in all its forms – in the overt ‘Muricanisms that are there as the butt of a joke, in the sarcastic item descriptions that poke fun at hyper-political ideologies, in the fact that the main villain is a literal representation of this type of extremism that we’re fighting against. We’ve spent the entire time with this massage that fighting against this sort of thought is the right thing to do, even if it is costly, and then the ending reverses that – he’s right, you’re wrong. Now does that validate everything Seed did? Absolutely not, depending on how far you carry the religious narrative (If he really IS a prophet or not). Was stopping him the right decision? Considering that the alternative is to not play the game it does seem that is the suggested right decision. But really if you just look at it at face value– what the hell? Of course, you have to stop him. I hate Hitler analogies because they’re so painfully overused but we know what ignoring extremism does. We know what ignoring this type of thought does, and what it doesn’t do is get better. Isolation makes a wound fester. You have to treat it. As a result, what to take away from this ending is unclear. It seems unplanned and poorly executed in its best light, and in its worst completely nihilistic and just plain bad. But maybe this isn’t the ‘true’ ending?


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is a second way of interpreting FC5 that occurred to me during my second play through, one that leads to a more interesting discussion, and one that I actually think was the intended takeaway. It’s you. Not metaphorically, but literally. It is you, as the player. You are the harbinger of the end times. You end the world. This sentiment isn’t just something I’ve pulled out of thin air, its repeatedly pointed out, time and time again by every Seed family member—especially Faith, the little sister. “He believes himself the prophet, but it will be you who chooses…” In the end, and the beginning, it is your choice that brings about the end of the world – literally. Both times you walk away nothing happens, at least not on a global scale. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now how is this possible? What kind of insane butterfly effect meta is going on here that your choice to stand against someone in the backwoods of Montana is literally the trigger for the end of the world? How can it possibly be you? I don’t have these answers. What I do know is that the “Reaping,” the Seed families’ declaration that now is the time to turn to violence, to make one last bid to gather as many resources and people as possible to prepare for “The Collapse,” their name for the end of the world, is kicked off by your choice. That the bombs drop as a result of your choices. That everything happens because you choose for it to.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So why is this better? Because the narrative isn’t about Seed—and it isn’t about if he’s right or wrong, its about cost. As Jacob says when you defeat him, “I don’t know if he (Joseph) talks to God… that doesn’t matter. He was right.” What cost is too much, and what choices do we make? Knowing that we are the literal harbingers do we still consider the choice “worth it?” Is the bloodshed the right call? Is standing up the right decision? Nothing would happen if we didn’t do anything. The cult has been living side by side with Hope County for years without incident—yes there is tension, but it is our choice which turns it violent. Is it worth it? Is it worth ending the world?!


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The short answer is yes. Unequivocally yes, and now we discuss why FC5’s ending and its story are in my opinion the weakest of the series. FC3, and 4 deal with complex issues which don’t have a clear answer. That’s the whole point. It opens the floor for discussion. FC3 explores our identity as gamers, and our relationship to violence and a goal-oriented mindset. How it drives us sometimes recklessly towards achievement at the cost of our character’s very humanity. FC4 asks the question if Pagan Min was really the worst choice for Kyrat? Are the replacements worse for the nation as a whole or better? Should we meddle in the affairs of other nations in order to encourage what we believe is beneficial growth? Again, there is no clear answer. But FC5 has an answer. Its an answer supported by everything history has shown us to be true, and in the words of John Seed “Just say yes.”


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Extremism doesn’t go away when ignored, and doing so is often the most harmful thing you can do in terms of societal development. Discussion is at the heart of growth, and devoid of that we have no way to gage progress. Again, I hate to use such a cliché analogy, but 1930s Germany and the political landscape leading up to the rise of Hitler and the Third Riche is the closest example of this which everyone knows about. Much of the rise of extremist thought in Germany was due to frustration, and it was a slow decent, but a huge component of that was willful ignorance. Once it started to get bad people felt powerless to stand in the way of the machine that they had helped put in place, and so they ignored it. They kept their heads down, and it got worse and worse. The purpose of this example is not to admonish those people, or to say they did wrong, but to look at one of the factors that helped cause one of the world’s most costly wars and realize that the only answer can be yes. You have to stand up. You have to resist. In the case of FC5 that is violently, but in life it doesn’t have to be. Its dialogue and discussion.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now the truly tragic part of the FC5 narrative is that in order to have this message you have to kind of look past the ending’s face value, and to give the writing team a lot of credit for laying in this complex narrative. It also requires a pretty massive suspension of disbelief that your character is somehow the literal cause of a world-wide disaster. I’ve discussed this theory with a close friend, and she acknowledges my interpretation but just doesn’t buy it. “I find it infinitely more likely this was a result of poor execution and planning than some larger narrative purpose…” and its hard to say she’s wrong. But even if I’m right, and there is this narrative purpose, the ending is still weak and doesn’t lead to much discussion or self-reflection. Its just an answer. A boring answer that brings nothing new to the table. To me, that’s a true shame because the rest of Far Cry 5 is just so damn good.",technology

personalfinance,mortage refi at a highter interest rate,"i've read several threads in this sub with similar questions - but my goals seem a bit different and wanted to reach out to the community for more pointed advice.

i am currently 8 years in on an FHA mortgage has ~352k remaining at 4.5% interest rate.  the monthly payment is 2800, of that PMI is 160.

i've got a potential refinance (30 year fixed, conventional mortgage)  that would lower the total monthly payment by ~300 - but its at a higher interest rate (4.75).  there would be no closing costs associated with the refi.

i am planning to rent the unit and this would allow me to make some money each month, rather than break even.  i don't expect to keep this property for the life of the loan, and would probably sell in ~5-10 years.

it seems like a no-brainer, but increasing the interest rate is giving me pause.  any feedback is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Home Buying - Down payment impact on interest rate?,"Hey guys. Hope this is the right sub for this. 

We’ll be selling and buying soon. We have some decent equity in the current house, in addition to its value rising in the 10 years we’ve lived here. 

When all I said and done, realtor is paid, mortgage is paid, etc... I expect to clear a nice lump sum. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 55-60k

Not that relevant to my question, but I’m gonna but the entire amount in a secure, low risk/low reward investment (probably the most conservative bond fund I can find) for anywhere from 6-18 months.  During that time, most of our shit will be in storage, while the necessities and humans will stay with my wife’s parents. I’ll throw her dad a few hundred a month to help out, while the rest of what used to me my mortgage payment will be used to attack debt. ALL debt.  Then we will move to our dream area, a suburb about 15 miles outside the city. 

Onto my question. Common sense dictates a larger down payment should result in a better rate. The house automatically has some decent equity in it, making it a safer investment for the investor (bank)

Google tells me that’s true as well. 

But what I’m having problems finding is real world examples/stories

Have any of you had a rate change by putting more down? And how much better did the rate get?

Or any mortgage brokers here? If I walked in with 20% (I’m starting there, a little high, to exclude PMI as a variable) you see my 20% is legit, and offer me 4.5%

Then I’m like “okay dude. Let me bump that shit to 30% down”

Mr. Anonymous Mortgage Broker, that I hope is reading this, what would that extra 10% (or even extra 15-20%) down do to change my rate?

I know it’s a lot more involved than that, but I simplified the process for the post. 

Basically I’m looking for real examples, real numbers I can play around with in Excel, rather than every website telling me what I already know, that it “can” or “might” get me a better rate.

I’m a 28 year old former artist who just became part of corporate America (RIP dreams) living in NYC.  Looking for some financial advice since this is the first time I’ve had stable income/benefits and have student loans to deal with.  EDIT: My GF did not pressure me to take this job, I am fine with my passion being a side hustle and it's more important to me that I can have a family one day and move out of my parents house.  She was my number 1 fan the whole way and I'm solely responsible for killing my dreams and am fortunate I was able to chase them for as long as I did.

Salary: 80k + Bonus in a year based on company profit (I also still make 5-15k off my music projects depending on streams/sales)

Rent: None until Jan 2019 (living home until then).  EDIT: Many people are suggesting I should stay home longer.  I have a GF of 7+ years who has put up with all my bullshit in the music industry and part of me taking this Job was to have enough income for us to move in together...so I have to move in with her in Jan 2019 when her lease is up.

Savings: 8k (with 4k for an emergency fund and 4k for general savings)

Loan details: 117,416.58 in graduate school loans.  7.210%, 6.840% and 5.840% interest rates depending on the loan.  Right now I'm paying 0 a month but will have to start paying in Jan 2019.  Minimum payments are $518 for the higher interest and $310 for the lower interest.

Job Benefits: Planning to max out 401k and opt in for Medical (plan without HSA) and dental/vision.  The 401k has a Roth option but I don't really understand what it is, and after a year of employment they match based on company profitability.

Just started using YNAB and it's really helped me get a grip on wtf is going on with my money.  Especially as an artist for the last 8 years I had no idea wtf was happening.

Looking for any advice, specifically on how to deal with my loans!  Thanks, happy to provide any additional information.",finance
personalfinance,Is secondary health insurance useful?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but who's ever sure of such things?

I have what I would consider to be very good health insurance at a reasonable cost. Blue Cross blue shield federal employee program is what I currently have. The coverage is great, and copays generally aren't bad.

My son was recently diagnosed with autism, and his recommended therapies are to be quite intensive. I'm not sure how many hours per day we will go with, but I'm looking at 5 days a week. Each visit/ each day gives me a $40 copay. For regular appointments, that's never been an issue. But looking at $40 every weekday, that adds up obviously.

Is this where secondary insurance could help? This is not a deductable in play here, just non negotiable copays. There is no yearly cap or anything like that.

The only option I'm aware of and currently taking advantage of, is the flexible spending account. The one where you can add pre-tax funds each check, to a maximum of around 5000 per year I believe. While helpful, that still won't be enough to cover all the appointments.

Any resources or ideas out there? Basically looking to offset the potential $800 per month cost of copays. The cost won't destroy the family or anything, but it is a bit jarring.",finance

personalfinance,Trade future equity for down payment assistance?,"Looking to buy my first home in Southern California and the prices in my area are above the 2006/2008 peak levels. We have just barely enough to put down 20% if we keep the purchase price below $600k. The specific house we are looking at would need ~$20k in kitchen upgrades to be ""livable"" to my wife. We are comfortable with the payments on the 3 scenarios below.

Here are my options:

1) Do the 20% down and not upgrade the kitchen and just live for a period of time until we save enough for the renovation (conservatively 3+ years). This is by far the most prudent approach.

2) Do 15% down (mortgage rate will be .2% higher without 20% down) pay PMI ~$120 month until I hit the 20% mark and PMI drops off. Use the $20k I would have used for downpayment on the kitchen.

3) Use a company like Unison to do downpayment matching. From what I understand they will take an equity interest in the appreciation of the house. You pay 2.5% upfront they do 10% down and take 35% of any base appreciation on the home. After 3 years they will proportionately share in any depreciation. The only way this really works for me is if house prices stay kinda flat or fall (if I think its going up at the same rate then I would do option 1 and refinance if needed). My market has been rising 6-10% a year for the past 5+ years, but I can't see that being sustainable especially with rising interest rates and historically high prices. I view this option as an expensive hedge for a price drop/correction in the next 5 years. No my wife won't wait for 3-5 years to purchase a home.

Can I rule out one or two of these options out as a complete idiocy?

personalfinance,"First tax season with a brand new job: do I max an IRA for last year, or pay my student loans and buy a car?","So here's my situation: I've been out of school almost two years and finally got a ""real"" job in February making 49k. I made next to nothing last year freelancing, and most of what I did make went into student loans and equipment for the business I was building. I didn't save anything for retirement.

I just found out it's not too late to open a Roth IRA and contribute for last tax year. If I max it out, that's an additional $5,500 in there I'll never be able to make up in the future.

Here's dem stats:
* 2760 monthly takehome (company matches 6% so I maxed that already)

* Monthly expenses including loans are about $750 (living at home rent free for the moment, and my car is ancient/about to crap out).

* 8k available to spend as of today. Net gain of about 2k a month, but no more paychecks before tax time.
* I have a bit over 30k in student loans, but mostly at 3-4% The highest is a $7500 loan at 6.5% that I'd like to pay off yesterday.

* Did I mention I need a new car? I'm not at risk of losing the job if it dies since I could borrow one for a bit, but it needs to happen.

My initial plan was to by a car with cash in the 7k to 10k range, but I realized car loans are cheaper than my 7.5k student loan, so I was debating financing the car (maybe allow for spending 11-13k for something a bit nicer at a dealership) and paying the student loan off. 

BUT...I just realized I can still contribute to an IRA for last year. If I open a Vanguard account and max out the contribution, that leaves 2.5 k for a down payment on the car, and nothing towards the loan (except the monthly).

I realize the interest rates on a Vanguard fund vs the student loan should more or less cancel, but it would be a HUGE mental thing to pay the loan off. Plus I HATE the idea of financing a car, even for just the year or less it would take to pay it down.

But I also realize contributing to a Roth for last year is something I can't make up in the future. It would set me back a few months on my plan to pay of loans and start saving for some projects/maybe some property, and I don't like the idea of depleting my available cash without making headway in any of those areas. But eventually I might be glad I did. I'm going in circles and need input.

TL;DR: Do I open a Roth IRA before I file and finance the car, do i pay the 7.5k loan and finance the car, or do I buy a car with cash and forget the other two?

&gt; After years of borrowing for stock buybacks and company buyouts at extremely cheap rates, the tide is turning as the Federal Reserve raises its target rate and pulls stimulus. That’ll pressure the swollen ranks of over-leveraged firms and weigh on growth, Guggenheim Partners Global Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd said. Pacific Investment Management Co. and BlackRock Inc. are among investors curbing purchases or being pickier about what they buy.

&gt; In particular, investors in the U.S. junk-bond market are becoming more choosy and less tolerant of debt backing risky takeovers, according to Rick Rieder, global chief investment officer for fixed-income at BlackRock Inc.

&gt; To be sure, some say it’s premature to abandon credit. Improved cash flows aided by U.S. corporate tax cuts and a long runway to refinance debt have pushed the day of reckoning farther into the future. The number of corporate defaults globally fell to a three-year low of 95 in 2017, according to a report Thursday by S&amp;P.

One company I have in my stock holdings announced that they were unwilling to raise capital through the stock market as the stock had already fallen hard enough (and it appears they don't understand why). Instead, they're looking at selling ""under-performing assets"" to continue to grow.

It also appears that they are also close to their revolving credit limit. That's going to be an interesting risk because much of their revenue comes from multi-year contracts that guarantee payments (unless products are not delivered as expected or the counter-parties go bankrupt). They pretty much have guaranteed revenue, but with high levels of debt.",finance
Bitcoin,"How the world will look after Bitcoin takes over, and why it is a very bright future indeed.","If you have been paying attention and have a correct understanding of monetary economics, you will have correctly concluded that Bitcoin will grow until it takes over the entire world currency market, squeezing out all competitors included fiat and gold, rendering them worthless.

Since we can know this outcome to be an inevitable certainty, let’s look ahead and consider what are the consequences inescapable hyperbitcoinization.

**The world’s first global deflationary currency**

You may have arrived at the correct conclusion that Bitcoin will end up being hoarded by everyone as it reigns supreme as a currency monopoly, but if you are also a dumbass may draw absurd and unfounded fears about deflation.  You may lie awake at night fearful of a future where people starving to death as they hold off buying food until next year when they can buy five or even ten percent more.  It is interesting to imagine a world where a currency has brought an abrupt end to human’s desire for instant gratification, but this is not how people behave.

Even today we can know that if people defer their consumption, they can increase their purchasing power through investment in risk-free assets such as US Treasuries, and yet they do not do so.  You can either conclude that this very modest intermediate step is preventing humanity from ceasing all consumption, or you can conclude that people have a much higher preference for goods and services now, rather than at some distant point in the future.   Time is deflationary.

Additionally, with a deflationary currency we can conclude that people would be incentivized to work harder with the goal of earning more money; this is a very good thing for increased productivity.  

**The eviction of rent-seeking financial leeches**

If you correctly understand Bitcoin, you would correctly conclude it will bring about the end to banks as we know them today.  Currently, our society’s method for maintaining a “secure” accounting ledger requires a great deal of resources—about 7 percent of GDP known as the financial sector.  Valuable real estate and human effort are consumed building and staffing banks in every city.  Without these resources having to be used to maintain the ledger, and are free do other constructive work and increase overall economic efficiency.  This is similar to how Netflix or Amazon’s ability to provide the function of video rental and book stores for a fraction of the cost allowed all of that real estate and labor to be redirected to other more productive activity.  Such will be the case with banks and finance as well.

From this correct conclusion, many people draw the incorrect conclusion that without banks and financing, people would be able to afford housing, cars, and education.  Housing, autos, and education are not subsidized by the banking industry; that is, the banks are not charitable organizations that contribute to cover the cost of these products.  They are rather entities that consume resources.  Without banks and lending, people as a whole could still spend the same amount of money on housing but this same amount would then go further as it no longer has cover overhead costs of the financial industry—e.g. people who buy their houses with cash, end up paying less than those that do so via financing.  

The timing of purchases would be impacted.  Without artificially low interest rates, people would likely shift their purchases and people would put money down, but people would still be buying homes and cars, albeit more efficiently.

Financing also distances the consumer from the actual cost of the product.  This is why when people buy autos or homes, they are less price conscious than they are on direct purchases, [often exceed their budget]( https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/04/03/hot-housing-market-home-buyers-spending-more-than-expected/479824002/), and are willing to pay for upgrades and features they would not otherwise purchase if they were more sensitive to their direct cost.  This is especially true in education, where people incur cost at expensive universities with nice amenities because their payment of those cost is deferred far into the future.   

In summary, humans spent money on housing and education before banks and will continue to do so after bitcoin has eliminated them and fractional reserve banking.

**Non-Bitcoin money is the root of all evil, and Bitcoin will destroy those roots and all those who rely upon them**

You may have heard the phrase “money is the root of all evil”.  I believe this is true in the sense that traditional money and control of it, is what allows the nation state to exist.  If you look at history you will see that governments always seem to have a very strong interest in controlling money and dictating to people what form of money they are required to use.  Governments do this because they receive a substantial benefit from control of the money supply.  By being able to expand the money supply via the creating of new currency units, the nation state generates a significant profit for itself—this is what is known as seigniorage, but is a rarely discussed economic term given how large this profit is.   Without seigniorage, governments would have to fund themselves entirely through taxation or debt.  This imposes financial discipline on governments and would strongly discourage or perhaps even prohibit expensive things like unpopular wars, mass incarceration, and big ineffective government programs in general.

When Bitcoin destroys the fiat currency, it kills the root on which the menacing tree of government grows.  Without control of the money supply, governments will be limited to smaller less threatening trees that are constrained by economics and market forces.  This will be a boon for peace and freedom lovers everywhere. 

**Conclusion**

Bitcoin will end banks, wars, and big government and increase economic efficiency and personal freedom.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Banking on Yourself With Cash (Sans Life Insurance Policy),"I read an article awhile ago (which I cannot find now) that described the concept of banking on yourself but just using a checking account or savings account **instead** of investing in a scammy life insurance policy. I am attracted to the idea of really thinking purchases through before committing, and that I'd be ""profiting"" by making loans to myself instead of the bank.

I am wondering how to actually go about being my own bank though. I imagine different interest rates should apply to different loan amounts. Thinking about at what threshold I want to consider purchases as requiring a loan, anything above $100, $200, $300.

I came across [unbury.me](http://unbury.us) poking around in the wiki and top posts on this subreddit, it looks like a great tool. But since these ""loans"" are something I'm making up I'm not sure what to put into the minimum payment field or the interest rate.

I'm wishing there was a table or formula where I could figure out what lenders typically would charge me. I see that 10% or more is high interest and 5% and below is considered low, but I'm not sure at what dollar amount loans those tiers typically apply to.

Apologies if this isn’t the appropriate sub, but I have a question regarding a credit freeze I have on my Equifax account. 
Back when equifax had their data breach, I froze my credit with all three credit bureaus. However, I was recently hired for a position with a federal agency, so I removed the credit freezes I had placed with Experian and TransUnion. When I went to remove my equifax freeze, I was asked for a 10 digit pin that I have unfortunately lost. I am required to request a new one by mail (instead of over the phone or email) and I am sending out the letter today.

My question is, can an employer conduct a background check if two of the three credit bureaus do not have my information frozen? Or do all three credit bureaus need to have the freeze lifted in order for a background check to be conducted? I’m just worried that I won’t hear back from equifax in time to complete the background check before my start date, which is May 7th.",finance

I'm looking for any pointers anyone wants to give me on how I can better save and invest my money each month. I think I'm pretty smart with my money, but I'm interested in hearing people's ideas on how I can do even better!

I am 25 years old, single with no kids, in my first job after college (been promoted once). Right now I'm making approximately $4500 a month (~$3500 after taxes and insurance). My company matches 100% my 401k contributions up to 3%. I’m putting in 3% pre-tax and 3% roth, so about $260 per month total. With the company match I have about $11,600 in there right now. 90% in stocks and 10% in bonds.

All in all, my take home pay comes out to approx. $3100 per month. I’m paying about $950 a month for rent and utilities. Just paid off my car, but my auto insurance is $115 per month. My phone costs $45 a month.

As far as debt is concerned, I came out of college with about $30,000 in student loans. Not ideal, but nothing too terrible either. My minimum payment is around $325 a month for 10 years. Right now I’m paying the minimum on all the loans and putting an additional $100 a month towards the 3 loans with the highest interest rates. I started with 13 loans, and I’ve paid off 3 of them. All my rates are between 3.15% and 6.55% I’ve paid off about $12,000 I think in the last 2 and a half years this way.

I have 3 credit cards that I pay off at the end of every month, and my credit score is 760.
I got a small $22,000 whole-life insurance policy last year. It’s a 20 year pay, and the premium is $30 per month.

As far as savings go, I’m putting $100 a month into a high yield savings account (1.55%). I currently have $2200 in savings. I’d like to get a couple months’ worth of income saved for an emergency fund. Thinking about increasing the amount I put away per month.

I recently opened an account with M1 Finance, and started investing $100 a month in several index funds (Vanguard Total Market, Vanguard S&amp;P 500, etc). I’m not entirely what my long term investment goals are, but I wanted to start earning money off my money, instead of just having it sit in the bank. Ideally I’d want to use this to help me retire early, or maybe for a down payment on a house or something.

So, my question is, based on my situation, is there anything I should be doing differently? Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Student loan solutions?,"Maybe I'm just being lazy and I haven't searched this subreddit enough. The title is exactly like it says. I graduated from a 2 year University in Chicago in 2011 with at the time 46k principal in student loans. When I agreed to take out loans in 2009 my only option was private student loans through sallie Mae. At the time of sign up I took on the variable interest rate which was before 11.25% and 13%. As the federal interest rate has gone up so has those interest rates. Also only one of the loans qualified for no payments until 6 months after graduation, so first month after I graduated I received a bill of 420$ for one of them. 

Now fast forward now I am not in a situation where I can live under my parents roof. They moved and I have good network for work as a freelancer in the city.

Now as they payments combined on the two loans is equal to some rent for single person apartment's I have talked to Chase/sofi/several others institutions for consideration. 

This is the tricky part, I have the income to justify the loan, a phenomenal credit score but it appears no lenders want to touch reconsolidation due to the education institution. One time in the past I had an Institution wouldn't touch the loan consolidation because I didn't make the principal of the loan equal or less to my annual income. One of the loans with the higher payment is now down to five years left of payments. 

Also they have transitioned to navient lending. I guess my over all question is should keep trying to find a lender to consolidate them or wait it out and keep paying?",finance

&gt; Growing numbers of small subprime auto lenders are closing or shutting down after loan losses and slim margins spur banks and private equity owners to cut off funding.

&gt; Summit Financial Corp., a Plantation, Florida-based subprime car finance company, filed for bankruptcy late last month after lenders including Bank of America Corp. said it had misreported losses from soured loans. And a creditor to Spring Tree Lending, an Atlanta-based subprime auto lender, filed to force the company into bankruptcy last week, after a separate group of investors accused the company of fraud. Private equity-backed Pelican Auto Finance, which specialized in “deep subprime” borrowers, finished winding down last month after seeing its profit margins shrink.

&gt; This time around, the financial system’s losses are expected to be much more manageable, because auto lending is a smaller business relative to mortgages, and Wall Street hasn’t packaged as many of the loans into complicated securities and derivatives. As of the end of September, there were about $280 billion of subprime auto loans outstanding, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, compared with around $1.3 trillion in subprime mortgage debt at the start of 2007. There isn’t a standardized definition of subprime borrowers, though it generally encompasses borrowers with FICO credit scores below 600 to 640 on an 850 point scale.

23 years old filing single. Work as independent contractor for postmates and other similar services.

total income from postmates is 10,440.
other income = 2k for a total of 12440.


Standard deduction of $6,350.

personal exemption of $4,050.

other business expenses including 50 percent of cell phone, data plan. and accessories such as protection case $660.

business miles driven = 10,000. 10,000 x .535 =  5,350.



my breakdown is as follows:

$12,440 -10,400 (standard and personal exemp.) = $2,040

$2,040 - 660 - 5,350 = -3970. 

questions

1) therefore, since my income level is too low, I shouldn't owe any state or federal income tax, correct? rather I'll only owe social security, Medicare, etc?

2) From my understanding, I can take both the standard deduction, as well as business deductions. even if these drop my net profits to negative, correct? 

3) from everything I have filled out online so far, Cedit Karma tax has estimated that my federal taxes due are $626, and my owed state taxes are $175, for a grand total of $801.

personalfinance,"Hey r/personal finance! Warning, wall of text incoming.","Hey guys! So I was on Reddit yesterday (obviously) and someone basically asked me to explain investing to him like he was 5. I thought my post could be helpful for a lot of people, so I figured I would just repost my comment as it’s own post here, so here you go! Hope this helps some people. Also, I made a few slight alterations, mostly so it doesn’t come off like I’m answering a question no one asked lol.



A brokerage account is like a checking/savings account, but for buying and selling stocks or bonds or other investment vehicles. 

A stock is a representation of ownership of a company. For example, you own 1 Apple stock, and let’s pretend there are 1 million apple shares outstanding, you own 1 one millionth of apple. If apple makes 1 million dollars of net income (income after wages, taxes, and payments to creditors), that income technically belongs to the shareholders (you, the stock owner). This is generally payed out in the form of dividends, but they don’t have to pay you the full amount, or even any if they don’t want to. That may sound bad, but generally that’s actually preferable for you because it means they are investing that money back into the company to hopefully increase future income. Also you have to pay taxes on dividends, which sucks (boo taxes).

An index is pretty simple, it’s just a collection of stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average is just 30 stocks. The S&amp;P 500 is just 500 stocks. An index is just a collection of stocks to represent the market as a whole.

Next up is a bond. A bond is pretty straight forward, it’s literally just debt, but for a corporation or government. This is where those creditors from earlier come in to play. Instead of going to a bank and taking out a loan, an entity issues bonds. They are generally $1,000, and pay a fixed interest rate, or coupon. If a bond pays a 6% coupon, they pay 6% of $1,000 every year, or 60 dollars (30 semi annually, almost all bonds pay semi annually). At the end of the bonds life (maturity) the entity pays the final coupon payment along with the original principal ($1,000). Of course, every payment they make to you is taxable (boo taxes, boo)

This is where retirement savings accounts come in, they are brokerage accounts, but you don’t have to pay taxes on your dividends and interest! Hooray! In the U.S. the most common retirement savings accounts are a 401K and an IRA. Another bonus to these accounts, is that when you contribute money to them, you get to claim that as a deduction against your income, which means less taxes!! A Roth account is the opposite, but the same concept. You put in after tax dollars, and pull out tax free. You do eventually have to pay those taxes on traditional retirement accounts, but only as ordinary income after you retire, so your income should be basically nothing at that point other than your retirement savings, so w/e. This sounds like a pretty great deal, right? That’s because it is! There is a caveat though, since it’s such a great deal, you will be severely penalized for early withdrawal from these accounts, so don’t do that.

Next up is a mutual fund. If you buy stock from just one company, and that company goes out of business, you lose all the money you invested, that’s no good, so don’t do that. You have to diversify your holdings to reduce the risk of a company failing. How do you do that if you don’t have enough money though? Most stocks are about $100 each, and if I need a lot of different companies, don’t I need a lot of money? No stupid, use a fund! A mutual fund let’s you buy a proportional interest in a basket of securities (stocks/bonds) so you can diversify with minimal investment. Sounds great right!? Well, yeah I guess, it’s better than nothing, but they charge you money for this in the form of sales charges, commissions, fees, and trimming your interest/dividends (boo fees). You will likely still make out well in the end, but there has to be something better, right?

That’s where ETF’s come in! ETF stands for exchange traded fund. They are basically a mutual fund, but they trade on an exchange like a stock. They generally don’t pay dividends (yay no taxes to pay until you sell!) and tend to have very low expense ratios (fees). You can buy an ETF for just about anything, but the most popular are the ones who’s only goal is to replicate the return of an index (index ETF). For a relatively cheap price, you get a lot of diversification, have preferential tax treatment (if they don’t pay dividends), and only have to pay minimal fee’s!! An S&amp;P 500 ETF is pretty much the gold standard for investing today. That’s not to say nothing can out perform it, but the risk vs reward is pretty hard to beat, and is generally the benchmark investors compare their performance against.  

Just like earlier with the one stock example, an entire asset class (like stocks, real estate, or bonds) can take significant downswings as a whole seemingly out of nowhere. You have to not only diversify your stock portfolio, but diversify your asset classes as well. How you should do that depends on a lot of factors and is pretty situational, so I won’t get too into that here, just know that only owning stock leaves you open to more risk (but more risk can mean more reward, so that isn’t necessarily bad!). Generally, the younger you are, the more concentrated in stocks you should be, and as you age, you should move more to fixed income (bonds and other debt securities).

There are plenty of other things to cover, and a nearly infinite number of securities you can invest in, but I’ll stop here. I hope you learned something! Feel free to downvote me and curse me out if I got anything wrong or you disagree with any minor statement I made. Cheers!",finance
personalfinance,"Completely Lost. Drowning in debt, New College Graduate, cannot find affordable rent. Need financial advice.","I have made a number of rather poor decisions, as I am sure everyone here is used to reading, but I have been trying to counter it. Here is my current situation, upcoming situation, and problems that I am having in making a decision.


I have been living on credit cards for the last year. I am a university student, putting myself through school, no family that could assist me, etc. I had a part-time job that I worked after my classes that kept my debt/credit ratio at roughly 50% (I.E. 1000/2000 dollars spent on a credit card). However, my final semester I am required to take a 35-40 hour internship...unpaid. This has caused my debt/credit ratio to go dangerously high. Despite working 40 plus hours at the internship, doing the class work, projects, assigned papers, and so forth, I managed to find a night job. The night job is bouncing for the bars around town which bring in maybe 200-400 dollars a month since I only work Thursday-Friday nights and Saturdays when they need me. I wanted to get a job as a night auditor with a hotel but my hours/Days fluctuate so unexpectedly (Law Enforcement Internship) that the bouncing job was the only one that ""worked"" with my schedules (IE ""Hey boss I am working 2nd shift Friday night this week and they are okay with it because they're all ex LEO or Military).


I stupidly purchased (financed) a car because the truck that I had been fixing for a while finally gave way to a head gasket leak, failed catalytic converter, and the mechanics wanted to charge me an arm and a leg because of all the JB weld, Zip ties, etc. (My ex-girlfriend's dad in high school took me under his wing and taught me how to fix my truck and work on cars in general. Even showed me how to ""jerry"" rig things to make it work). 


To make matters worse, I have had three people hit my car in my parking lot and it got damaged by the flood back in November here. Rentals, repairs, calling insurance, waiting, maintenance, etcetera set me back around $4,000. Also, now my cars value is squat (Example the last person that hit my car sideswiped it and it was a little over 3500 repair quote to fix it). 


Before all the financial details, I have been applying for jobs and finally accepted a job at a firm in Charlotte NC. I start May 1st, $40,000 Salary, Health Insurance, dental, and eye Premiums Paid fully, 25 copays, its great! Downside is I live two hours away from Charlotte in Boone North Carolina. Approximately a 100-mile drive there and back and my car gets about 22 mpg combined because of mountain and city driving. Test calculations show about 125-150 a week in gas with approximately 1000 miles out on the car each week. I recently had to buy new rotors and brakes, got a quote from the dealership for 1025 and a local store for 850, so I bought the parts, tools, and everything needed for $389 plus Ill need an alignment for another 90 so about half the cost of what I was quoted and I can sell the tools afterwards (installing next Sunday when its warmer and I don't have work).

Insurance:
Minimum payment $105.60 (No at fault accidents in over 5 years, raised my rate from 87 a month due to people hitting my car and the flood damage)

Phone:
$70 a month with insurance on phone, 55 if I take it off.

Rent:
$650, Shared apartment, utilities put us at around $750 per person. Lease ends on July 31.

Food:
Around 150-220 a month. Depends on if I am sick because I don't really eat that much when I am sick.



Recent Expenses:

Medical Bills: 
Out of Pocket around $370 for copays and for medicine. (paid 1250 in December for another Semester of Health Care under BCBS) Had to see a doctor multiple times over the past few months. I have been getting sick a lot. Doctor told me I am sleep deprived and she got on to me about my weight gains since last year.

Car parts, maintenance, repairs, related expenses:
Approximately $4000 in total with maintenance, repairs, and the insurance-related stuff like rental insurance and what not. (I get the extra rental insurance because my cars been dinged approximately 24 times in the parking lot and the rental place said it would go on my insurance if I didn't get the extra coverage. 

Traveling for interviews:
Approximately 300 in gas. I packed bologna sandwiches for food.



Good news:
I have been selling my things to helps build up my checking account. I am only keeping what I absolutely need, Laptop, Cellphone, Mattress, Clothes and an Ironing board. So far I have sold my desktop, tv, furniture, stereo, and an old iPad and made $715!
Checking account is at $1400 right now. All bills are paid and current. I have never missed a payment, called for credit extensions, decreases, etc. (I also have other things listed for sale so hopefully people buy those things too.)

I killed off my 7500 BoA credit card in January, canceled it and that was the end of it. Little did I know that would take a hit on my credit score. 

Landed a rather high paying job for my major! Criminal Justice Major, jobs in Boone are around 34-38k starting for law enforcement, I was going down that route but I am severely colorblind and was disqualified. I was told my colorblindness wasn't an issue when i started my major so I started getting nervous in January February when the department told me the news. Started applying to anywhere and everywhere that I thought I could make my resume work. Ended up with a nice starting pay!

The Chief of the department that I work with knows my personal story and my credit history (they do full background and credit checks before the application) He said that he would cosign on a property for me if need be! (Approximate salary is 109k)



Bad News:
Sick again this week so the security group sent me home because I can't really bounce if I cant talk (Severe laryngitis and upper respiratory infection).

Rent in the Charlotte area is 950-1500 in the area where I can walk to work (It is located in Uptown Charlotte).
I looked into room shares, they are around 500-700 dollars and if they are farther away I will need to park somewhere or ride the Light Rail.

Parking Passes near work are $198 a month.

Light Rail $88 dollar a month pass.

Gas to drive from Boone to Work about 125-150 a week, plus 1000 plus miles a week on the vehicle (wear and tear), and I would need a parking pass of some kind.

I am still fairly new to utilities and I am not sure on the cost of utilities in Charlotte, the Cost to get water and electricity hooked up and so forth.

Help:
I have been stressing about this for a while. I haven't gone out with any friends since November, my roommates leave me alone and keep quiet because they know I am either at work or bouncing and I am exhausted, and on top of that I am lost. It is my fault for putting myself in this much debt. I should have financed a cheaper car, at the time I ran the numbers and I could afford it, I should have found a cheaper place to rent in Boone, at the time I figured it was in walking distance to campus so I wouldn't have to drive my truck and I signed the lease, I should have never, ever, ever, gotten a credit card. I hate myself for it and I have been actively trying to kill them off, however, it just seems like nothing I am doing helps. I pay over the minimum and the interest takes away half of what I paid, an example being Barclay Card, Paid 300 and got hit with a 98 dollar interest amount. I know it is my fault, I can think of a million excuses from A-Z, but it is my fault. Before I graduate I had to do exit counseling for my loans, and the number that was given to me for my salary was horrific. Even with my salary, because of my debts, I would need to find a cheapish place outside the city and commute or cheap in the city and walk to make ends meet (IE pay rent, go to work, eat food, repeat). I canceled my Spotify subscription, Netflix, and I quit eating out in January. I need guidance on what to do, I know I am a 22 year old guy and I should have my head screwed on right but I do not know what to do. I don't care if it takes 4 years I want to get out of this debt, go to work in Charlotte, and live a better, healthier, happier life. Please help me Reddit, be the scolding parent I needed when I was 18 and got a credit card. I chose the IBR plan because I want to pay off my loans sooner rather than later, but if anyone knows of a better plan such as graduated please let me know.



Link to picture of projected expense calculations I did: https://imgur.com/a/PdaHX


TLDR:
High debt, cards near max, high interest, took a high paying job in a neighboring city 100 miles away, rental options in the city are high, travel costs high, etc. 

Still locked into a lease 100 miles from new job, 1400 dollars to name, lots of expenses, need guidance on how to ""survive"" and get out of this mess. Already selling everything but the neccessities, and cutting expenses where I can. 


UPDATE: 

Found a great room share for 500-600 depending on utilities that’s a short bus ride to my work. Max costs with bus pass are going to be 550-650 a month. Won’t be driving the car, all utilities included and I’m still trying to sublease apartment in Boone.",finance

personalfinance,Spending another $6K JUST for a minor worth it? (USA),"Hey there! I've been attending college on and off mostly part time since 2012 (yaaaay depression and anxiety!) but I see the light at the end of the tunnel! I'm graduating with a Communications degree in December BUT I'm worried it's a bit too broad of a degree. 

I was originally planning on a Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies Minor and now have been looking into a Globalization Studies Minor (as I want to travel and work abroad when I'm done) but due to time constraints and lack of class availability in the summer its looking like I can't finish either by December.  

I've been considering taking some classes in the winter and spring so I CAN get a (or maybe both) minor(s) but whenever I mention this to my mom she says she thinks I'm wasting my money....that nobody really cares about minors....and I have no idea if she's right or not. I don't have a specific career path in mind but I figured a Womens/Sexuality minor could help me in any HR position and Globalization would help when I moved abroad. 

I'm already about $38K in debt (with interest rates ranging from 3%-11%....fuck you Sallie Mae) but since I'm living at home while I'm in school and have a pretty decent job I'm paying at MINIMUM $1,000 a month on them.   

What do you think? Is it worth an extra $5,000-$8,000 to get a minor? 

TL;DR- Should I spend an extra semester just to get a minor? Or graduate already?",finance

personalfinance,Remodeling with construction loan and want to live in a trailer instead of pay rent- finance or exhaust cash?,"We are embarking on an extensive remodel of our house that requires a construction loan. We want to live in a trailer on the property during the remodel because renting seems like a waste of money, but we don’t own a trailer. Originally, we planned to put it on our HELOC and pay our mortgage payments on the HELOC that would more than cover the cost of the trailer, then sell the trailer, but we realized the HELOC is closed at the first closing when construction begins, not when construction ends and the new mortgage is created. Our mortgage payments are deferred during construction. 

Question is- do I finance the trailer or use my cash reserve? I have enough cash to buy the trailer, but it means I’d have minimal cash on hand if something comes up early in the project until we replenish the fund. Other option is to finance the trailer and pay it off within 6 months- before the construction ends. We have very good credit, but not sure if financing a trailer is enough to drive our credit score down enough to ultimately change the interest rate on my final mortgage.",finance

personalfinance,"Finance and I want to plan/manage our finances together. Best options for a ""joint"" account?","Hey,

So we recently became engaged and want to figure out the best way to reach our first goal which is owning a house. Using a few calculators we figured out a price to aim for is somewhere around 300k-350k based on our joint income (125k, but hopefully hits 150k when she gets a job in her field, ~1yr away). 

Our breakdown:

I have 0 loans/debts aside from 8k on a credit card w/ 0% APR whose offer expires in some 8-10mos. Asset wise: around 20k in liquid assets. 30k in an investment account + IRA, and 30k in my 401k. She has around a 1k balance on CCs, but has a fairly large/medium loan of 60k. I plan on helping her tackle this loan, and we're aiming at around 1.5k/mo payments at the highest interest rate accounts and working our way down. Her savings are also around 10k liquid, but with no retirement funds. (23F/25M btw)

Our normal monthly expenses combined is around 1.1k. This includes our bills/food/gas/insurance/entertainment/etc. I don't pay rent but I pay for the household utilities and groceries, while she does the same. This is NOT including the above loan payments.

So the point of this was to keep track of our spendings/Savings. We want to have an overall location where we can see our cash and spendings and act accordingly. We were looking into opening a joint checking account, but I hear that there are quite a few apps/services now to allow couples to track spending better. is there anything you guys suggest for helping us with this? Ultimately our goal is to purchase a house in the next year or two, right as soon as we get married.

Thanks!",finance

I could also attend the local CUNY schools which would be nearly free but isn't ideal for my field of study and doesn't have as big an alumni network (and prestige lol) to look for opportunities from.

RBI, while announcing its first bi-monthly monetary policy for the FY 2018-19, has announced that any entity regulated by them such as banks, wallets etc. shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities for buying or selling of cryptocurrency such as bitcoins. If banks, e-wallets and any other entities regulated by RBI are not allowed to facilitate sale or purchase of cryptocurrencies, obviously individuals will not be able to transfer money from their bank accounts to their crypto-trading wallets. 

""A person will not be able to transfer money from his savings account to his crypto wallet,"" says, Abizer Diwanji, Head, Financial Services, EY India. 

The central bank has repeatedly cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, regarding various risks associated with dealing with such virtual currencies. 

In its statement, RBI said that technological innovations, including those underlying virtual currencies, have the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system. However, Virtual Currencies (VCs), also variously referred to as cryptocurrencies and crypto assets, raise concerns of consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering, among others. 

In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by RBI shall not deal with or provide services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling VCs. Regulated entities which already provide such services shall exit the relationship within a specified time. RBI will be issuing circular in this regard for further details. 

Recently, several banks have banned their customers for buying and selling of cryptocurrencies. Citi Bank in an email to its customers has said that credit and debit cards cannot be used to purchase cryptocurrencies. It has been reported that RBI has warned banks about cryptocurrencies in January, telling them to step up scrutiny of financial transactions by companies and exchanges involved in the trade of bitcoins and similar digital tender. 

RBI has also issued a press release earlier in this regard stating ""As such, any user, holder, investor, trader, etc. dealing with virtual currencies will be doing so at their own risk.""",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,[Repost] My grandfather is offering me a $10k practically interest-free loan. Would I benefit or suffer given my current situation?,"**TL;DR** - This loan isn't something I necessarily need.  
My question(s) is basically: Will the advantage of this loan, if any, provide any considerable benefits I am not seeing? Or will the benefits be negligible and I should just buckle down harder?

### Quick Background ###


**Myself** 

25(M) IT professional (2 years full-time experience, IT for 5). Pretty poor growing up, single mother raising the hellion myself and sister were. First in family to go to college.  
I try my best to make financially responsible decisions and to live humbly within my means.  
I nearly fainted when I got my first paycheck as an intern in college.

I spent my college years being extremely cheap (read: cheap, not frugal). It was, and still is, hard to shake certain behaviours and perspectives when I was poor for so long. I suffered quite literally mentally and physically at the result of my penny pinching. 

I've since adapted a much more balanced lifestyle. But indeed it still remains difficult to tote the line between enjoying this ride of life knowing I could not wake up tomorrow morning versus long-term retirment planning knowing I'll likely live for another 60-70 years.

**The $10,000:** My grandfather has been retired for several years now. He owned and operated several photography/camera stores for close to 40 years. Has some residential properties, etc, etc.  
He's offered, or rather I've asked and he accepted, to loan me a bit of money in an attempt to help me get ahead. 


I've come up with what follows, but I'm not sure if it's the wisest approach.

By ""practically interest free"", I mean 2.3%. The rough terms I will drew up:

* Initial Loan: $10,000  
* Monthly Payment: $700 ($345 direct-deposited every two weeks)  
* Repayment Period + Interest: 14 months = $10,230.  

***

### Current Holdings/Income ###

##### Full-time job #####


* $70,000 pre-tax. I've been working in IT full-time for 2 years.  
* My take home pay is pretty close to $3,600/month ($1,800 every two weeks).

##### 401k ##### 


* $17,000 contributing 3%. Employer matches 100% of first 3%, 50% of the next 2%.  
* I have only recently reduced my contribution amount. It was at 5% for basically 2 years, but I figured that extra 2% wasn't worth it and could enjoy the extra income, albeit tiny amount.

##### Betterment #####

* $885. 90% stock/10% bond. 
* I know I should be contributing more, but right now this basically serves as my emergency fund.

##### Teaching ##### 

* $500/month.
* I've been teaching part-time since August '17. I'll receive $1,000 before June. I don't teach during the summer, so these payments will stop until August. I basically treat this money as a discretionary fund.

***

### Current Expenses ###

I live in the Midwest in a 1 bedroom apartment I love. Great neighboorhood, tons of resturants, bars, night-life, etc within walking distance. 
	
##### Rent #####


* $825/month. There is a massive amount of renovation/construction underway in my neighborhood and the adjacent city. I'd guess once it's complete, the area will be in much higher demand, possibly increasing my rent?

##### Electric/Heat #####


* ~$130 average. Accidentally spent two winter months on ""EM Heat"". Had no clue what that was until I did my own research :x

##### Car Payment #####

* $400/month. 
* I bought a new 2017 Mazda 6 after driving my first car ('99 Cavalier) for 9 years. I plan to on getting +2x years on this. Totally happy (though perhaps not the most frugal) with my decision. I'm not a car guy so I won't want to switch/upgrade likely ever.  It's just a car to me.

    * Full loan = $25,700 @ 5.99%. 
    * Remaining = $23,000
    * Insurance = $80/month ($470 6-month premium)

* ^ This is where I think I should be primarily attacking if I take the loan ^


##### Student Loans #####

* $16,800.
* I attacked these extremely hard from '16-'17. Down from $36,000. This means I don't ""need"" to make a payment until 2/2021.

Type | Amount | Rate
---------|----------|----------
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $4,650 | 3.860% fixed
Federal Perkins | $3,900 | 5.000%
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $3,500 | 3.400% fixed
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $3,500 | 3.400% fixed
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $2,800 | 4.290% fixed
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $2,200 | 3.860% fixed


##### Life Things #####

* $380 
    * Groceries = ~$100/month. I generally try to stick to this per month. Rough estimate.
    * Internet/Netflix = $60/month
    * Cell phone = ~$60/month. Two lines through Ting. 
    * Nightlife = ~$60/month. Usually go out one night a weekend. Again a rough estimate.
    * Eating out = ~$50/month. I don't eat out much, but when I'm suffering on my couch Saturday morning, having Chinese delivered is a miracle. 
    * Error = $50. Accounting for a likely error/omission

** Estimated Total Monthly Expenses = $1,850 **

### My Ideal Breakdown ###

1. My ""plan"" is to take around $4k of the 10, and dump it towards my car loan. This would stave off my $400 monthly payments for 10 months. But then again, I'm essentially just doubling and replacing this with my repayments towards the $10k loan, right? 

2. I could takes an additional $2,000 to bolster my emergency fund. 

3. The remaining to attack that Perkins Loan @ 5.00%?

### My Reservations ###

Even after typing all this out, I'm not sure if there is any inherent long-term benefit (apart from the avoided interest payments?) from gaining $10k now.  
    
1. Am I seeing things clearly? Perhaps I'm just being blinded by the overall lump sum of $10,000.

2. I'm assuming I'd have to pay taxes on the $10k? 

3. What does /r/personalfinance think?

personalfinance,TSP for Down Payment (even though everyone says not to)?,"Hello! First time poster on this sub, hoping you guys can help me get my head on straight. My goals are: a) buy a house and b) keep my taxable income as low as possible because of school loans.

Everyone says not to take a loan against the Thrift Savings Plan because you're missing out on growth during the time you have the loan. But what about putting in the extra with the intent of using it as the downpayment - instead of putting it in a regular account? And what about sacrificing some of that growth for lower school loan payments?


My current circumstances are:

-30 years old, single, make $96k a year, excellent-range credit.

-Paid off all private school loans last year, still have federal, but the money that was going to the private loans is now going into a Money Market savings.

-Paying off school loans via the PSLF program, so 10% of *taxable* income goes to school loans for the next 6.5 years.

-Currently saving for a house with about $1k a month in the Money Market (0.65%, $13k so far), but live in a very pricy region so it'd take 4 more years to come up with 20% down.

-Contributing 10% a month to TSP (Traditional; Mostly in L2050), plus 4.1% a month to FERS.

-Currently have $32k in TSP.

-Credit union allows $0 down without PMI for an extra 1% interest/1.3%APR.

-Lots of family support emotionally, none financially.

My thinking is I can double my TSP contributions to the max allowed, which is $18.5k a year, stop adding to the Money Market and keep it as my emergency fund, and then I could borrow against the TSP for either the downpayment (in which case I'd likely need to borrow beyond what I put in specifically for this purpose) or for the closing costs (which would be covered by the extra income if I couldn't roll them into the mortgage).

Am I missing something? People are pretty definitive about not borrowing against the TSP, but it's looking like it would save me taxes and loan payments if I used the TSP loan to help buy a house... I read something about double taxation, but how would that even apply with a traditional TSP?

personalfinance,"74K in student loans and kinda, sorta freaking out.","Ok, so here's my situation as it stand right now.  I currently owe the IRS 4K- I'm making payments on that,100/mo.  I also owe 73.5K in student loans.  All federal loans and interests rates ranging from 3% to 6.8%.  I make about 63K a year.  I have child support for 800/mo.  I moved into a family member's house and pay no rent.  Just food, I clean the house and help out with whatever is needed.  I gave my car to my ex who will be taking over the car payments.. his name is also on the loan.  So starting May 2018, I will have no car payments. 

Edit:  I am on a income based repayment plan for my SL with Nelnet.  It is $237.56/mo. I just choose to pay 400/mo.  

I only have 1K emergency fund.
 
My net pay is about 2400/mo. Here's the break down.
  
401K contribution is 3%

Roth IRA  2% 

Monthly income: 24K

Weekly income: 600$ usually it's a bit more but im rounding down

Child Support:   800$

Total Bills:   1813~ 2163 *once May gets here due to increased IRS payment 

I'm doing the best I can, I've been listening to Dave Ramsey's podcasts and following his debt snowball method. Hence, I'm getting rid of the IRS debt first then going ""gazelle intense"" on the SL.  My parents helped me pay off $5200.00 in credit card debt, so thankful for that.  They have been so helpful.  But I'm on my own for the rest of course.  I don't have a cellphone bill right now because I'm on a family members plan and it's cheap so they just pay it.  As you can see in the #'s mentioned above... I run a very tight budget.  I bring home about 2500/mo respectively but its give or take.  I could take overtime at work, but I'm so scared I'll have to owe the IRS again.  Right now I am paying the student loan 400/mo and focusing all my energy to get rid of the 4K IRS debt which should be done by sept/oct. Once that is done, I can snowball that into my student loan payment.  That new SL payment will be 1K a month or more, whatever I get I will throw at it.. (gifts, bonuses, tax returns if ever, etc...) My kids are 16 and 14.  Once I'm done with child support, I can throw even more at the SL debt... I will always help out my kids no matter what of course.  I'm not leaving them high and dry once they turn 18.  I will just have some money freed up by then.  What do you guys think? should I do something different?  I am mentally and emotionally traumatized by this.  I have my Bachelor's in Business Mgmt with a concentration in HR.   My current job is great, I'm happy... I can move up and grow.  The benefits are great for me and my kids so I don't want to leave.  I'm vested and want to make it my career. But I'm just struggling with staying positive, some days are great others are so bad i can't sleep.  I worry about my future, I even feel bad for when people take me out to dinner etc., they pay because they know my situation and I'm not ashamed to admit it.  I made a lot of mistakes when I was younger, I wanted to show my kids that going to college was the right way to go.  My parents never really showed me how to budget and the importance of understanding student loans.  I'm not blaming them, I just didn't have the knowlege back then.  Mix that in with my young and free 20-33yr old self and you've got what I mentioned above.  I am 34 yrs old now about to turn 35 and only now am beginning to fix this mess.

personalfinance,Maybe a financial advisor would be a wise next step?,"Okay, I hope what I write below doesn't sound like I'm in any way bragging. I am a 38/m, single young professional living in central Mass. While some parts of my life leave a lot to be desired (friendships, relationships, lack of hobbies) I have been quite fortunate in the career and financial department. I guess you could even say that I was lucky to have discovered what I wanted to do young, skipped college, and found myself earning six figures by ~26. Pure luck I guess, I had no foresight that this would all work out, just a drive to learn and succeed. Anyways, I owe ~150k on a property valued at 360k with 2.875% interest rate; I have 9 years left on my 15 year mortgage. I have ~130k in one 401k, and 22k in another. I live fairly frugally, my only vice being I like to be eat out, but I don't go for pricey vacations or buy a Porsche. I make ~140k, but due to a couple recent windfalls of cash - I have found myself with ~120k in savings / CDs.  I realized I'm kind of being an idiot for hoarding all this cash, though, in fairness, 70k of it came into my possession in the last 15 months. A financial advisor was recommended by a couple peers of mine that I trust, so I figured paying a professional might be my best option for now. I was going to keep 30k for an emergency fund and slowly start xfering money into a managed account. Again, I am not bragging in any way, I just got lucky working in a high paying industry, but I have also come to realize that I need to get out young before I have a stroke! It is not uncommon for me to have to work nights and weekends during an emergency. I cannot count the number of times I've been called at 2am by a frantic colleague seeking my help. And, I don't get paid for these interruptions and the candle truly burns at both ends. It was okay in my 20s and early 30s, but, I have found that it's taking a tremendous toll on my physical and emotional health. So, I guess what I'm asking is if perhaps I have enough foundation to build from, and, hopefully, get out young?!? All I really want is to eek out 9 years on my mortgage and then hopefully consult full time. I want to be able to pickup contracts as I want, sometimes take a couple months off as necessary, enjoy my life, and most importantly not be on-call 24/7! I love what I do, in fact, I like to work, but I also want financial independence so I can learn what I want, work when I want, and not put up with the office politics and backstabbers as much.

personalfinance,Filing separate for WV State taxes?,"Hello PF,

I got married last year, so this was the first time I did my taxes as a married person. I always heard how being married can help come taxes time. So I filed married jointly on turbo tax and went through the process. We ended up owing almost $1,000 to the state of WV which I paid back in the beginning of March.

Yesterday I was talking to a friend that was doing their taxes and they were talking about how much of refund they were getting.
So I started looking into mine this morning. For background info,

I was taxed on $66,502 and paid $3,065 in WV state tax. My wife was taxed on $54,179 and paid $2,306.

When I go to this website that calculate wv tax https://smartasset.com/taxes/west-virginia-tax-calculator

If I put in single and just do my self (my income and single) and then my wife by her self (her income and single), we paid about what we should of paid in WV tax. If I combine our income and change it to married we do own about $1000 more then we paid. 

First why is that? and second could I have filed WV taxes for both of us as separate but kept federal as joint and not had to pay this extra $1000.

If I could, what is the best way to fix this now that I already filed my taxes?

Thanks for everyone's help. I wish and should of looked into this before I filed back in March but didn't think much of it when using turbo tax.

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,Help me fix this :),"Just four months ago, we were 33k in credit card debt, so there has been some improvement. I started with really high interest rates and am working from there, but now it's all about the same and I'm not sure where to go.  Also, maybe our budgets need work too, but more about that in the main post.  Both 28, married for 10 years, and have two kids (7 and 3).

**The good:**

No housing costs (base housing for the military). All utilities are included: water, sewage, garbage, and electricity up to a baseline. We typically get a check of about $75 every quarter for being under the base.


No medical costs. All healthcare is covered for the entire family.


No daycare costs. I work from home, self employed, and the littlest one stays home with me until she starts preschool in the fall.


He puts 5% in TSP now (down from 10%) in order to get the new matching, so a total of 10% is put in monthly. The balance is just over 18k at the moment. His job is secure, active duty military with 7 years in and another 4 on his current enlistment. This is the only retirement savings.


Insurance I pay at once, the entire six months, because it's expensive. My husband had two accidents and a totaled car in the past 3 years so it's a bit high. $180/month for two cars and renters insurance. It's been my debt paying plan to lower monthly obligations as much as possible so we can live entirely on his income, so that mine isn't ""necessary.""


We do have a small emergency fund of $5000, but prefer to leave it there.


**Bills:**

Car payment one: $222


Car payment two: $300


Tmobile cell phones: $172


Self employed taxes/QB: $17


Netflix: $11


Kindle unlimited: $10


Amazon music: $8


Amazon freetime: $7


Cable/internet: $118


Kid activities: $132 (dance, ballet, karate, swim)



**Budgeted stuff:**


I try to stick to $50 a week for groceries.


Each adult gets $20 a week for personal spending (I forgot my lunch, I'm running errands and want to pick up a soda, etc).


$40 a week for kid activities (picnic here, fast food there, ice cream at the zoo, etc). We let each kid pick one activity on the weekend, but they're limited to discount days or places we have memberships etc.


I do all of this in cash, and just take out $540 a month.


**Debt stuff:**


Timeshare mortgage: $94 minimum, 17.9% - balance? (4491 original, 17.9% interest for 7 years, 94.13 monthly, paid 6 months so far, so in my head I'm thinking 5000. It's been hard to get a hold of them and get the payoff amount).


Credit card one: $226 minimum, 15.15% interest, $9720 balance


Credit card two: $86 minimum, 11.90% interest, $3358 balance


Credit card three: $72 minimum, 11.49% interest, $3957 balance


Credit card four: $58 minimum, 11.24% interest, $2992 balance


Car loan: $300 minimum, 3.89% interest, $10951 balance


**That brings total monthly obligations at $1533 + $540 = 2073**


**Income**


His take home pay after retirement, taxes, dental premiums etc. is $2370 a month.


Mine is variable, but I shoot for $100 per day. I'm self employed so I have to pay quarterly taxes. For quarter one, January 1-March 31, I made 10289 and after deductions I owe $1609 in tax.


I also get sent amazon gift cards sometimes, but don't count those in my income.  They serve as a budget for ""things"" for our house, like new dog leashes or dog food, paper towels, toys for the kids, or even new kitchen gear. Basically if it can be bought on amazon, besides groceries, that is our limit for it and the only place we spend there. (this is why it's not in our budget). 



**What I need:**


Advice on which debts to pay first or where I need to beef things up. Basically, my entire income is sent to a separate account from the bills/groceries/whatever account. His income is for bills and budgets (with about $200 wiggle room for an occasional unexpected charge).


I see it as having about 2000 a month to pay towards debt out of my income (I set aside 1/3 of my income for taxes, but as it turns out that may be too high). 


**My thoughts**


Most of this debt is in his name, and is at least 7-8 years old. He's never missed a payment, but paying bare minimums gets him nowhere.  They also waive all payments every time he deploys etc. but interest still accrues. He's not a numbers person, so he finally gave it all to me to look at and deal with as of December and in that time, between tax refund and my income, I've paid off about 12k.  The issues there are more of a relationship issue, not a personal finance one, but are being handled. It was mostly him ashamed to admit he messed up all those years ago.


I should pay off this timeshare and then he can either surrender it or we can use it. We do travel, a lot, but I'm not sure the timeshare is the best plan.


Next I should just go down the debts by level of interest rate? I've been doing the snowball method, to pay off all of his little ones ($300 there, $900 here) to free up those monthly payments and redirect them, but now that the interest rates are all semi close (except the timeshare) should I switch?


Do I need more in an emergency fund? With him having such a stable job, and housing and medical costs not ever being an issue, I'm not sure we really need more there. We've never once had to touch it.


Should we put more into retirement now? He plans to do his 20 years and retire so that he gets a pension for life (and we get healthcare for life) so that makes me think we can get away with this for the current year.


At this rate, we should be able to pay it off hopefully by end of year.  Last year I made 36k and I took 3 whole months off, so I'm planning to work the whole year through this time and see how that goes.",finance

While applying for disability, in the interim 2 years, I used credit cards to make ends meet. I have roughly $27,000 in debt on various cards. My two largest debts have interest rates of 17.99% and 15.24%.

My Fico score is 620. I bring home $6300 after tax each month. My student loans total $30,000 qualify for full discharge and have been placed on a hold until the application is totally processed. 

 My house payments are $2200 after utilities and insurance. My only other bills are a family phone/internet bill of $200, a $50 gym membership, and $200 I pay to send all four children to gymnastics.

**About my situation**

I do not have 20%, please do not crucify me. Or, I have 20% but only for a very rundown place in a not safe area. I am a younger female that often works early/late and do not wish to purchase a home where I cannot feel safe getting into/out of my car.

**Answer to common questions: I have 26k saved so far, I am looking at places ranging from 160k-190k, my area has a pretty low cost of living.** My car/medical insurance is paid through the year, my current monthly expenses are for my phone, ($20), internet ($44), rent ($420), and food (approximately $150). I have two pets who have emergency vet funds, but their cost/s per month equate to about $50.

**In addition, I have a sibling who I have rented with for the past four years without issue who will be paying me rent to help alleviate the costs. Should the sibling move out/be unable to pay I have a long term (5+yrs) partner who can and will then move in.** 

I have done the NYT's Better to Rent or Buy calculator and it has said buying is better.

I have considered the costs of PMI, home owner insurance, emergency funds, etc and feel personally that buying is better.

I have no debts at this time. I earn 50-60k a year depending on OT and have a job with good job security.

**USDA Home Loan**

Positives:

* Potential for no down payment

* Mortgage insurance: 1% fee upfront, 0.35% fee for entirety of mortgage **Is this correct?**

Negatives:

* Stricter income limits
* Strict location rules
* Stricter eligibility rules all around

**FHA Home Loan**

Positives:

* 3.5% Down Payment
* Very accessible for most buyers
 Negatives:

* Insurance paid for entirety of loan, unable to be canceled **I don't 100% understand the MIP for FHA loans, can anybody explain?**

**Conventional mortgage+PMI**

Interest rates and PMI depend on credit score, income, amount down, lending history...

**HomeReady**

I just learned of this today, so I might need some more fact checking.

gaming,Tomb Raider (2013 Reboot): Is it really more realistic than the old series? [Discussion],"So, let me preface this post by saying I really do enjoy the rebooted Tomb Raider (I haven't played ""Rise..."" yet). It has a better movement / camera system by far, and of course the graphics are excellent. 

The combat and enemy types / waves also makes me feel like I am playing Resident Evil 5, but with climbing, but I can't count that against it since I'm a big RE fan. 

But one of the main intrigues of rebooting Lara and her adventures was to make it more grounded and realistic, specifically in regards to Lara's design, especially since supposedly the new and woke breed of gamer would reflexively sneer at the old Lara's mode of dress while she spelunked hither and yon. 

So, our new Lara has a more modest tank top, full pants and boots. She's still attractive and fit, and her breasts are not small by any means, but certainly more proportional to her body -- after all, the game design is aiming at photo realism, not quasi-animation like the old series. 

But as you get into perilous situations, you soon realize that Lara has a Wolverine-like ability to recover from some of the most grueling punishment. I mean, I knew British people had grit but our new Lara has adamantium ankles judging by how far she can jump and fall without breaking bones. And here's an off detail: Her hair and pieces of her clothing &amp; equipment are physics objects and move accordingly, but her breasts are 100% stationary. One of the perks of youth I suppose? Honestly, I think they just didn't want any of Dead or Alive's jiggle physics to detract from their new sensuality-free Lara, but when everything else in the game is going for realism, those immobile mammaries are just a bit counter-immersive. 

But I won't harp on that anymore -- I know female aesthetics in video games really gets people's feathers puffed out on both sides of the discussion. So what about the gameplay and the missions? Lara is not given a backstory that suggests she is an accomplished combatant, so the fact that she learns to kill and become horrifically effective in short order does not seem realistic. I know that's a belabored point about this game, but I recently played through it again and It still stands out as peculiar. Aside from quickly turning into a Terminator-esque killing machine, she is also somehow able to upgrade her rudimentary weapons through MacGuyver-like means in increasingly more effective and ingenious ways. Can you really tape two rifle magazines together and have the ammunition still cycle effectively? I don't know, but by God (and Queen) Lara makes it work. 

We also have the dreaded quick-time events that people either tolerate or hate, and some events are simply scripted but give you some semblance of control even though you have little time to react. Fair enough, but these crazy moments that have you hanging for dear life and leaping and jumping as buildings fall off mountain sides are almost all contingent upon you being in exactly the right place at the right time. It's an impossible series of lucky coincidences, and they happen frequently throughout the game. If you think about them in the context of physics and probability, they are possibly the most wildly unrealistic element of the entire game. 

That leaves us with the puzzles. All of them rely on Rube Goldbergian arrangements that make no sense at all from a practical standpoint. They only exist to provide a fun puzzle for the player -- perfectly fine, really, but as the Tomb Raider games become more life-like in appearance, these game mechanics become increasingly more immersion-breaking, simply because there is no reason for them to be there in the context of the story and setting. I can't be too harsh on TR for this, because this is a broad issue of many modern games whose graphics strive for realism. 

Now, I won't even get into the supernatural part of the story. That's low hanging fruit. But I just wanted to point out that even though we never see Lara's belly-button, and she is never in a bikini for an ocean-diving segment, the new Tomb Reboot is hardly anymore realistic or grounded than the old series. It simply has more advanced graphics and violent gameplay. 

Thoughts, rebuttals, indifference, anyone?

Edit: i forgot to mention that Lara seems to need food in the beginning to keep from starving, but you never need to hunt again. She also appears to be extremely cold and shivering in the rain, but later she is moving about in snow-topped mountain ranges without ever stripping an enemy of a jacket (this is before you get unlockable clothes). She also seems not to have nipples even when she is soaking wet and frigid, but there I go again with the aesthetics...",technology

personalfinance,(27/US) Started getting credit score under control... no idea what to do from here. Will need a new car soon. Help?,"Experian - 687 / TransUnion - 668 / Equifax - 664 (All scores are FICO)

3 inquiries under Experian and Equifax, 4 under TransUnion

Credit limit is ~3K, 2 CC's opened. One being a (still) Secured Capital One card opened five months ago. The other one I just opened last month.

Total debt is 800 (paying 50 bucks a month) + whatever I put on my credit card (utilization is ALWAYS kept under 9%). Around 4K in the bank ATM, nothing in savings.

I make right around 500 a week after taxes, with a little over 600 being possible some weeks, depending on overtime. So anywhere from 2000-2400 a month.

My current CoL is right around 1200 a month. (Includes rent + bills + insurance, food, all that jazz)

Can provide any more information if needed.

So a little over a year ago, I decided I needed to get my life together. I sat in a depressive slump and let life pass me by. Through loan rehabilitation, getting the Capital One secured credit card and cleaning off most of the derogatory marks on my credit report, I went from ~500 credit score to what I have now, mostly thanks to all the information and posts in this sub. And it felt/feels really fucking good.

But now my car is about to go out the door. It was a beater I got last summer, and I don't see it past the summer time, which I was hoping it would. I do plan on driving it until it breaks down. I don't really want to buy a beater car again (unless that would be my best course of action) so I was thinking of buying a pre-owned car from a dealership. Ideally I'd like to put 5K down, and take out a loan for no more than 10k through my bank (Chase). Can't do it through my credit union because I need to have two years of credit history and two years of job history, neither of which I have. (Have had steady employment my last nine years, but I was told job history means being in the same field for the last two years, which I do not have)

I do not know what to do. I have no one to turn to for advice, and am all on my own. I want to be able to go back to school in the fall for IT (just picked up the CompTIA A+ certification book) but I fear that I won't be able to make ends meet by taking classes while working. As of writing this I do not qualify for financial aid, I had it years ago and blew my opportunity with it. I believe I have to write a letter to someone/some board asking to have it reinstated? Not sure but all I'd have to do is go down to the local college and find out for sure.

Criteria for a car: Would like to keep it around 15K if that sounds good (5K down + a 10K loan, no idea where my interest rate would be at). No more than a few years old. Was thinking a Civic or an Accord. I live in the midwest so roads are pretty bad here + winter, but doubt i'd be able to find anything AWD for that price.

Sorry my post is all over the place, I have a lot on my mind and no where to really turn to for advice so I am kind of stressed out. Can provide any more information if need be.

Thanks guys.",finance
personalfinance,Options for paying for truck repairs,"So I've recently come into some pretty expensive repair costs needed for my truck.  I'm looking at my options on how to pay for this, obviously with the fall-back plan of swiping my credit card.  Here's some necessary information:

In 2016, I sold my previous car to purchase a truck, pay off some debt, and lower my overall payments / debt.  My truck is a 2007 Chevy 1500 with 70k miles on it that I got for 18k TTL.  I put 8,000 cash down and financed 10,000.  I currently owe approximately 8,000 on the truck, and it's worth is approximately 13.5 - 15.5k.

The truck needs the rear differential replaced.  This cost is about $2850.  Further, it will need the front shocks replaced, which I have estimated to be approximately $750 to $1,000.  

In 2017, I quit my job, my wife quit her job, and we decided to fast-track our educations to graduate this May.  We are both military veterans and have income from the GI Bill.  Our living expenses and our income are really close, and we have an additional $800ish to $1500 monthly after bills, food, gas, etc.  This varies because I also bartend, and that's not a definite income.

We both expect to have jobs after our graduation, starting in May.  She is in the final rounds of interviews for a promising position making between $50-60k, and I expect to have a job (after going on multiple interviews and estimating my skills / degree / etc) making minimum $60-80k.  Our annual expenses equate to nearly $48k.

My wife and I are looking at possibly buying a house in the next 12-18 months.  We have an ""emergency fund"" but it is IDEALLY being saved for a down payment for a house.

So here's my question:  What options do I have, outside of swiping my credit card, to pay for these repairs?  Can I refinance for cash (My bank is Navy Federal) and use that to pay for the repairs?  I don't have an issue making the additional monthly payments.  

Should I just swipe my card understanding that we will have more income come the next two months?

Is there an option which I have not yet looked at?

TL;DR - I need to pay for truck repairs.  The cost is estimated at a total of approximately $3600 - $3800.  My wife and I will have nearly 2-3x our income in the next few months considering we will be graduated and have been actively job-searching.  Should I swipe my credit card, or can I refinance the truck for money?  Is there another option which I have not yet considered?",finance
personalfinance,Credit Balance Transfer Questions,"Hey all!
     I was exploring some alternative credit cards to the one I currently have (through Chase). I just have a few questions for you in terms of credit:

1.) I am currently single and 26yo. My current credit score is 774. I have not ever missed a payment, have only one hard credit inquiry, and am generally good at managing my budget.

2.) Say I wanted to move my balance on my current Chase card (just above 2k) to one of their different/newer cards with lower interest. As part of my current card, I took higher interest rates in order to have a higher max ceiling. Now that I have budgeted things and established a pretty decent history over the past few years, I feel like I should move to a more ""stable"" card. Does this balance transfer negatively affect my credit score?

3.) As an alternative, do I just stick with my current card? Do you have suggestions to other cards? How do cards with no annual fee compare to some cards with annual fees? 

Thanks!",finance

So here’s the deal - due to some family/personal finance issues I have dug myself into quite the predicament as far as debt goes and I’m hoping someone out there can help me make heads or tails of the mess.

My boyfriend and I collectively bring home roughly 6.4K per month after taxes. Out of that our hard costs for rent/utilities etc. comes out to 2,815.

That leaves us with about 3.6K to tackle my debts. Note that my private loans, due to the situation with my dad have defaulted and have gotten my credit in the sh**ter so ideally, we’re hoping to get out of credit card debt first and foremost and tackle the student loans after that.

Credit Cards 
- Credit Card #1 (20.49%) - 10,345.35
- Credit Card #2 (29.99%) - 1,950.85
- Credit Card #3 (0% APR until 2019) - 5,112.94

Credit Card total: 17,409.14

Private Loans: ~94K
Federal Loans: 17,906K

Have been making sure to pay more than the minimum across all of the credit cards and have already tried to call the credit companies to ask for lower APRs to no avail.

Also any advice on how much we should be putting away for savings? We tried to include on the hardest of hard (is that a thing?) costs so we will likely need to take into account groceries/personal items etc.

personalfinance,"Moved to US from Canada: tax-wise, better to sever ties?","I am a dual citizen that moved to Nevada, USA from Ontario, Canada in Oct, 2017. In Canada, I was making just over 100k CAD, and in the US I'm now making 148k USD (~190k CAD)

I maxed out my TFSA and RRSP contributions prior to leaving Canada.

I have 10 years of pensionable service time in the Canadian govt, and I am on a 1-year leave of absence, which I elected for knowing that it a) provided a fallback in case my new career in the US didn't work out, and b) I would be able to buy back pensionable service time the following year, and extend my pension by 1 extra year. I plan to commute my pension Oct, 2018 as a lump-sum payment. I currently have no intention of returning to Canada to reside because everything is working out well in the US.

I own (mortgage) a condo worth 320k USD in Nevada (purchased Oct 2017), but have no property in Canada. My entire family lives in Canada.

I'd like to know that when it comes to taxation, if it will be cheaper to sever ties with Canada, or if it will be more beneficial (e.g., TFSA contribution room growth) to maintain residency in both Canada and the USA? It's worth noting that Nevada does not have any state income tax.

I think I may have found a partial answer here (http://americanlaw.com/ustxtmp2.html), but I am struggling to understand if I will end up paying more in taxes by also remaining a Canadian resident? Everything I've read on this topic is rather dizzying.

""Usually the combined United States Federal and State personal income tax rates are lower than the combined Canadian Federal and provincial personal income tax rates. As a result, it is generally desirable to pay income tax only in the United States and not in Canada. By remaining a resident of Canada for income tax purposes all United States source personal income is subject to Canadian tax, which may be partially or wholly offset by foreign tax credits. However, the total tax paid in the United States plus the tax paid in Canada (net of foreign tax credits) usually equals the tax that would be paid in Canada, at least on the United States source income.""

personalfinance,Getting different results from TurboTax and TaxAct,"I did my taxes last week in TurboTax.com.  My taxes are extremely simple.

When I was done with TurboTax, it told me that I was getting federal refund of $410.00.  My state tax is a flat tax, so I never get a refund or owe.

Well, TaxAct is significantly cheaper, and I used them last year.  So, I redid my taxes (since they're pretty easy) and TaxAct is telling that I am getting back $262.00.  I'm combing through both pieces of software and I cannot find any discrepancy in what I entered into the software.

personalfinance,"22 years old, minimal expenses, what to do with savings?","Hello, 

I'm a 22 year old college grad and am a few months into my first real job which pays ~70k a year. I have no student loans or debt, am currently living with parents so no rent at the moment or any major expenses. I may be moving out soon but that is yet to be determined. I am currently contributing the max 401k match with my employer as well as HSA contributions. 

I recently opened a high yield savings account and shifted $10k of my savings into there. I have another ~10k of savings that I can either also move into the high yield savings, or invest in other options such as a CD/CD ladder/other investment avenues. 

It seems like the ""easy"" route would be to just dump the rest of my savings in the savings account, but is it worth it to explore other avenues with slightly higher interest rates such as the aforementioned CDs? Any other advice in general would be greatly appreciated. I should mention if you could provide advice on both longer term investments and short term investments that would be great. 

Some additional details that might help in providing advice: 

I tend to save the majority of my money right now, only spending money on going out with friends and going to concerts. I'm spending money this way due to the fact that I am able to save so much by living at home. When I move out, these habits will definitely change. My larger leisurely expenses would probably consist of taking a vacation once a year and spending money going out from time to time. I have no intention of purchasing a home anytime soon, but I may need or choose to replace my car within the next two years. 

Career wise, I'm hoping for decent career progression within my company. The company has been doing well and has a very positive outlook over the next few years. I have no intentions at the moment of going to grad school, but that may be something that could change depending on how things go over the next few years.",finance

personalfinance,New to home buying. Looking for some advice on mortgages and expenses.,"Alright guys, so here's a long one. I am a recently turned 25 yr old, recent college grad, recently engaged, recently hired at my first salary job (8mo ago) and recent puppy adopter. I've been renting apartments for the past 7 years and since my life is finally setting its course into long term adulthood it's time to bogey down and get serious. My fianceé and I are wanting to own a home and are looking to buy in mid-late 2019 and start planning a family. We recently moved to Nasvhille, TN for our jobs and the the housing market here is sky rocketing as you can imagine with any up and coming metro area. We know nothing about buying a house and what it entails, all of our knowledge is with renting. We understand ""Rent and Utilities"" and that is about it, we know nothing about owning a house like property tax, possible HOA fees, mortgages, insurance, and things of that liking. I know some of these things are tentative like equipment repair/replacement and higher utility costs and we understand that a mortgage is the hefty part of the monthly expense. but what are some other things to be aware off? What's a ballpark average of things to expect and budget for?

&amp;nbsp;

Some other details, we recently got a puppy so expenses are high atm with the little one. We have a decent EF that we ABSOLUTELY wont touch or dip into for a down payment or pay off any current debt. and speaking of debt, we have no credit card debt, just two loans. I have about $14,000 in student loans that I'm paying about $300 (sometimes $400) a month on, minimum is about ~$150. I know some will say to pay this off first before buying a house but the interest rates are not too high and I don't mind paying this over the next 4 or 5 years in order to get a house sooner before property value shoots up any further. Fianceé has a car loan that she will finishing up in the next year (cant remember the total amount, but it's almost done).  

My credit score is pretty good at 755. My fianceé... not sure, we've never checked (but will check soon).. But she's never had a credit card or been in serious debt (if any at all besides her car loan), her only credit is probably from the car loan that she's always paid on time and in full for the past 3 years and the renting we've done together for the past 2.5 years (we've never missed a payment or due date). She does have a PayPal Credit account for big online purchases, but she' always pays those off in full before the promotional period ends. We don't have a down payment setup but are hoping that a FHA will be right for us, and we could have a down payment set aside in the next 1.5 years.

- Net monthly pay: $3,000
- Monthly OT pay: ~$350

Banking,Realistic Expectations for a Auto Loan from my bank...,"Firstly, I apologize if there's a more appropriate sub to post this question in...

Alright, so I'm a few weeks away from purchasing a new vehicle.  The interest rate through GM Canada is 2.49% for 84 months, which is relatively low (Toyota's rate on their competitive vehicle is 6.49%, for example.)  I have excellent standing with my bank, and I was wondering if its even worth the effort to see if they can offer me a lower rate.  

The amount to be financed is approx. $37000 CDN.  At 2.49% the interest amounts to $3350 by the end of the term.  1.99% would be $2665.  Drops the payment down by $8/month.  I know its a negligible amount, but that $8 towards another debt I suppose.

Also owe $35k on my house, going to keep going one payment at a time on it for a while.

I’m wanting to pay off either the car or the camper. Can’t decide which would be better. 

Camper:
5.99% interest. But, monthly payment is only $123 per month. So essentially a drop in the bucket. 9 years left on the loan, but I would double up and pay off sooner for sure either way. 

Car: 

3.4% interest. $290 Monthly payment, 3.5 years left. 


Camper makes a bit more sense due to the interest rate, but it would be nice to free up the extra money on the car in case we have a slow time at work or something similar. Either way I’ll carry full coverage insurance on both of them. Also I tend to keep stuff a long time, I imagine I’ll own both of them for another decade at least. I typically drive cars past the 200,000 mile mark, haven’t made it to 300k yet due to rust but I’m hopeful it’ll happen someday.

investing,Is anybody worried about China selling U.S. treasuries?,"Hi guys,
As I understand it, China is the largest holder of U.S. debt and Japan is 2nd. Japan is already starting to reduce its treasury purchases. If China sells off U.S. treasuries that means the yields will rise and companies across the country will be less inclined to tacking on more debt. This comes at a time when the market is already extremely leveraged AND when the fed’s fund rate is increasing. This will cause cash to dry up in U.S. equities which will slaughter the stock market due to the deleveraging....I’m really not trying to be a contrarian, I’m just wondering if anybody shares this same view?

personalfinance,Tracking and improving my (good) credit score. I want excellent credit.,"I have a history of poor credit choices and performance.  Years ago I was in the lower 500s, due to divorce and youthful irresponsibility.  I've worked hard to improve it, and even though I've got a foreclosure on my record (2007) I've been successful.  I'm pretty proud of it

My credit score (according to Creditkarma) was in the low 800s and very high 700s until I had to buy a new car in November.  It's just below 750 now, and bothers me.  I understand that paying off debt is the best way to improve it, and I'm doing that, but I'm wondering what other strategies could I be using.

I've considered paying for a membership at MyFICO.com.  I know that the scores I see on Creditkarma are higher than those potential creditors see when they check.  Is MyFICO more accurate if I pay for it?

My available credit on credit cards is $26k, and my balance is about $12.5k.  I've considered getting an additional card with a lengthy 0% term (CITI Simplicity offers 18 mo @0% and the low end of the advertised interest rate is better than either of my two current cards) and transferring some of my CC debt to it.  I currently have 2 cards, both show balances of 51%.  This will change very soon, though, because I have about $1000 ""extra"" money I intend to use to lower the balance on both cards.  I don't know how to tell if this will hurt me or help me.

I'll be using credit to cosign student loans for my daughter, who will attend college in the fall.  I've agreed to pay half of what she'll owe after scholarships and government guaranteed loans, about $12k/year.  I have the money to cover the entire bill first semester, would it be smarter to do that in order to delay applying for the first student loan for 6 months?

We have been living in apartments for over a decade now, and we are done with it. We would like to provide our daughter and two dogs with a much better lifestyle, and we feel like our monthly rent payments need to be generating some equity for us. That being said, I think we might be rushing into it. Here's our current situation:

Income (Me): $5,656/mo gross; $4,260/mo net

Occasional Overtime: $456 gross; $320 net per shift, typically 1-2 shifts per month, but possibly 0 (aka not reliable)

Income (Wife): $0

Savings: $800

Rent: $1,169

Bills (excl. debt): $650/mo

Regular Spending: $1,200/mo

Credit Cards: $7800 balance; ~17% avg APR; $215/mo min payments

Auto Lease: $276/mo, ends in December 2018

Personal Loan (paid medical bills): $3600 bal; 11% APR; $157/mo

Private Student Loans (Wife): $32,000 bal; 10% avg APR; $345/mo payment

FedLoans (Me): $58,600 bal; $0/mo

FedLoans (Wife): $46,932 bal; $0/mo

Ok. So as you can see, I'm making enough to pay all monthly expenses and have about $250 left over each month (more when I get overtime). I've been putting $100 in savings each month and paying the rest on credit cards. I have an incoming summer bonus and tuition reimbursement (online MBA) from work, totaling about $5000 net. This will all go to credit cards. I expect to have them completely paid off by August at the latest. After that, we intend to turn our attention towards the personal loan and knocking that out hopefully by December at the latest. My original plan from then on was to attack my wife's private student loans (there are four, two of them have me as a cosigner ($206/mo for D2I calculation)), however our close friends just bought a house down the street from us and we are really itching to get out there and buy our first house as well. 

My wife is attending school part time right now (we just moved here last fall so she doesn't qualify for in-state tuition yet) but intends to attend school full time in August. Her FedLoans are in forbearance through September, at which point they will go into in-school deferment. We intend to pay for the remainder of her education with scholarships and grants or out-of-pocket if we have to. I am currently attending an online MBA program that I am roughly one third of the way through. I am paying for this degree with FedLoans. My next disbursement will be in July, and I intend to only pay for the 9-week class ($1950) and reject any student refund amount. This process will repeat with additional 9-week courses in September, November, and February, although in February I intend to retain the refund to pay for an additional class in April that FedLoans don't typically cover. All in all, I expect to borrow an additional $9,750 in FedLoans for this school year. After that, I will only have two more classes to obtain my degree, and I intend to pay for those out-of-pocket.

We live in a LCOL area, and all of the houses in this area qualify for USDA 0% down loans. Right now, my individual debt-to-income ratio is 46%, which exceeds the maximum for USDA (41%). However once the credit cards are gone and we turn in the leased car in December, I should have a D2I low enough to qualify. We would be buying a house in the $160,000-$200,000 range, which I estimate will come with a $1100/mo-$1300/mo mortgage.

That's our situation right now. What do you think? Are we crazy for pushing to buy a house with all this debt looming over us? On one hand, I feel like we should wait until we both graduate and my wife gets a full-time job, and we have an emergency fund of some kind. On the other hand, I will likely get promoted within a year which would be awesome but may put us over the income maximum for USDA, meaning we'll need to go the traditional route and save up probably 30k or so. 

One thing I could do - and this might be extreme (and somewhat not legal) is to accept the student refund amounts in July and September and use them to ""refinance"" the personal loan (lowering my D2I) and look into turning in the leased car 3-4 months early (I think if you do this, they just send you a bill for all remaining payments, eliminating the lease from your credit report, and subsequently D2I calculation). This would bring my D2I down low enough that we would qualify in October (which is when our current apt lease ends). This seems risky. Doesn't the bank check your statements to see how you're managing your money? Will a move like this seem dishonest to them?

Sorry for the long post. Let me know what you guys think.

Edit: Thank you guys for safely talking me out of it. I'm going to finish paying off credit cards and then start building up my emergency fund to at least 10-12k. Once we both graduate and my wife starts working, we'll start looking for a house. I knew it wasn't a good idea to start looking now, so I appreciate your helping me talk myself out of a bad decision. Thank you u/gyaradostwister for helping me realize what a poor financial decision 0% down is anyway and that even after the monthly increase in equity, it's still cheaper to rent now and save up to buy later.",finance

personalfinance,Consolidated Student Loans - Payments or Pay in Full?,"I recently consolidated $5k in federal student loans.  I could comfortably pay off the entire balance over the next few months, or stretch it out with slightly-above-minimum monthly payments.  

My question:  Would my credit score benefit from one approach over the other?  

I've read some very varying articles.  Some recommending one or the other, some recommending consistent payments for 12 months followed by pay-in-full.

With an interest rate of 3.75%, I'm willing to stretch payments out if it means a greater benefit to my credit score.  At this point I'm more concerned with improving my credit than saving a few hundred dollars.

Possible relevant info:  

* My credit standing is in the Poor-Fair range (650).
* I do not currently have a credit card, but I'm researching my options.  I settled ~$1,500 of credit card debt 10 years ago when I was fresh out of college, broke, and ignorant... well... more ignorant than now.
* I do have a Kohl's charge card with a limit of $700.  I probably use it once ever 3 months, never exceeding 30% of the limit, and pay the full balance prior to due date.
* The only other debt I currently have is $300 on a now-closed $8k line of credit with Mattress Firm through Wells Fargo that I used for a $2k purchase a couple years ago.  Mattress Firm and Wells Fargo parted ways at some point after my purchase, but my slightly-above-minimum payments &amp; promotional 0% APR was not affected.

I didn't end up needing the cash, so I was going to put it back towards that loan, but now I'm thinking maybe I should use that lump of cash to pay off my Chase credit card in its entirety instead since the CC interest rate is higher than the student loan's rate.

We cut out unnecessary crap. We paid off our Best Buy credit card and one of my Sallie Mae loans. We are putting a larger payment towards my Sallie Mae loans. 



Currently I make $59,000 before tax/insurance. My husband makes about $29,000 before tax/insurance.



One SM loan is $13,300 at 10% interest (with 8.5 yrs left), another is $4,700 at 11% (with 5.5 yrs left), and the last is $11,200 at 11% (with 5.5 yrs left). All of these are variable interest rates. We are putting the most money towards the $4,700 loan. The interest rates keep going up every 3 months or so. Fuck Sallie Mae. I don't want to give them another dime, but I also want to make sure I'm doing the right thing with refinancing.





I have been waiting for my credit score to pass 700 before I refinanced. My Transunion is 712 and Equifax is 711. I put in an application through SoFi to refinance with a 5 year 5.8% fixed interest through a pre approved offer. I was approved for a 15 year 7% fixed interest loan for $29,500, which will cover my SM loans. This would put my monthly payment at about $265. For reference, my required monthly payment for SM is $471, we pay $571. 


I did look into refinancing through Earnest, Common Bond, and Lendkey. Earnest can't refinance SM loans and the others had basically the same pre approved offers. 



15 years with a 7% interest rate sound daunting. Yes I know I can pay this off early and it's better than 10-11%. I talked to customer service and they said it is due to my cash flow. I could add my husband as my co signer. His income is less than mine by $30,000 and his credit score is around 680. Do you think it'd be worth it to add him? If something were to happen and I died, I do not want him to be responsible for my loans by himself. 



Am I overthinking this?

I’m having trouble understanding how best to calculate the exact percentage of additional tax burden I will be taking on and comparing it to my existing paychecks.

I’m an unmarried individual, with no dependents, making $30,000 per year.
My employer is currently deducting these items at these percentages from my paychecks:
Federal income tax - 7.15%
Social Security tax - 5.64%
Medicare tax - 1.32%

My understanding is the 2018 rates at my level for these items are:
Federal income tax - 12%
Employee Social Security tax - 6.2%
Employee Medicare tax - 1.45%
Employer Social Security tax - 6.2%
Employer Medicare tax - 1.45%

I’m not certain why the percentage deductions on my paycheck are all slightly off from the expected amounts. I’d expect them to be paying only 6% of my federal income tax and something closer to the actual rates for Social Security and Medicare (but they’re close).

These rates would indicate I’m taking on an additional ~6% in income tax, 6.2% in Social Security, and 1.45% in Medicare taxes. 

Is this correct? My intention is to ask for a percentage raise to compensate for the difference.",finance
economy,Bubbles Bubbles everywhere ...,"Economics is not an exact science. It has many theories and hypotheses from many different types of ideas and philosophies. The reason why economics is not an exact science is because every economist is trying to predict human behavior. In fact, the number one thing you must learn, in order to understand economics, is an assumption. You must assume that the actor in the economic model is rational. So, how can we make precise models when we know that not everyone is completely rational? The answer is, we don't, and that is why there are a number of competing ideologies and philosophies within the study of economics.

One idea that sticks out to me, given the current conditions, is the Austrian School of Economics. These economists felt that too much liquidity, and easy access to capital results in higher risk taking, and malinvestments. The idea is that if it is easy to get capital, then individuals with capital are prone to taking on more risk, without doing the proper research and due diligence required to make a good decision. The incentive to make perfect investment decisions diminishes, if an investor or company only needs to get more capital to stay afloat. 

Since the Great Recession, we have had extremely low interest rates, and extremely high levels of liquidity. Investing conditions have never been easier, and I think this has a direct link to stock market performance, private investments, and alternative investments like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The rise of unicorn companies such as Uber, the high valuation of Tesla without profits, the FAANG trade, and the rise of cryptocurrencies can all be attributed to the ease of monetary conditions. And now, the punch bowl is going to be taken away.

As the Fed starts to raise interest rates and taper off its bond repurchases, liquidity is going to dry up. Markets as a whole, such as the stock market, and the bond market, are probably not in bubbles, but there are definitely bubbly assets. Stocks like AMZN with a 307 P/E ratio, and NFLX with a 206 P/E ratio are bubbles. How can any investor expect profitability to catch up with these share prices in the near future; a recession will come well before that. These stocks are priced for earnings 20-50 years from now, just like the internet bubble was, and I think they will have a similar fate.

So I went to Credit Karma (where they have federal + state for free) and found that they will ONLY file state if you file federal.

What would happen if I file my federal again? Only because I want to file my state through Credit Karma because it's free (don't want to through my state website because its confusing)

Should I just submit it through Credit Karma again? This means that the fed will receive two (Credit Karma and TurboTax) but also my state will receive the filing.",finance
personalfinance,I forgot to add a 1099. Filed taxes through Turbo Tax yesterday. What do I do?,"Completely forgot to include a 1099 on my taxes since I had to download it and didn't have the physical paper. I just filed through Turbo Tax yesterday.

Another related question I have is the forgotten amount was about 4600 but that increased what I owed on Federal taxes by over 1700 and brought my CA refund down by $400 (meaning I was taxed 38% on that 4600 for Federal). How is that possible when total income is under 200k? I live in CA, could that have included self employment tax?",finance
personalfinance,Pay off/down small mortgages or invest in Roth IRA,"I have two small 2nd mortgages on a couple rental properties  ~$6800 @7.75% ($75/mo) and ~$9000 @7.5% ($83/mo). I can't decide whether to pay these mortgages off before I fund a Roth IRA or make my Roth contributions first and pay the mortgages second. I know that a Roth isn't going to out-perform these interest rates in the short term, but with the yearly limit, I don't know it it's better to get the extra year or two of Roth benefits and pay off the mortgages after I max that contribution.

Additional information: I have $15k in savings and ~$800/mo to spend toward these goals. I am currently maxing out the SIMPLE IRA offered by my employer. Refinancing the mortgages for a better rate is not an option.",finance

finance,"I am reposting /u/sirbastian's takedown of Bitcoin, because I am constantly re-sharing it and terrified it will somehow get deleted","By /u/sirbastian, originally posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7iyej5/bitcoin_exposes_the_massive_economic_illiteracy/dr2sntd/

-----------------------------------------------------------

While it's true that a currency needn't _necessarily_ be ""backed"" by something to be an effective means of exchange, virtually everything else you've said is false, or obvious pandering to the prevailing socioeconomic attitudes prevalent in this sub.

First, let's dispel the notion that US dollars aren't backed by anything. US Dollars have an important quality that makes them useful to an individual, regardless of whether other individuals want them: they can be used to pay down US citizens' tax obligations. This is no trivial thing. Read about Chartalism for more information.

&gt;A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being:
1) easy to use and understand by everyone
2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal
3) neglegible in overhead costs

You're listing this out like it's out of a textbook or something, but it's just 3 random points you picked out of the air that are heavily influenced by the current subject matter of Bitcoin. The average economist, when asked about money, is not going to mention that it should be ""easy to understand by everyone"", tamperproof, or low in transaction overhead. They're going to talk about the usual trifecta:
1) A medium of exchange
2) A store of value
3) A standard of value

Hilariously, even though you've arbitrarily chosen the metric we're using to measure the worth of a currency, Bitcoin still utterly fails to meet all 6 of these points. Let's go through them, starting with yours:

1. Easy to use and understand by everyone - Why would you even set yourself up for this? ""What is Bitcoin"" ""how does Bitcoin work"" ""How do I get a bitcoin"" These are some of the most asked questions on the internet because nobody can grok Bitcoin on the first try, and even when they do, it's not clear to them how they can ""buy in"". 
2. Tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal - While at first bluff this is true, tamperproof is really just one element of a larger desire that malicious third parties can't change the debt record in their favor. From a purely technical standpoint Bitcoin should be resistant to this, but in practice, the number of coins lost to negligent storage, Wallet exploits, etc. puts this point squarely against BTC. I am much, MUCH less concerned that my US bank account will disappear due to some technical trapdoor, or compromised because somebody hacked into the computer systems at my credit union.
3. Negligible in overhead costs - Bitcoin is ludicrously expensive to transact in, and circumventing this via, e.g. the Lightning network, necessarily involves tradeoffs against other technical qualities that you will doubtless be counting for Bitcoin elsewhere.
4. Medium of exchange - worthless. Nobody wants to buy pizzas with Bitcoin, because it is by and large considered some kind of investment. I love the irony that people don't want to spend their bitcoin to buy things because they're convinced that it's so incredibly useful to buy things - so much so that it will one day net them millions of... dollars? No wait, not that!
5. It is completely untrustworthy as a store of value - putting money into Bitcoin is not safe. This entire sub has ""invest responsibly"" posts slathered all over it because even the most foolhardy zealots realize that that saying you should save your life's earnings in Bitcoin is a terrible idea.  If I had $20 in a bank account in 2008, when I took it out today, it would only be worth 87% of what it was then. Inflation does hurt you over long periods of time, but this was a smooth, monotonic decay. It's the kind of value you can quite literally bank on decades in advance. Bitcoin has no such assurances. The value of your life savings denominated in Bitcoin changes significantly every day.
6. A standard of value - The fact that people's biggest concern is how many dollars one can buy with their Bitcoin tells you everything you need to know. Nobody denominates values in Bitcoin - it would be completely useless. If I told you this car was worth 1 BTC, that means two different things on Monday vs. Friday. If I tell you it's worth $15000, you understand.

&gt;It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can.

This is meaningless. 

&gt;This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar

Oh, you mean soar up and down like a tech stock after an IPO? Making it completely untrustworthy as a store of value, and unusable as a medium of exchange? Regardless, even if it _was_ monotonically rising in value (it's not, not even close), why would this be a good thing? If you want to live in a world where all goods and services are completely denominated in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter what Bitcoin is ""worth"" in US dollars at any point in that cycle. The measure of Bitcoin's usefulness starts and ends with what types of things can be bought with it. It doesn't matter if a pair of shoes costs 1 BTC or .0000001 BTC if, all other things being equal, your salary and pension and taxes are measured in BTC. It's just a scale-factor. If you think the value of Bitcoin, denominated in US dollars, soaring into the stratosphere is a good thing, then you've patently revealed your true motivation, which is for the in-crowd to get rich. This is deliciously ironic given:

&gt;they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.

And so we see what you'd really like to see happen: destroy the riches of the current superwealthy and replace them with a different group that you like more - Bitcoin early adopters.



Bitcoin is a fascinating development, and it blazed an important first trail in the modernization of money and commerce, but from a technical standpoint it is totally inadequate to serve as the currency of the internet, or the currency of the world. Transaction fees, energy usage due to mining, validation waits, Wallet protection, and exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - all of these things are lacking in fundamental, unfixable ways. The world needs something that has a lot in common with Bitcoin, but it also needs to have a lot of things that are quite different. Sitting around and telling each other that the establishment just ""Doesn't get us, man"" is fucking delusional. There are people that don't understand cryptocurrency, but this is not the only or even the main reason that Bitcoin falls into criticism. It is being criticized because it has real, legitimate, unsustainable, deal-breaker problems. When you write this kind of BS that 'the establishment is just trying to protect the status quo', you sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist who things that GM knows how to make cars run on water but won't tell us because of the oil cartel. It just doesn't make any fucking sense. If Bitcoin was a digital pantheon of economic exchange that was going to usher in the modern era of banking, then you know who would be all over that shit? BANKS. It's not a cabal of evil capitalists trying to crush the revolution. It's a few uninformed people, and a bunch of people who have genuine grievances based on their understanding of monetary policy and finance. Maybe in some cases they're too stuck in their old ways of thinking, but anybody assuming that finance and banking professionals have no wisdom to impart here is gravely mistaken.

The shorthand for all of this is to ask yourself: if you could wake up tomorrow to a world that had replaced all existing monetary infrastructure, would you REALLY want to? Millions of truck drivers with unsecured wallets, policeman's pensions sitting on the blockchain, Starbucks waiting 5 minutes to confirm that your $5 coffee (+ $5 settlement fee) can be handed over? 3 transactions per second for the entire world?",finance
personalfinance,HSA basics,"Hello all, I apologize if there is information covering these questions in the sidebar -- I didn't see anything when I perused it.

I have a few questions regarding HSAs. I've had an HSA for the past few years and am only now beginning to understand (thanks to this sub!) that I'm not utilizing it properly, nor do I fully understand it.

Questions:

1.  I have an HSA through my employer, and I have a certain amount of money deducted from each paycheck for the HSA. Say I l leave this job and move to a different company which does not offer an HSA. Then is it still possible for me to put money into my current HSA somehow?

2. Now say I leave this job and move to a different company which DOES offer an HSA. Can I combine the funds between the 2 HSAs, or will I just have 2 sepearate HSAs for the rest of my life?

2. My husband just started a new job which offers an HSA with his health care plan. Do we both need an HSA? Can I use my HSA to pay for his health care needs? Or do we need 2 separate accounts and each account is only allowed to pay for 1 person?

3. I know at least that with my HSA, I get to keep the account after I leave the company. I'm not sure about my husband's yet. Is it possible that his company has different rules regarding HSAs, or is there a federal rule/law stating that companies have to allow you to keep the HSA once you leave the company?

4. My HSA website has a FAQ section which states that you don't have to close the account once you are on Medicare. However, it states that once you qualify for Medicare, you may no longer be able to make any contributions to the account. So I assume that in order make use of the HSA as wisely as possible, I should have money saved up in the HSA by the time I'm 65 that will cover my healthcare costs for the rest of my life. Is that the correct way to utilize the HSA?

5. I have my husband listed as my beneficiary for the HSA, and vice-versa. If I were to die first and my husband inherits my HSA funds, is he still restricted to using it for only healthcare-related costs?

Thanks in advance for helping me out :)",finance

I had $2456 withheld form my checks and my wife (who's total income was only $21,000 of the total) had around $556 withheld.

personalfinance,Can I get through life without a degree even though I'm incredibly debt in school debt?,"Hi, so I'm 22 and I am incredibly sick of school. I'm sick of all the lies and the bullshit they've fed me and I'm tired of everyone telling me that my life will be infinitely better with that shitty piece of paper than without one. The simple thought of having to re-inroll in school makes my blood boil. I have the capacity to finish and get my degree but I am STRUGGLING to find the motivation for it. I have no clue what I want to do with my degree, I don't know if my major is the right one for me, but I've wasted three years of university on random, bullshit course that never added up to a real degree. I picked history because I thought it would be easy and quick and I could just get it all over with.

I currently work full time making 15/hour. I am like 30 or 40 grand in debt at school. I don't really know the full amount because I just blindly took private loan after private loan because I was told that, again, my life would be infinitely better with a degree. 

I'm burnt out as hell, and can NOT find the motivation to enroll for another semester. I took last semester off because I just couldn't stand the thought of struggling through a bullshit course I could have cared less about. 

IS there any way to live a decently comfortable life without a degree? Or did I pretty much fuck myself? Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Best way to handle my debt?,"Hello,

I spoke to one of my creditors this morning and I have $2,600 in debt from them. They offered me a settlement of $1,300 if I pay it in full. I have a few other creditors that seemed willing to do the same. 

There is no way I can get the actual money to settle in full, even in the coming months. I am wondering if there is a debt consolidation type organization that will settle all my debt at lowered settlements and then I can pay them one monthly payment? My credit isn't good, I'm nervous about extortionate interest rates. Any help is appreciated in looking in the right direction. 

I know debt consolidation isn't considered a good idea the way their industry is set up but I need to find a way to make this work so I can get back on the right track. Thank you.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Crypto Safety Education Series #1: Combat phishing scams - how does domain work and how to not get phished,"Hey guys, we are launching our site [Crypto Aware](www.cryptoaware.org) this week and our goal is to combat the increasingly frequent crypto-related scams and hacks through education, protection and advocacy. 

Yes, the security features can always be improved, but most of crypto scams and hacks exploit the weakest point - **you**, the cryptocurrency holders and investors. 

Our educational series is meant to talk over some of the most popular type of crypto related scams and reveal their common patterns so you can avoid them.

The first few parts of the series are dedicated to phishing scams - the most common type of crypto scams. And today we will focus on dicesting how domain works - a concept that often confuses newcomers. 

Most phishers take advantage of most users lack of knowledge regarding domains and pretend to be the official exchanges/wallets when they have nothing to do with the official websites.

There are usually 2 ways to make a spoofed-website look legitimate - **by having a similar URL and a similar website design as the real website**.

While a poorly designed phishing site is definitely a giveaway that the site is illegitimate, the best way to distinguish a phishing site from the real site is through the website URL.

Phishers may be able to copy the exact look of the real website, especially when the real website is open-sourced, but they can *NEVER acquire* the same domain address as the real site.

&gt; So what exactly is a domain name?

Let’s use Crypto Aware’s web address as an example and analyze each part of a website URL.

Crypto Aware’s homepage address (or URL) is https://www.cryptoaware.org

&gt; `https` part of the url indicate the protocol. HTTPS indicates that the website connection is secure, while `http` (without the “s”) means the communication to the site is not encrypted and thus, not secure.

&gt; `www` refers to the subdomain of the website. A registered domain is allowed to have multiple subdomains to host different contents. For example, we can have different contents hosted on `www.cryptoaware.org` and `blog.cryptoaware.org` if we so choose.
&gt; All subdomains are under the control of the main domain register. One can also choose to host the website on a “bare domain” (without subdomain part) and just display the root site address such as `cryptoaware.org`.

&gt; `cryptoaware.org` is the website’s domain. And `.org` is what we commonly referred to as the TLD (top level domain) of the web address. Other common TLDs are `.com`, `.io`, `.net` etc, you get the gist.
 
A domain is unique and is owned by the company/person who registered it. Once a domain is registered and active, no one else can use the same domain unless the original owner is willing to sell or transfer it.

So phishers’ ultimate goal is to deceive and lead you to a spoofed-website that was made to look like the legitimate website to gain information to access your funds. And they love to play tricks with a website’s URL by registering a domain name with small, easy-to-miss differences from the real website domain.

Let’s take the recent [Binance’s phishing attack](https://medium.com/binanceexchange/summary-of-the-phishing-and-attempted-stealing-incident-on-binance-651e4dd1dd63) as an example to demostrate what are official URLs and what are not.

&gt; ✖ Phisher’s website address is an unicode misspelled domain name `www.bịnạnce.com` notice the small dot below `ị` and `ạ`, they are unicode latin letters that are different than `i` and `a` and thus a completely different domain than `www.binance.com`. If you have trouble see the character difference, check [this screenshot version](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/https://steemitimages.com/DQmRCRHDdZwVsUxEyPfWhjqpxkCxf62G1M7Z5n9H9b5GqNP/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-08%20at%2010.29.22%20AM.png) 

&gt; ✖ By the same principles, `www.binance.org` and `www.binance.net` are NOT under Binance’s control (unless they have also registered those domain in fear of phishers) and are completely DIFFERENT sites than `www.binance.com`

&gt; ✖ `bi-nance.com` and in [Bitfinex phisher’s example] (https://twitter.com/bitfinex/status/910289315829297152) `bitfinex-com.com` are not under Binance or Bitfinex’s control and they are phishing websites.

&gt; ✖ `www.binance.example.com` or `binance.example.com` are NOT under Binance’s control. The real domain is `example.com` and they registered subdomains for `www.binance` and `binance` to impersonate Binance.

&gt; ✓ `us.binance.com` is under Binance’s control. `us` is a subdomain of `binance.com` and should be generally trustworthy unless the domain has been hacked and compromised.

Ok that’s a wrap for the day, hope the information was digestible enough without becoming too technical. If you have any question, please leave them in the comments below. Tomorrow we will continue the phishing scam series with a focus on ads phishing.

P.S If you are the victim of a cryptocurrency phishing scam, please [report your case to us here](https://goo.gl/forms/80h7834zHxAzQpLH3). Here at Crypto Aware we are establishing the **First Responder Network** for crypto-related scams.

CryptoCurrency,The state of the world and cryptos stake in it.,"As an 18 year old growing up in todays world I wonder how the crypto community acts like it does. Lets talk about the world right now not even crypto. In America we have Trump as president, who is throwing out environmental regulations even though we just surpassed the 400 ppm co2 line, world wide we have multi billion dollar corporations dumping waste and toxcins into our environment. We have fake wars being raged to stimulate rigged economies. We don't have a choice anymore what is it Hyundai or Honda? Mcdonalds or Burger King? High fructose corn syrup or sugar concentrates. We're fed fake food, water bottle companies have been proven to be selling tainted water with ph levels of 5. Its fucking insane that the world is ok with this. Now lets wrap this back to cryptocurrencies. Even the basic principle of a blockchain is having a public ledger, that concept right there could completely change the way a company and or government operates, it holds them accountable by everyone that can see it. I dont understand how this community sits here and lashes out at each other and calls each other shit coins. At the end of the day being a human growing up in this fucked world I would be happy with a coin I have 0 money invested in succeeding as long as it meant mass adoption and accountability for these institutions. Right now the banks and governments are winning because we are such a weak community with morales as strong as the banks. Start being driven towards building a better society not a bigger pocket. Do your research and encourage projects that believe in the basic concept of a blockchain. If one wins the whole world will benefit. But this mindset of your coin must be the ""one"" all will result in destruction of this market from within and will allow for a total take over from the same people we are trying to escape.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Do I need to report mileage reimbursement on my personal federal income tax?,"In 2017 I made a little over $200 in mileage reimbursement. I work as a behavior technician and transport my client to and from the clinic I work at, and am reimbursed $0.30 a mile for driving her to and from her house. This reimbursement amount is shown online for each pay stub I get each week. Do I have to report this amount while filing my taxes, or report anything at all? I've been googling this forever and none of the tax websites or google can really give me a straight answer. I do not want to submit my taxes with inaccurate information and be penalized and do not really have anyone to ask.

Other info: I only received a W-2 from my employer and there is no added information in box 12, everything is blank, which means mileage is included in box 1. I only worked with this client in November and December of last year so mileage was around $30 a week reimbursed...

personalfinance,Pay off HELOC balance with extra income to avoid $4k in interest over next 70+ months?,"Current income is approximately $8k a month.  Total expenses around $7k a month. 


I have around $18k in checking at the beginning of the month and around $24k at the end of the month before bills are paid.


$30k+ in retirement account and credit card is PIF at the end of every month (no balances anywhere).  Own a home.  Do not have anything in my savings account and have approximately $40k in credit card limit for emergencies.  Both my wife and I are secure in our current employment.  She has around $8k in a work 401k and I have 23 more years before a $100k a year pension.


We have a HELOC that we used for home renovations with a balance of $18k with a minimum payment of $320 with an interest rate of 7%. I am wondering if it makes sense to take between $8-10k out of checking and pay off approximately 1/2 of the HELOC balance.  The new monthly payment would be around $160.


Does that make ""financial sense"" or would it be better to just move that chunk ($8-10k) and put it into a savings account and get my 1% yearly and continue to pay the minimum payment on the HELOC for the next 6+ years.

personalfinance,Quarterly Tax Question,"Hello I have a question. This is my first year working a 1099 job. 
I've been working a self-employed job where I make about 1600 a month since January 2018. I don't think the job is going to last more than 2 to 3 more months definitely not for the rest of the 2018 year. I know I have to file quarterly taxes, but I'm a bit confused as to how to calculate a payment for the April 17 quarter. 

A few questions 

Do I need to pay quarterly taxes for a job that's not going to last all of 2018?

I live in California, are there other quarterly taxes I need to pay on top of the federal taxes? 

How do I calculate everything? Also, how do I deduct expenses?

personalfinance,Looking to refi student loans but not sure why calculators are returning such a high interest rate,"I have about $230,000 in student loans, making $150,000 but currently interviewing with firms that might bump that up by ~$50-100k all in.  I'm working on getting my emergency fund saved up and don't have any other debt.

My student loans are at 6.0-6.5% interest which I think is pretty crazy.  I'm looking to refi into a lower rate.  I see some of these companies offering rates as low as 3.0-3.5%, however for some reason when I look at these refi calculators most of them are looking to refi me into like 5.0%.

I have a 750+ credit score and no other debt, so I'm guessing it's just because of the debt/income ratio that this is the case?  Is this correct or is there something else going on?",finance

investing,Money market funds now paying 1.75%+ interest,"Banks have been very slow to increase interest on savings accounts. Many large banks still have the nerve to pay no interest. A quick check shows that in my zip code, BoA, PNC, and Wells Fargo each pay 0.01% to 0.03% interest on their basic savings accounts. If you jump through hoops by having a checking account with them and meeting account minimums, hopefully avoiding the $5-$12 account service fee, they pay a whopping 0.06%, 0.10%, and 0.32% interest, respectively. Even bank money market savings accounts pay very little interest, at 0.03% with PNC Bank. Unless you're with an online bank like Ally, a credit union, or another bank that is particularly aggressive about their savings account interest rate, you're probably getting ripped off.

Vanguard's prime money market fund pays 1.74% interest currently with no account service fee, although given, it does require a minimum of $3000 to start. But if you already have investments with vanguard or another mutual fund company, it's a no brainier to use their money market fund as your savings account rather than your bank savings account. I keep a $100 cash buffer in my checking account, credit cards for emergencies, and then my savings are in Vanguard's prime money market fund beside my taxable investment and retirement accounts.

I just wanted to point this out since it feels like increasing mutual fund money market rates have flown under the radar. It's kind of upsetting to me because I feel like people are getting robbed. Meanwhile, mutual fund money market accounts could be paying 2.5% interest by year end, with essentially no risk to principal.

On another note, does this change anyone's investment strategy? I'm thinking that retail investors, seeing saving account rates go up alongside increasing market volatility, may reallocate more into cash, pushing markets down further.",finance
personalfinance,Looking to purchase a home in the next year - FHA loan?,"Hey PF!

My wife and I have been renting for about a year, and are considering buying our first home in the next year or so. We are looking around our local area (central Indiana), where the housing market has traditionally been pretty affordable.

However, prices just keep rising, and we have several friends who are experiencing difficulty getting into the houses they're approved for because of offers over asking price from other, wealthier buyers. One couple we know has had 3 houses that they offered list for, and were still outbid.

We haven't been pre-approved yet, but we both have excellent credit, about $55k in student loans, $15k car loan, and about $8k saved specifically for the house. We are making nearly $100k/year (pre tax) combined.

Can someone help me understand the terms for an FHA loan, and how much house we are likely to be able to afford? We are paying our loans down aggressively and well ahead of schedule to have them paid off.

Follow up: are first time home buyer grants still a thing?

We are definitely financially stable, $5k emergency fund and 1-2 months ahead on our budget, paying well over the minimum loan payments, if that helps!

**EDIT: For those saying we need to pay down our debt first, that is still our plan. But we are trying to get as educated as we can. At what point is the existing debt minimized enough to take on a mortgage, especially when out highest interest rate is locked at 4%?**",finance

CryptoCurrency,Why is it legal to extort crypto developers?,"After the NANO news, and reading about Craig Wright being sued over bitcoin, I am starting to wonder if the federal government is complicit in the takedown of crypto-currency developers in the form of settlements.

Obviously, the IRS and the SEC have stepped up to the plate to take an active interest in crypto as it has gained significant value in the past year.  Couple this with high dollar stock market investors like Warren Buffet, or people in power like Steve Mnuchin (who, O/T has a knockout wife that is waaaaaaay out of his league), and you have a recipe for crypto disaster. 

Their strategy seems to be utilizing people who have lost money from hacks and, in turn, milking the developers out of court while holding coin growth as a hostage during the course of the lawsuit.

I may be writing this too early, but I have seen a lot of power players speak out against crypto, and it seems clear that they are doing what they can to repress market growth. Opinions?",cryptocurrency

Long story short, my wife's primary job is costing us roughly $10,000 in owed taxes. I am trying to understand what went wrong or how she's underpaying that is causing this sort of huge discrepancy. I saw a CPA whom I trust, but I just don't understand how the numbers are what they are. 

Keeping this very basic, I only input my w-2 and her w-2 into Turbotax just to see how the numbers would play out. 

My W-2; I made ~80k and paid ~15k in federal taxes (Box 2 on W2)
My wife's W-2; she made ~120k and paid ~15k in federal taxes (Box 2 on W2) 

I claim single 0, she claims married 0. 

We're finding that her W-2 basically incurs $10,000 in a tax hit. My CPA says 15% is very low. My wife inquired with her employer and they are adamant that they are taking the proper amount of federal taxes out. 

How is this possible? If ~15% is correct for her pay, how does her W-2 cost us $10,000?

personalfinance,College student looking to set up before making it on my own,"Hello!

I'm currently a college student in Idaho, and I have two years left to go. I'm entering into a very competitive field, centering around CGI and Virtual Design, and I'm nervous about finding work in the future. I mean, I'd be happy working a job that's even $40,000 a year, but that's not really my biggest point.

I worked last summer at Domino's, and most of that money went to my tuition. Money that I got for birthdays in my childhood went into a CD (as per my dad's suggestion, though I didn't start to understand this until I was about 14) and will mature next year. College here is quite cheap, but even with my academic 4.0, scholarships are not provided (for various reasons), and my student loans will be decent when I get out.

For rent, I'm borrowing from my dad, who gave me a very very kind interest rate of %2.0, so that I could focus on paying off the student loans before my loans to him.

I'm looking at an internship in my field, but naturally, it is unpaid, so if I do get it, I won't be making money during the summer, which may set me back further.

Assuming I don't get the internship though, what steps should I be taking in general to set up for a better financial future? I want to start setting up things like retirement, savings accounts, CDs, and all of the other things, but I don't even know where to begin. There are so many terms and so many complexities and accounts to deal with that I am struggling to figure it out.

crypto_currency,Soccerex announce London Football Exchange as new Title Sponsor!,"Soccerex have announced a new Title Sponsorship agreement with the London Football Exchange (LFE) – the world’s first fully integrated football club stock exchange and marketplace.

The LFE is the creation of pioneering finance experts who are using cutting-edge blockchain technology to revolutionise the football market and this sponsorship sees them supporting the next three Soccerex events starting with Soccerex China, April 17/18, Zhuhai where the partnership will officially be launched. In addition, the LFE will be title sponsor of the subsequent two Soccerex events, the first of which will be held in North America with further details to be announced shortly.

Blockchain technology was first created to serve as a decentralised digital ledger for transactions of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. However, due to the transparency and security it offers, the business community are increasingly finding new uses for the technology which looks set to dramatically alter the world’s financial market place.

The LFE platform utilises this blockchain to bring new and improved benefits to football fans around the globe, offering safer and more direct systems for payments and ticketing, delivering value for clubs and fans alike. With a team of international experts and advisors, the LFE are combining their deep understanding of football and corporate governance, along with their legal and financial know-how to build the ultimate community where fans can partake in exclusive football benefits and even the opportunity to invest in their clubs in return for equity, giving them a direct stake in the club they love.

Commenting on the new agreement, Jim Aylward, LFE media and entertainment adviser said, “We are very excited to sign this agreement with Soccerex, the world’s leading football conference. The LFE is committed to positive dialogue with all of football’s stakeholders and this partnership is the perfect opportunity for us to engage the global football community. We look forward to working with Soccerex to achieve this through their different events around the world.”

Soccerex Chief Operating Officer, Rita Revie said, “The London Football Exchange are pioneers just like my late husband Duncan was when he started Soccerex two decades ago. Football, and the world in which it operates, has changed so much since then, largely due to technology and I have no doubt that LFE will be at the forefront of football’s next technological revolution.”

The LFE will play a significant role in both the conference and exhibition at Soccerex’s inaugural China event and will host the VIP dinner on April 16.

Soccerex China has a local partner network that includes De Heng Qin, Desports, Time Fun Media &amp; Culture Ltd and Huafa Sports, part of the Zhuhai Huafa Group. The event also benefits from the support of the Hong Kong Football Association and from Soccerex Global Partners, LaLiga.

Over two days, the event will bring together senior decision makers from across China and the rest of the world for an exhibition of market leading companies and a programme of conference sessions and networking events focused on the growth of football in China and the fulfilment of China’s national football reform plan.

Organisations confirmed to attend include Alisports, AC Milan, Adidas, FC Bayern Munich, Chongqing Dangdai Lifan F.C, Hublot, IDG Capital, Jiangsu Sunning FC, LaLiga, Lander Sports (owners of Southampton FC), Manchester United FC, NFL, Shandong LunengTaishan FC, US Soccer Federation, Wanda Sports.",cryptocurrency

Now im thinking of a long term play (5-10 years or bust) where I hope the govt defaults and isnt able to pay it back because our debt is too high, interest rates are rising along with tax cuts with the possibility of tarrifs (tarrifs not really important but thought id add it)

if i short bonds, how much am I expected to lose over the next 5 years?

If govt actually defaults how much would I gain?",finance

personalfinance,Estimated tax questions (Fed and state),"Federal scenario:

Say I had capital gains from stock at $30k just in the first quarter and I calculate the tax payment to be $5800. 

I also assume I will underpay withholdings by a total of $1k and have a tax on dividends of $700.

First, can I spread out the tax on the $30k between 4 quarterly payments and still avoid the penalty, or do I need to do a lump sum payment by the first deadline?

Second, say I apply some carryover capital losses to reduce the $5800 tax owed to $3000. This means with no estimated payments, I will owe $4700 (3000+1000+700) at the end of the year. 

Now, let’s say I will see a new $4k tax credit this year (FYI child tax credit for 2 kids).  Since I know this will cancel out all this tax, can I just ignore the estimated payments or will I get penalized for not paying it as I go?

I plan on making more capital gains this year and am curious how I should treat each quarter, i.e. should I split new tax evenly into remaining payments or keep making lump sums by quarter.

State scenario (Maryland):

Similar question, if I estimate my tax bill from capital gains to be $1500 can I do quarterly payments with no penalty or do I need to pay as I go. Also, does Maryland let you apply capital losses to cancel out gains?

Thanks for any help!",finance

personalfinance,Helping a friend by taking over his car,"Recently a good friend of mine lost his high paying job and is asking me to take over his car and the payments on it. It’s low mileage, well maintained, and a nice car that I trust won’t give me many issues. I haven’t sat down with him to discuss how much is owed or the nitty gritty details quite yet because I wanted to walk in with a plan of what I wanted to do. From what I’ve read, my options are either to keep the car under his name, make the payments on his behalf and transfer the title once the cars paid off, or go to the dealership or a lender and refinance the car under my name. He’s a good man and a man of his word so I’m not worried about him screwing me over with the car or the title. My issue with that is that I have only about 8 months of credit history, so payment history is not much. I’m worried about the lender jacking up the interest rates and making the monthly payments skyrocket to something unreasonable since I’m a 22 year old guy and I’ve never financed a car and have barely any credit history. Would it be smarter to get a notarized agreement between him and I stating that I’ll take over the remaining payments and he will transfer the title to me once the car is paid, or refinance so that the car is entirely in my name?",finance
personalfinance,I’m interested in a Roth IRA but I’m not sure if it’s a good decision,"I am a Junior in high school and will be graduating next year. I have about $1,500 saved up and I’m paying off my car through a loan from the bank. I have $2,770 left to pay and am paying $105 a month on top of car insurance which is around $100 a month. I make around $500 every month for now until summer which should increase to about $400-500 a week. I need some help on what a Roth IRA is because I heard that if I put $2000 into a Roth IRA every summer for every year of high school with a 7% interest rate then it’d turn into a million. I’m not sure where to start and where to find a long term saving account with a high interest rate where I will be very well off with money when I’m older.",finance

personalfinance,Is it bad for my credit or otherwise non-advisable to immediately utilize a cash advance on a recently opened credit card?,"Hey all,

I bank with Fifth Third and recently was approved to open a credit card that has a $3,000 limit, does not charge interest within the first 15 billing cycles, and then charges an APR of 26.49% for cash advances. I opened this card because I need to pay off a study abroad program (that I've elected to do, so I guess this is more of a want rather than a need) that costs $3,000 by 4/30. The way I see it, I have two options:

1. Get a cash advance on this card and pay a fee so I can transfer it to my checking account and pay off the program by the due date. My plan then would be to spend the months following my return from studying abroad to make payments on this card to try to ward off the interest rate for as long as possible. However, I've been told that this will cause a rather large hit to my credit, which currently is in the 700 range.
2. Pay off the program in installments until I leave (I have three months to pay off the $3,000). In the meantime, charge my rent and other bills to the card, which again, I plan on starting to pay off upon my return.

Does anyone have any advice regarding my two possible plans? I am so excited to study abroad, yet I don't want to completely ruin my credit in the process. For context, I'm 26 and have already paid off my student loans, so I currently am debt-free. Thanks in advance for any insight anyone can give!

UPDATE: Thanks everyone for the sobering advice. It was definitely something I needed to hear. I am going to look into payment plan options instead, see if the scholarships I applied for actually come through and if they don't, save my money to study abroad when I can actually afford it. Thanks all!",finance

&gt;[The F.B.I. on Monday raided the office of President Trump’s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, seizing records related to several topics including payments to a pornographic-film actress.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/fbi-raids-office-of-trumps-longtime-lawyer-michael-cohen.html)

&gt;Federal prosecutors in Manhattan obtained the search warrant after receiving a referral from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, who called the search “completely inappropriate and unnecessary.” The search does not appear to be directly related to Mr. Mueller’s investigation, but likely resulted from information he had uncovered and gave to prosecutors in New York.

personalfinance,Which order to pay student loans,I’m 26f and hoping to start trying for a baby before my 29th birthday and want to try to get my debt paid down as much as possible in the next 2.5 years. I currently make 40k/year not including bonuses. I have 59k in federal student loans that are on an IBR plan plus one private Sallie Mae Loan and some credit card debt. My plan is to have the credit cards and Sallie Mae paid off this year and then start tackling the federal loans. The 59k is made up of subsidized and unsubsidized loans ranging from $500-9k with interest rates from 3.4 to 6.8. My plan is to make my monthly payments and then use the custom overpayment tool to pay off the unsubsidized loans with higher interest rates first. Would it be better to pay down the larger ones first? Just want to approach this in the best way possible.,finance
personalfinance,Auto refinance - broker change the rate,"I am trying to refinance my auto loans. I don't have a huge loan but I think I could save a little money with a lower APR - right now I'm at ~$12k at ~5%. My credit score is in the upper 700s.

I applied at RateGenius - originally before i applied they advertised 2.99% through credit karma. I know advertisements can be misleading - so this part is on me, thats fine.

They did a hard check for the application. The came back to me with ""fully approved"" loans @ 2.4-2.5% options (with varying term lengths). I was okay with that - its half of the rate I had now. No fees or early payment penalties so that sounded okay to me.

I asked them to send me the documents. They said sure - but then the next day, I get a call from them saying the rate is now 3% if I set up auto pay and its like 3.24 if I don't set up auto-pay.

This all seems fishy to me, is it normal for them to suddenly change the interest rate on me after they sent me a ""fully approved"" quotes? They already had my full/hard credit report? what could have changed?

Anyway apparently having a BA  limits my financial aid from the federal govt meaning most of the assistance i can get is from loans but my credit score is only 580. My parents paid for my useless bachelor's the first time around so they won't pay again OR cosign my loans. 

My current job is too stressful as I am disabled, and the pickings for mental health are slim at entry level.  Im having a hell of a time finding work that pays comparably that is safe.

Can I take out loans anyway? How much do I even need? I'm overwhelmed and don't know what to do",finance

I googled fedloan and came up with the # 888 647 0465 which is for ""myfedloaninfo."" When I asked about sending something in via email, the gentleman I was speaking with started to give me a phone # for fedloan. I told him I thought I called fedloan, and he said the company he works for does debt consolidation and student loan forgiveness for fed loan and 2 other companies (he named them by name). I said I might as well see if I am eligible for student loan forgiveness. I talked to him for a few minutes, and then he asked me to give him a 6 digit code from my email that was to reset my password for fedloan. I thought that was a bit fishy, and I hesitated, but I reminded myself that I called him. I was on the phone with him for over 20 min, being put on hold a couple times (there was call hold music during this time). He said he could consolidate my loans into one loan, and due to my income being under 42k per year, I am eligible for $0 payment but that would be based on my income each year. He then said I would need to pay $599 for a processing fee that would take several months to go into affect. In the mean time I would have stop payments put on my fedloan payments. 

For me that was a red flag. It sounded too good to be true, followed by pay a large sum of money. I told him I would look into his company some more and call him back. 

I was able to log into my fedloan account and change the username and password. I also notified my bank of possible fraud.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin's Monetary Policy is the cause of price swings,"First to state the obvious: Bitcoin's price volatility prevents widespread adoption by merchants and other risk averse people, with cost to hedge and uncertainty about the near-term value turning people away.

Now for my unpopular opinion: This is built right into Bitcoin's monetary policy (steady, unchanging supply schedule, with a cap on total coins). I don't see how widespread adoption can happen when more stable alternatives already exist (gold / fiat) and it is possible to have an ""economically stable"" monetary policy.

How to create an economically stable monetary policy: Tie the maximum block subsidy to the difficulty level. When difficulty goes up, the subsidy increases commensurately, and decreases when difficulty reduces. If demand for the coin increases, miners see higher profitability and devote more energy to mining the coin, increasing the number of coins on the market and diluting the price. When demand for the coin reduces, the opposite effect occurs and miners produce less coins which supports the price. The key here is to make sure the coins per block goes up or down in line with difficulty (10% increase in difficulty = 10% more coins). As it is tied to a verifiable cost (energy spent), this prevents run-away inflation and keeps to the principle of sound money. We can then conceptualise the blockchain as an accounting system that credits users based on their energy input to the system.

Keeping transaction fees deflationary: The above idea ignores the impact of transaction fees, but we can easily accommodate them by making the block subsidy even more dynamic: reducing the subsidy by a historical average of transaction fees per block. Otherwise transaction fees would be inflationary as they would encourage miners to increase their output and therefore the number of coins on the market.

Apologies for the long post, but I'm fully signed up to the bitcoin idea and see this wild price speculation/ panic as a major hurdle for the eco-system. I know speculation for personal gain is what got everyone interested in the first place, I just think it prevents wider use and is easily (technically, not politically / socially) dealt with by applying some basic economic principles.",cryptocurrency

bonds,I guess it depends on what it means to substitute...,"...Obviously a synthetic CDO is not exactly the same thing as a directly mortgage-backed CDO. I think what Eisman was saying was that the synthetic CDOs were effectively a substitute, or perhaps better said, were a functional substitute for the ""regular"" CDOs, because they provided a volume of financial instruments for the CDO manager to charge a fee against. 

While diversification reduces risk, they key point made by Lewis (among others) is that the actual risk was misstated. 

According to the ISDA, the notional value of CDS at the end of 2007 was about $62 trillion. According to the Fed, the value of all first lien residential mortgage loans as of March 2008 was about $10.1 trillion. I know that this is not my primary field of expertise, but I can't quite understand how one justifies having $10.1 trillion in assets insured for $62 trillion. Someone with a principal residence worth $400,000 couldn't get an insurance policy that would pay out 6 times that amount; the insurer would pay what it took to rebuild your house (or some variation on that). Last year, thinking about this same topic, I asked our homeowner's insurance agent why I couldn't overstate the value of my house. He smiled and said, ""Moral hazard.""",finance
personalfinance,"Pay taxes quarterly for Independent contractor, or?","I recently started a new job and at this juncture, 100% of my income is via independent contracting. After doing some research, it appears that I might need to be making quarterly payments towards my income tax since my employer does not take those taxes each paycheck. I mentioned this to her, however she made a comment that, “It’s nearly impossible to stop paying taxes quarterly once you start” so that freaked me out a bit. I was actually under the impression I was required to. I’m trying to save money (student loans like the rest of the country) and I am not sure my life necessitates an accountant yet, but maybe so? If it helps, I live in Texas. No state income taxes here, only federal. 

Two fold question: 
1. Does the government really have you “on the hook” once you start paying taxes quarterly? Or can you adjust your quarterly payments easily? The only reason I’m concerned about this is that my income can vary quite rapidly quarter-to-quarter. I mean like potentially $4000-$5000 swing. (That’s a lot for me, ha). 

2. Do I have to pay quarterly? Or can I pay once a year?",finance
personalfinance,Stop 401k contributions to get e-fund faster?,"Wondering if, in keeping in line with the prime directive of how to handle money, I should suspend my 401k contributions (7% or about 50-70 USD a week) in order to build up my emergency fund quicker. I currently have an e-fund of $1639 and want to get it to a minimum of $4500 (3 months fixed expenses) but ideally around $6000 (4 months expenses). I don't think I'll need much more than that as I don't think it will be hard to find a job that pays what I currently make and mostly because my job is pretty secure.

Currently, I'm able to save $560 a month with no OT. I can save upwards of $1,000/mo if I do a lot of OT (and stay disciplined by not spending it). This is not including the 7% I put into my 401k. (Btw, my 401k is matched 50 cents to the dollar up to 6% of my ""annual salary."" I invest in the MM S&amp;P 500 Index [Northern Trust]).

Once the e-fund is complete I'm wondering if I should pay down more on my student loan or start saving for my next car ($12-$15k) for when my current, already paid off, car goes to crap and to beef up the emergency fund. Or do I put enough in the 401k to max the employer match while still saving for future car/house/bigger e-fund?

Honestly I'm having trouble understanding the interest rate in my student loan. I pay on one account but each loan has its own interest rate? Do I just take the average interest rate of the following?

personalfinance,My mom's finances are in major trouble because she can't stop buying things for orphaned kids. Can I ask you guys for some advice?,"My mom: 

**TL;DR (up top) My 66 year old mom makes about 41k per year and has about $21k in credit card debt from buying gifts for family and toys for orphaned children. She was an orphan in an eastern European country growing up so she's got a soft spot for kids. How do I help her dig her way out of this one?**


* Age: **66 turning 67 this year.** 
* Base Gross Salary  **41,664** (worked in the same company for 41 years.)
* Monthly Gross avg. *$3472
*Monthly Net post taxes etc. avg **$2440**

* 401k: **$80k** (currently putting about 10% with company matching up to 6%.)

**Thoughts and Questions On My Mom's Situation**

1. **STOP USING ALL CREDIT CARDS IMMEDIATELY** (She hasn't even spent most of that money on herself. It's almost all been on gifts for family and donations to orphaned children groups. She doesn't keep any of the receipts so I can't write them off as donations etc. ) I have recommended that she finds other, less expensive ways to help the kids. By volunteering and donating time. Her broken english makes it a bit hard, but I'm working on ways to help her fulfil her desires to help others in a non self-destructive manner.

2. Of the $4,000 in savings, use $2,000 to immediately clear off Retail Credit Cards 4-7. Is this a good idea? 

3. ?? Should she get a loan for the remaining (approx) $19k in debt. That way she could pay off all of these high interest credit cards and replace them with one monthly payment but wit (hopefully) a lower interest rate? 

4. She wants to dip into her social security and start collecting payments while she continues to work. That way she can use that money to pay off the debt while she continues making an income. Is this even allowed or recommended?

5. At her age, she is eligible to dip into the 401K money. Is this a good idea? 

6. My mom has broken english and frankly has no concept of what an interest rate is. What are the odds that I, as her 30 year old son, can take on the retail credit card companies and find a way to negotiate her debt down? Is this a valid strategy that works? She isn't in collections and is actually in great standing with all of them. How much time does this take usually. I obviously have my own family and job to take care of but I want to make sure I can help my mom as well. 
Should I contact a debt negotiating service on her behalf? 

7. Any other ideas, recommendations, advice are welcome.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay to fix my broken car or not?,"My wife and I were JUST getting on board with the Dave Ramsey plan, and were about to get started saving $1000 of emergency savings. Today we found out that I have a blown head gasket on my 12 year old Hyundai Tucson, after spending quite a bit to replace a broken radiator which turned out to be a symptom and not the cause of all this mess. The cost to repair the vehicle would be around $1700, which is ON TOP of the c.$500 I already spent on a new radiator.  KBB on the vehicle is $2310, and total repair costs will total $2300; not to mention the costs of any other gremlins that might turn up, which I'm deathly afraid may happen.  My  wife and I are considering taking out a loan from her 401K at 4.75% to either get the vehicle repaired, or pay off the car loan for our other vehicle, which has an interest rate of 12% ($7600 balance), and pay that off faster and with a lower monthly payment. Frankly, we have no idea what to do, or where to move. 

There is no feasible way for us to go to just one car (We SERIOUSLY considered it), and the mechanic needs to know soon what we want to do, and we don't have an answer.

investing,Buy coconuts instead of gold?,"Please give this some serious thought before you let your knee-jerk reaction makes you say that it’s a retarded idea. 

Premise 1) Safe drinking water will be in shorter supply 

Premise 2) Land will be more expensive due to overpopulation/ land prices tend to rise. 

Premise 3) oil prices will rise- this will increase transport costs and hence contribute to increase in food costs. 

Not sure how tax cuts, higher debt (which we may not be able to repay), higher interest rates, will affect this trade. 

I don’t want to buy gold because it’s inherently worthless and it has value because people give it value. Might as well buy crypto if I’m going down that road. 

Hence, coconuts. However, it would be a difficult task to find a broker who will let me do this so might as well invest in wheat or soybeans or something. (Maybe avoid food produced in red state areas due to risk of tarrifs for China. But that’s only a short term problem so not really a concern). 

The reason I took coconuts is that it has a high water content and might be seen as an alternative to drinking water in the future for developing areas/ areas with water crisis.",finance

personalfinance,Setting ourselves up financially for children,"Hello Personal Finance!

My wife and I are trying to save funds up to have children.  I am trying to get some advice on how to best prepare ourselves, as we have no idea what we will be getting ourselves into.  

To begin by giving a little background, my wife and I are both 26 years old, and we each make roughly 48k a year from our main jobs and about 5k a year from side jobs.  To give a rough financial picture of our current debts/expenses:

Home-~$1500/month (year 2 of a 30 year mortgage)
Student Loan Debt-~$15,000
2 Car Payments- Total $500/month-will both be paid off by next July
Credit Card Debt- $0

Outside of that our expenses are just general things like utilities, food, car insurance, entertainment etc.  We are both savers so we don't go over the top on anything.

We currently have $25k in savings earning a 1.5% interest rate and $20k in checking (Total $45k liquid cash).  I contribute to a 401k to get the max match and Roth IRA, and my wife has a pension through her job.  We have decent Term Life policies as well.  

The question is, what recommendations do you have to best prepare ourselves to have kids?  We are looking to have kids within the next 3 years, and where it gets tricky is that my wife really would like to stay home with kids at least until they get to school age.  That would mean we would be losing her salary which will have increased to roughly 52k by the time we would be having kids.  I make 48k now, but I do have an MBA and work with a company that has decent opportunity for growth, so I do project I will be making hopefully at minimum 60k by the third year, but that is a pure estimate and don't want to rely on that number.  

My current goal is to pay off the cars, which would be done soon, and then rolling what was being paid on the cars to the student loans, to get rid of as much debt as possible, while also hitting the mortgage hard as well.  The only thing is that we have the $45k liquid right now and I almost feel as if I could be using that money elsewhere to better position ourselves so that losing her salary in 3 years would not hurt as much with the expenses of a child being added into that.

Thanks for the future advice!",finance

personalfinance,Should I get a new savings account?,"Hello. I am 20 years old and a student. I have a $11/ hour job I mostly just work weekends and breaks. I have a Discover IT student credit card, a Chase checking account with around 2k in it, and a Union bank savings account which I have around 5k in. I transfer $50-100 a week from my checking account to my savings, plus 75% of any gift money I receive. I have had a savings with them since I was 5, while my account was converted to a student account rather than a minor account a year ago. I am not really sure what the interest rate is at it says ""variable interest rate"" on their website, but I have gotten 9 cents interest paid to me like every 3 moths. My discover credit card is great, and so is my checking. I don't pay any fees for my checking  or savings because I am a student, and have a lot of ATM access to add cash to it, though I will switch the day they start charging me monthly. I am considering getting an online savings account because they have more interest. Would this be worth it to do? I have been looking at a couple and have looked at Ally at 1.45%, Discover at 1.5%, American express high yield at 1.55%, and Synchrony at 1.55%. I don't want to have any fees. I have heard good things about ally on this subreddit, and not as many good things about the Synchrony, but ally seems to have lowest interest of these. I will mostly deposit money into it simply by transferring from my Chase checking account. 


I rarely use cash, so not having physical store isn't huge deal for me. If I want to deposit cash, I can just put into my Chase checking, then transfer to the bank. I have withdrawn cash from my bank a total of 1 time in my lifetime, but in the case I would ever want to, it seems ally and synchrony give me an ATM card to withdraw if I ever need to for free from certain ATM, while the Discover and Amex don't?  Ally has a no fee ATM very close to me while Synchrony has only one sort of close, but with a fee. Thought they do give you up to $5 ATM fees back. I Know I could transfer to my Chase, then deposit, but that would be slow. I think in a super rare situation I would want cash, I would not want to wait 3-5 business days. Though really, I have access to a closeby ATM for my checking, so I doubt this all really matters as I almost never use cash, and am more likely to deposit into my account more than I withdraw. Should I just choose Amex or synchrony because higher interest, or will the 1.55% not be worth it over the 1.45% over small possibility I will want to withdraw cash? Should access to an ATM be important, especially if I have a debit card anyways? I am pretty sure I could survive without the ATM, though I am thinking of it potentially being helpful in some situation.  Which savings account will be the best for me? I am also open to any other suggestion.  Also, should I close my Union bank account if I switch, transfer half of my 5k only, or keep only a small portion in it? Would there be a benefit to keeping it open? I would appreciate any advice or suggestion.",finance

financialindependence,Would anyone be interested in a Government FIRE subreddit?,"I created /r/govfire with the thought that a government employee centered subreddit may be helpful. While many of our benefits correlate with private sector benefits, often times getting the right answers can be confusing to both the government employee and the 'civilian' trying to help out.  

My hope is to not spread the community too thin by drilling down too specifically, however a subreddit that allows local, and federal government employees, contractors, and military to ask very specific questions in a group of similar individuals may be beneficial.  

Topics can include, but aren't limited to: TSP, Military pensions and the new blended retirement system, FERS, how to get into government contracting, contracting overseas, local government and municipalities, union help, and so on.

Is there any interest? The sub has been created, but is obviously empty.  Please feel free to join if you'd like to take part, or DM me if you have any ideas you'd like to share / or help moderate. 

Edit: Looks like we had enough people sub to go forward with it, we'll try it out for a month or so and see how it goes. If it takes off, I'll look into having the Mods here sidebar link us.

Question is, where to park this money for the time being?  I'd like it to be easily accessible, and also not plugged in to the market.  Safe, secure place.  

Also would not like to just shove it into my credit union, as they have terrible savings account interest rate.  Current bank is Navy Federal Credit Union.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loan with the highest interest?,"Hi guys, first time posting here. But I see a lot of good advice so I'm hoping to get some opinions.

I was never aggressive with my student loans after graduating (been out since Spring 2013 and paying since Fall 2013).  My payment has been about $235/month since the beginning. I have several different loans (ranging from 2.2k to 3.5k) with varying interest rates.  My highest interest rate loan is 5.75% but incidentally it also has the lowest balance (less than 2.3k).

I have more than enough money to pay it off in savings and would still leave me with at least 3 months of bills in savings/emergency fund.  I'm really considering paying off this highest interest loan. The reason I've come to you guys for advice is because I'm also planning to buy a house next spring, and that $2300 I'm sure would come in handy.


My estimated payoff dates with the minimum payment is something like January 2024, but if I pay off this highest interest loan I could continue to pay the same amount each month and put that extra money from the paid off loan into the next highest interest loan. Are there any tips you guys would give me for paying these loans off effectively? Is knocking out the highest interest loan a good idea?",finance

I’m a relatively new fed and finally got around to allocating my funds from the default to the individual funds. I really don’t know much about TSP.

personalfinance,Let it get repo'd?,"I have a loan on a truck through westlake financial. Long story short, i scrounged up 1000 to spend on transport and couldn't find anything remotely dependable in that price range, so i bought a 2002 Ford f150 from a low credit dealership. Now i pay $288.51 a month with a 22.5 interest rate and 177 a month for insurance for this thing on a roughly 2000/mo(takehome) income. I made the purchase in October of 2016.

Fast forward to now. My wife and i have a scheduled c section this Friday to welcome our second (and last) into the world and she left her job a few weeks ago so of course i shoulder all financial burden.  I have roughly 1100 in fixed expenses aside from the stupid truck, so in short i can't really reasonably afford it.  I never could, but with my wife working we made it work. 

I'm as upside down as it gets on this thing. The payoff is too high to sell and get out from under it. It's at 225k miles, approaching mileage where nobody's gonna buy it regardless of condition and what kbb says.  Refinancing is not an option. I've spoken with the bank, and with my credit and the disparity between the payoff and vehicle value, I'm at the end of the road. I think my choices are narrowed  down to give it back, stop making payments and wait for repo, or commit insurance fraud. 

So my question is essentially do i have any other reasonable options? Probably not, so should i take the truck back to the dealer or just let it get reposessed?",finance
personalfinance,$28k debt with poor credit score - how to tackle,"Hi! I was hoping for some advice on how to help pay off credit card debt that's been hanging over my head for years. I have approximately $28K in credit card debt. I make $1100 in minimum payments per month, and have budgeted an additional $500 I can now put towards this debt. I used mint.com to calculate how long the pay off would be, which would be almost 5 years and accruing nearly $12k in interest. The interest rates on the cards vary from 12-20%. My credit score is 620, simply for the reason of high credit usage. I have a 13 year history of on time payments, no accounts in collections, etc. I've considered getting a loan but with my poor score not sure that it would help. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance

I really don't know what else to say because I haven't talked to them, but my mom wants me to search and see if it is legit.

personalfinance,Contacted by debt collector about a supposed 9 year old debt. How do I protect my credit rating?,"A debt collector contacted me about a cable bill debt from 9 years ago. I asked for proof, and they provided the address where I lived at the time of the collection.

I think I should pay this in full. It's not a large sum. If I do this, how do I protect my credit rating?

* Update:  I contacted the attorney.  The debt is small, between $100 and 200.  The attorney said it's likely a scam, given the small amount and elapsed time.  The attorney did state that if it's not a scam, it likely constitutes a written agreement, which holds a 10-year statute.  Attorney said to have them call her if they attempt to contact me again or if I see a negative activity on my credit report.

CryptoCurrency,How to tell people are pretty bad at DYOR,"Hey, I just noticed that recently there is a lot of drama about Verge. 
A lot of people are calling it a scam or whatever. This part, I do agree, the latest event are very dodgy.

What I also read is a lot of people claiming that Verge is a dogecoin fork. 
This is simply wrong. Verge was indeed named as Dogecoin dark and they rebranded as verge after. 
The reason the dev team called their coin dogecoin dark is not because they forked the chain off dogecoin (like bitcoin cash), or forked the project and started a whole new chain (litecoin), but they wrote the codebase from scratch and wanted to make an homage to dogecoin, hence calling their own coin, dogecoin something. 

Jackson palmer, the creator of dogecoin made a video yesterday ( https://youtu.be/KlYPzseauVU )and at 9:20,he talk about about verge and confirm it is NOT a fork. 

Now, I wonder if people call out verge as being a fork of dogecoin because it used to be called dogecoin dark, how much of their « own research » is wrong? How does this impact the market as a whole and actually means a lot of people think they bought something knowing what’s up, but in actuality just read it on reddit by some other guy posting wrong information and them making the wrong decision afterwards. 

In my opinion, this is one of the reason the market is down. A lot of people think they have done their research properly, but they were fed wrong intel and they are taking that as face value (member reddit shills?). 
I am not saying that reddit is not a good source of info, but I find it people are so stubborn about what they think and have very rigid opinion on everything. Calling all bad news fud is not going to save your coin from tanking. In this market, you need to be good enough to take all bits of information and check them. Not just take the bits of information you like and spread them everywhere without even fact checking anything.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Cox keeps sending me to collections for $30 that I'm not responsible for and has dropped my credit score by over 50 points,"Hey Reddit thanks in advance for the help. Back in October 2017 I noticed a derogatory mark on my credit score from Cox Cable sending me to collections for $30. I called Cox and spoke to a representative, it turns out it was a $30 charge for a monthly payment for an account which was closed 3 years ago. We moved from that house in July 2015 and paid off and cancelled all accounts linked to that address the day we moved. The rep was confused of the charge since all accounts must be paid off before closing, so he completed paperwork sent it in to higher management and told me to follow up in 2 weeks for a solution. 2 weeks later called back, spoke to a different rep who told me he was also confused for this charge and red flagged cox for this incident. He believed it was Cox's fault for charging me for an already closed account. Checked on the status of the order, he needed to fill more out and to keep checking back for a status. Called back in December and was told by a rep that everything has been closed and taken care of, that this was Cox's mistake. Checked my credit report and there showed the closed account. 

Fast forward to today, to a notification saying my score has dropped 50 pts, checked credit karma and there it showed the Cox collection open again, since January apparently! Called Cox multiple times today only to get very unhelpful and rude reps, one even told me that it was closed and reopened because I filed bankruptcy? I've never declared bankruptcy, explained to the rep as how they can assume such thing, her response, ""that's what you told us, but the only way to erase this is to pay. I'm just the financial person"". I was furious, and asked to transfer to a manager. The manager was again extremely rude and unhelpful, even hung up on me while she had me on hold. I waited patiently for a call back, 30 minutes later I hear back from a completely different person. He told me he was told to tell me I just had to make a payment and he was there to collect it. Again, I explained the whole issue to him and all he kept telling me is ""the last form was never sent in, cox shouldve transfered the charge over to the new account, and all you could do is make a payment. I really wish I can remove this for you, but my supervisor is opposed to that"". I hung up there. 

It is just $30, I can easily pay this off, but I refuse to pay this after being told by Cox reps repeatedly that this is their mistake. It's upsetting that I am being penalized because of their mistake! 

I'm completely fed up with this company and nobody over the phone is helping me out. What are my options here to fight back Cox and get some Justice here? I need to protect my credit score, but I want to do this the right way and not give in to their sketchy business practices.",finance

personalfinance,Is it ever worth taking student loans?,"Long time lurker... thank you PF for helping me reduce my CC debt and have proper savings. Now I’d like some personal advice on loans.

 

I am 29. I would like to get my bachelor’s degree as soon as possible as my $38k/year job with a 4 hour commute is making me more and more depressed; applying elsewhere will either yield me with minimum wage or rejection because I lack a degree. I have 11 years of work experience, 6 as a manager. With a 4-year degree, I would double my current income AND have the opportunity to advance into a proper career.

 

I have been approved to take classes at a CC in the fall. I do not qualify for Pell Grants as my income in 2016 surpasses the threshold so my options are to either

 

a) work full-time and take a few classes when possible or

b) rely on scholarships, savings, and loans and go to school full-time. 

 

I am guaranteed to transfer to a state university IF I follow the recommended path. I will need to complete 60 units, which could take me anywhere between 2-4 years before I could transfer.

 

FAFSA approved me for a direct Stafford loan of $9500 at 4.6% interest. While I’m aware the rates are not accurate, student loans through CreditKarma show I can get variable loans with interest rates as low as 2.5% (3.5% for fixed).

 

I have paid and subscribed to scholarship resources (scholly, Fastweb, grantwatch, etc) and many require students to be full-time for eligibility. While options are limited, I have already been awarded $3,000 from applying, so I’m feeling more and more inclined to be a full-time student if I’ve already been awarded this much this quickly.....

 

I know r/personalfinance leans towards NO when it comes to loans.... but for my sanity, would it be wise for me to take a few loans and be a full-time student so I can finish quickly, or should I prolong the process to leave with as little debt in the end?

 

Some financial background:

- CC utilization is around 9%

- 2.5k in CC debt (0% interest until August 2019, with automatic payments at $175/month) and 4.2K left on my car ($200/month)

- FICO score of 762 from recent CC bill

- 6k in savings

 

TLDR I’m 29, depressed, with no future. Do I go to school full-time and rely on scholarships and loans, or go part-time with little to no loans but finish school by the time I’m 35?",finance

personalfinance,"Home remodel, which is better?","Hello,

I'm looking at some basic information for a home equity loan to remodel my kitchen (about 20k).  I can safely put 10k from my savings into this but...
To get a home equity loan, I'd need to likely get an appraisal (around $500), then at least $100 for a loan origination fee, and likely another $200-400 in miscellaneous fees.

Let's say I can get a 3.5% interest rate, and the plan is to pay this loan off by end of year or early next year. I'd be paying 1k up front to get the loan and then interest over the next 8 months would make it around $145) or 1145 in total...

The other option is to put all 20k on a credit card that pays 2% in points @ 19.49%  I'd still be putting 10k down immediately so only 10k would stay on the card.  I'd get $400 in free points and 10k on credit I'd probably try to pay that off in 5 months.  
$162.4 the first month
$130 the second month
$97.5 the third month
$65 the 4th month
$32.5 the 5th or 487.4.

Essentially, this route I'd save myself $500 in cash plus I'd make at least $400 in points so it comes out a wash.


Notes:

I fully own my house/car, so I don't have a mortgage or any other bills besides utilities.  I can put 2k a month towards paying off the ""loan"" as I paid off the house last year, this was what I was paying to rapidly pay off the mortgage.

I wouldn't have to have a hard credit check (I've got 4-5 credit checks in the last 3 years).

personalfinance,Maximizing Savings/Retirement vs. Student Loans,"So I'll be entering my first position and I'll be making roughly $75,000 ($54,000-56,000 after taxes). Being that I'm still living at home and will be remaining on my parents medical insurance, I thought this gives me the opportunity to either take advantage of getting rid of my loans entirely in one year. The other option is spreading it out in order to maximize contributions to savings and retirement, say 2-4 years. Spreading it out would let me save more in both retirement and savings, but as of now the only thing I want to build-up is my emergency fund from the 1,000 its at now. And I don't have any desire to own a home at least for now. I do have plans to pursue a Masters in my field in the near future.

I currently have $31,000 in loans at an average 4.15% interest rate with 4 months until payments kick in. Otherwise, no debt on credit or car.

I already plan on maxing my Roth. My employer contributes 2% off the bat and then an additional 50% of 6% of salary post one year. I may just still contribute the 6% so I am already used to it and not ""needing"" that money and it would put me at 13% saved just on Roth and meeting the match on its own.

I'm just curious if it would be better to buckle down and just beat the loan in a year (but be wonderful psychologically) or spread it out and contribute more towards retirement and savings and future education/car/home.

personalfinance,New Uber card too good to be true?,"Having overlooked offers like the Sallie Mae MasterCard, I am a little concerned that the new Uber card will be nerfed or at least downgraded with caps or less benefits (phone coverage and no FTF).

This fits my travel plans perfectly as I am simply looking for a starter travel card that still has strong cash back options. I also want a third credit card as the basis of my credit history. I currently have the DIscover It Student and the BCE as I see these cards as long term added value cards that I would likely use even ten years down the road.

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Plan Review [With Pictures],"I'm about to graduate here in May, and I'm planning my on how I want to go about paying off the deferred interest before it capitalizes, which happens in December of this year. My fiancee is also graduating next year, and her loans are quite a bit more with higher interest rates, so I'd like some advice on how to go about paying off the most bang for my buck. This is only talking about avoiding capitalization, as my strategy changes once repayment becomes necessary and I consolidate.

I do not plan on consolidating until after they enter repayment, as all the accrued interest becomes payable right then as opposed to in December.

Could you give me some advice?

Here's my student loan spread which comes into repayment this year: https://i.imgur.com/0F7oxuW.png

And this is hers: https://i.imgur.com/EjjrtLX.png

My current plan is to pay off my unsub loans as they have been accruing the longest, and then the student loans with the highest annual cost. Is this the correct way to go about it?

Looking at hers, I do not know the interest rate for unsub (although i could look it up at some point) but the private is so much higher I planned on beginning to pay those down asap, but only after mine are paid before capitalizing.

Although reddit always gives *stellar* relationship advice, I don't need any of it for this.

personalfinance,How do I pay private student loans during school?,"Some academic information for my situation: I recently turned 18 and will be ""beginning"" my college term in the Summer.

I have 34 credits out of my 60 required for CC, and after CC, I will transfer to a 4-year, but I still need loans for CC. 


So I completed the FAFSA, and by no surprise to me, I'm not eligible for any federal aid as my parents earn too much (EFC is at around 20k, however, they can't help me pay for any of it). I've looked into private loans since I'll need money, but from what I've seen, you have to make monthly payments even when you're in school.

My thought process is that I am fairly young so I think I can make it up over the years, I will be able to avoid loan interest and the 10% early withdrawal fee, and I could probably get a tax credit if I do the traditional IRA. I am also super stressed about money, and all the random jobs I’m doing are both distracting me from my school work and not bringing in enough money to cover my expenses.

My question is, does this plan make sense? Are there downsides I’m not seeing? And if it makes sense should I go with a traditional or Roth IRA? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,$7k missing from our refund check; find out IRS applied it to delinquent student loan debt my husband never mentioned. Help?,"Hi PF, 
I'm a new poster here but really respect the advice I've read here over the years and thought I should put this dilemma to you all. TL;DR at bottom.

**Background info:**
My husband and I (married less than a year) filed jointly for the first time this year. We bought a house and had solar installed, and were supposed to get a big tax return due, in part, to a rebate from our solar.

Right now due to our mortgage, property taxes, a few unforseen expenses, and a salary increase falling through, we live pretty much paycheck to paycheck. While we make enough to cover our monthly expenses, we have no significant savings to speak of and I don't get paid 1-2 months out of the year due to my line of work. An emergency could really ruin us financially for a while. We are getting better about budgeting and cutting down our spending wherever possible, but right now we make just enough to cover bills, mortgage, insurances, etc without going full rice and beans for every meal.

My family's finances are complicated so we filed through their CPA who told us to expect nearly $11k in tax returns. We were ecstatic thinking, for the first time in our lives, we'd have a good sized emergency fund and planned to put it in a separate savings account and not to touch it. 

We received the refund check and it was painfully below what we were expecting. $7,750 short to be exact. I ask the CPA who says it's possible someone had outstanding debts. I was shocked because I monitor my credit and accounts like a hawk. He said we should expect a letter explaining where the money went. The letter arrived and said the money was applied to a delinquent balance through the Department of Education. I called them for more information and found out my husband owed nearly $8k for a student loan from 2009 he never mentioned and it's still not paid off in full (about $217 left to pay until it's wiped out). I won't know much more about the loan (like interest rate, previous payments, etc) until we receive the loan history from them in the mail in two weeks.

When the husband got home, I asked him about it and he said he thought he had it on a deferment. But defer only means put off...it doesn't go away. I know he wasn't great with money as a young guy - there have been other financial details of his past I've had to pry out of him that greatly hurt his credit, but we've been working through that. I thought we were good. I was furious that he seemed to have just forgotten about this debt, and didn't really have plans to tell me about it or address it. But here we are.

He said he thinks his mom signed him up for the loans, or at least helped, and it's possible he lost track of it when he moved to a different state over 5 years ago, and eventually got a new number, although they still had his correct email address on file.

**Main question:**
Apparently if the debt belongs solely to one partner, the injured partner can file to get their portion of the refund back. However, if I do that and get the money back, his debt would still unpaid and will be hanging over our heads. Should I just accept this as a wash, easy come easy go, and be grateful the majority of his debt is now paid and behind us? Or do I fight to get that money back to have an emergency fund and make him pay on his loan debt monthly? Is it better to be relatively debt free and paycheck to paycheck, or have an emergency fund with way higher debt and monthly bills? 

PF, please tell me we can get through this, and if you have any suggestions for the tax return situation, I'm all ears. I tried to include as much relevant background info as I could without oversharing, but if there are details needed to give advice, please ask and I'll do my best to answer if it doesn't get too personally identifying. Sorry for the wall of text and for any typos, I'm typing on mobile.

**TL;DR**
Expected big tax refund, turns out IRS took nearly $8k to pay for husband's delinquent student loan debt he never told me about. Do I file to get that money back to have as an emergency fund and make him pay monthly on the loan, or call it a wash and be grateful the debt is paid?",finance

personalfinance,"State (CO) tax payment hasn't withdrawn from bank, when to worry and who best to contact?","So I filed my taxes back in February using TurboTax.  I ended up owing a little bit extra to the feds and a large bit to the state of Colorado.  I set up payment through TurboTax using direct debit from my checking account, with a ""date of withdrawal"" of April 9th. I figured I'd rather keep the cash on hand until a week before the due date.

Fast forward to this week.  Monday was the 9th, and sure enough there was an ACH Withdrawal from ""USATAXPYMT"" for the amount of my remaining owed federal taxes.

But nothing shows up for my state payment.  Same for Tuesday.  Same for this morning.  I double-checked my return saved from TurboTax, and there's the sheet for my state ""balance due"" with the correct direct debit information (identical to federal).

Checking the state's revenue website, it is showing my account with a balance due of the expected amount.  Checking my bank account online shows no transaction; either completed or pending.

So, the payment deadline is next week.  Should I:

1. Just let this go, under the assumption that it'll work out at some point.  If payment doesn't post by the deadline, what would be the consequences?
2. Follow up with TurboTax?  I've assumed they were the agent handling the timing / processing of the payment, but maybe they already handed that off?
3. Follow up with the Colorado department of Revenue?  Maybe there's just a backlog on processing payments?
4. Follow up with my bank?

I could obviously pay through the state's website, but then I worry about getting ""double debited"" if TurboTax's payment then suddenly processes, and having to jump through hoops to get things squared away.  The amount in question is about $950, so it's something I only want to send off once.

EDIT TO UPDATE:  Thanks for the feedback. It looks like I'll give it a few more days, maybe following up with Colorado revenue if nothing seems to be happening by the weekend.

FINAL UPDATE (2018/4/12): Just in case anyone comes past this, I wanted to say that the CO tax payment cleared as of this morning.  So I should've just calmed down and given them 2-3 business days to process payment. :)",finance

personalfinance,IWTL How do I start to love money?,"Hello everyone!

If you can give me some advice, that would be great.
I want to learn how to start to love money? As is, per se.

I was sitting the other night and tried to weigh all those classic incentives that make us move forward.

Health - yes, to some degree

Family - no, zero interest in that

Children - no, I'm childfree

Social respect - no

Self-education and growth - yes

Money - yes

But it seems that I have that ""impostor syndrome"" deep inside that stops me from making more money. I come from a family - somewhere in between of middle class. And while we were able to afford many things, my dad kept on saying ""Money is hard to get. There is 6 billion people on this planet that wake up every morning and they think how to survive and take your cut away from you"".
I think its the worst thing that you can teach your kids...

And when I grew up, there were bright days when I could make a real good amount of money - tens of keys - but I couldnt jump higher. This doctrine still holds me back.

If you've completed your trip from rags to riches, and if you have had similar negative indoctrination, how did you fight it?

And yes, I want to focus on money only. And getting new connections, thats my exclusive goal.

personalfinance,Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan affecting DTI,"So I am currently looking to get a personal loan of $2,500 to cover the rest of a motorcycle purchase (I currently have $1,000 from selling my previous bike).

personalfinance,"If I am self-employed, do my expenses count against my total federal income tax, or only the self-employment tax?","If I understand correctly, if I am a self-employed individual, I pay my federal income tax on my income (let's say about 15%), state income tax, and then I also pay about another approx. 15% toward self-employment tax (the part that would normally be paid by an employer). Am I correct on that so far?  
  
Of course, the benefit is that I can use expenses to count against my income. Therefore, my questions is: Do those expenses change how my federal and state income tax is calculated, or is that always based on income regardless of expenses? Do expense write-offs count only toward self-employment tax, or toward all tax?  
  
To ask it one more way: am I paying state and federal income tax on my earnings before or after expenses and write-offs?",finance
personalfinance,"Upside down on an auto loan with high interest, but my credit has vastly improved. What are my options?","Last February, I purchased a car from a dealership that helps people with bad credit. It's a 2012 Kia Forte Hatchback. They're charging me up the butt for it, with an interest rate of 22% because at the time my credit was around 590. Not the best decision, but it was an act of desperation. 

Fast forward a year, and I've done quite a bit to improve my situation. Namely, my credit score has gone up to 700. However, the dealership won't refinance because it's against their policy. Makes sense because they're making thousands of dollars on the interest they're charging me. I still owe $10k on the car and it's worth $3000-5000, if I'm being generous.  I bank with a local credit union and tried to refinance with them, but was denied because of how much I still owe on the loan. 

My question is, what are my options? Should I try to refinance through another company? Buy a new car from a more reputable dealership? I'm happy that my credit score has gone up so much, and would really like to use it to save me a couple hundred bucks a month on my car payment, and maybe even end up in a better car.",finance

personalfinance,Getting Married: Joint and/or Separate Finances (US),"Reaching out to PF to help discuss the various approaches to finances leading up to marriage, and also while married.

She is moving in with me in June 2018, so her rent will drop off, and her bills will decrease somewhat.  Questions are: 1) should we combine bank accounts, keep them separate, or a combination of the two? 2) how can we best maximize our savings given our financial information below? 3) what, if any, protections should we consider if we plan to purchase a home prior to marriage? 

Any help PF can lend is much appreciated.

27, and I currently only have 1 line of credit open. (I should note My credit is in the 760s, and this is the only credit card I have had for a year and a half.)

How will the banks look at this?",finance
personalfinance,Determining value of Municipal Job,"I am in my seventh year working for a local (big) city in a semi-professional admin position and make around $94k/year with three more step increases until I top out at $100k. I read a post yesterday from someone who has double the years I have but is sick of the daily grind. I feel the same way that this job does not have much challenge to it and I am bored for most of the day. Many replies told the OP to stick it out until early or full retirement with pension. I am in my mid thirties and can retire early at age 55, so only 20 more years to go. From what I read, pensions are not guaranteed based on financials of the city. I do not contribute to any other retirement fund, only personal savings.

I am conflicted because I know there are always greener pastures from my present reality but I feel working a private sector job has more value proposition to it (higher earning potential) but also longer hours and more expectations. I have a wife who watches our toddler full time, and we live in a very HCOL neighborhood (high rent). I cannot save anything and we live paycheck to paycheck. The upside to my job is I have a lot of spare time where I can research hobbies and work on my masters program in an unrelated field. I do not work any OT and it is generally not available in my current line of work. My goal is to be financially independent within 10 years from real estate investing, it seems difficult to invest locally since properties do not cash flow well here. Moving or investing out of county/state may be an option. I value my time with my family the most. If I was to continue working for someone else I want to work from home in the field of my masters program, or find a government job working from home to continue vesting into my pension. I am looking for advice on whether to stick it out, or pursue my goals, or if I am whining and making excuses and need to suck it up.

Looking at my paystub, is this a normal breakdown for a government job:

11% Retirement
13% Fed
3.5% State
1.5% Medicare
1% Union Dues
5% Benefits (Health, Dental, Life Ins)

That is 35% of my paystub for upkeep, leaving me with around $60k. 
Thanks everyone.",finance

personalfinance,How to calculate how much you end up paying on a mortgage?,"Hello, I'm doing a report in a class about how building credit is beneficial, and one point I'm trying to use is mortgages and rates. Assuming you can do 20% down and not pay PMI, how do you calculate how much you would have paid at the end of a mortgage. Just for a basic example let's say $300,000. 

Also what I'm trying to find but haven't been successful at all in is what the window is for interest rates. I'm not so much wanting to know what the average rate is, but more like the usual difference between the highest rate you can get and the lowest rate you can get from the same lender. 

I hope I explained that clearly enough!",finance
personalfinance,Pay off 0% loan or keep paying note for 3 years?,"I have $13k in the bank. Checking and savings account. I pay $500/month (principal only, I pay 0 interest) on my 2015 model car. I also mandatory save $500 a month and put that into my savings account and pretend it's a bill. 

My payoff on my car is now $10k. I have a little over 13k cash right now (after bills payed for next month too). There is also no penalty for paying it off early. 

Adding the $500 + another $630 bill (last month of that) would add an extra $1100 to savings account. Putting me at ~6 months when my account goes back to what it was (around 13k), which is my cash comfort zone.

Once my cash is back up to where I like, I plan on adding $1000 to my mortgage (which is my last debt and has a 3.5% interest rate). 

Is this wise? Or should I keep paying the car note to the end of the loan?

I don't plan on making any crazy purchases, I have a nice budget that includes a lot of things that can (and will) come up, my job is still steady. So not many risks that I can see.",finance
personalfinance,Pay off debt on investment property?,"My mother quietly bought a building years ago on which she took out what amounts of basically a credit card loan as a mortgage (~15% interest).  She ended up pouring after-tax cash into the property make it rentable.  It was a terrible purchase and she didn't know what she was doing so it took a long time and a lot of money to put it in good shape.

Fast forward to today, the property is generating about $4500 in rent and the mortgage is roughly $1500.  Recently she has come into enough money to pay off the mortgage entirely.  I think it's the right thing to do because the interest rate is so high and it's hard to imagine, even with the mortgage offsetting rental income, that you can really invest in anything to outperform that mortgage.  Normally I think you want to keep the mortgage because you're getting a leverage advantage, but given the high interest rate, it seems like you can't overcome that advantage.  She has sufficient emergency funds so that's not a big issue.  Am I thinking about this correctly?  Should she pay off the mortgage?",finance
personalfinance,Are these loans financially feasible?,"Current high school senior who pIans on attending the University of Illinois College of Business next fall. I have a lot of AP credits and should only need 2 or 2.5 years to graduate with a Bachelor's in either Finance or Accounting. My question is about my financial aid package. 

The total estimated cost of attendance is $36,000, but I received $21,000 in grants and scholarships which almost exactly covers tuition and all fees directly to the university. However, there is an estimated $15,000 in uncovered costs (mainly room and board as well as supplies). I have a single mother and an EFC of 0, so the costs fall on me. I was offered $3,000 for a federal work study (which I would accept) and thus $12,000 annually in federal loans. Assuming I do graduate early and with only $25-30k in federal loan debt, how financially feasible is this? Will that be a large burden on my own?",finance
personalfinance,25 yr old Master student wondering about paying off bachelors degree debt and investments??,"Basically my question is whether I should pull my investments out and throw them at my student loans or just keep paying my monthly payment(200$) on the loans and keep my investments.

I have 17k in student loans left to repay from my bachelors degree
- 4 loans with interest rates from 3.4-4.5%

I invested about 10k a few years ago and that has steadily been growing every year into the 14k it is now.

I also have 26k in a Roth IRA that I try to contribute to every year.

Is it dumb to invest money when I could use that money to pay off my loans instead? For whatever reason, in my head, investing money and making my monthly payments on my loans is the best strategy but I'm curious for your inputs!",finance

On the other hand, you have people who expect a certain degree of quality and presentation immediately u, and tpon access to a game, who aren't willing to accept any excuses or ""dev-speak"" about why the product ever was allowed to release in such a state to begin with. What ensues tends to be a vicious battle between gaming apologists, and gaming crusaders. Players from the first camp vehemently defend the game, the developer, and the state of the product/service; any criticisms are typically ignored/rejected, and veiled behind the armor of ""It's an early access title."" because they WANT the game to succeed so that it can inevitably get better. Players from the latter camp feel slighted or even ripped off, and aggressively attack the game, the developer, and the state of the product/service; any praise is typically demonized, and people who engage in ""white-knighting"" are typically personally targeted for their blind optimism. They want the game/studio/product/service to fail because they believe that the game lacks a basic respect for gamers, the quality bar expected for the pricetag, and a general ethos.

What we're left with is polarized, toxic communities. We are left with Community Managers who are forced to regurgitate the same tired phrases over and over again to try and placate the most visceral members of the community.

""We hear you, and we're having talks internally about why _________...""

""We understand your frustrations, and currently we are evaluating ________...""

""We never meant to ______, which is why _________...""

We're left with development studios who aren't learning their lessons from their mistakes. We get games that are released in states that are beyond terrible, but exempt from backlash by simply slapping on the ""Early Access"" tag, as if that means anything anymore. We have publishers that don't have a complete game ready for release, but have a fully-structured monetization system in perfect working order. There is such an over-abundance of copy-cats that it is almost an overload to figure which games are genuine efforts, and which ones are quick cash grabs. You can't check the headlines for games in the past year without seeing studio after studio stumble blindly beyond the ""Greed"" line, and nearly every game that comes out nowadays releases in a sub-beta form.

The gaming industry has a problem. We're setting the expectations for fully developed, fully staffed studios at the same levels we set for indie games nowadays. There is no reason for a game like ""Hunt: Showdown"" to come out with server problems that are reminiscent of issues we'd have expected from a game in 2005. There is no reason for a game like ""Radical Heights"" to come out with default textures and janky optimization from a AA studio that has millions of dollars readily available to drive and fund its development costs. There is no reason that a game studio founded by 6 people in their garage with an idea and a budget of under $100,000 should be able to deliver one that is equivalent, or dare I say, superior to a company that has a team of 40+ people and a multi-million dollar budget. For every ""Hellblade"" we get, we also get a game like ""SOS"", and the consequences are visible on nearly every form of social media. For every ""Rimworld"" we are blessed with, we see a ""Metal Gear: Survive"".

There was really a time when Early Access was meant to help smaller studios shield themselves from criticisms and the expectations of a AAA studio. The trend, however, has shifted to just serving as flame-proofing from skeptics and critics alike. I ask, ""Why?"". In a time where we have more choices than ever to buy games, as can be evidenced by simply examining the number of titles released on Steam annually, why are we setting the bar lower? Despite the outcry and outrage we see experienced for platform initiatives like ""Steam Direct"" which has allowed more garbage-tier titles to gain traction than ever before, we make exception after exception for studio shortcomings and a basic quality of life expectation.

Where do you stand? Do you think we have a quality problem within gaming?",technology

personalfinance,About to land a new job but current employer may want to talk about a raise,"So I recently got a job offer which makes almost double what I make now but I'm currently waiting for their HR to call me to collect information; background check etc. The reason I'm taking this leave is that my current employer refused to give any of us raises even though we flipped a good profit in 2017. The senior technicians have warned our boss that if he did not give me the raise I deserved that I would quit.

Couple months later, I finally got fed up with the working conditions and long hours. Subcontractors that they hired to do some projects for us got paid substantially more, $300 to do perform a task while I got $18 to do it. A competitor reached out to me and I went in for an interview, they offered almost double my pay, matching pension, dental, vision, 4-week vacation, etc. 

My current employer called me just now asking me to come in for a 1 on 1 meeting. I'm assuming a raise but I don't want one anymore, nothing a couple dollars can change when my pay has almost doubled and I have way better benefits. What do I say if he were to bring up raises?

I’m a fiber construction project manager, and I transferred to this department (internal) about a year ago. I’d like to hand my unsupportive, hypocritical, and micromanaging supervisor my letter of resignation today before I leave in an hour. There is a chance she will try to make a counter offer and I am not sure how to handle that. I also believe that if I reject a counter offer, I will be walked out because my boss is extremely emotional due to being under an enormous amount of pressure from upper management.

Here is what I’ve done to prepare:

* I’ve read through the PF Employment wiki. 
* I’ve saved all my employment documents and removed personal files from my computer.
* My benefits will stop at the end of the calendar month, and I’m not using the FSA.
* I’ve been with my employer for 9 years and 8 months, so I will keep 100% of my 401k (I even called fidelity to make sure).
* I have used all my “earned” vacation.
* I am writing my letter of resignation after I post this.

I am enrolled as a part time student, and I’m going full time at a university in the fall. I wanted to stay until the end of July (my 10 year anniversary), but this place is too toxic. I have saved, planned, and made lifestyle adjustments to support myself while I’m in school finishing my degree over the next two years. I'm 30, I hate working in telecom, and I'm pursuing a degree in STEM. I have scholarships, grants, personal savings, and I’ll take loans to cover the difference if needed. I'm getting health insurance from the university when I start in the fall.

I've been working with no breaks since I was 15. What advice can you give me? What should I do about health insurance over the next 3 months? Should I submit my letter of resignation today at the end of my shift, or should I wait until tomorrow morning?

**EDIT:** I am going to present my letter of resignation/two weeks notice to my boss as of May 1st so I don't incur more than a two-month gap in health insurance. If I resign in May, I will have health insurance coverage until June 1st. My new insurance coverage will begin when I start the fall semester in August. This will ensure I'm not charged a penalty for lack of coverage when I file my 2018 taxes. If something horrible happens, I'll get COBRA. Thanks for all this input, advice, and support!

The form it is making me do, IT-203, has two columns where it lists salaries, wages, dividends, etc. for both federal and New York income. The federal income spots are already filled with info from my W2 and 1099s, etc. It shows my combined wages/salary for last year. For the New York field, am I supposed to put how much of that is ""New York sources"", or do I SUBTRACT the amount that was ""New York sources"" and put it in there, while leaving the remainder in federal?

&gt; [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8b84fe/crypto_safety_education_series_2_combat_phishing/) of the series on how to identify and avoid ads phishing scams

Email phishing is another very popular way for phishers to contact users. Links contained in an email will lead users to a spoofed-website, and ask them to reveal sensitive information, such as their private keys etc.

You might be wondering, “I have never visited a spoofed-website before, how can they get a hold of my email address?”

Well, it’s easier than you think. There are legitimate services where you can buy email lists as leads, as well as many dark-web markets where you can buy leaked/hacked email addresses in bulk for cheap.

One popular email phishing technique is to pose as a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange or wallet service, inform the user that they have detected unusual activity on their account recently, and urge the user to confirm such activity.

Another popular phishing email template is to inform the user that there is a pending transaction for his/her exchange or wallet account, and the user needs to confirm the authenticity of the transaction before it gets processed.

Both types of emails will include a link for confirmation, and the link will subsequently lead the user to a phishing site where the user will be asked to enter sensitive information, such as passwords, private keys, etc.

Below are 2 real-life examples reported on [bitcoinwhoswho blog](http://bitcoinwhoswho.com/blog/2017/12/05/dont-be-fooled-by-colnbase-or-myethenwallet-scams/) posing to be MyEtherWallet and Coinbase respectively.

&gt; Email Example 1: **MyEthenWallet Phishing Email**
&gt; From: mailer@**myethenwallet.com**

    Hi bitcoinwhoswho.com,
        MyEtherWallet has recently been targeted by attackers trying to obtain access to wallets on the Ethereum network.
        
        In order to prevent any other security issues, we have implemented Two Factor Authentication.

        However, the Two Factor Authentication wallet security has to be activated by our users manually.

        In order to set up Two Factor Authentication and to secure your wallet, please visit the link below to upgrade your wallet to the new security protocols.

        UPGRADE YOUR WALLET^link to phishing site

        “PLEASE UPDATE YOUR WALLET ON HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF LOSING FUNDS OR TOKENS.”
        Thanks and be well,
        kvhnuke @ MyEtherWallet LLC


&gt; Email Example 2: **Colnbase Phishing Email**
&gt; From: no-reply@**no-reply@colnbase.support**

    You just sent 0.04804 ETH
    Congratulations! You have successfully sent 0.04804 ETH (worth $12.00 USD) to 0x598944a224d65f4F8AD1fB0828308556F11D7543 using Coinbase. To facilitate this transaction, you paid 0.00021 ETH (worth $0.06 USD) in network fees.
    This withdrawal is being sent to an address (“0x598944a224d65f4F8AD1fB0828308556F11D7543”) that you haven’t previously used.

    If you believe your account activity is unauthorized, please click the button below to cancel the transaction and restore access to your account.

    Cancel this transaction^link to phishing site

Above are just 2 examples of possible phishing emails. They both are trying to exploit users’ sense of urgency, thinking they are dealing with unauthorized transactions, and that their accounts are under attack.

When people think their accounts are not secure, they tend to act hastily, without scrutinizing whether or not the source and the content of the message are legitimate. And that’s when they visit phishing sites by clicking on links to **upgrade wallet** or to **cancel transaction** without looking twice.

There are few ways to distinguish phishing emails, such as the appearance of typos, wrong graphics, wrong colors, etc. However, the best way to detect them is by looking at the email sender address.

For example, in Gmail, to inspect an email sender’s information, you can simply click on the little arrow next to your name, [as shown in this screenshot](https://d25qfs7a9f072j.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gmail-sender-info.png?x25967).

You can now see, in addition to sender’s address, who it is mailed by, and whether or not it has been signed by a trusted domain.

Never trust an email solely based on the sender’s name. Anyone can put whatever name they want in the “From” field. Inspect the domain name and refer to our previous section on domain names when in doubt.

Another important thing to mention here is DO NOT click on any link and DO NOT download any attachment from untrusted emails.

**Why?**

Sometimes, even though the links may appear legit, for example, displaying the text myetherwallet.com, clicking on the link may actually take you to a phishing site, such as my-ether-phishing-example.com. Most email formatting follows standard HTML guidelines. Standard markup allows you to edit where the link redirects to, which can be vastly different than the displayed text.

Last, but not least, downloading an attachment from an untrusted source is the #1 way to get your computer infected with malware. [Read up on this cautionary tale from a Reddit post](https://imgur.com/a/7Ndc1).

Bottom line is, if something doesn’t feel right, be extra cautious and verify your source. If you are unsure whether the email communication you received from the exchange or wallet service you use is real, reach out to them via their OFFICIAL email address, OFFICIAL Twitter account, or OFFICIAL Facebook page.

Here at Crypto Aware, we have recently compiled a list of official URLs and social media profiles of [popular cryptocurrency exchanges](https://www.cryptoaware.org/resources/top-cryptocurrency-exchanges/) and [cryptocurrency wallets](https://www.cryptoaware.org/resources/top-cryptocurrency-wallets/).

And for God's sake, please, please do not ever reveal your password, private keys, or recovery phrase via emails or messages, EVER. Unless it is your intention to have all your funds taken away.

I worked for a car dealership for a year until I was able to land a career type position at a company I wanted to work for. I was able to pay off about 4k within the first year due to bonuses, but I took a significant pay decrease (~9k) in order to start in the entry position as a helpdesk/jr admin. My current loans are as follows:

My wife and I made 58,000 combined this past year. After all bills are paid for the month we typically have 100-300 ""left over"". Outside of saving more on food (currently we spend about 250/mo on groceries and close to another 300 eating out as we both work pretty long hours) we don't have many areas we can reduce our spending. We spend almost nothing other than food ($0 on alcohol), bills, gas, 6% to a roth 401k, and an occasional trip to the movies or bowling alley. Any raises or ""left over"" money we receive is usually put down towards paying off loans or contributing to our savings.

We sold our house a few months ago and moved to Texas in our RV so my dad could take up a new job. I went from my own spacious room to sleeping on the fold-out couch in a mini living room. I've been living with six people and four dogs in less than 300 sq ft. We're currently looking for a new house but my parents are (understandably) super picky about what to buy. We want a house in the country that isn't a dump, and not too far from town, but real estate has sky-rocketed here and it's hard to find something compatible in their price range.
I work five days or more a week as a valet making minimum wage + tips ($12 - $25/hr, usually around $15/hr). I actually really enjoy my job. I'm a full-time online college student and part of a startup business apprenticeship which currently consists of online training and personal projects. It takes up a lot of my time. I am expected to be selected by a company somewhere in the US by September and will likely be moving out on my own. At that point I am taking a break from college and seeing where the real world takes me for a while.
My parents and siblings are getting really fed up with me because I'm not pulling my weight around the ""house"". The usual chores, taking care of the dogs, running errands, etc. I get it. I do. I'm often out working, and when I'm ""home"" I'm writing college essays, or on video calls with classes and blogging stuff for my professional development and whatnot. It feels like there isn't enough time in a day to get everything done. My older brother was 20 when my parents told him he needed to pay rent or move out (keep in mind this was back in our REAL 5 bed, 3 1/2 bath house). However, he wasn't in any sort of school. All he did was go to his fast food job (not knocking fast food, I've been there), hang out with his gf, and go to parties, usually coming home at like 3am and sleeping til 2pm when he left for work. He chose to move out, got his own place, and seems happy. I'm actually trying to make the most of my life right now, but receiving the same talk from them.
My parents recently had that same ""rent or move out"" talk with me. They call my schooling (which I am paying for) ""something you're doing for yourself"" and that family stuff comes before work and school. I 100% agree, but what am I supposed to do? Work less? Slack off in school and waste my money? I chose to make a down payment of $4k in savings and monthly tuition payments rather than take out a bunch of loans. I don't think I have the money to pay my parents any rent or move out right now.
I am making ~$1500/mo at my job and forking over tuition payments of $500/mo. I have like $2k in the bank. I don't pay any other bills besides gas (~$200/mo, I drive a 3hr round trip to work). I do have my ""own"" car that my dad bought (cheap turd that needs major repairs, but I do like it, E36 BMW convertible hence my username). I think my parents would be cool with me taking the car with me. The RV life isn't all bad, and I have the option of renting one, plus site rent for ~$600/mo, but I don't think I can realistically afford this.

personalfinance,What does personal finance think about leasing and financing depreciating assets?,"I've noticed that most of the wealthy (or at least, superficially wealthy) people I know choose to lease their luxury cars.

On the face of it this seems like a bad idea because obviously by the end of the plan you'll end up paying out a big margin on top of the product, which will be worth considerably less by the time you've finished. Paying an extra 30-50% for something that's losing value by the day = bad.

But what about plans that allow you to return the product, that you aren't locked into, and that include insurance and warranty? This seems to me a financially viable way to effectively rent something you need or want without having to pay out the entire thing and without being hammered by unexpected costs. Just a single predictable monthly payment plan.

I've considered leasing out a laptop, for example, because I've grown a bit fed up of paying a lot of money for a laptop that's nigh obsolete by the time I've stopped hurting from the downpayment. With leasing are you not passing the obsolescence of the equipment back to the company? Sure, you don't have an asset to sell at the end, but is it even worth anything by then?

I feel like PF will hate leasing on a fundamental level but I wonder if anyone chooses to do so for certain things.",finance

ALL CC's have the same Interest rates or negligible difference in rate.

This is it. We don't budget for anything else. every penny either goes towards Debt, or some of it gets wasted on junk food and such. sometimes necessities.

WE WANT TO STOP EATING OUT AND WASTING MONEY!!!! (I feel that a properly done budget) will help with this. that plus some willpower and me putting on my big boy pants and just doing it.
However, i know that paying down debt is the best way to save money bla bla bla. I just dont feel secure putting every single penny towards debt once all the bills are paid. all we have is $500 in a savings account. and i feel like some kind of balance could be achieved here.

Thank you all for your time.",finance

personalfinance,(EU) I met with a financial advisor. Would really appreciate an experienced opinion or two.,"Hello pf,  
I am having second thoughts about a financial decision, and I could really use a second pair of eyes and brain cells on this. I appreciate anyone that's bored enough, or interested enough that reads through this and helps me out. I'll cut to the chase... I'm 28, with a bit of money in the bank and no debts or investments. I met with a financial advisor that was recommended to me by satisfied family members. I didn't have no expectations, but I was hoping she would maybe help me get a better mortgage offer than I'm able to get myself (I'm in the market for an apartment). We did talk mortgages, but the two sessions I've had with her were more geared towards overall financial well-being and future planning. This is not what I signed up for originally.  

Now, she has designed a savings plan which also contains an insurance component, to guarantee my monthly income stays at the same level in cases of poor health/serious accidents/disability/etc. I've had my doubts about that, as the word insurance just screams wasted money to me, and I've been able to make her strip the insurance component to its bare minimum. We've agreed on another meeting today where I would sign the thing.  

The insurance is tied with a retirement savings component, and apparently they are inseparable. Even if nothing happens to me, I'm supposed to collect the money spent on insurance back when the time comes. That whole insurance+retirement ""account"" is set to appreciate with a ~7,5% interest rate, and the monthly contribution is set at a manageable 6,5% of my current salary, with the insurance component being like ~2,5%. I need to contribute to that account for at least 10 years before I break even. After that it just grows, and I can pull out at any time.

One more thing I'd like to add is that I'm not a go get it done type of person. Some would even call it lazy, and I couldn't argue with that much. Had I not met with this advisor, the money would probably just continue sitting in a bank account collecting 0.1% (yearly!) interest for many, many, years to come.  

I have not asked for this, but she's pretty adamant that I need it, to plan for the future. Especially when I get that 30 year mortgage I'm hoping for. Well, this makes me uneasy. I'm being offered something I didn't ask for. And I don't want to say I'm being forced into anything, but I do get the feeling that this particular person won't work with me unless we have this ""security"" plan up and running first.  

**TL;DR**  
Planning on buying a place this year, need mortgage. Wasn't doing any real financial planning, or investing. Met with an advisor that suggested a plan to stick to. The plan's retirement savings component is coupled with an income insurance component in case of health deterioration. I've cut the insurance to a minimum (2,5% of my monthly income), but that's as low as it goes. Can't cut it completely. I'd be losing money if I withdrew from that account first ten or so years, after that I can pull out at any time and take what I put in plus interest.

**Questions**  
Does any of this raise any red flags in your guys' minds? Am I crazy for not caring about income insurance and the security it provides should anything happen? Am I crazy for not liking spending 2,5% of my monthly income on such insurance? I'm positive I'm being offered better financial management, and investment opportunity than I would get myself in the foreseeable future. Should I shy away from it just because it's a financial advisor offering it?  
Thank you very much in advance for any and all opinions!",finance

personalfinance,Need to pay off mortgage at 8.875%. should I drain my 401k?,"So we purchased a town house right before the crash. I think around 2006. Two mortgages. The smaller one was at $34,000 with 8.75% interest and a balloon. I was able to get the balloon off and adjust the interest rate on the larger loan, but they couldn't lower the 8.75 one.

After 12 or so years the principal has only gone down about $6000. 

I could drain my 401k and pay off that loan.  I know everyone says not to do that because of the tax hit, but am I losing more money paying that interest for another 20 years?

We are paying double the minimum but after refinancing just to get the balloon off it's still going to take forever to pay off.

Any advice would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,About to invest in a rental property. Can I get some perspective?,"Some details: The rental income would be $1,800/mo, and the monthly note at 20% down would be ~$870/mo, so I'm looking at $930/mo profit.

Sounds great, until my lender told me cash required to close on the sale would be ~$32,000. This includes the 20% down payment,  monies in escrow for property tax/insurance/etc, as well as closing fees. 

This is all pretty standard (except for the 5.625% interest rate; interest rates are bananas right now), but I'm just balking at the cash required upfront to make $930/mo. I mean at that rate, it would take 34 years for the property to make that money back, longer than the length of the mortgage. And if I'm doing the math right, $930/$32,000 would be a 2.90625% return on investment, right? Is that the *actual* ROI, or am I not including something?

Does this seem like ... not a good idea? Would I be better just dropping that in a mutual fund?

edit: My math was off, it's actually  $(930 * 12)/$32,000 = 34.9% APY. Thanks /u/theoriginalharbinger",finance
personalfinance,AT&amp;T debacle. Please help!!!,"So I have been fighting with At&amp;t for four months now over a BOGO offer they had during Christmas. I purchased 2 Samsung Galaxy s8 phones. I upgraded one line and added a new line (that was the deal to get the offer). I paid for one phone in full and the other had to be placed on their installment plan in order to get the monthly bill credit to make it free. For four months I have been fighting them to receive the billing credit and today was the last straw. The representative told me to hire an attorney lol. 

So at the time of purchase I was chatting with a representative who told me that yes I could pay for one phone in full and still qualify. I was so sceptical having been fucked by ATT on numerous occasions that I had them send me an email stating that I qualified. This was sent on Dec 24th at the time of purchase. 

Cue March 8th, bill rolls in. No credit. I chat with a rep for 2 hours. Finally he tells me that yes I qualified for this promotion and the credit will be on the next bill. I kept the chat transcript. 

April 10th, new bill no credit. Chat with another representative who gave me a credit for this months bill and assigned me aa case number. He promised it would be resolved that afternoon. Was no6. Kept chat transcription.

Today I chat and they immediately send me to the escalation department or whatever. Man tells me know I don't qualify because I paid for one phone in full and suggests I hire and attorney lol 

Am I fucked? What can i do? I have all this in writing and now they are refusing to apply the credits.  All help appreciated. I have spent countless hours trying to get this resolved. 

TL:DR- Att is trying to screw me out of a bogo promotion.

Edit: Thanks for your advice everyone! Unfortunately, I cannot accept being mislead by numerous representatives in writing. I have filed formal complaints with the Federal Trade Commission and Better Business Bureau. Going to give it a week and then send the demand letter. Will keep you posted. 

Edit 2: Its been resolved!!!! The FTC complaint got their attention. They just removed the installment payments all together and credited me what's been charged so far! Persistence paid off!",finance
personalfinance,Best e-file options for somebody new to the workforce in 2017 (w/ two jobs),"I file my own taxes electronically through the IRS and separately through my State's web site.  However, I have a younger son who started working in 2017, and has two W-2 for two jobs.  

I want to help him files his own taxes himself, rather than me do it.  

These are first jobs and he has no investments, no dependents, etc., so his filing requirements are about as basic as it gets, minus the multiple W-2s.  I'm looking for a free (both federal and state) and easy-to-use option for a first-time electronic tax filer.

personalfinance,Can you make money by borrowing at a higher rate and investing at a lower rate? The math suggests you can. What am I missing?,"I was chatting with someone yesterday about the difference between compounding interest and amortized interest. Conventional wisdom tells us that if we borrow money at 4% and invest it for a 3% return, we are losing 1%. 4-3=1, right? Well, this person claimed that wasn't the case, and that in that scenario you'd actually make money because of the difference between amortizing (less interest paid each period) and compounding (more interest received each period). It sounded fishy, so I tested the theory by building a very simple amortization/compounding schedule (I wasn't allowed to post a file, so I took a picture of the schedule instead).

Sure enough, in this situation over 3 years, you actually net a profit of $155.94 for borrowing $5k at 4% and investing it at 3%. Now, obviously, if there's a bigger difference between interest rates, the scenario changes. For this example, the sweet spot seems to be keeping the debt under 6%. This means you could have returns of a little over half your borrowing rate and still come out ahead by having debt (leverage).

This goes so contrary to what I've been taught all these years (I'm even a CPA!) that I'm still doubting it, but the math doesn't lie, right? Am I missing something? Did I botch a formula somewhere? Or is this common knowledge I've somehow managed to miss?

If this is true, this changes the idea that we should pay off debt unless we're getting a higher return in the market. Instead, we should pay off debt only until the investment returns are a little more than half the debt rate. Of course, there's also risk tolerance to consider, too, as using leverage is always riskier than not. But assuming all other things are equal, it appears 1% return does not net out equally against a 1% debt.

https://imgur.com/a/StpGr

Edit: To be clear, I know this isn't apples to apples from a cashflow perspective. My thought when creating this scenario was how to best use a windfall (tax refund, bonus, etc). Should you pay off a loan you already had and are already paying back from other cashflow sources, or take the money and invest it (even at a lower rate)? Apologies for not being clear about that in the inital set up of the scenario.

Edit2: If we assume the windfall is received, the debt is paid off, and the amount that was going to debt would be invested instead, it produces $239.23 in income vs the net gain in the original scenario of $155.94. Since this also lowers risk by eliminating debt and produces a better return over the 3 years, this is clearly the better choice. Thanks for pointing it out! https://imgur.com/a/IHVt9",finance
personalfinance,Does this home buying plan sound like it makes sense?,"I'm pretty close to pulling the trigger on a home purchase, and while it goes a bit against the general wisdom here, I feel like it's an OK decision for me, but I'd still love to get some input. Here are the details:

The house: $210K, newly renovated, very close to downtown and my job and in a not-so-great but not-scary neighborhood. I live in a very hot market and there's a good amount of tear downs and new constructions happening in the neighborhood, so I feel good about the potential value. I haven't had an inspection done yet but there aren't any red flags with the property yet, for the purpose of this, let's say there aren't going to be any.

Work: I have an extremely stable full time job making $58K with phenomenal healthcare, takehome is roughly $3900. I've been told in about a year there will be a new position opening up above me that I'm currently the first choice for, which would bump me up to high $60s low $70s. I also make an additional $10K-$15K annually in freelance work. 

The Loan: Here's where I'd the most input, I can either go with a first time homebuyer program which would give me a grant of $8000 to go towards downpayment and closing costs as well as a tax credit of 40% of what I pay in mortgage interest, the catch is that it would be an interest rate of around 5.4%, I could get something in the low 4% range if I went with a credit union. I have an additional $12K I could put down while keeping $10K in an emergency fund. My only other debt is a $5K car loan.

The reasoning: I'm planning on staying in my job for the medium to long term, I have a very secure job with excellent health insurance, so I'm not very concerned about unexpected expenses popping up on either of those fronts. My highest priority is location, so I'm very concerned with spending a lot of time saving and just chasing inflating home values and still ending up with a house that's much further out than I want. 

My plan would be to get a roommate (based on what rentals are going for, this would be about $700/month in rent and about another $150 in savings) and put that and all of my freelance money towards the principal and then refinancing when I hit 80% LTV, at which point I should have a monthly payment that I could comfortably afford without a roommate even if the promotion and all of my freelance work fell through.

Edit: I don't mean to be snarky, but I'm not interested in any advice along the lines of, ""yeah but you might go blind and get hit by a meteor"". I'm well aware that things can go horribly wrong and I feel like the risk is low enough for me to tolerate.",finance
personalfinance,Was able to save $100k for a house. Now hesitant to buy. Money is now sitting in bank account. Any advice?,"Hi PF,

*Disclaimer: I live in the Bay Area, CA*

I was able to save $100k for what I thought would be enough to afford a down-payment on a nice starter-home. However, Bay Area home prices have skyrocketed and it looks like interest rates are climbing as well. With the impending 2018 Tax Plan and the inability to itemize deductions, it seems that I'd be taking too much risk buying a home within the next three years.

What should I do with the $100k that is wasting away in my bank account? Ideally, I'd like reasonable access to it if in case I do decide to buy property elsewhere.

personalfinance,Can anyone help clarify one point about transfer balance cards for me?,"So, as part of my credit paydown efforts, I moved a chunk of debt from one card to a Chase Slate card with 15 months of 0% APR.  My debt isn't ridiculously high, but it did come with ridiculous interest rates attached, which was making it difficult to make headway. I've made a ton of progress since then, and am on-track to pay off the whole balance before my 15 month 0% window is over. Which is to say, this isn't a pressing issue for me, just a point that I'm trying to get straight. 

I've read a number of statements on the subject in here saying that, were one to not pay off the total balance on a card like this within the window, that one would have interest on the entire, original balance applied retroactively. So, if I started with a $10k balance transfer, and ended the 0% window with $800 left on the card, I'd still get charged the 16-24% APR on the entire $10k. 

This surprises me, because that's not how I understood things to work in this particular situation. Not that I'd put it past them -- I know this is standard practice on ""buy now, pay no interest for 18 months"" type deals, where if you haven't paid it off in the allotted time, you're paying interest on the total purchase price. But as I understood it, on this kind of balance transfer, they're making their money on the 3% or 5% balance transfer fee, and then they get to charge interest on anything you still haven't paid off at the end (which is probably what they're really banking on.) 

I've even gone back to my original card agreement, and I don't see anything that suggests that I might be charged retroactive interest if I'm still carrying a balance from that transfer at the end of the 0% period. I know that if you miss a payment, they'll start charging interest, so I don't think that's where the confusion lies. I've just seen it stated with such confidence here so many times, I'm doubting myself and wondering if I've been missing a trick this whole time.",finance
personalfinance,Home equity loan to pay off credit cards?,"About three years ago, I went through a period of prolong unemployment for a little over a year. Within the last two years, I’ve gotten established at a solid company and have a good salary just north of six figures.

During that time period, I ran up some credit card debt to the tune of about $20,000. I’ve been making my payments on time, but because of interest rates higher than 20% I’ve had a very difficult time actually making any meaningful progress towards paying them off.

Early this year, I needed to have a place to live and I was tired of renting so I finally made the decision to buy house. I closed on it at the end of January.

Since buying the house, the Zillow estimate of the value of the house has gone up over $25,000 more than what I paid for it.

My question is, would it be possible or is it even worth it to approach a bank and try to get a home equity loan with a lower percentage rate that I could use to consolidate my outstanding credit card debt?

Is there anything else that I should be on the lookout for when trying to get some kind of loan to consolidate the debt and get it into a more reasonable interest rate. I am well aware that there is a danger of paying them off, and then running them back up, and I am committed to cutting them up and not using all but one of my outstanding credit cards in the future.

personalfinance,1098-E Form reports significantly different interest paid than previous tax years,"I've been paying student loans for several years now and always may the same amount each month. Each year the ""student loan interest received by lender"" in my 1090-E form has been approximately the same.

However, this year I noticed my federal return was far lower than previous years, while processing through H&amp;R Block. I looked closely and noticed my 1098-E form was reporting an interest paid HALF of previous years.

How can this possibly be if I'm always paying the same amounts each month?

These loans are managed by Nelnet, so I logged into my account and simply added up the ""applied to interest"" column in my payment history, but the sums are very similar between 2017 and previous years. It's certainly nowhere close to be different by a factor of 2.

personalfinance,Cash Out Savings Bond 2-Years Early?,"Good afternoon, long-time reader of this sub. Thanks to everyone here I have managed to build my savings, retirement, and emergency fund and continued to grow my career. I have this sub to thank for a lot of my current financial behaviors. I have made some assumptions, but would like a little more direction when deciding what steps I should take next.

I have 20, $1,000 EE savings bonds in my name from 1990 at a fixed 4.00% interest rate. They have been building interest ever since they have been issued and using the Treasury website are currently valued at $37,560. Their final maturity is scheduled for 11-2020 and I have a few questions.

Situation - 
Signing a new employment agreement starting in Mid-May after being unemployed since 03/02/2018. Starting salary $100,000 annual including benefits ($500 monthly reimbursement) and travel expenses ($120 monthly reimbursement). 10% annual salary increases and 20% bonus potential on earnings. 0.75% vested options in the company over a 5-year period.

I resigned from my former position and have earned $16,000 to date. Crude math has me expected to earn approximately $44,000 for a total annual income of $60,000 for 2018 with this new employment agreement excluding bonuses/reimbursements.

Assumptions -
I keep this job through the final maturity of these bonds with an proposed $121,000 annual salary. Everything is honky dory and I move them to a retirement fund/down payment on a house.

Questions - 
1) What are tax implications for cashing out EE Paper Bonds? Is there any value to cashing them now and moving them to a retirement/index fund this year that I have earned the least amount?

2) What is the expected value of these bonds when they reach final maturity in 11-2020? (The calculator didn't allow me to calculate value that far in the future)

3) How can I move a savings bond into a retirement account or use to invest in purchasing a house with minimal tax implications? Or how can I use this money at all with minimal tax implications?

Facts - 
I don't need this money now, but would prefer to make the right decision if I end up losing 30+% on taxes either now or when they reach maturity. What is the best decision to make? Interest rates like this never come up anymore, and I feel like I shouldn't cash out early - I am assuming I won't lose this job, but who knows. I have never been fired before but I have left nightmares and could potentially have $0 earnings any year in my life. Hence my addiction to saving, and reading this sub.

I just had a breakdown this morning when the reality of being married to someone with 75k student loan debt hit me. (well I always knew about it but it just hit me now that we are legally bounded.. forever...)

Time to get to work and please give me some advise on if you think this is a good plan, comments, etc :) 

OPTION 1

1. Using my own saving to pay off the loan (we were going to use part of this as my retirement (I am self employed) and a down payment for a house) - but we decided to not buy a house until we know where we are going to move to long term (pending job offers). 

2. My husband will pay his same loan amount to me monthly, and I will use that towards a ETF/Mutual fund and build my saving back up (that will be a guarantee 6.8% gain, +/- whatever the market decide to go?) 

3. If we do decided to go for it, any tips on paying the lump sum with a credit card? (I like my points). Would transferring the loan to a private lender, and pay it off right away be a good option?

OPTION 2

1. My hub works for the federal govt' - we can sign up for the PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS (PSLF) plan and play it off in ten years - the problem is we aren't sure if he is going to be in the fed for that long.. 

Thank you so much y'all! With a mental breakdown came some mental clarity - looking forward to hear your comments. 

edit 1: thank you for all of your advise! the 'me' vs 'ours' is definitely an adjustment, but totally makes sense!

we already have a joint saving account - what if instead of paying 'me' back, he would just pay into our saving - and use it for our future? Would that be a feasible plan? (esp. since the interest rate is so low on my current saving ~80k, might as well use that to pay the debt off? that's my initial thinking...)

edit 2: just talked to the hubs and he is leaning towards paying it til the 20 years mark for loan forgiveness (been paying for 7 years so 13 years left, 156 more payments) - since he is only paying 315 a month - even if the monthly goes up (with increase salary in the future), and with the tax we will have to pay in the end - it would come up to still less than 75k... would it make sense to try to pay everything up front..? or just stick with the payments...?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan debt in collections; is it worth it to accept Compromise vs. a Rehabilitation settlement?,"I currently have $12,790 worth of Federal Student Loans in collections and have recently been granted an unexpected windfall in the form of a large tax return for 2017 AND a new well-paying job. The collections agency is offering me a ""Compromise"" to pay $10,287 by July 10 (90 days), and in return they would write off $2,503 ""in savings"" that I would not have to pay myself, as well as clear the delinquent status from my credit.

This leaves me about $1,500 to plow into debt. My current strategy is to pay off my 401k loan as much as I can prior to paying off my high interest credit card. I currently am not contributing to my 401k as my match has not yet started. Does PF you think I should at least put in 6% currently without a match or use that extra $200 to pay off my 401K loan. Or should I just not bother paying the loan off and pay my CC off? They both are going to be about roughly the same amount of time to pay off with my current strategy except the fact that the 401k loan is time sensitive. As a note, I usually receive about a $1,600 federal refund so I believe I would still get a smaller refund with the penalties from the loan if this is the case. Also, after the High Interest CC and the 401k loan is settled my 401k match should start and at that point I would start contributing. What should be my next approach? I was thinking about then switching to at least a 5 mo E-fund and as well as giving myself a tad more spending money per month, increasing to $700-$800. I have been living on $510 a month for quite some time and it sucks. I just feel like I can never do anything. I know that it may not seem like a great idea but idk how much longer I would be able to handle it. Even with giving me $800/mo I could still fund the 5 mo E-Fund by the end of the year. 

Then I think my approach would be to actually split between snowball/avalanche. I would snowball the 6.8% fed loans and leave the less than 5.6% loans alone and then plow it into the 6.75% SL. 

What do you guys think?

Also, do you think maybe I should up my monthly auto savings deposit? to $200 a month once I reach the SL stage? or maybe do some sort of split extra monthly payments between the 2 student loans?

1.) Paid monthly, so January's paycheck had more taken out of it because changes for the new tax laws hadn't gone into effect.

2.) Teacher, and get paid my salary over 12 months, July-June. But I did not start working until August last year, so my salary was divided by 11. Therefore, my paycheck is going to be higher, and therefore taxed higher, until July (paid at the end of the month, so my June paycheck will still be at the 11-month rate). 

So, when I factored that in, plus summer school (which I will be working) plus the $80-200 extra I get every month for things like subbing on my prep period and other extras, it has me overpaying by $1700 and says I should claim three dependents and drop my refund to like $100. Awesome. Did that today. Two questions.

1) Forgot to ask at payroll, is there a time limit from turning it in to when they have to submit it by and when it has to take effect? Or is it company dependent?

2) When I did the math for next year (not exact, I know, but just playing), it looks like I will need to put two dependents for next year..
A) When does the IRS usually put out new withholding calculators (yes, I am that new to this)?
B) When should one have a new W4 submitted for a new tax year to maximize effectiveness?

Final question, that I think I know the answer to. In the 2019-2020 school year, we are going to be 11 month employees, with the option to defer 8.333% of our net pay to get a paycheck in July. I will probably just take the larger paycheck, round up to the nearest 100 and save the money myself, vs giving the district the interest, but have made no decisions yet. My question, though, is this; am I right to assume that either way, it will not effect my withholdings as my salary at the end of the year will be the same? The feds don't give a crap whether I make all my money over 12 months, or 11, or all in one lump sum, just the end number, correct?",finance

personalfinance,"Owe 29,000 in Federal taxes over 2016/2017 taxes. Looking for advise.","Okay, first my now wife and I have made several mistakes over the last couple of years. We know what we did wrong and we have corrected to prevent this in the future. However, we are in a dilemma now.

Me - 34 m I owe $9,500 for 2016 Federal taxes. I did not file my taxes for 2016 until September of 2017. I asked for a repayment plan of $100.00/month and it was tentatively approved. I have been paying that $100/month for a few months and have not ever received a final agreement. Recently I sent a letter to the IRS asking for clarification. Wife - 28 She owes $8,700 for 2016 Federal taxes. She did not file her taxes until September 2017. She has a payment plan of around $290/month and has received confirmation of her payment plan.

We were not married in 2016 and filed separately. A large chunk of what we owe is due to the Health Insurance Marketplace and us showing we made more than what was allowed so we have to pay back what was subsidized.

We realized our mistakes a little too late as we didn't file our taxes until so late in 2017. We were married in 2017 and our taxes were filed jointly on time for 2017. However, we owe a total of $11,600 for 2017.

We now owe a total of $29,600 in Federal taxes. We are both self-employed (same company) that is a startup and is starting to take off but still 2 years away from normalizing our salaries. Right now we make $83,200/Year combined.

I owe $11,000 in Credit Card Debt and She owes 13,000 in Credit Card Debt.

Can we combine all of the owed Federal Taxes into one installment plan with the IRS? What is the lowest payment we can expect?


Edit: First of all. I am embarrassed that I said ""Advise"" when I meant ""Advice"" So... yeah...

There have been a few comments about what we have done to correct this. I will highlight that here:

1. We are now paid as full-time employees of the company through normal wages using Quickbooks Payroll. 
2. We have an accountant review everything for us quarterly to make sure we are not shooting ourselves in the foot. 
3. We are moving our Health Insurance away from ACA and to something like TriNet.  
4. We have YNAB and have started budgeting our income. 
5. I am selling my car and we will have one car payment.

personalfinance,How to decide between interest rate vs APR ?,"I am buying a home and need to decide on a lender. I have multiple quotes from different lenders and I have two competing quotes at this point. Both loans are 10/1 ARM loans. I chose a 10/1 ARM over a 30 year fixed loan because I don't plan to live in this home forever and will most likely sell or re-finance it within the first 10 years. So here are the details:


Lender A) is lending me at an interest rate of 3.875%, **APR 4.479%**  
Closing cost for lender A): 8549.27$  
Monthly payment for lender A): **2825.47**  
Down payment: 100,000 (say)

Total cash needed at downpayment: 100,000 + 8549.27 = **108549.27**



  
---  
  

Lender B) is lending me at 4.125%, **APR 4.503%**

Closing cost for lender B): 6521.12 $

Monthly payment for lender B): **2911.95**

Down payment: 100,000 (say)

Total cash needed at closing: 100,000 + 6521.12 = **106521.12**


---





I am confused about how the APR is calculated. Is it combining my closing costs to redistribute the total cost of borrowing over the principal to arrive at the APR ?


How do I use this information to determine which lender to pick ? I don't get the trade-off. On the surface, lender A) seems like a better option because of lower monthly costs but it has a close APR.

Lender B) has a higher monthly payment but has upfront lower closing costs.

What gives ? How can I make a financially sound decision with this.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage broker fee - I think I'm being taken advantage of,"I recently bought a house. I initially applied for a mortgage directly with a bank, the appraisal came back low so I went with a mortgage broker that was recommende to me by a colleague. 

I had a frustrating experience with the broker, he dragged things out and ended up not getting a mortgage approved by the closing date. I was able to convince the seller to extend the sales contract for an additional 30 days and I told the mortgage broker I was going to apply for a mortgage from another bank on my own as well and that he should continue working on mortgage and I would go with whoever could close soonest.

I ended up getting the mortgage directly from the bank I applied with. The mortgage broker said he was set to close with another bank as well but the interest rate was significantly higher (5.125% vs 4.375%). 

The mortgage broker convinced me to sign an unsecured interest only revolving line of credit through him with a local bank to help with the cost of renovations. I closed on this loan right after i closed on the mortgage with the other bank. Immediately after I signed the revolving line of credit he handed me an envelope and said here is my invoice. I took a look at it in the car and he invoiced $8400+ for ""financial services"".

The only talk we had of his charge was at our initial meeting where is said it would probably be ""$6000-7000"". I emailed him asking why his invoice was so high he said he had spent 196 hours of work. I reminded him of what he had told me intially and he said he will change charge to $7000. 

Effectively he closed a $100k line of credit with me and is asking for $7k. I feel like he only wanted me to close on the line of credit so he could say he had facilitated me to close on something since I went with a different bank for the mortgage. I also find it hard to believe he spent almost 200 hours working on my mortgage. I was able to close on a mortgage with a different bank on my own and estimate it took less than 40 hours of work (from me who has limited experience doing this)

I never signed a contract with the broker, so I don't think I really owe him anything. I am just curious what your thoughts are as to what a reasonable fee would be or if he is trying to take advantage of me.",finance
personalfinance,"$56k debt, starting new job out of college and a bit overwhelmed trying to balance my loan, 401k, emergency fund, quality of life.","Hey guys, I've been lurking here quite a while but I could really use some help with my current situation. I'm not posting in the Canadian sub as I will be earning in the US.

**Some background information on me:**

* mid-twenties, single Canadian citizen, heading to Seattle area for work on a TN visa

* Graduating college this month with **~USD$56k debt** ($16k is a personal loan from a family member, the remainder was recently refinanced on a Canadian line of credit at 4.1% interest rate)

* Assets: approximately USD$1000 cash; no investments etc.

* Liabilities: just the student debt. No car, but will be renting an apartment in the US (estimating up to $2000/mo in rent/bills).


**Employment information:**

* Starting a new job in Aug that pays roughly USD$110k/year.

* Receiving $15k signing bonus in the first month of employment (taxable), and $17k for relocation a month before starting (grossed up for tax, i.e. I take home $17k)

* Conditions on bonuses: must work for 1 full year at the company, or I must return the bonus in full.

* 401k: employer will match 50% of all contributions up to $18.5k maximum employee contribution

* HSA, FSA options available

* Stock options at 10% discount (large public tech company in Redmond)


Additional info: retirement age goal is not set as I haven't had much time to ponder about it. I want to live somewhere nice, so I don't really want to budge on the rent/bills part (I spent a while living in a 100-year old crumbling apartment near my uni). I do not plan on buying a car until I've fully repaid my loan.

All my life I've had $5000 in the bank or less, so I'm a bit overwhelmed on how I should be balancing my income, bonuses, with my liabilities. I've started building a repayment plan and monthly budget, but there are a few things I'm not sure about:

* How fast should I pay off my loan, if not ASAP?

* Should I start contributing to my 401k right away at the same time as repaying my loan?

* Should I be buying into stock options now or later, or at all?

* How much of my bonuses should I use as a lump-sum repayment to my loan, vs. holding for an emergency fund?

* If I have an emergency fund, is it okay to funnel all my remaining income into loan repayment (minus fixed costs and 401k)?

* Are there any hidden consequences of refinancing my loan through a US bank, or should I just keep them across the boarder?

gaming,"The TRUTH about ""NieR: Automata"" that has been kept a SECRET to the western world!","Edit: ooooook so nevermind reading this because I guess because it's garbage, I'll just down vote everything I said too and get out of your hair.
------------

So I just started playing this last night. On hard. Haven't really slept, at least not where it's like ""now is sleeping time, be back in 8 hours world!"". Yeah, I'm loving it like McD's buuuuuut...

I wanted to know what ""YoRHa"" stood for since it seemed clearly to be an abbreviation and also how come they wear those blindfolds all the dang time?

Now I'm only up to where you fight another one of those construction looking robots from the PRRROOOOLLLOOGGUUUEEEE (which, fuck that shit, set it to normal and then back to hard when you're done. It's fine, you're no less of a man/woman/yougettheidea)....but...I did a little googling and apparently this Yoko Taro guy behind the whole story wanted to get all experimental with live stage plays a while ago.  And he done went and just did it. Cause I guess he's straight fire.

So he used his connections to form a basically made up totally fake idol group and he called it ""YoRHa"", capitalized like that and all. For apparently no other reason than his stated reason for why the R in NeiR is capitalized: an eye-catching style choice. (Or maybe he has some kind of beef with vowels) Then he wrote a play/musical of some kind that involved them as well as a bunch of assault rifle props. There certainly don't APPEAR to be robots in it or even similarly designed cursed/ghost kids (or whatever the fuck it was) like from the kinda sorta pretty shitty OTHER NieR game...but anyway...

 But in addition to doing the boss music for the other game series he's associated with, Drakengard (haven't played it) and being listed IN THE CREDITS as ""YoRHa"", their other main defining characteristic is...

that their ""weird"" stand out look is that they ALL wear black blindfolds on stage while they sing.

It's not a combat visor like everyone says. If it was it would fit better and not sag down half way on 2B's face. It's not that their visual data is being fed to them from the Pod wirelessly like I thought, either. It's just a stylistic self-reference to one of his own previous art projects. And it does look cool, I'll grant that. But since he's been explicitly withholding in interviews about the game, calling it ""A Seeeeeeeecret! (tee-hee-hee!)"" about what ""YoRHa"" means, I figured I'd go ahead and be forthcoming on his behalf about what I found. 

You're welcome Yoko. This is for the prologue's lack of checkpoints. Still loving the game overall FWIW.

personalfinance,"Just got a personal loan for $12k, how should I use it?","So I just got a personal loan for $12k at 11.5% APR primarily for debt consolidation, but here's my full situation:

Emergency fund: $0
Auto loan: $6500, 14.6% APR
Federal student loans: $2500
Visa CC: $1400, 11% APR
PayPal Credit: $1000, 20% APR
Personal Loan: $600, 8.99% APR
Medical bills: $300

I've been using the car for food delivery as my primary source of income, so my plan is to buy an electric cargo bike to replace the car, which will set me back about $1600. That will allow me to pay off the auto loan and sell the car to a private party for around $6k. I also plan on paying off the personal loan and medical bills since they're so small, and the minimum monthly payment on the loan is $150, so it will significantly lower my bills in the short term. I'll also pay the PayPal balance since the interest rate is so high.

At that point I'll have about $2k left over. I could pay off the Visa but since the interest rate is lower than the loan I figured I could just wait to pay that off. However, I still don't have an emergency fund, and I can't decide if I should use some of the personal loan money to get that in place, or if I should just pay off the credit card anyway since the APR is only different by .5%, and I could still use the credit card for emergencies until I get the emergency fund in place.

My plan is to get the car sold ASAP after getting the bike, so I could just wait a month or two until the car is sold and then use that $6k to replenish the emergency fund, and then put the rest towards the loan. But I'm wondering what you guys think is the best way forward.",finance

personalfinance,(US) Questions regarding Forms W-9 and 1099-MISC when filing taxes as an independent contractor,"During 2017 I worked as a independent contractor for a lady who owns her own business. At the beginning of our contracting relationship she had me fill out a W-9. 

She is a very sweet person, but is a bit unorganized and hasn't really gotten back to me when it comes to questions regarding filing my own taxes. 

This is the first year I've worked as an independent contractor and it was my understanding that I would simply fill out a 1099-MISC form for myself and the only information I'd need from her is her Payer's Federal ID and current address. This is the only information I've asked her for, but she said she would ""give me my W-9"" once she got around to finding it in her quick books. 

Which made me second guess my understanding and so I did some googling and am now even more confused. Is a W-9 the appropriate form for her to provide me? Is she actually supposed to provide me with a 1099-MISC herself or do I provide a 1099-MISC on my own?

Last question, is there another way (maybe via a different form?) for me to pay my taxes and file them without having to involve her at all? It's getting to be crunch time and while I'm prepared to file for an extension, I'd rather just have it over and done with.

My situation: I have around $250K in student debt at the moment through Wells Fargo (WF), with an average interest rate of ~7.5% (oof I know!). Long story short is that I fell into hard times and medical issues and had to drop out of medical school. I will be graduating with a BSN (Nursing) in August. I have a job lined up that will pay $~60K before taxes. I have an amazing partner that supports me and he’s taking care of rent and I’m just paying for utilities and food ~roughly $600. No helps from parents and that’s ok since I didn’t expect anything (they stopped talking ever since I came out).


My dilemma: I talked with WF about my loan and they will not adjust my payment so that 50% will go towards principal and 50% will go towards interest. They said that their business practice is that ALL of the  monthly payments will go towards interest and anything on top of that will go towards principal. Am I solely out of luck or do I have a shot with refinancing with a better company that will allow me to do the 50/50 split? I’ve looked into SoFi but they will not assess me until I have graduated and have an established work history and income. Should I just make payments to WF for a year, get my work history established, and then reassess my situation and hope that someone can/will refinance me?

Fast forward to 2 years ago and my credit score was back up to around 700 and I got a new vehicle with a low interest rate. Unfortunately, I had to roll the owed amount of the high-interest loan into my new one.

I currently pay $540 a month for my auto loan, I need to reduce that by about $200.  
I have a bonus of around $5k coming up soon and the solution I am considering involves  
Putting the $5k down on a used vehicle, getting my monthly notes down around $350 for it  
Then doing a voluntary repossession of my current vehicle and taking the credit hit  
Then rebuild my credit by keeping my 4 credit cards under 30% utilization (as they are now) and paying off the new loan

I know that there is a chance my current lender could come after me for difference of my current loan and potentially garnish my wages. At that point, I would have no problem filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy for that creditor and hopefully keeping my other lines of credit to rebuild.

What do you suggest? Is the school in LA worth all the extra hours of work and possibly borrowing 40k for? Should I start my adult life in a field like film with 40k debt?

personalfinance,5 Allowances? Does this seem correct?,"I just went through the IRS Withholding calculator and it said I should claim 5 allowances. This seems like way too much and feel like I would be under withholding. Is the calculator only supposed to be for ""Fed Witholding"" amount I also have Med and OASD taxes. Am I not supposed to include those?

Info: Single, no kids. Started new Job March 12th making $59k I currently claim 1 currently. I take the $2500 student loan int credit and I am expected to contribute $515 into my HSA. My total Taxes per pay period (semi-monthly) are Fed $289.09, Medicare $34.95, FED OASD $149.43, and IL withholding $115.18. I don't plan to contribute pre-tax 401k until Sept when they match. So company, I believe has prorated my salary to $47602 for the year. I do get a bonus but wont receive that until beginning of 2019. If it matters 7.5% for a $3,576 potential. I made about 10,780 at previous employer also claiming one. I am making an assumption as I don't have access to my electronic pay stubs anymore but I was probably paying about $420 in taxes (for all 4 types) or about $220 just for Fed Withholding a check (basing it off an old 2016 paystub I found), paid bi-weekly.

personalfinance,Salary Exempt Question in Florida,"On mobile so sorry for wall of texr :

I started working for a non profit as a part time ,hourly employee doing the same job I did at a for profit business (but for less money per hour) .

There were indications given that I would ,after a time ,be brought up to at least what I was paid per hour at the for profit employer (in hindsight I should have negotiated to get either the equivalent of what I made before or get it in writing when this raise would occur but I digress... )


After about 6 months I was taken on as full time .

I was told there would be no raise and as a full timer I would be salary exempt meaning I would work for 40 hours a week and if  I work over that (but there's really no ""if"" if you are full time you do at least 50 hours a week ) I would not get overtime .

I have never been a salaried employee but from what I read ,I am guaranteed that 40 hours of pay even if it's more or less some weeks .
I was ok with this as I love my job .

The ""benefits"" of being full time are medical insurance (which I do not use/need..my partner is a local government employee with amazing benefits ) and after a year of employment, earn PTO (which is really not that great ,you earn like 1 day of PTO every year that you work).
Nobody gets to use their PTO apparently(we are never fully staffed) and it doesn't roll over nor will they buy it back and since full time is salary it didn't quite make sense to me why PTO was a perk but I didn't think too much about it .

There is also a 401K that I'm told is good but I am still waiting for that information /sign up .

Not using any of that ,but I like knowing I have/had a steady income so I've been rolling with it. 

On average I work  52 hours a week (I had a few weeks of 60 hours and once did 72) due to my workload (As mentioned above we are chronically short staffed )and lots of ""mandatory "" staff meetings and events outside of work hours .

Again ,I was ok with this and I do love my job but recently I had to miss 20 hours due to a family situation .
I was approved for this time off and I was able to get coverage for my workload (you have to arrange your own coverage in addition to getting approval).

My check is now less for the pay period that I missed 20 hours for .

It was my understanding that being salary exempt meant ,since I do not get overtime, I must get paid for 40 hours a week (which is why the PTO made no sense to me) even if I do less than 40 as ,with no overtime , it averages out for the weeks I go over 40 .

Was I wrong about being salary exempt?

I have read up on it again and it doesn't seem like my employer is indeed classifying and paying the salary exempt employees correctly but I'm not an attorney and Florida is a little wacky with employment laws (apparently).

investing,5 great long ideas that you should know about,"All feedback and comments very welcome

**Value Stocks** Caterpillar (CAT) is poised to deliver earnings per share growth of more than 30 percent this year according to a analysts, while the firm projects peak earnings of $16 per share four to five years from now. Currently priced at $150 the stock trades on a forward PE of less than ten. With Caterpillar's mining and construction markets around the world showing signs of a turnaround, thats a multiple that may appeal to value investors. 

Cemex (CX) is technically a Mexican cement company but with 50% of assets in the US and the financials based in dollars its about as American as almost any stock on the NYSE. The Mexican connection has held back CX as other construction companies have benefited from a strong US economy and increased Federal spending plans. But Merrill Lynch has said that all that political risk is more than priced in and that a weak dollar and strong growth in the US, Europe and the Philippines will ""drive strong earnings"". With the stock down 30% over the past year and a TTM PE of 12.9 it looks pretty cheap 

**Insider Buying** With the stock down nearly 40% DDR Corp (DDR) and yielding 10% director Alexander Otto has been snapping up stock with 7 purchases this year totaling about $40mn. Mr Otto is from the Otto dynasty that owns c.80 million square feet of U.S. office space and European shopping malls. His father Werner started the business back in 1949, so Alexander is well connected and, more importantly, seems comfortable enough with DDRs strategy and valuation to make numerous purchases in quick succession.

He’s not the only one, SumZero have given DDR a target price of $12 (compared to current stock price of $7.30). They are not the only contrarian investors out there supporting retail assets. Hedge funds and analysts are increasing beginning to realise that the demise of some retailers does not mean the end of retail malls and assets. Mall owners have shown ability to repurpose malls to bring in new retailers and reposition the real estate for new experiences such as movie theaters, child zones, and restaurants. That means that there is value and insiders, hedge funds and others are snapping up assets on the cheap.

**Growth Stocks** Solaredge Technologies (SEDG) has reported earnings growth of 40% for years so it’s not surprising that it trades on a lofty TTM PE of 30. In 2017 earnings grew 65% and SEDG Chairman and CEO, Guy Sella, said he was sure the company could maintain the trajectory of growth in 2018. The level of solar power generation is rising rapidly and the company has issued guidance for 70% sales growth in Q1 2018. With consensus 2018 estimates of $2.96, if the stock achieves that (reasonable) PE multiple of 30, it would see the stock rise an impressive 60% to $88.

DLH Holdings (DLHC) provides professional healthcare and public services to Government agencies and has seen steady exponential growth over the past 5 years. EBITDA has been growing by 100% annually. Looking ahead, management remain optimistic about the pipeline. In particular DLH, which offers drug and alcohol counseling services, could see expanded funding to fight opioid abuse. Given rapid growth the TTM PE of 16.8 and forward 2018 PE 12.5 looks very cheap. (please be aware this is a high risk microcap stock)

personalfinance,Question about taking out graduate school loans.,"Hey everyone, I'm sorry if these questions have been answered before. I found a few answers through searching, but have some questions still. 

My current situation is I have no current school debt from undergrad, and I'm very grateful for that. I have a credit card debt of $1766, and I owe my father $1000 for helping me buy a car. I also owe $560 to Firestone for a repair on the used car I just bought, and I know I need to get the timing belt replaced which will be around $800.

Grad school tuition is going to be anywhere from $25k to around $32k depending on which program I go to. 

Here are my questions:

1) I've never had to take out student loans before. From what I read, I'm eligible for about $20k from federal student loans. I haven't been awarded anything yet. Is it reasonable to budget $1000 a month plus rent (7k a year) for my private loan? Maybe I won't need that much, but I'd rather take out some extra, and then pay back the leftover immediately when I'm done. 

2) How do I make sure I'm getting the best bang for my buck? I found some sites that compare ""possible"" loan rates, but I know they may vary for me personally, I'm not sure on what factors though. 

3) After I finish this year long program I'm immediately applying to medical school, which is another huge debt endeavor. There's usually a gap year between finishing a ""post bacc"" or masters program, and getting into medical school. What will happen with my loans for the 6 months in between? (life willing I get in on my first try). 

4) Should I use these school loans to pay off all of my personal debt, to delay the interest from growing for a bit? I won't have any substantial income to be able to pay the personal debt off with. 

If you can answer any of these questions, I appreciate it! Or if you have better searching skills than I, and can refer me to some reading, I would appreciate that too!

I've never had any late payments on this card but the interest rate/charges are killing me.
And I think there may be something wrong with the charge/purchase history on the card but I haven't had much time to dig into all the statements.   

My savings hovers between $600-900 and I'm trying everything I can to cut back on expenses, cut out eating out, fuel, and will be cutting cable soon.  

I also have to find another place to stay in my area as my current landlord needs tenants to get out of certain units so they can renovate them and charge $300+ more for rent and it's high as hell already.  Most places in my area that have the amenities needed start anywhere from $1200 all the way to $1500 which isn't doable and rent is already $1080.

I don't have the money currently to cover places that want 1st, Last months rent, and a security deposit.  

I have an account review set up with Wells Fargo tomorrow to go over my accounts and get info as to what I can do and have access too but I wanted to see what path I should take in this situation as I need to pay for more things than the debt, rent, and other bills, as my car needs it's rear brakes and parts replaced or updated and I need 2 new back tires as well.  
And that's just one set of things needed in life right. 
I can't really go to family for help because they cannot provide any help without making life more stressful as is and no one can be relied on to keep a secret.  I've never begged or asked for money from family in my whole life and I really don't want to have to go to them.

investing,Sharing an Interesting Market Indicator I Created using Fed Data - Consumer Credit to Savings Rate,"**[See Google spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ysnMx5UelwkHBsJCCyNfyCXzI_E5UIx-Pld3tB5WwI/edit#gid=0)**

[IMGUR Chart Link Here](https://imgur.com/42QWpSR)

**Looking at Consumer Credit to Savings Rate Historically**

Hey everyone, so an interesting trend I noticed around Christmas time was the rapid expansion in consumer credit at the same time that consumer savings rates were drawing down. One can easily see how this may be bearish, although some people mentioned to me it could be bullish in that it indicates strong consumer sentiment about the forward economy.

So I decided to look at this from a more analytical and historical perspective. It turns out that there was a big spike in this ratio that times almost perfectly with the past two market tops. Data further back than that is a little murkier since consumer credit was far less than what we have now and the interest rates were much higher, leading to increased savings rates. 

I did account for interest rates in the calculations so that the savings rate is more ""normalized"" based off the risk free rate (I used 2 year bond yields as a proxy for this). 

**My two cents**

Consumer credit is inflationary int he short term, but deflationary in the long term. Much of 2017's growth was spurred by consumers taking on credit risk once again. That is good in the short term since the economy grows based on consumer spending. But once consumer savings run out, that forces consumers to either tap additional credit to keep up their spending habits, or to decrease their spending, which results in economic slowdowns. This results in either a economic slowdown, or a bigger growth in credit bubbles, only to result in bigger drawdowns down the line.

Based on this chart, we can see that the major indicator is when the slowdown (or drop after the peak) occurs after a big spike in the consumer credit to savings rate ratio. Fundamentally, this indicates that consumers are having a tough time paying their bills and that companies will see tougher time growing revenue in the face of increased consumer spending. It is a natural fit for a timer of market tops.

Everyone can draw their own conclusions. All data is taken from FRED.",finance
personalfinance,If I have a CC that is ~90% full is it a smart decision to apply for a new CC with 0% APR that I can use to pay off the first card and then start trying to tackle the 0% APR card instead?,"Like the title says I have a CC that is about 90% full through my credit union bank. It has a $3,000 limit and it's at about $2,750 from my wedding this summer. The interest on the card and the payments have been too high for me to make any headway in paying it off. I was wondering if I got a new CC with about the same limit (if possible) would it be a wise decision to use the new credit card to pay off the existing one with $2,750 on it and begin making payments on the new card that has a more manageable interest rate? 

I am in my late 20's and my wife and I are about to move to a new area where we will be able to earn and save probably about 20% more than what we are managing right now. My brother suggested the idea of getting a new CC to pay off the old one and that way I can have a better interest rate in the new card, while simultaneously building credit by keeping the old CC empty and out of commission. Am I completely naive about how credit works? Is this plan even slightly feasible?

Insurance- $133.00/mo

Rent- $495.00/mo

Internet- $150.00/mo

Food- $100/mo (i cut this wayyyyy down) it kinda sucks (WE DO NOT HAVE STATE/GOVT ASSISTANCE) this was a challenge but achieveable. kind of feel like maybe it could be higher?

Fuel- $120.00/mo

Allowance(Fun money) $100.00/mo (split between wife and I) I know we have debt and such, but i feel like this isnt enough maybe? I dont like feeling like im working to work.

Vape supplies $80.00/mo *These are currently not budgeted for*

DEBT:

CC1-- MIN PAYMENT 30 (Remaining balance:1000)

CC2--MIN PAYMENT 25 (Remaining balance:492)

CC3--MIN PAYMENT 25 (Remaining balance:444)

CC4--MIN PAYMENT 39 (Remaining balance:778)

CC5--MIN PAYMENT 65 (Remaining balance:2192)

CC6--MIN PAYMENT 25 (Remaining balance:769)

CC7--MIN PAYMENT 46 (Remaining balance:1165)

CC8--MIN PAYMENT 35 (Remaining balance:596)

Loan1--MIN PAYMENT 114 (Remaining balance:2264)

Loan2--MIN PAYMENT 60 (Remaining balance:1110)

CC11--MIN PAYMENT 15 (Remaining balance:470)

Loan3--MIN PAYMENT 34 (Remaining balance:343)

CC13--MIN PAYMENT 30 (Remaining balance:550)

ALL CC's have the same Interest rates or negligible difference in rate.

I chose BTC as a payment method, got redirected to BitPay. It asked me to pick if I want to pay with BTC or BCH, showing me the ludicrous BTC fee and 0.00€ BCH fee.

I picked BCH to check if I have enough of it to pay. I hadn't. **Shortfall 1: There was no way to go back to the currency choice, I had to wait 15 minutes for BitPay to cancel my payment. There was no way to just go back.**

After waiting 15 minutes I was redirected back to the checkout and once again picked Bitcoin. On BitPay I chose Bitcoin this time. Got a QR code, so I open up my Coinbase wallet and try to scan it. **Shortfall 2: It doesn't work. BitPay goes out their way not to disclose their Bitcoin address, you must use their wallet. or one specifically compatible with BitPay.** 

If I wanted to move my money from Coinbase to BitPay wallet I would first have to pay the fee for moving from wallet to wallet, then pay the fee second time when finally paying BitPay.

So, I go to shapeshift.io and try to exchange my BTC for BCH so that I don't get billed the transaction fee just once, not twice. I put in my Coinbase BTC address as the source, and my BitPay wallet BCH address as the destination. I click ""Start transaction"" and get slapped with ""There was an error creating your order, please try again in a few minutes."" **Shortfall 3: Either BitPay or Coinbase somehow creates addresses that shapeshift deems invalid and doesn't allow moving funds to.** 

At this point, I could've gotten a different wallet, gave it to shapeshift, then move BCH from my wallet to BitPay wallet, but I gave up. I didn't even order a pizza, I was too fed up with that experience.

Now, you might think: Go to the bitcoin subreddit, this is just a Bitcoin rant. **YES, IT IS**, in the minds of most people Bitcoin == Crypto and we should do everything against that notion. 

Bitcoin is obsolete technology. We should do everything to make any company that accepts Bitcoin move to something newer. There's Ethereum, Monero, Zcash, all better in every regard in comparison to Bitcoin.

Imagine how the process of buying this pizza would look had it used Ethereum. I would press the ""Order"" button, see a MetaMask confirmation prompt, just press ""Confirm"", and be on my way, while in the backend the smart contract takes my Ether, immediately exchanges it for Dai to protect the pizzeria from volatility, all without the 10 minute wait, no $1 fee, no central authority processing the transaction.

This will give me $600 leftover before my second income, for entertainment, gifts, etc. I need to build up my emergency fund to 3 months, and then start putting that money into debt, I think. 

My rent lease is up in August. I have 10k for a dowb payment, and I would for sure have 1 roommate living with me, who I could charge $500-600/month. Possibly two roommates for the first year. 

&amp;nbsp;

Does this budget seem reasonable? Should I give it another year? Homes I'm looking at near Minneapolis range from 1000-1500 sq/ft, and $170-225k. Let me know if I missed anything.

&gt; Federal regulators are seeking a $1 billion payment from Wells Fargo to settle problems with mortgage and auto loan issues, along with compliance risk management concerns, the bank said Friday as it reported its first-quarter earnings.

&gt; Although the finances reported by the financial giant topped Wall Street forecasts, the San Francisco-based bank warned that the results are subject to change due to continuing talks with the regulators.

&gt; If levied, a collective $1 billion penalty by the two regulators would be the highest-ever fine imposed by the consumer bureau. It could reduce Wells Fargo's first-quarter profit by approximately 20%, Kyle Sanders, an Edward Jones financial analyst, wrote in a research note issued Friday.

&gt; Sanders estimated a potential $1 billion penalty could lower Wells Fargo's first-quarter earnings per share to nearly 91 cents.",finance
personalfinance,Debt Refinancing/Pay Down Plan Advice,"So long story short, my wife and i are in the process of buckling down to pay off debt asap. We have an emergency fund. We plan to reshuffle debt through refinancing in order to help with that after determining our rates could be much better. So heres the numbers:

Wife credit cards  173/m 7977 total 20% interest
Car loan 262/m 7712 about 2.5 yrs left
My private student loans 740.73/m 69137 total avg apr of about 8.5%.
Her private student loans 90.73/m 3054 total avg apr of 9%.
Our credit scores are both over 700 and improveing multiple pts a month. Theyd get even better after the cc utilization is improved.... the biggest ding to our credit right now.

We have a mortgage, fed loans, and a few other small bills but those are low interest or will be eligible for forgiveness in reasonable time. Our focus is on the above. 

Our plan is to get a debt consolidation loan from lending club. We found we are preapproved for a 16k 3 yr 9.34% fixed loan to cover the cc debt and car for $501/m; increasing our monthly payments $65. Also wed refinance and combine our private student loans into a 73k 20 year at 6.44% and only $542/m; saving $291/m. This would net us $230/m profit.

We would take this saving and apply most of it to the new consolidation loan to pay it off even sooner. (And providing a liquid cushion for ourselves over the next 3 years if needed) Once we had that paid off in 3 years, we would refinance the student loans again. Were preapproved now for a 73k 5 year fixed at $1419/m; costing $586/m more than now and $877 more than the 20 yr would. This would be easy as wed have the extra $501/m from paying down the CC plus the 3 years of payments in the mean time. 

Essentially we pay off debt in 8 years rather than over 10. We also plan to throw any extra money at our debt when possible(tax returns, etc) and intend for salary increases to pay for any cost increases, that we may have with our kids, home, etc over time. 

Were curious as to what some of you might see that we may be missing. Were aware that rates could increase and hurt us, but wat are the chances that it would cause a loss? Can we find a consolidation loan thats shorter term to save on rates? Would we be further off just paying extra without refinancing, refinancing one and/or paying extra after 1 'side' paid down, or executing the above plan? Lastly is refinancing the student loans 2 times in a 3 year period feasible?

Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on how best to tackle current debt.,"Hello all,
          I am looking to move in July and with this my rent will increase so therefore my monthly expenses. I'm looking to reduce the amount i have going out each month which should be a given. I currently have 2 credit cards and an Auto loan i'm paying on.

The Auto loan has an interest rate of 12.99% with monthly payments of $356.68. It's maturity date is 12/22/2021. I really do not wish to be paying this amount each month for that length of time. The car is currently upside down with a loan buyout of $12,365.88 and an approxiamate vallue of $10,000.

One credit card is $4,100.47 / $5,500 with an APR of 18.49%

the other credit card is $1,402.75 / $4,500 with an apr of 23.74%.

I am primarily focusing on paying off the high APR credit card but would like to know if it would be smart or not to consolidate my credit card debt or take out a personal loan. 

I have a preapproved offer from chase to REFI my auto loan at 5.84% for 48 months which would take my monthly auto payment down to approxiamately 318. 

My Fico credit score is being reported at 742 so i think my credit is fairly good. What would be the best approach for me to take in my sittuation and if you do not have the time/ feel like working this out, is there some sort of tool i can plug some of this information into to ge answers.

As I could expect, the transaction on my chase credit card was denied.  Called chase and they said it was crypto.

I tried on my navy federal debit.  The transaction failed and I received a fraud text from navy federal.  I confirmed the transaction was legitimate but it still failed the next 3 times.

Finally I called Navy Federal fully expecting it is because of crypto, partly because I have read a post form someone saying Navy federal didn't let them purchase crypto.  Turns out nothing was stopping it on there end...it was on visa's end  ... AND IT WASNT CRYPTO AT ALL STOPPING IT .
Uphold.com has a special feature called verified by visa.  Navy federal had to talk to me over the phone and send me a special code.  They waited on the phone with me as they gave the code to uphold/visa and the transaction went through !

personalfinance,Not sure why I can’t get ahead. Wondering if I should get third job?,"This is my first post so I apologize if it’s been asked before. 

I am recently single and 30 years old. I work a full time job M-F 8-5 and an as needed job whenever they need me or I can work. 

I currently make $17.50/hr at my full time job and I put 5% of my income into a Roth and 5% into a traditional IRA as I didn’t know which was better. My employer matches 3% for a total of 8% into each. On top of all of this, my health, dental, and eye insurance all comes from my paycheck and that leaves me to clear about $950 bi-weekly. I make around $14 an hour at my as needed job so I do not count this income as it is not consistent. 

So here’s the breakdown of my expenses. I do not have a car payment, cable, or internet. I do own my home. I have about $250 in savings and $0 in checkings. 

Mortgage: $307/mo
Cell phone: $116/mo (unlimited everything through Verizon) 
Student loan A: $4200 ($100/mo) - through my bank 
Student loan B: ~$20K ($23/mo) - my federal loans which are under income based repayment 
Water and Electric- ~$200/mo (has been higher since winter)
Cars: I have 2 cars- a 2015 Civic and a 1999 Wrangler both paid for but maintenance and gas is roughly $100/mo at most 
Car Insurance(both cars): $720/ 6 mos
Food: ~$150/mo (maybe) I don’t eat out often
Personal loan through family: $5000 (no set monthly payment- just pay whenever)
Medical bills: Varies- but lately it’s been $400+ each month as I have a heart condition as well cluster migraines that are out of control - and MRIs are EXPENSIVE! 
Credit Cards: I have 2. One has about ~$400 balance. One has roughly ~$70. 
Pets/Random expenses: $100/mo if that

If I total my monthly expenses it comes out to around $1K give or take a month as it does vary due to my medical bills. 
I clear around $1,900 a month without including my as needed job income. So I am unsure as to why I have zero savings and continue to live paycheck to paycheck. I have nothing in collections and everything is paid up to date. I feel like I’m struggling to get air every day and get caught up. My partner did assist with the bills when living here, however the help was not completely consistent and I actually have more money now than I did when my partner was living with me. Do you all think I should get another job on weekends and evenings for awhile until I can get caught up? I don’t live an extravagant lifestyle and the things I do have are not new. So I don’t understand why I can’t get caught up. Any advice would be appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,ITT grad: my private student loans were just forgiven,"UPDATE, 4/16

Okay, I got in touch with the company today. They were basically useless. They couldn't tell me why my loan was forgiven. They couldn't tell me if I should expect a form 1099-C in the mail. They couldn't tell me what the forgiven amount was. They even said that I was a few months behind on my payments at the time it was forgiven, which was not true; I've got bank statements showing the autodrafted payments through May. They've stripped all historical information from their site; I can't look at statements on my loan anymore.

It's a happy mystery, but it's still a mystery, and not knowing whether it's a tax liability or not is bothering me.

ORIGINAL POST:

So yesterday I got a letter in the mail and a check. The letter informed me that my private student loans from ITT Tech have been forgiven; they are now at a zero balance and I owe no more. The check was for, presumably, the payments I made on the loan between the time they decided to forgive them and now, though no reason was provided.

I have not applied for any sort of loan forgiveness on this loan, though I've attempted to refinance it a few times, never successfully. I have applied for forgiveness against my Federal loans, but that's not gone anywhere. I did a quick news search to see if there are any big stories about loan forgiveness; I can't have been the only one.

Anyone have any ideas? I'm ecstatic, but I wish I knew to whom I owe the thanks!",finance
BlockChain,Blockchain to improve representative democracy!?,"Hello community, almost all of us might think no one is living in a real ""democracy"" so how about this kinda idea:

-An digital Asset that gives you the right to vote, once you proofed your citizenship.

-Voting Token will be airdropped once major decision appears (privacy ,humanity rights,economic changes,social changes,war, social crisis)

let's say a lot of people participate when crypto gets more adption, and they get the right to vote with their token for several decisions with a basic yes or no. Wouldn't this create some kind of decentralized ""mindset"" which could be used by new political partys to implement a better democracy in the world and regain trust.

the most important point is that the representatives need to act on what the majority voted for, this can be achieved by being transparent from the beginning.

I think this could be a way to actually reach REAL democracy in countrys that are controlled by the industry and several politicians that get paid.
To make this actually work - this token can't be sent to other wallets (of citizen) to reject people who are trying to buy those token. this factor makes the token untradeable on exchanges - which is clearly not the use case and it would make it a non profit decentralized platform.

do you guys have any improvements for this, or figured out some points that make this ""theory"" invalid? im happy if this leads to a little discussion on representative politics and why they don't work - and will NEVER work.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Looking for advice on student loan repayment strategy,"I graduated two years ago and have been laser focused on paying my student loans since then. I have gotten them down from $105k total (yikes) to about $65k currently, on a very low to median salary. I have been mainly focusing on my private loans, as they had a semi high and variable interest rate but I have thrown some extra money at my highest rate unsubsidized federal loans as well.

Recently, two things changed: 1) I was finally able to refinance my private loans to a lower interest rate and 2) my federal loan minimum payment increased from $0 to $189 after recertifying. 

I don't know if I should continue to focus on the private loans now that the interest rate is lower than some of my federal loans.

I plan on going to graduate school in 2-3 years (for a Master's, self-funded) so at that point I would not owe payments on the federal loans, but would still have to pay on the private. My original thinking was to have the private loans paid off before starting school, but that will take too long. I may try to refinance again if I can get ~3% interest rate and lower payments.  

I also think it would be nice to have the unsubsidized federal loans paid off, since interest will accrue while in school, but some of those have pretty low interest and they are the bulk of my federal loans. So, I'm not sure what the best way is. 

Currently:

**Private Loans:**

~$37,500 @ 4.41% fixed, min payment $475

**Federal Loans:** 

~$24,600 total, min payment $189

Subsidized: *interest on these does not accrue while in school and is 100% subsidized during REPAYE if not covered by monthly payments*

$2,418.58 @ 3.150%

$1,534.00 @ 3.610%

$4,322.50 @ 4.250%

$1,920.00 @ 4.410%

Unsubsidized: *interest accrues while in school and 50% is paid by REPAYE subsidy*

$6,138.93 @ 3.610%

$8,040.77 @ 6.550%

Federal interest rates are fixed and include .25% autopay discount.

I have about $200-300 extra in my monthly budget, plus variable income from my side job ($75-400/mo).

When I saw this my stomach dropped, I was hoping to spend like $20,000. That's around $345 a month in payments.

It is apparently supposed to save me $150 a month on my electric bills, which are now outrageously high ($400-$750 for a 1200sqft house). I am mainly doing this to save on electric costs and have redundancy for when the power goes out.

I get a 30% federal tax credit on the system, so $9000, and Massachusetts gives me $1000 state tax credits. If I get this installed before the summer, I get enrolled in their ""SREC"" system, where for every 1000 kWh, I get a credit to sell on the open market. About 8 total giving me $1200-$2000/year depending on the market demand.

First off, I have a decent windfall from my tax return. I purposely made sure I would get a return despite the fact that I know it's a ""free loan"" to Uncle Sam. The total I have to play with is $10,000.

Second, I have $7,000 in credit card debt. Part of this is vet bills. I found out the ugly truth of ""deferred interest"" when the bill came due for that. Ouch. Got me good. The debt is split 3/4000 if that matters.

Third, I need a ""new to me"" vehicle. I'm looking at a Honda CRV, roughly $10,000, hopefully 2011. This is as old as I want to get, I'm planning on running it to the ground (15 years or more).

I don't have a set time frame for getting the vehicle, paying the debt down is obviously priority one. In about 3 months I definitely need this vehicle though.

My tentative plan is to pay at least half (or a decent portion) of the CC debt. When that hits my credit report (and hopefully improves the score)  open up a new account with a credit union offering zero interest balance transfer and transfer as much as I can from the CCs. Once this is accomplished and my score is decent enough (currently 630) to get a nice interest rate on an auto loan, I want to get the CRV. I plan to also set aside $1500 in the mean time for an efund to be added to weekly. 

Does this plan make sense? How would you guys go about this? I know the debt is hair on fire, and I plan to address it, but I really need the vehicle. Thanks for reading!",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans are drowning us.,"The facts:

I'm an example of over borrowing and not understanding what was being signed by myself and my parents.  It's my biggest regret in life how I went about paying for college, but I've managed to secure a decent job/living as has my wife.  I've reached a point where I feel like I may be able to make a dent in some of this, but my wife and I are not sure how to completely tackle it.

My Student Loan Debt:

$45,000 via Navient (avg. interest rate 6.8% across 10 loans)
$54,000 via MyFedLoan (Parent Plus Loans in my Parent's name) - Has $12,000 interest about to capitalize because they were put in deferment for the past year. - avg. interest rate 7.9% across 8 loans)

Wife's Debt - 65,000 via MyFedLoan - avg. interest rate 4.45 across 14 loans - Currently In Grace Period (ends in June)

Current Payment ""Plan""
I am on the IDR plan with the Navient Loans - The payment is minimal (about $200) currently.
The MyFedLoan payment is predicting to be $891 on the Standard Plan.

My wife's payment, on a standard plan, will likely be $600+.


My questions are this:  I can't do anything about the Parent Plus loans because they're in my Parent's name.  The balance of those loans will not impact loans in my name or my wife' s name.  Is there a good way to refinance them to make the payment more affordable/better interest rate?

Secondly - I don't want to pay on these loans for 25 years.  However, is it best to choose a plan that has lower payments so I can begin paying on top of it to more quickly eliminate higher interest loans?

My Wife works at a large hospital that is a Non Profit hospital - Perhaps she qualifies for PSLF?

* Internet/TV: $100
* Utilities: $250

* Groceries/Daily: $900
* $4200 total not including student loans

* We have no other debt aside from Cars/Mortgage.  Cars will be paid off in 2 years and we intend to ride them until they no longer function.

That leaves us $2675 for savings/student loans.  Ideally we'd put $1500 towards Student Loans and continue to save the other $1175. Across 10 years that's accounting for $180,000.  I can expect 3-5% raises annually and my wife can expect about 3%.

worldpolitics,WW2 the lies! About Germans and jews!,"The Haavara Agreement (Hebrew: הסכם העברה Translit.: heskem haavara Translated:""transfer agreement"") was an agreement between Nazi Germany and Zionist German Jews signed on 25 August 1933. The agreement was finalized after three months of talks by the Zionist Federation of Germany, the Anglo-Palestine Bank (under the directive of the Jewish Agency) and the economic authorities of Nazi Germany. It was a major factor in making possible the migration of approximately 60,000 German Jews to Palestine in 1933–1939.[1]

The agreement enabled Jews fleeing persecution under the new Nazi regime to transfer some portion of their assets to British Mandatory Palestine.[2] Emigrants sold their assets in Germany to pay for essential goods (manufactured in Germany) to be shipped to Mandatory Palestine.[3][4] The agreement was controversial at the time, and was criticised by many Jewish leaders both within the Zionist movement (such as the Revisionist Zionistleader Ze'ev Jabotinsky) and outside it, as well as by members of the NSDAP and members of the German public.[4] For German Jews, the agreement offered a way to leave an increasingly hostile environment in Germany; for the Yishuv, the new Jewish community in Palestine, it offered access to both immigrant labor and economic support; for the Germans it facilitated the emigration of German Jews while breaking the anti-Nazi boycott of 1933, which had mass support among European Jews and was thought by the German state to be a potential threat to the German economy.[4][5]

Background

Although the NSDAP won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority, so Hitler led a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the German National People's Party.[6] Under pressure from politicians, industrialists and others, President Paul von Hindenburgappointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the Machtergreifung (seizure of power).[7] In the following months, the NSDAP used a process termed Gleichschaltung (co-ordination) to consolidate power.[8] By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches.[9]

Within the Nazi movement, a variety of (increasingly radical) ""solutions"" to the ""Jewish Question"" were proposed both before and after the NSDAP was in government, including expulsion and the encouragement of voluntary emigration. Widespread civil persecution of German Jews began as soon as the NSDAP was in power.[10] For example, on 1 April, the NSDAP organized a nationwide boycott of Jewish-owned businesses in Germany; under the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which was implemented on 7 April, Jews were excluded from the civil service; on 25 April, quotas were imposed on the number of Jews in schools and universities. Jews outside Germany responded to these persecutions with a boycott of German goods.

Meanwhile, in Mandatory Palestine, a growing Jewish population (174,610 in 1931, rising to 384,078 in 1936[11]) was acquiring land and developing the structures of a future Jewish state despite opposition from the Arab population.

The Transfer Agreement

“CERTIFICATE

The Trust and Transfer Office ""Haavara"" Ltd. places at the disposal of the Banks in Palestine amounts in Reichmarks which have been put at its disposal by the Jewish immigrants from Germany. The Banks avail themselves of these amounts in Reichmarks in order to make payments on behalf of Palestinian merchants for goods imported by them from Germany. The merchants pay in the value of the goods to the Banks and the ""Haavara"" Ltd. pays the countervalue to the Jewish immigrants from Germany. To the same extent that local merchants will make use of this arrangement, the import of German goods will serve to withdraw Jewish capital from Germany.
The Trust and Transfer Office,
HAAVARA, LTD.

”— Example of the certificate issued by Haavara to Jews emigrating to Palestine

The Haavara (Transfer) Agreement, negotiated by Eliezer Hoofein, director of the Anglo-Palestine Bank,[16] was agreed to by the Reich Economics Ministry in 1933, and continued, with declining German government support,[17] until it was wound up in 1939.[18]Under the agreement, Jews emigrating from Germany could use their assets to purchase German-manufactured goods for export, thus salvaging their personal assets during emigration. The agreement provided a substantial export market for German factories to British-ruled Palestine. Between November, 1933, and December 31, 1937, 77,800,000 Reichmarks, or $22,500,000, (values in 1938 currency) worth of goods were exported to Jewish businesses in Palestine under the program.[17] By the time the program ended with the start of World War II, the total had risen to 105,000,000 marks (about $35,000,000, 1939 values).[18]

Emigrants with capital of £1,000, (about $5,000 in 1930s currency value) could move to Palestine in spite of severe British restrictions on Jewish immigration under an immigrant investor program similar to the modern EB-5 visa. Under the Transfer Agreement, about 39% of an emigrant's funds were given to Jewish communal economic development projects, leaving individuals with about 43% of the funds.[19][20]

The Haavara Agreement was thought among some German circles to be a possible way solve the ""Jewish problem."" The head of the Middle Eastern division of the foreign ministry, the anti-NSDAP politician Werner Otto von Hentig, supported the policy of settling Jews in Palestine. Hentig believed that if the Jewish population was concentrated in a single foreign entity, then foreign diplomatic policy and containment of the Jews would become easier.[21] Hitler's own support of the Haavara Agreement was unclear and varied throughout the 1930s. Initially, Hitler seemed indifferent to the economic details of the plan, but he supported it in the period from September 1937 to 1939.[22]

After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 the program was ended",finance

I worked full time (W2) with an income of ~59k. I have zero withholdings and I know that’s frowned upon because it’s an interest free loan to the government but I’d rather get something back (which always goes into savings) than have to pay at this stage in my life. 

I also had a short contract job (1099 misc) that paid 1250. No taxes taken out so I knew I’d owe there. 

My federal return was 1700. Is there any way you can help me understand why I owe nearly 1100 to state? Do I really keep very little of my contract money? I didn’t think I was high enough in the tax bracket. Or is this a better question for someplace else?

[Here's a study from the Kansas City Fed](https://research.stlouisfed.org/wp/more/1996-006)

Technical analysis is not intended to be predictive of future price moves. It's a method of risk management that, primarily, allows you to identify asymmetric bets. Their usefulness has much less to do with ""self fulfilling prophecies"" and other mumbo jumbo. 

Edit: The sub is nothing if not consistent. Level of discourse is disappointing, this sub used to have productive conversations. On the plus side, the visceral reaction from people toward TA is heartening -- means lots of people are ignoring a useful risk management tool. I think the commentary below tells you a lot more about the person making the comment, and their biases, than it does about TA and its usefulness.

personalfinance,Doctors don't get enough education on managing debt,"Hello everyone,

I will go on a rant about debt management education in the medical field and also my personal situation.

So first off, I have been in college for 4 years, medical school for 4 years. I am currently on year 1/3 of my residency training (doctor in training) and possibly if I decide to pursue a fellowship which is for specialty training, it would be another 3 years of training. During these 11, possibly 14 years of training. Most people, unless you're fortunate enough to have a wealthy family who can for your medical education are stuck with a 6 figure debt. The average debt being  $190k in 2016 (source: https://www.studentdebtrelief.us/news/average-medical-school-debt/).

And back in 2011, they got rid of subsidized loans for medical school loans (source: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/no-more-subsidized-loans/). Which means we were accruing interest on loans we couldn't pay back while in medical school. Our schedules and studies don't allow us to hold a side job. For the government, it's a low risk loan as most of us will graduate and be able to slowly pay back our loans. I don't get how they got  away with this without any push back, but like I said, a lot of people going into the medical field are not aware of these changes or don't have the time to care.

Anyways, I'm currently a first year resident making $50k a year. Our salaries only go up $51k,$53k for our following 2 years. So not a significant amount. I bought a house for $180k on a doctors mortgage, meaning no down payment was necessary and my interest rate is 3.625%. I couldn't stand living in a 1 bedroom apartment/studio anymore. Whether this was a good financial decision or not I don't know, but it makes my quality of life immensely better. Money can't really replace that so I'm happy with my decision.

In terms of my debt. I'm sitting on $110k with a interest rate of 6.8%. So I am doing better than the average but her is where I need your advice. I am currently paying back the minimum based on my income which is around $280/month. After my mortgage, car payments, utilities, life insurance, and other miscellaneous expenses; I don't have much else to pay back. I am currently single and doesn't look like I'll be marrying anytime soon. And assuming I won't go into a fellowship, I'll be making around 175k -225k depending on where I practice. I could be doing shifts on the weekends at an urgent care or emergency department which pays around 1-1.5k a shift to increase my income. I plan to live within my means and not by a new car, not buy expensive clothes or toys until I can fully pay back my loans. Other than my seemingly simple plan, can you guys help me better my financial situation? What books or resources can I read to increase my knowledge so I can better my future? I am a doctor, but that doesn't mean I know anything else other than my field so starting from the basics is what I need. And yes, I have read the white coat investor.

On a side note, I do have about $14k sitting on some stocks. Would it be wise to sell my shares and put it towards my loan now or be hopeful that my shares will increase at a rate greater than my interest?",finance

personalfinance,"Drowning in a debt mess of my own making, losing sleep. I don't know what to do and I don't know how much longer I can do this.","In essence, I'm experiencing a personal debt crisis of my own making, due to poor choices, lob loss, more poor choices, ignoring collection calls because of my own anxieties and generally acting stupid. I know. I feel like this is the scariest thing I've ever faced in my life, and I need help.

I'm 28 and I feel like I've already ruined my financial life. I'll try but inevitably fail to be brief on the backstory. When I turned 18, I got my first credit card. I was extremely stupid with it, as a kid working a crappy part-time job, I used it to buy shit I couldn't afford. I could barely make minimum payments, let alone pay it off month-to-month. This continued through college.

It was all sort of fine for a bit after I graduated and got a full-time big-boy job. I got my debts current, I was slowly paying down things, although I didn't have a lot of income with which to do so. I was making $35k a year. The credit card debt was about $7K, spread amongst 3 or 4 cards with atrocious interest rates. I was barely able to save money. I put about $1,000 in a 401(k) over the span of 3 years.

Flash forward to 2015 and I had a personal crisis. I got very drunk and got arrested, essentially for resisting police officers who were trying to stop me from running around a main road and getting myself killed. I lost my job. I went to rehab. I was facing two felony charges. (Somehow, this debt situation is scarier to me than that).

I got myself back together, quit drinking, got a job about 6 months later. Of course, my debts had fallen behind, as my income had fallen to $0. I liquidated my puny 401(k) to pay off some expenses, but it didn't last long. My new job was a significant pay cut - I started out at $25K. I could barely afford rent and utilities, let along anything else. My debts fell further and further behind and I just figured ""I'll deal with this when I'm back on my feet fully.""

I was literally afraid of the collection calls. I have a lot of anxiety issues, I get panic attacks easily, and I figured ""well, I don't have any money for these people, why bother talking to them.""

Oh, and rehab generated its own $1,200 bill. So that's fun.

After 3ish years at my new job I'm up to making about $32K, which is more comfortable. I want to get my finances in order, but don't know where to start. I still only have about $400 in savings, and I live paycheck-to-paycheck generally.

I've got $3,104 in collections. I've got $6,319 in closed accounts that are still with their original creditor, if I'm reading that right. I've got $40,445 in student loans, all federal, which I keep current and is the debt I worry the least about. Payment terms are very flexible.

My most pressing issue: A collection agency (Calvary Portfolio Services) with a $1,951 debt (originally a Citi card) is threatening to sue me. I got a demand letter from Federated Law, saying unless I dispute the debt within 30 days, they will assume the debt is valid.

personalfinance,"Fresh College Grad, what do I do now?","I'll be a fresh college grad come next month at 22. I'm pretty excited, but I realized I'm completely unprepared for the real world, and what that brings.

This is my current financial situation as far as I know:

A: I start work in June. I make roughly 4700 USD/mo after state and federal taxes, but this figure is before
any voluntary 401k/IRA/Health insurance contributions. I have roughly 1.5k in savings to tide myself over until I start collecting paychecks. 

B: I owe 6k on an unsecured Stafford loan that I plan to start paying off once the grace period ends. I owe my parents the rest of the 80k for my 4 year, in state, college tuition, but their plan for me paying that off is, verbatim, ""pay us as much as you think you can afford each month, and we will be happy."" I owe no other debt to any
other financial institutions besides from that. I've had a credit card for a few years that I pay off in full every month, and have a score around 725. 

C: I currently plan to live with my parents for 3-4 months, which they are 100% okay with, until I can save enough money to move out. I figure 10k in savings should be enough to move out, although I live in a high COL area (D.C/Metro). I have a friend I want to room with, as I'm not a person who wants to live by themself. 

D: My parents want me to stay on their health insurance until I hit the legal age, but I plan to pay for some coverage as provided by my company. My company covers 50% of any insurance monthlies. 

E: My dad spends a lot of time out of the country due to his job, so he told me I can drive his car for as long
as I'd like. He drives a relatively recent year CRV. Although, I do plan to purchase my own, probably few years used, car, in the coming months.

My question is, is there anything I should be doing, that I might have missed, to prepare myself for being a mostly self sufficient adult?

We're a family of two, earning about $23,000/year, so based on [this calculator](http://safetyweb.org/fpl.php) we are at roughly 140% of the federal poverty level. Given this, the maximum we should have to repay should be $600: that is what both the [KFF](https://www.kff.org/health-reform/faq/health-reform-frequently-asked-questions/attachment/repayment-limits-for-advance-premium-tax-credits-2017-tax-year/) and the [IRS website itself](https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/individuals-and-families/four-things-to-know-about-advance-payments-of-the-premium-tax-credit) says, so something isn't right.

Income: $90,000/year, $5,000/mo take home,   $6,000 in variable income/year 

Bills: $500/mo in student and personal loans, $1750/mo rent, ~$500/mo utilities (phone, heat, elect, tv/internet), $350/mo groceries, $200/mo shopping. 

Savings: currently $15,000 savings in the US and €5000 in Ireland with an additional €4000 we can't touch until a personal loan (~€6000 left on the loan) is paid off. 

Credit: score 630 (&lt;$2500 in overdue accounts, some I dispute - for example, $900 electric bill in Cali where they didn't shut me off wheb requested and next tenant ran the bill until they shut it off for a total of $600) I used to not care about this stuff though I should have. 

No credit cards. We don't buy what we can't immediately pay for.

I am incredibly anxious about money and savings because I work in tech and have been laid off a few times due to acquisitions, finance issues and pivots. Gaps in work were ~3-5 months when this happened. I would qualify for roughly $650/week unemployment if this happened. My husband could go work construction for ~$600/week take home if this happened. 

Can we afford to buy a used car? If so, cash, finance or lease, and what should our price range be? We're not flashy and just want something reliable. 

We were quoted 10.39% interest rate w $200/mo for a 2015 used sedan with warranty with good gas mileage  (~$11,000 all pre-interest fees considered). Insurance would be  $200/mo.

We've considered a used car (2014 sedan ~70k mi)  $7200 cash. 

Also, how much should we realistically be saving per month? We hope to move back to Ireland in 3-5 years and buy a home for €250-310,000). First time buyers only need 10% down, but we'd want a bit more to alleviate monthly payment (i would likely make way less there, €60-70,000/year before tax) 

Tldr: One income, 5k/mo take home, $3000/mo in bills we can't cut back, $1000 in bills we can probably cut to $500. ~$15,000 in savings. Can we buy a car? If so for how much and in what way? Any suggestions for savings/budget with a goal of buying a house in a few years?",finance

M0 is 1.2 trillion dollars.
M1 is 2.5 trillion dollars
M2 is 10.5 trillion dollars.

#1. Even taking into account the M3 money supply, we owe more money than there exists. 

#2. The republicans are going to fast track our debt even higher.

investing,Bonds vs. Bonds ETFs (during a crisis/recession),"I know very well that bonds are something that can be sold at a higher price when times are rough, because the Government will adjusts its monetary policies according to the economy, and the interest rate usually fall so that people spend more and limit the damage of the recession. While that is true for bonds (correct me if it isn't), i was wondering if it is also true for Bonds ETFs. At first they seem to offer the same thing, but the ETFs are way more liquid and they cannot be exchanged for the ""Bond original value"".

I actually want to greatly reduce the % of stocks i have to take cover and hedge, but i am not sure if Bonds ETFs are a good idea and if they are great during bad times. 

Thanks for the help.

Edit: According to Investopedia

«Bond ETFs are a great option to gain exposure to the bond market, but there are some glaring limitations. For one thing, an investor's initial investment is at greater risk in an ETF than an individual bond. Since a bond ETF never matures, there isn't a guarantee the principal will be repaid in full. Furthermore, when interest rates rise it tends to have an adverse effect on the price of the ETF, like an individual bond. As the ETF does not mature, however, it's difficult to mitigate interest rate risk.»",finance
personalfinance,I am a high school senior about to go into student debt. Help me get this right.,"**Who am I?**

I am an 18 year old high school senior, and I am attending Vanderbilt in the fall to study some field of engineering, likely biomedical. I applied under the EDII decision plan, so pretty much no matter what I am attending Vanderbilt for at least one year.

**Whats the situation?**

I applied for financial aid and I was awarded $3,500/yr from the TN Hope Scholarship and $58,869/yr in a need-based grant, totaling $62,369 in aid for the 2018-2019 school year. My financial aid letter lists the estimated cost of attendance as $73,501. (This figure also includes $1,294 in book costs, and nearly $3,000 in ""Personal/Misc Allowance"", so if I'm smart about that I could probably save an additional $1000). This leaves my yearly estimated family contribution to be about $11,132. For four years, assuming no changes in the EFC, that totals $44,528.

**What are my loan options?**

Vanderbilt fin aid makes it pretty clear that they don't think taking out loans is a good idea. Nevertheless, they direct students to three different options:

* *Undergraduate Federal Loans*: This includes Federal Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans and Federal Perkins Loans. As I understand it, it's highly unlikely that my family would qualify for the Perkins loans.
* *Federal Direct Parent (Plus) Loans*: This is where the parent is the borrower. This is not an option as I will be the one taking on student loans, not my parents.
* *Private Alternative Loans*: This is where Vandy really starts throwing up red flags and 'turn back now' signs. They advise students to only use private loans as an absolute last resort, and I have no intention of using these if at all possible.

So basically, my only option currently is Federal Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans (If you understand what that means, then skip to the next section since me writing this out is really more for my own benefit and understanding than anyone else's).

* *Subsidized*: These loans are where interest on the loan is federally subsidized and covered while I'm in college.
* *Unsubsidized*: With these, interest accumulates and basically becomes part of the loan when I graduate.

These loans have a fixed interest rate of 4.45% and an origination fee of 1.066%. The maximum borrowing limits are as follows:

* 1st Year Student: $5,500 combined/$3,500 max for subsidized
* 2nd Year Student: $6,500 combined/$4,500 max for subsidized
* 3rd/4th Year Student: $7,500 combined/$5,500 max for subsidized

If I max out on the loans, that works out to a grand total of $27,000 in student debt, not taking into account interest.

So, if I were to take out the maximum loan possible each year, I would be left with these out-of-pocket costs each year:

* Year 1: $5,632
* Year 2: $4,632
* Year 3: $3,632
* Year 4: $3,632

My parents will be helping me with these out of pocket costs, though, again, all student loan debt will be my own. 

**What now? AKA What the hell is this kid talking about?**

So that's how cards fall. Basically, my question is this: ***What can I do now and what I can I plan to do in the future in order to make going to college as financially manageable as possible?*** I know that during the summers I will be working my ass off to make as much money as possible to save and also put towards out-of-pocket costs. I know I likely will not be able to do work-study during college since I will be a BME major and also training to hopefully walk on to the cross country team as a sophomore (they are non-scholarship, so no help there). I know that out of college I'd really like to do some travelling before really settling down (I know this will also entail some work as I travel, whatever form that takes). And I know that as a Vandy engineering grad, I will likely end up with a fairly well-paying job.

I have read a lot of the stuff provided by this sub's wiki, but most of it applies more to recent grads that actually have student debt already rather than soon-to-be student debtors. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks yall!

* Second job was an internship in CA, where I made around $16,000 before taxes - I have the W2 for this and according to TurboTax should expect around $1600 from my federal return, while also owing about $58 to my home state (NJ).









* The first job where I only made 572.XX, I believe there was only 1 withholding from each paycheck, but now I can't recall what it was for. Other friends of mine with similar jobs at this university actually got returns for these positions, so I anticipate I will get a very very small one as well, though I'm not sure how it will affect my overall federal refund, if it all (I don't know anything about this).








So I'm wondering if my best option is to go ahead and just finish filing with TurboTax, then amend my return once I receive another copy of my W2 from my university, or to wait until I receive the missing W2 to file at all. 











What kind of late fees should I expect if I wait to file? Since my federal return is likely to be sizable relative to my income for the year, should I be okay in either situation?

I make $70k/year, am single, and don't work in public service, so pretty much all of the forgiveness options that I've come across are not an option for me. I've done some research, and it seems like there are many different options for consolidation, which has brought about some questions.

1) I've read that consolidating the loans separately is preferred for most, in order to retain any benefits gained through the government loans (forgiveness, etc.). What real benefit am I gaining in my situation? I plan on having them paid off long before the 20 years is up, so I don't see that as a benefit. Should I really be worried about consolidating them separately?

2) My father has offered to cosign on the loan(s). Now, I know there are many factors that go in to the offered rates, but given no credit-related information, would there likely be a noticeable difference in my offered rate if he cosigns? I'd prefer not burdening him with the credit impact if I can avoid it.

3) Now for the big one. I've been looking at many different lenders, there are so many viable options! I know this is another one that may be credit dependent and will take in to account many other factors, but is there a lender or set of lenders that is renowned for offering the best student loan consolidation loans? For reference, here is a list of lenders I am currently considering: SoFi, Laurel Road, Earnest, CommonBond, LendKey, CitizensBank, StudentLoans.gov (Federal Direct Consolidation Loan - I believe this is the only option for consolidating government loans, correct?)

This is a huge decision and could seriously impact my future, so needless to say, I am over thinking it!

What can I do?","I have been working at a pizza restaurant as a cook and delivery driver for the past 3 years. I am a fairly young person, and only this year have started to really try and dig into understanding how my taxes and tax returns work. 

Each year, I get two W-2s. One for my wages when I'm clocked in as a cook, and one for my wages when I'm clocked in as a driver.  I noticed this year that my employer has me listed on my driver W-2 as a Statutory Employee, meaning no Federal or State Income tax has been taken out. I am a driver for majority of my hours, so I am left having to pay in a massive amount to the IRS come tax time. 

I have been looking into what the IRS defines as who can be classified as a Statutory Employee, and as far as I understand I don't meet the qualifications. 
From what I've found researching online, a Statutory Employee's classification is determined based on 7 factors:

1. How much control is granted to and exercised by the principal (the person employee the worker).
2. Whether or not it is the employer or the worker who makes a financial investment in the working facilities that the worker will commonly use.
3. How much opportunity the worker has for profit and loss.
4. Whether or not the principal (also known as the employer) has the power to discharge or fire the worker.
5. If the work involved is a crucial component of the employer’s business operations.
6. How permanent the relationship between the employer and the worker is.
7. What kind of relationship the employer and the worker planned and agreed upon in the beginning.


In my situation, 

-My employer sets my work hours

-My employer determines what deliveries I take, and how much I will sell those deliveries to the customer for.
 
-I am given a $0.25 commission on each delivery.

-I keep all of my own tips, and report them at the end of my shift.

-My employer has the discretion to fire me

-The only thing that I am invested in as part of the job is my delivery vehicle. I am responsible for all insurance, gas, and repairs. 

-I have an opportunity for profit or loss with tips. My net delivery cost (gas, repairs, insurance) can be negated by a good tip, or I could incur a net loss if I receive no tip. 

-The work involved is absolutely crucial to the employer's business, more that half of the orders our store makes are for delivery. 

-The relationship between employer and employee is permanent  until either termination by the employer, or resignation by the employee.

-The relationship agreed upon in the beginning is that of a normal employee's job. I was given no special form to sign upon employment stating that I was a statutory employee. 
 


I am not sure if my employer is trying to list drivers at statutory employees to get some sort of benefit for themselves, or if this is normal and legal. What are the advantages/disadvantages of being listed as a statutory employee in this situation? Any advice is greatly appreciated. I will stay tuned the the comments to give more details if needed!

TL;DR: Employer lists me as a Statutory Employee, but I don't think I meet the conditions. Am I being scammed?

I cannot find anyone in the area to do a damn t4!! H&amp;R block cant do it. I cant use turbo tax because they demand I have a Canadian home address. I am unable to file a T4 through the US turbo tax and if I just hamfist the numbers into that it claims I owe thousands of dollars for money I already paid taxes on. \(Almost as much as my tax return was supposed to be from Canada!\)

I'm using my income from my business to pay for the student loans. This year I've put about $10k into loan payments. Interest makes it feel like I'm barely making a dent. 

Should paying off my student loans be my priority? Should I be investing my money into stocks?

I'm 28 years old and just moved back home to continue saving. 

Edit: The interest rate on my loans range from 5.5%-7%. They are all federal loans.

Now, 10 months later, I have about 24.5k in student loan debt left and have about 25k in savings, i live with my parents and don’t spend a lot of money. I’m not sure if it’s a good idea using 11k to pay off my grad school debt, 5.3% interest, and continue making $600 payments. Would this be a good idea? My thought was that I’d still have some savings, I’ve wiped out the loan with the largest interest rate, and I’ll probably finish paying off my loans 2 years earlier than I would if I just continued making payments of the same amount.

personalfinance,Employer (W2) withheld WAY too little for Federal taxes,"I work a part time job for a company and made ~$14,000 in 2017 for them. From what I saw online, they should've withheld ~$1,300 (I saw the rule for that tax bracket as ~$932 + 15% of [income - $9,000]). My employer only withheld ~$350. I ended up owing over $1,000 between Federal and State (California) taxes. This fucked me bad, I have significant medical bills due to a recent knee surgery and was not expecting to owe so much for taxes for a W2 job. 

This seems... illegal? It completely fucked me. I'm young and not exactly financially well off, it seems to wrong to owe $1,000 for taxes with a W2 employer. My bank account is now depleted and I don't know how I'll pay bills. I didn't set aside money for taxes since I figured the whole point of W2 was that the employer takes care of withholding the correct amount. 

I have a second job from which I made about $20,000. They withheld ~$1,500. I'm still in the same tax bracket. The employer for this job withheld too much (which seems more common). I filed this employer first and was expected to get a refund of ~$800, then I filed my second employer and ended up owing over $1,000.",finance
personalfinance,No mortgage interest deduction starting next year. Use $80K to pay down mortgage or invest?,"I have $80K in cash and considering paying down the mortgage or couch potato invest it.  We are looking to retire in 5-8 years or at least move to a fun job where I really don't care how much they pay me.  Should I put all of that 80K into our mortgage for the guranteed return of our current rate - 3.125%.   We have about $380K balance left on it.  The other option is to put it in a mix of index funds.

Some thoughts

- Based on the new tax plan, we won't itemize next year.  We will be better off taking the standard deduction so any mortgage interest is not helping my tax situation.

- I Feel like we are headed towards a correction, so maybe I won't get the ""historic"" 7% market returns in the next 5-8 years. I'm not all that savvy of an invester, so maybe I'm too conservative.
  
- Our current effective tax rates are 29.3% federal, 7.9% state - So we would pay a hefty chunk on that market returns.  Though it will most likely translate to long term cap gains.  But that 3.125% mortgage paydown is like a tax free, guaranteed return in my mind.

- We could probably pay off the house in the next 4-5 years if we divert all/most of our extra income into the mortgage after maxing out retirement accounts

- Once the kids are out of the house in 10 years, our place would rent out for about $4500/month (current rates).  We would then rent or buy something smaller for half of that $4500/month we will receive.

- Kid college plans are all in 529s and we don't plan to put in any more than is already in there.  If they need any more, they will have to get loans.

- Non-retirement accounts currently hold ~$400K, retirement accounts hold $1.4mil.

So am I being to conservative to try and pay off the mortgage? In the past my stupidity and overly conservative finance style has caused us to miss out on huge market returns and a lot of our money was eaten away from inflation while it sat in savings accounts.  I have since read up and moved most of everything to investments while keeping about a years worth of emergency funds in a 1.5% savings account.",finance
personalfinance,"I'm unemployed, my wife is half-time, we have $100 in savings, and I just finished our taxes and we owe almost $600. What do I do?","My wife (22) and I (23) are in a difficult position. Here's some background:

In January of 2017, we were both still attending college. I was a faculty child and she had a huge scholarship, so our school expenses were negligible. I took a part-time software dev internship (contractor) at a small startup in the area, she worked for a couple of university offices.

Fast forward a few months to May 2017. She graduates and is unemployed until September, at which point she got a half-time job at a local library. We move to a new apartment in the same city in June. The startup I'm still working for decided to make me a full employee in September, and I decide to take a semester off of school to work full-time (spring 2018 semester) for them because I'm really enjoying the work and felt like my university program was deteriorating (best professor resigned, small program). My gamble didn't pay off, and I was asked to resign in February, which was mostly my own fault. I have on and off again depression and it was having a negative effect on my work performance. My wife also suffers from anxiety, depression, and PTSD, which is why she had a hard time finding a job after graduation.

We have $100 in a savings account and about $250 in our checking account as I write this. Most of our bills for this month are paid except for the credit cards. I plan on calling most or all of our credit card companies tomorrow to ask for some leeway.

As far as debt goes, we owe several thousand in student loans for my wife (before we got the scholarship), and we have 4 credit cards, none of which we use now and all of which were racked up by my frivolous spending habits in college:

USAA: $1372

Chase: $706

Discover 1 (under my name): $1052

Discover 2 (under my wife's name): $287

My wife brings home just under $1000/month after taxes. She has applied for a few promotions that would take her to full-time. As I said above, I am currently unemployed and actively seeking employment. I've also been accepted to a more robust program at a larger university.

Here are our monthly expenses. We don't keep a budget (I want to. It's hard to do when our lives feel so tumultuous). so some are estimates.

Rent: $700
Internet: $54
Electric: Varies between $90 and $150 (our area's weather recently is super varied, no gas)
Car Insurance: $43
USAA Credit Card: $15 minimum
Chase Credit Card: $25 minimum
Discover Credit Card 1: $45 minimum
Discover Credit Card 2: $75 minimum
Groceries: Usually around $100-$150
Pets: Around $100 (food and litter for 1 big dog and 2 cats)

A lot of our money goes toward fast food. We were only able to make rent for March from my last paycheck at the startup and April because my parents were willing to bail us out.

I finished our taxes on TurboTax tonight (I know, I waited far too long. Stress.) and because of my contractor status at the startup for the majority of the year, we owe $404 in federal taxes, and TurboTax is charging me $160 (I used it so I could deduct some work expenses like a computer I bought for work). I was not good (at all) about saving portions of my income during my contractor stint.

So we owe $564 for our taxes. On top of all the debt we have and the income we don't have. To say I'm panicking is putting it mildly. I'm really at a bit of a loss what to do. I've always been pretty bad with money but we've always managed to survive, but now I feel like we're in a bit of a crisis and I have no idea where to go. My grandparents and parents are generous but I don't want to just be bailed out.

What should I do moving forward?",finance

Bitcoin,Rise in Bitcoin Price: ‘April 17 Decides the future of Bitcoin’-Expert Reveals,"The recent rise in Bitcoin has attracted a lot of concern from many experts as one ofthem claimed that the price of the currency could surge even higher in few days.

On Thursday, Bitcoin price surged from $6,786 on Thursday morning to a high of $8,011 effort night of the same day, which was more than 17 percent in an unusual spike.

One of the bitcoin expert, identified as Brian Kelly, the CEO of BKCM, revealed that the price of Bitcoin could rise further this month, as the US Tax Day looms.

In a statement with CNBC, Kelly, said;

“We’re early stage tech in this - this is like the internet in the 1980s.

“After the last couple of months talking to folks, I think we’re more like the 1980s.

“I think this technology is going to work, it is going to be game-changing.It is very early days so we can have this mass of volatility.”

Mr Kelly further said;

“I think this is for real, so we’ll know presumably after April 17 if we can hold these gains.We will know how much that was selling impacted.”

Now on 17th of April is acknowledged in the US as “Tax Day”- it is the deadline for those in America to file their 2017 federal tax returns.

In reaction to this, Mr Kelly said;

“We probably have 500 to 600 billion dollars come off the market for tax purposes and we have had that since December.

“It looks like we have bottomed here and there definitely seems to be a change in the sentiment around it so I think this is the real thing.This is an open source software so you can’t think of it as a company and that is where people make the mistake.”

Reports have it that for the last 10 weeks the correlation between stock markets and Bitcoin has indicated the cryptocurrency is still being perceived as a risk asset as opposed to a safe haven asset like gold.This is due to the volatile nature of the market and because it is still largely unregulated.

personalfinance,First time filing taxes - work outside the US by US company while earning less than $4k USD per year (student),"Hi, not new to personal finance (and asking from a new account to protect my identity). I should have asked this question some time ago. I'm curious to know about filing taxes while living abroad and working for an American company. I am 22 and have never filed a tax return as I have lived abroad since turning 18 and my family moved outside the US. I should have filed years ago, but I didn't.

I am an American citizen with a legal US residence in Florida. I have lived in Italy for the past four years for my undergraduate. While here, I have worked at an American company based in New York for the past three years (I received my first W2 for the taxable year of 2015). My US legal residence is in Florida. I have assistance from my family in supporting my daily cost of living (they pay for rent during the academic year February-May and September-December).

From my W-2 form for 2017, I had federal income tax, state income tax, social security wages, and Medicare wages withheld. The previous two years 2015 and 2016 I had federal income tax withheld and state income tax. I am utilizing the  IRS's ""Interactive Tax Assistant"" and it is stating that I do not need to file a tax return, though I may in the event that I will receive a return. I'm not sure if I should list this as foreign earned income, because I did earn it while residing outside the US although I had received the income from a US company that withheld.

I wanted to reach out to this community to see what I should be doing in regards to this.

So today, I am happy to announce the release of a game I have been working on the last few months...

Crypto Rider! A 2D racing game, where the tracks are historical price charts of popular Cryptocurrencies! Collect blocks to unlock different cars based on popular Cryptos.

I was fed up of watching the charts during the bear market, so I thought I would make something a bit light hearted, to cheer myself and (hopefully) others up.

The game is easy to play, but hard to master. Also, no audio in the game as I imagined most people will be playing whilst travelling and listening to their own music.

** The game is free for iOS and Android devices. **

The features of the game are as follows:

* Fast paced racing action
* 9 different Crypto themed cars to unlock
* 10 tracks to race on!
* Compete for the top spot on global leaderboards!
* Shill your high score to your friends with the sharing feature
* 1-Touch control system. Hold down to accelerate when grounded, and hold down to flip in the air! Landing a flip will result in an extra speed boost!

personalfinance,High School Senior in Need of Student Loan Insight,"I saw a post like this and hoped that I could get quality insight from r/personalfinance just like the last person to post was. I’ll follow his/her post layout but give my details. The reason that I’m not going off of the advice given to him/her is because I believe that my situation is different enough to warrant a separate post, especially regarding my amount of debt, location, school, etc.

**Who am I?**

I am a 17 year old high school senior and will be attending the University of Delaware in the Fall for biological sciences, with a minor in Spanish. This of course is flexible early in the year, so if anyone has any insight on my majors and minors and if I should make any changes, I’d love to hear it. For simplicity’s sake, this is the only school that I am considering.

**What’s the situation?**

I applied for financial aid and was offered $2582.00 yearly in scholarships and grants. According to the financial aid letter, the total cost of attendance would be $29,344.00. My EFC is around 19,000, which ends up being $76,000 over 4 years. I am currently applied to $100,000 worth in external scholarships ranging from relatively small $500 ones to one large $9000 one, but I feel like the safest thing to do is to assume I win nothing from these.

**What are my loan options?**
The financial aid packet laid it out like this-
Federal Direct Subsidized Loans: $3500.00 per year
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans: $2000.00 per year

Federal Direct Parent (Plus) Loans: I’d rather not shift the debt onto my parents, so I’d elect not to accept these if possible.

Private Loans: It is to my understanding that I’ll have to take these in order to pay for my schooling, and if possible I’d be grateful to hear your advice on where to acquire these.

TOTAL: $5500+(private loans) a year.

NET COST: $18,500 yearly/$74,000 for 4 years.

The deal with my parents was that they’d help me with the up front costs with going to university but this is the time where I have to take on my own loans and shoulder that debt. I normally refuse to give them direct control like that into my financial business anyway, so it would be great if I could keep it that way.

**Conclusion**

The goal for my four years of college is to put myself in the best position for financial stability in my near future. I need some help on finding out how to do this, especially regarding what strategies I can employ to lessen these loans by any means possible. Work study is out of the question because to my understanding it isn’t offered by my school. I have applied and have been accepted to a program that offers grants and scholarships based on my performance in developing community service projects but I’m sure it would be better to not expect anything from those either. The University of Delaware is hands down the biggest school in my state, but I am really not sure how well a degree from there is regarded nationally. If light could be shed on how well UDel is regarded, I’d appreciate it. Otherwise, I really thank everyone for their help on the mountain of debt that I’ll have to take on soon.",finance
personalfinance,My W4 is incorrect with my employer. Unsuccessful attempts have been made to amend. Do I have alternative recourse?,"I'm newly employed (within 90-days) in the state of Florida.  My employer uses a third party, cloud-based software to help manage human resources, timekeeping, records, and payroll.  Upon employment, I complete certain documents which included a W4.

With my first check I realized somehow (perhaps my error, or my employers) my ~~W2~~ W4 was mistakenly filed to make me EXEMPT from Federal Income Tax.  I brought this to individuals in Human Resource and Accounting immediately. 

I've now gone four bi-weekly pay periods without having this EXEMPTION corrected.  I've made attempts after each paycheck to bring this to light again, but without success.  I'm assuming I will just owe these missed taxes on my next Federal Tax Return.  Do I have an alternative recourse to correct my W4?",finance
personalfinance,Tax related question: should I stock money in retirement or hold onto it for my current needs?,"It's tax time, and I'm using the Credit Karma free tax software to file my state and federal taxes. I live in NYC, so my lucky ass is getting triple taxed. I have ended up owing money for the past few years because my out of state employers don't factor in the city and state taxes. This year is no different. Huzzah! /s 
  
At any rate, I've put in all of my information, and I've come to the end, where I didn't like the number that I owed. I did remember that I had not contributed anything this past fiscal year to an IRA (roth or traditional). So I tinkered with the number by adding in an IRA contribution. That caused the number of what I owed to be a bit more manageable.

Here's the thing. Presently, I maintain a 3 pronged portfolio career. Specifically, I have three distinct positions that I hold simultaneously through the course of a regular week. Most days at least 2 of them overlap, but never all 3. The highest earning gig has been washed away due to a generally bad working environment caused by management. Last year was moderately successful for me financially, so I was able to finally create a decent savings account. (10months worth of bills) Given the issues with my most recent employer, I am living off the other two positions, but I want to be prepared if it will be necessary to dip into my savings. 

**I explain all of that to say this:** Whatever I will have to pay in taxes this year will certainly have to come out of my savings, as a result of my work situation. I want to keep as much in savings as is humanly possible given my tax bill, and this can be potentially helped by an IRA contribution. However, this part is where I need guidance as to what I should contribute to an IRA and then pay.

I have 3 options:   
-pay the full tax bill and don't contribute an IRA (I keep the most money in my savings this way)  
-contribute 5500 to a traditional IRA and then pay a lower tax bill, but have far less money in the savings (savings would lose 5500 AND the tax money)  
-contribute 5500 to 2 IRAs (traditional and a Roth) and pay a somewhat lower tax bill and have a little more money in savings than option 2  
  
Hopefully this table works to illustrate my point/issue
  
Description| Tax bill w/o IRA contribution| Tax bill w/ 5500 trad IRA contribution | Tax bill with half IRA/half Roth contribution
:--------|:--------|:--------|:---------
Fed tax owed |3640 | 1708 | 2673
State &amp; city tax owed |4511 | 3727 | 4119
Total taxes owed |8151 | 5435 | 6793
Savings pre-tax bill |16700 | 11200 | 13950
Savings after payment/contribution |8549 | 5765 | 7157
  
Personal financers of Reddit, what should I do? Yes, I realize that putting 5500 in an IRA is paying myself, but I currently need the funds that I have and don't want to put myself in a financially compromising situation. 
  
**TL;DR-** I have a big tax bill and can minimize it by chunking money from my savings into an IRA. I don't know if I should put some of my savings into an IRA, because I need the savings money at the moment.",finance

personalfinance,Are we nuts to think we can afford this house?,"As the title states, my husband and I need a gut check in case we are being totally crazy in thinking that we can afford this house. I can answer any questions for things I may have left out – I apologize for the length, I wasn’t sure how detailed I should be. I really appreciate any help. We love this house but we want to be realistic.


**Location:**

The house is on the Northwest side of Chicago. It is 100% updated, newly built two years ago from the studs. There is nothing we’d currently change about the house.


**Mortgage:**

Purchase price – max $520,000, hopefully closer to $500k or $510k; numbers below reflect $520k

Down payment - $78,000 (15%)

Cash to close - $88,000

Principal and interest - $2239.55

Total payment including property taxes, PMI, homeowners insurance, garbage collection - $3192.42


**Income:**

After taxes and retirement savings - $6673.94 monthly

Overtime (husband) – sporadic, anywhere from $100-$200 post-tax per paycheck 

Bonuses – 300%-500% of monthly salary ($4775, raise due in August) yearly for me; $2000 yearly for husband


**Savings:**

Retirement: $170,000 total

I save 25% of my salary yearly in a non-401k employer plan. Husband is currently saving $600 per month in a 401k with a 5% match.

We will use our bonuses to max out Roth IRAs at the end of every year for as long as our income allows. After a year we’ll likely reevaluate our budget to try to fit a monthly contribution in. 

After cash to close we will have $30-$40k cash remaining.


**Debt:**

I have $14,000 in federal student loans, with an average interest rate of 5.5%. 
Minimum payment is $300 monthly; I pay $500 monthly with the extra going towards the highest interest loan. Estimated date of repayment is October 2020 with this method, after which we would divert the $500 towards the mortgage principal.
We have no other debt; we both drive 10+ year old fully paid off cars. 


**Expenses:**

*Monthly:*

Utilities - $300

Cable/Internet - $125

Food - $400

Blue Apron - $120

Phones - $150

Gas - $80

Public transit - $210

Cleaning service - $200

Loans - $500

Prescriptions - $20

Household expenses - $100

Fun money - $500

Security system - $50

Total – $2755 ($5805 with mortgage payment)

Remaining - $718.94


*Yearly:*

Car registration, city sticker, and permit - $400

Car insurance - $1000

AAA - $52

Hockey - $1000

Amazon Prime - $100

Costco - $60


Notes on expenses – the Blue Apron and cleaning service will likely wait a few months until we’re certain our budget is accurate. We’ll fit them into our budget if we can but they aren’t necessities. When one car dies we are not planning on replacing it, as we only actually need one car. We don’t need the cars to get to work, we use them for hockey and for visiting family in the suburbs. So we aren’t budgeting to buy a new car any time soon, and if somehow both died we could definitely get away with not replacing it and bumming rides for a while.

So – are we nuts? A cheaper house isn’t currently an option, as those within our desired locations are usually only $100k or so cheaper while needing a significant amount of work. This house is likely this cheap because of the location – it’s about a mile from the train (not at all an issue for us) and one street away from a busy main road (also not a problem for us as we currently live off that road in a busier neighborhood and don’t find that the noise/congestion bother us at all).",finance
personalfinance,Received $275 from tax returns and my friend received $1k back despite earning similar amount of money,"TLDR; Friend(18) filed as a single and got back $1k with him earning $10,327 and $947.29 federal tax withheld and I(19) as a dependant (but earned more than mother and couldn't file together)got back $275 with a earning of $10,296 with $668 federal tax withheld. What can I learn from this situation?

This situation is a little bit weird and I just want a bit of clarifying on this. If possible I would like to get more on my return back! 
I'm age 19 and he is 18 years old. He's currently working in the military and all of his wages are from them. I have 5 W-2 forms from different jobs over 2017. 

He's earned 10327.79 in 2017 with $947.29 federal tax withheld. The way he filed his taxes is that he didn't allow anyone to claim him and as a single person. He lives under his parents house and I would to think that his parents pay for 50% of his living cost but according to him he pays for everything himself. He does not have any debt or student loans YET or own a car.

For myself, I've earned 10,296 with $668 federal tax withheld. I received $275 back. I allowed my mom (divorced) to claim me as a dependent to only find out that my mom has not worked enough to earn more than me. I filed my taxes way before hand so I didn't know about this situation until a couple weeks ago but I don't know still if it affects how much tax return I would get if I filed as a single or as a dependent. I live for free, insurance is paid for and they purchase food for me. The only thing I'm paying for is a car that I recently purchased recently.",finance

Wanting to find a good strategy, I looked at Fidelity's brokered CD ladders (info at https://fixedincome.fidelity.com/ftgw/fi/FILanding#tbcds|treasury|cd-new-issue), and found that they seem quite good. 2 year CDs are 2.65% of delicious FDIC insured goodness (2.25 APY), with almost 3% if I wanted to risk a 5 year ladder.

In addition to Reddit, I am a fan of the Bogleheads forums, which is a very different place, based on the religion of index investing, and they always Pooh Pooh any attempt to do other than own indexes even when they are obviously doing to fall in value and/or underperform for a few years until the current cycle of rate raises is done. When I asked over there, a few people thought the CD ladder idea a good one, but many were shocked, shocked! that anyone would stray from pure Bogleheadism. 

I mainly wanted to ask people's opinions here. I am 49 years old an something like 85% equities, plus a chunk of cash. The CD ladder would be around $100k and bought inside an IRA so taxes wouldn't be an (immediate) issue. Should I do the CD ladder, or is it somehow Stoic and honorable to hold bonds even when they seem guaranteed to fall in value for the next few years,

personalfinance,Debating Condo Purchase Due to Student Loans,"Hello everyone. My wife and I are exploring our options for renting and buying a home. I would like some advice on making a wise financial move. We are only in the position to do a 3-5% down payment, but the mortgage price is equal to our current rent price for a townhouse twice the size of our apartment.

We have decent paying jobs. Last year's AGI was $157,000.00. Since then we received raises and will earn $163,000.00 this year. I contribute 7% per pay period to my employer's 401K and get all matching funds and I have a separate Roth IRA and IRA rollover from a prior job.

We live in a very expensive area of Massachusetts for housing. We currently pay $1925.00 in rent and our rent is scheduled to go up to $1950.00. Rent prices are going to continue rising for our area due to new construction and gentrification. Our lease is up at the end of May so we have to do something. We found a rental unit priced at $1,500 in an area that works for both of us.

A lender pre-approved us for $248,000.00 based on last year's AGI. We found a renovated condo listed at $235,000.00. We saved up enough for a 5% down payment or 3% and the closing costs. If we did 3% then we would have a similar monthly payment to our current apartment even including the PMI, association fee, taxes, and insurance. The condo was well-maintained and has updated systems inside, including the boiler and furnace. I do not believe the condo is a bad deal or that the price is out of line for one of these condos. I feel like home ownership makes sense when you simply compare the rent payment to the mortgage payment, but that's only half of the equation.

However, we also have about $240,000.00 in (mostly federal) student loans. I am on the 10 year standard plan and she does income based repayment. I was paying extra until we decided to save up for the condo. We are worried about taking on more debt, but feel some pressure to buy due to the real estate market. Are we nuts to think we should just buy the condo? Or should we move to as cheap of a location as we can find and pay down debt and bide our time knowing prices keep going up?",finance

personalfinance,Credit reporting when mortgage loan servicing transfers question,"Okay, I'm normally pretty good with finances, but I haven't run across this one before. I'm trying to help a friend who has had horrible finances most of her life, but now has a 'real job' back on track. Here is the scenario:

""Friend"" (We'll call her Abby) purchased her home in 2005. It was a subprime loan and was bounced around a bit before settling with ""Acme Mortgage Company - Unhelpful Division"" in 2010. She has some currents, some lates, some really lates. They then transfer it to ""Acme Mortgage Company - Helpful Division"" in 2014, where she got a modification in 2016 and has been current ever since.

So now she has two accounts showing for the same mortgage. They appear as:

""Acme Mortgage Company Div 1"" 2010-2013, closed account, opened in 2005, age 12 years, 6 months. (mix of on time, 30/60/90/120 day lates)

Then we have

""Acme Mortgage Company, Division 2"" 2014-2018. Also reporting as opened in 2005, 12 years, 6 months age, mix of current (for the last 15 months) and 30/60/90/120 day lates

So my questions are:

Is this being reported correctly? It's showing as 2 accounts, both with many derog's, one closed, one open. But it's all the same loan and company. Should I/she request they be combined?

If they are combined, will that then lower her average credit file age? Would the bump for only having 1 account with lates be more than the minus for shorter average credit length time?

And lastly, the ""Acme Division 1/unhelpful/closed"" account is due to roll off her report in Dec 2018. Would it be better to just let it lay where it is and roll off in 8 months?

End goal is to help her raise her score, lower interest rates and dig out from under the pile she got herself in. She's in a solid position now, just digging out. Thanks in advance!",finance

Bitcoin,Call for Presentations: CHAIN-IN'18 Blockchain Conference,"CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

******************************************************************************
Chain-in: The International Industrial &amp; Academic Conference on Blockchain Technology
Porto, Portugal — July 9th &amp; 10th, 2018
http://www.chain-in.org/
******************************************************************************
WHY CHAIN-IN?
- It brings both industrial enthusiasts and academics to interact and join forces for a brighter blockchain future.
- It spans a wide spectrum of talks: technical, law, market, economics, etc., that helps attendees and speakers understand the entire blockchains ecosystem.
- It is a platform for easy/fast/recorded dissemination and speaker's exposure without the burden of academic papers.

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Chain-in is a unique industrial and academic conference focused on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency technologies. In spite of all the hype behind the technology, the industry and academia are often following different approaches to build tamper-proof distributed ledgers (or databases). Experience shows that there is no pure black and white, and thus it is wise to have both rivals exchange knowledge and join forces. Chain-in aims at bringing researchers, developers, and enthusiasts from academia and industry to sit together on the same table and try converge to the best of the technology.


PRESENTATION MODEL
Given that blockchains hail from industry, Chain-in avoids the academic proceeding-based style, and rather adopts a more ""casual"" model through dedicating the event to presentations and interaction.

ethereum,Call for Presentations: CHAIN-IN'18 Blockchain Conference,"CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS

******************************************************************************
Chain-in: The International Industrial &amp; Academic Conference on Blockchain Technology
Porto, Portugal — July 9th &amp; 10th, 2018
http://www.chain-in.org/
******************************************************************************
WHY CHAIN-IN?
- It brings both industrial enthusiasts and academics to interact and join forces for a brighter blockchain future.
- It spans a wide spectrum of talks: technical, law, market, economics, etc., that helps attendees and speakers understand the entire blockchains ecosystem.
- It is a platform for easy/fast/recorded dissemination and speaker's exposure without the burden of academic papers.

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Chain-in is a unique industrial and academic conference focused on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency technologies. In spite of all the hype behind the technology, the industry and academia are often following different approaches to build tamper-proof distributed ledgers (or databases). Experience shows that there is no pure black and white, and thus it is wise to have both rivals exchange knowledge and join forces. Chain-in aims at bringing researchers, developers, and enthusiasts from academia and industry to sit together on the same table and try converge to the best of the technology.


PRESENTATION MODEL
Given that blockchains hail from industry, Chain-in avoids the academic proceeding-based style, and rather adopts a more ""casual"" model through dedicating the event to presentations and interaction. This is also a great exposure opportunity for enthusiasts, developers, and non-experts to speak at Chain-in. The ultimate goal, and the hope, is to foster interaction and enrich the discussions

financialindependence,CDs instead of Stocks and Bonds for retirement. Is it crazy?,"I am 30 years old and about 1-2 years away from FIRE. In my opinion, the stock and bond market are both very overvalued and I think the conventional wisdom that the stock market always goes up in the long term may be wrong (ie. Japan). I plan to invest 80% into 3% CDs for income and the rest in gold/silver/land/stocks to provide some inflation hedge. Am I making a horrible mistake here? I think it will be much safer than doing the conventional 60/40 stock bond allocation based on current valuations.  I worked very hard to get here and I am having a hard time gambling most of it in the stock market. What do you guys think? Am I the only one that thinks this way? 

edit: I would invest in stocks when they become more reasonably valued. I think this will happen as interest rates rise.
edit: I have 60 years of living expenses saved. assuming I do not have kids",finance
personalfinance,Advice - Personal Vs Joint Checking Accounts,"My wife and I are looking at opening a second checking account, either a joint account or one that is in her name. I currently have a checking account with Navy Federal Credit Union, and we plan on going in sometime this week to open the second account.

My questions are, are there any pros/cons to a joint account over a personal one? If we decide on a joint account will they do a hard pull on my credit report or just hers? Is there anything else I should be aware of before hand? 

Thanks in advance, any help is greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Panicking and need help with filing taxes,"I filed jointly with my spouse and sent the forms via mail. We did that instead of e-filing because we needed his AGI from last year's forms to file taxes and he didn't have the value since he had someone else file his taxes and it was a complicated situation since he was living out of country until recently.

I sent my taxes on April 10th (I know, later than I should have) through USPS and I checked today. My state taxes have been delivered, however my federal taxes have been sitting in the office for 5 days and I didn't realize until now. I thought it would be fine since I paid for 2-Day shipping 6 days ago.
 
I tried filing an extension online, but they're asking for both my and my spouse's AGI, which I don't have because what I mentioned early. Obviously I can't ask for an extension through paper right now because it won't get there on time. I realize I put this off much later than I should have, but does anyone have any suggestions on what can I do?

personalfinance,Marriage Bonus - am I missing something?,"Hi everyone,

My girlfriend and I have widely varying incomes right now and planning to get married in a few years. If my calculations are right, we would save ~$13K/year by getting married sooner. I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Details:
-I'm starting a new job in August making ~$270K
-She is a grad student making ~$30K

-Filing as two individuals we would pay ~$68K of federal taxes
-Filing jointly we would pay ~$55K

Whether or not it's worth getting married sooner for tax purposes is a separate question (maybe for r/relationships) but for now I just want to know if this math is right?

We live in California. I'm assuming the state tax impact would be more or less a wash.",finance
personalfinance,Can someone explain to me why our W-2s look fishy? Our boss/the owner is swerving around my questions.,"Hi, I don’t know much about taxes, so I’ll give you the info I think may be relevant. My friend and I worked 2017 at a small business. I think there is an issue with our W-2s, but the business owner, who doesn’t speak great English, acts like he doesn’t know what I’m talking about. 

During 2017, I worked two part time jobs and went to school. I am 23, female, single, and claimed 1 on my W-4. One job was as a receptionist and the other a small restaurant where I worked as a cashier. 

The numbers on my W-2 for the receptionist position are (I’m rounding)-
1 Wages/tips- $10,600.00
2 Fed tax withheld- $1,100.00
3 SS wages- $10,600.00
4 SS withheld- $650.00
5 Medicare- $10,600.00
6 Medicare withheld- $150.00
The only other boxes filled are 9 for verification code and 15 for state. These numbers seem legit. 

The numbers on my W-2 for the restaurant are-
1 Wages/tips- $2,000.00
2 Fed tax withheld- $20.00
3 SS wages-$2,000 
4 SS withheld-$125.00 
5 Medicare- $2,000.00
6 Medicare withheld- $30.00
No other boxes are filled. 

I don’t know much at all about taxes, and this is my first time doing them by myself, but what could the reason be that the federal tax withheld at the restaurant is so low? I called my boss to see, but he acted like he didn’t know what I was talking about. He also said that he did the payroll himself last year, so calling his accountant wouldn’t help. We also did not receive pay stubs at that time, just checks (now, started 2018, he has someone else do his payroll and we receive pay stubs).  

My friend is a driver there and he has a similar issue… maybe worse? He does not speak advanced English so I’m helping him. He is married and claimed 2. His numbers are as follows…
1 Wages/tips- $14,000
2 Fed tax withheld- $2.00
3 SS wages-$14,000 
4 SS withheld-$870.00 
5 Medicare- $14,000.00
6 Medicare withheld- $200.00

TLDR- I don’t understand how our federal tax withheld is so low. My other job withheld 11% (which google said is correct). What is a reasonable explanation for this?",finance
personalfinance,Why do I owe $500 in federal tax for 0% LTCG,"Hello, im in the process of filing my taxes for this year and my W-2 income totaled $7702. I also have stocks that were purchased prior to 2010 for ~$9000 and were sold for ~$30000 for a LTCG of ~$21,000 (filled out 1099-B). There is also dividends of $577 (filled out in 1099-DIV). 
This still puts me in the 15% tax bracket (up to $37,950). And for the 10% and 15% tax bracket, the LTCG tax should be 0%.

Prior to adding 1099-B, my federal tax return was $968 however after adding the 1099-B my federal tax was reduced to $458. After playing around with the numbers it still reduced my federal tax by $510 whether my LTCG is $1000 or $20000.

investing,Person here deduced that Trump wants Fed Hikes.,"A person here talked about how his actions reflected that he was playing a game to try to make the Fed lower interest rates but everyone here said that he is over analysing and trump is just a stupid impulsive person.

Now Trump has tweeted about China playing the devaluation game while Fed raises interests.

If Fed doesn't increase the rate 4 times what happens? Any impact to any particular stocks? I cant think of any. Good time to buy bonds? (price of bonds should increase when FED announces they will lower interest rates) 

What do you think of shorting the dollar against the CNY? If its only 3 hikes then the dollar should fall because 4 hikes are priced in and if China cant keep on devaluing their currency then CNY should go up.",finance
personalfinance,I stopped myself from buying a new car today.,"After making some poor choices with credit cards and bills in my early 20s, I have started to rectify this. I have paid down nearly all my credit cards and have several thousand in the bank. It feels really good. 

However, today I got an offer in the mail for a new car. It would pay off my existing car loan which has 3 years left on it. Payment is $300 a month at 0% apr. I made a mistake with this car as I had a previous cars negative equity rolled into it. That car would have been paid off by now.

I went to the dealer and really enjoyed the car. It had all the features my current car does not have. However, when they came back the interest rate was at 2.9%(pretty solid) the payment was at $425. After some haggling it went down to $380 and a down payment of $2000. Basically my Car was getting paid off at the full loan amount with rebates but I was adding a new $30,000 dollar car payment. 

I had initially said yes but when I stood up I felt sick. Like I was making a massive mistake. I told them I am sorry I could not do this. They pressured me a bit but I remained strong and walked away. 

I feel really proud of myself right now. I have been so dedicated to working on my finances and being better with my money. I think is a good step in the right direction.",finance

personalfinance,Taking out a private loan for a second bachelors degree and unsure if I should defer payments on it or start paying immediately.,"Ok so here is the situation. I am starting an accelerated (16-month) BSN program next month, and am in the process of applying for a private loan to cover the cost of both tuition and living expenses, as the program allows very little time for part time work. The program costs about 73k total, and I am receiving about 23k in federal loans. So I will owe just about $50k in tuition alone. I will work part time, but I am worried it won’t be enough to completely cover my living expenses.

I currently have 15k of undergraduate student loan debt that I will be deferring payments on while I go back to school. My monthly expenses will include a $500 rent payment, $200 car payment, and $170 car insurance payment (so about 800 just in bills). My part time job will probably bring in just over 1k a month.

Originally I wanted to apply for a loan of 50k and try to manage my living expenses with my part time income. However, the bank seems to advise starting monthly payments on this loan immediately rather than deferring payment due to the interest rate (variable from 5-11%). 

Would it be insane to take out a larger loan (60k) in order to start paying the loan off while I’m in school? It seems backwards to take out loans for purpose of paying the loan... but my dad is now a co-signer and feel like I should also give myself somewhat of a cushion in case I can’t work as many hours as I intend to. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!",finance

financialindependence,The Beginning of my FI/RE journey,"As you browse through this subreddit you come across many:
    ""I have 700k net worth, mid-thirties, no debt, one     rental, here is my plan""    or 
   ""I can't tell anyone but you guys - 55 y/o, no debt, 401k is at 900k and am psyched..."" 

I could incessantly describe many other posts like these.

Don't get me wrong, I truly appreciate reading about all these success stories and respect the individuals that post about them, but it gives an unrealistic sampling of the actual working world. 

The majority of the individuals I know are highly leveraged, have no retirement, massive student loan or car debt, and quite frankly are financially illiterate.

I am fortunate to have found this subreddit last year as I was highly depressed, laden with debt, and unhappy with the stupid decisions I made when I was younger.

But now I have recovered and am on an obsessive (don't worry I still go out with friends, enjoy a good whiskey, and travel) path to FI/RE.

Here we go:      0% to FI/RE---NEGATIVE 180k nw

Context: Travelled the world on student loan money, went to an expensive private school 1st year of undergrad, finished grad school where I racked up massive debt, had a long-term girlfriend that had expensive tastes... You get the picture. 

Fast forward 8 years and I am 180 k in student loan debt.

The PROS: drive a shitty car that is payed off, no credit card debt, no girlfriend or kids

Currently: Got my first ""big boy"" job in December at 26 y/o at 70 k salary. Moved back in with my parents, and started throwing everything I could at my debt. 

I have paid 16k off of a 56k private loan. All my federal loans I am paying the absolute minimum on an IBRP.

I recently accepted a position that will boost my salary to around 113k. 

MY PLAN
 - completely eliminate the rest of the 40k private loan      in 8 months
 - max out ROTH IRA for the year
 -take advantage of the shitty 1000 dollar yearly 401k match company offers and contribute nothing more

The Future Plan?
  -Apply this summer to the: Active Duty Health Professions Student Loan Repayment Program of which they will pay 40 k per year of federal loans for 3 years (total - 120k)
 -Go in as an officer - (average salary 85k) and completely max out TSP every year for 3 years as well as begin contributing to a Vanguard taxable brokerage account with a healthy amount of index funds
 -While on active duty I figured my savings rate could be upwards of 80%

Outlook?
 -After serving for 4 years I would be 30 y/o, no student loan debt, and what should be a 6 figure net worth (TSP, Vanguard, Emergency Fund, ROTH)

I wanted to write this to optimistically reach those individuals who are in similar circumstances as I am and to tell you that you are not alone.

My hope is to motivate people and be proof that there are other's out there who have FI/RE ambitions but are starting in a substantially sized hole

Most everyone in my life has told me I will have to work till I die and my debt will never be paid off.

I say Fuck them.

My goal is FI/RE at 36. This gives me 10 years to make it happen. This may be overly ambitious, but why handcuff myself to modest expectations?

I love this community, and I hope to one day emulate the numerous individuals on this subreddit who have sacrificed tremendously to get where they are now.

personalfinance,First-time home buyer - need advice on mortgage interest rate terms,"My partner and I are first-time home buyers and we just received an offer from my CU for a 30-yr conventional loan with 4.5% interest rate on a $475K house. This rate seems kind of high to me since we both have excellent credit (I'm in the high 700s, partner in the low 800s), we are providing a 20% downpayment, and we have two solid incomes.

Trying to do some research, I read about typical loans from CUs being in the 3.5-4% range...is ours high because we are in a more competitive market? It is a fast-growing area and there is definitely more demand for homes than there is supply. Our plan was to just go with my CU because I have been really happy with them, had a good experience with them for an auto loan a few years back, and they have a great reputation locally (they are regional).

Should we be asking them to lower the rate? Shop around more? Or are we just unlucky to be in a competitive market?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Remembering Diaspora: The first fully decentralized social network.,"Not many of you ever heard of Diaspora. 

They were everything crypto currencies were without using currencies.  They had Dapps built off their protocol such as ""The Federation"" 
Diaspora was complete , and released 3 years before the ethereum crowdsale.   A working beta was released in 2010, and the main net was launched. 

They were the first decentralized social network run off PODS(Nodes).  Best part? They only needed $200,000 from kickstarter.  Not billions like some overhyped cryptos need and don't even have a working product, but that's a conversation for another time. 

Anyway, 

**what happened to diaspora?**

The co-founder Ilya Zhitomirskiy died suddenly of suicide at age 22.    Theories were ""Pressures related to Diaspora"".      Conspiracies say although Mark Zuckerberg donated to their kickstarter, he was responsible for llya's death because Diaspora was a threat to take down Facebook.  Something about the donation being a decoy to steer attention away.    Again, that's a conversation for another time.  

 Long story short they find it odd someone who was so motivated with the world of opportunity at his feet would just fold under pressure enough to commit suicide after most of the work was done. 



##*""Our distributed design means no big corporation will ever control Diaspora. Diaspora will never sell your social life to advertisers, and you won’t have to conform to someone’s arbitrary rules or look over your shoulder before you speak""*##


Diaspora is still being used today. Said to have about a million users , and about 5000 total PODS(Nodes) registered with some inactive. 

There were a few ways you can join. Open signups by joining in on someone's pod if they left signups open.  Running your own pod that dealt specifically with just your profile, or hosting other users at a central location. 

Right now it seems to be an underground dedicated community just like open IRC was.  

As much as some people don't like to believe ""stories"" , you have to give credit where credit is due because we all have Diaspora to thank for laying down the ground work for all the crypto platforms we have today. Including Ethereum.    

BitCoin opened the door for using crypto currencies, Diaspora proved BitCoin right.

Second package: $160k Salary, Company puts 25% of base salary into 401k (So they'll pay an additional 40k into my 401k regardless of me contributing) vested in 4 years, 35 days Combined PTO, unused PTO is paid back at the end of each year, company pays 100% health, 10k Signing bonus and 9 Federal holidays.

So the max 401k contribution is 53k. Which means I'd only be able to contribute up to 13k before I'd hit the annual combined contribution cap. That 40k means my salary is still 200k either way.

personalfinance,Previously waived student debt keeps popping up every few years,"My SO took out some student loans back in 2009. Unfortunately, some adulting issues popped up and they had to stop their schooling. After a few years they were diagnosed with an illness, became unable to work and then filed for, and were granted, disability.

After getting disability they applied to have their student loans waived due to their inability to pay back these loans. After filling out some forms and submitting them had the debts completely waived. 

A few years later they were contacted by a separate entity representing student debt collections for the Federal Government saying that she still owed money for the student loan debt. She had to fill out additional paper work proving she was disabled and unable to repay. After receiving and reviewing all of the submitted paperwork, the debt was waived for a second time.

Cut to last month, a sizable chunk of their disability stipend was missing without any explanation. Turns out that a letter was sent to our previous address, which we hadn't lived at in nearly 4 years, explaining that future disability payments were to be garnished due to the student debt, which has also been ballooning thanks to applied interest.

After contacting this new company, Nelnet (different than they'd submitted the information to previous), they were told that they had no record of them being disabled or any debt forgiveness. Apparently all new forms have to be filled out and resubmitted to qualify. 

Is this standard issue? 

Is this something that just gets passed from company to company while a person, who thinks their debt is waived, carries a debt that continues to balloon with interest?

Is there anything we can do to make sure this doesn't happen again?

personalfinance,"I feel stuck - student loans, maybe grad school? Overwhelmed.","Hi all, 
I am graduating in less than a month with an engineering degree and am trying to figure out what to do for the next two years. I am so overwhelmed and need to figure out what my best plan would be for the next 6 months (i.e. the grace period before I have to start paying my loans regularly.)

I currently have around 55k in federal loans and about 30k in private loans (3 Sallie Mae loans, 1 Discover - all between 10-12% interest)

I make 19/hr and usually work around 35 hours a week but I am technically not a full time employee. As of right now it doesn't look like this is changing. I like my job a lot but it is not what I want to do forever, and I am struggling to find another position and have been applying like crazy since last October, but I haven't even gotten interviews. 

Starting in July my rent will be $300 with no utilities, and my car payment is $300. I'm in the midwest and have a 10 minute commute so food/gas/other cost of living stuff isn't terribly expensive. I have about 2000 stagnant debt on one credit card with 0% apr that I need to pay off, and my other card is my ""living card"" that I put up to $350/mo on for food/gas/gym but pay off the balance. All my accounts are in good standing and I've never missed any payments.  Edit: I also have to get a storage unit once I move as I am moving in with a family member and need to put my furniture somewhere. The 300/mo rent is sort of just until I figure out where I want to live, so that is another aspect of I'm going to have to sign a lease at some point (avg. around here, I'll probably pay around 700/mo if I can't find a roommate, 300-400 is normal with a roommate)

My loans are set to come out of deferment in January. I have nothing in my savings account. 

Obviously paying down the private loans ASAP is priority, but I don't know how to balance the bills outside of that, and I'm afraid my loan payments will be too high for me to pay extra after the grace period. Assuming I don't find another job, I do get 5k/year in educational assistance. I am debating on doing a masters program using the assistance and using it to keep my loans deferred so I can pay as I can, but on the flip side I currently work for a nonprofit and if I don't defer them, I can start applying my payments to PSLF. 

In general I'm just super overwhelmed. Dream situation would be to take 2-3 gap years, pay off my loans as much as possible, and then go back to med school. I wanted to move out of state so bad but it doesn't seem like that's going to be an option. 

Any insight or guidance would rock. Thanks to anyone reading.",finance

personalfinance,What's the best home improvement loan option for us?,"We're closing on a home at the end of the month that's going to need some work done to it: kitchen remodel, floors, backyard, appliances, etc. I'm going to say roughly $50k-75k, depending on what we decide to prioritize and what kind of estimates we get. The home is being purchased with cash and will be fully paid off. 

I've been trying to do research, but would like some feedback on what works best for us.

My first thought is this is the perfect opportunity to use my much-improved credit score to open another account with a better rate and transfer the balance.

personalfinance,"31 years old, dentist, loads of debt, and planning for the future (marriage, buying vs renting etc.)","Alright, sorry for the wall of text, I’m just really struggling with how to approach my debt.

I graduated from dental school in the summer of 2015 with over $400k in student loans, did a one year residency where I put my loans on forbearance, loans currently sitting around $460k with interest rates around 6-7%. Worked for a year on a $156k salary in an affordable part of CT, was paying around $3700/month toward loans but not saving anything. 

Inherited about $25k, paid off a $10k loan from sally mae I had taken out when preparing for residency/moving cost etc, another ~$14k(first,last,brokers fee,moving etc) I put towards relocating to Boston with my gf of almost 5 years where I’ve been working on a “commission” (production we call it) based income, by year end will probably be around $170k but rent is also over $1000 more a month, so dropped loan payments to about $2600/month. Also not able to save much though I put aside more than needed for taxes (independent contractor)

Also racked up about $10k in credit card debt buying new furniture, paying for flights to people’s weddings/bachelor parties/living a little large. My girlfriend also has about $10k (maybe less now) in credit card debt but no student loans. 

I want to propose soon ish, ring is going to set me back about $13-14k, putting down 50% and then can make payments after soon. Accomplished this by investing $12k in a SEP ira due October so I’d have more “disposable” income now to make that $7k payment. This will also be my first retirement investment.

Come Sept. 1 we will be moving into a condo my SO’s mom purchased when the market was in shambles and has been renting since we didn’t know if we would be moving (back) to Boston. Our rent will go from about $2700/month to about $1400. My SO will be done making car payments of $1000/month in November (paying her car off in 3 years.) I think we are both ready for a change of scenery but there are not many cities where we can have a nice place for $1400/month, and no place in Boston pretty much so it may be our home for the foreseeable future while we “prepare” for life.

So, things I/we want to accomplish...

Get engaged (and pay off ring)

Save remaining money due to SEP ira in Oct (about $7k)

Pay off credit cards

Pay student loans in smartest manner (refinance and pay as fast as possible? As little as possible and be taxed on 25 year forgiveness?)

Save for a down payment on a home (this feels unobtainable if paying off loans asap, should definitely pay off credit cards first?)

Marriage (no rush here, though tax benefits and family help make this obtainable)

Biggest challenges: 

Maintaining current quality of life, especially for SO (she was making good money, living cheaply, buying extravagant things before we met. Not making as much money anymore)

Balancing saving vs paying off debts 

Size of debt

Desire to stop throwing money away to landlords, move back to west coast, and own our own property is very strong

So, how do I do this? Do I hire a professional? Is it too risky to go with REPAYE and have taxes due on the forgiven amount? Is that my only way to purchase a home? Will it mess with my abilty to get a loan to open my own business if I’m showing that I’m making very small payments to a very large amount of debt?",finance

personalfinance,Is my payment schedule/plan mathematically smart?,"I am posting under my wife's account: We will be moving soon to a much cheaper apartment/town home in the next couple of months, and I expect to be able to not fall into arrears, despite our debts. But my payment philosopy across a wide amount of accounts is simple:

1.) Do not let interest accrue

So, here are the numbers:

Credit Card #1: Owe $7800
-Interest Rate: 0% until 4/2019, 22.5% thereafter 
- ~$80 monthly payment (minimum)

Credit Card #2: Owe ~$5300
- Interest Rate: 0% until 3/2019, 24.5% thereafter
~ $60 monthly payment (minimum)

Credit Card #3: Owe ~$950
- Interest Rate: 0% until 4/2019, 18.5% thereafter
~ $25 monthly payment (minimum)

Credit Card #4: Owe ~$420
- Interest Rate: 0% until 12/2018, 23.5% thereafter
$61 monthly payment (avoids interest after 12/18)

Credit Card #5: Owe ~560
- Interest Rate: Deferred, 0% until 4/2019, thereafter 25%
~$45 monthly payment pays off balance before interest capitalizes.

Credit Card #5 is a store card.

Now the fun stuff: Student loans! These capitalize quarterly if I let the interest accrue. They are all Department of Ed loans and our income is such that it doesn't make sense right now to consolidate. We're on REPAYE because:

1.) I received a stipend as a graduate student my second year
2.) Between that, a weekend job, and my wife's income, 2017 wasn't a kind year.
3.) While I fully intend to and am qualified for a job making more money than I am now, the semester is still chugging along, and I'd like to focus on writing a Thesis over the summer. I'm not moving on to a Ph.D program in the arts. Credit Card #4 was solely for Ph.D applications and travel, etc, and I could/should have applied to more places, but damn it's expensive.

Loan #1: Owe ~$1100. (from $5500; Loan Disbursed 2008!)
Interest Rate: 6.8%, in Forebearance until 5/2018
Weekly Capitalization of Interest : ~$2
Weekly payment on this account: $28

Loan #2: Owe ~$1400 (from $5500: Loan Disbursed 2008!)
Interest Rate: 6.8%, In Forebearance until 5/2018
Weekly accrual in interest: ~$2
Weekly payment on this account: $2

Loan #3: Owe ~$19,600 (from $20,500; Loan Disbursed 2016)
Weekly accrual in interest: $20.02
Weekly payment on this account: $20.25

Loan #4: Owe ~$9850 (from $10,000; Loan Disbursed 2017)
Interest Rate: 6%
Weekly accrual in interest: $11.35
Weekly payment on this loan: $11.50

Loan #5: Owe $23,200 (from $24,800: Loan Disbursed 2016)
Interest Rate: 6.3%
Weekly accrual in interest: $28.12
Weekly payment on this loan: $28.25

Plan for Credit Cards:

Pay down Credit Card #4 by 12/18; Roll that payment into Credit Card #3, shuffle the deck/see what balance transfers I can make in 03/2019, hopefully 0% but we'll take whatever we can get.

*EDIT*: I mistakenly wrote 03/2018 in the preceding sentence, not 03/2019.

Plan for Student Loans:

Pay down Loan #1 on a quasi-accelerated schedule, roll that payment into Loan #2, then Loan #5, then Loan #4, then Loan #3. Because of REPAYE, my minimum payment is $0, but I don't want to stay poor forever, nor do I want $2.5K of interest to capitalize every year.

About my income: Right now because of school I am not rolling in dough. I plan on taking the weekend job to as close to full time as possible, and then looking for a better line of work either as this thesis is getting written, or immediately during finals week, depending on the state of the rest of our finances. We're going from an $800 payment for our rent to around a $500 payment (we're in gorgeous Central Kentucky).

So, I'm assuming there's a smarter way to plan for repaying this loan, given the following:

1.) I don't have a better job yet.

* Assume belt-tightening: We are/will be foregoing cable internet for unlimited mobile between two lines (which are, sadly, throttled after a paltry 35gb) saves $20/mo.
* Space heater &gt; Electric heater
* Blankets &gt; Electric heater
* Windows &gt; Air Conditioning, etc.
* LED bulbs in everything
* Yearly/monthly subscriptions are for professional organizations: An honor society ($50 annually) and it's chapter ($10 a year), and two organizations ($110/year for one, $80/year for the other) that I hope will function as networking opportunities.
* $50/week grocery bill
* $30/week gas in the car (and for me, a free bus pass will stay free because this thesis ain't done yet)
* Tuition will be billed in August, and it will be around $2K: I intend to schedule a defense that semester and get the degree in Fall 2018. If I don't finish that semester, I will simply say that I finished coursework and made significant progress towards the degree.

So my question is: Can I keep rule #1 in play, or is there a smarter rule that will help me pay down these loans?

""Get a better job"" is a solution, but ""go into arrears until then"" is not. So assume the one will come in the future, but the second needs to happen in the present.

The 401K goes down from 10% of income to 5% in May
Dependents goes from 0 to 1 in May (less tax)
I am sitting on 11K of investments that earn quarterly dividends and yearly capital gains: I don't want to touch those
I have less than 1K in stock, they each pay a little bit (very little) 4 times a year.

For our 2016 taxes, we basically were right on the money...which isn't normally the case for me since I usually have taxes to pay off investment income(capital gains and qualified dividends).

We filed jointly last year, but not sure if my wife's w-4 was changed after we got married.

This year, we filed jointly again.  I had a bit more in investment income, ~ $13k.  So based of my calculations, that should have resulted in an extra $2k and change payment we owed.  However, it turns out we owe $3.5k.  I dug in to the details and my wife only withheld $6.8k this year on $56k taxable income, whereas last year she withheld $8.6k on $53k.

Her payroll department said that everything on her W-4 was corrected when she got married, but somehow this doesn't add up.  Do I need her to withhold at a single status?  Is the discrepancy due to the fact that both of us work and only one of us can claim personal exemptions?

personalfinance,"Help, Credit, budget, situation","Hello,
I’m in need of some personal finance advice. I’ll break down my income, and debts below. I am currently experiencing a snowball effect of debt after poorly utilizing credit cards while in college, spending problems, living above my means and yeah. I have had to relocate several times over the past three years for work. I’m in a specialized field, but was laid off twice in the last four years. Both times I was laid off I relied on a combination of unemployment and my credit cards to hold me over while I was looking for work. I know I should have an emergency fund, but I haven’t been able to save. I am recently considering bankruptcy, but I need some advice.

I am in a little situation because time is of the essence. I just moved to Chicago for work in January 2018, and I subleased someone’s apartment for the remaining four months until the April 30 2018. So I am in the process of finding an apartment that is long-term.  Theoretically, yes I could just resign this lease, but the apartment in my opinion is too expensive, and it is hard for me to justify/afford this long term. I was trying to help a friend out, and they are living with me and are going to be moving to the next apartment with me we move. The current place I am in is about $1500 a month, plus utls, for a one bedroom, so its not viable for us to stay here. Another aspect of this is I have two large dogs, and their breed is on just about everyone’s restricted list, so apartment finding is near impossible. I have just under 14 days to find a new place.

What makes me very concerned is I just woke up this morning with a collections added to my credit from a previous landlord, from 2016, who said I broke my lease, although I gave the required 60 day notice. I received a collection notice in March 2017, disputed with them saying that the lease ended in June 2016 and that I never resigned a new lease. Anyway they still claim I owe from January 2017- June 2017 for about $8700 for those months. I was on a lease with two other people and they also have this on their credit. 

Aside from this, I have decent/good credit. I have had no problem getting loans or anything in the past. None of my accounts have missed payments or anything. My income has increased over the last several years, but I am behind, I don’t know what to do. But due to circumstances I have rolled a lot of my debt on to credit cards and or a personal loan. So I am looking at suggestions to what I can do. I just finished grad school in December 2017, so I am going to have to start making payments on my student loans in the new two months. I have a shit ton of them too. 

I would like to eventually buy a two flat or something and rent out one unit and stay in one. This can’t happen now, because of DTI, but I need advice on the moves I should make. 
I have a really great job right now, which requires a lot of time and flexibility in my schedule. I occasionally have to travel for work so it makes getting a second part time job difficult. It also makes it difficult having dogs, and getting a second job. I can’t be gone that long and leave my dogs at home. I’m single and I have no family or friends that are able to help out. MY friend who lives with me works overnight, so he is resting during the day and gone in the late evenings. Removing my dogs is not an option I am even considering.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Tax Question,"Hi everyone, 

I am filing a correction to my federal tax returns (1040X) to account for cryptocurrency exchanges. (Was not accounted for while filing)

I had a few questions:

1) My understanding is that crypto-to-crypto exchanges are taxable events, therefore they all need to be reported. Can anyone confirm?

2) If I never withdrew to Fiat am I do I still need to file for capital gains/losses? I recall seeing something regarding holding onto currency for over a year changes the status of coins from capital gains to something else. 

3) If my crypto assests posted a gain (+value) as of dec 31, 2017, but a negative loss as of today (4/17) I would file for the former in the 2017 correction, and in 2019  I would report the total value as of 12/31/18?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Married couple in ~40k debt looking for general advice,"Hi there! This is the first time posting here, so not sure what's going to happen here. This is an ""omnibus"" post...I have a few questions for people and I'll put a TL;DR at the end.

So my wife and I have been married for almost three years now. We have moved around a lot, and we have finally settled on jobs where we can actually make careers instead of being stuck nowhere at a dead end job. We've hit some issues along the way and I was hoping that you all would be willing to provide some advice.

So let me start with the most troubling issue - the IRS. I'm writing this out because it's tax day. My wife and I have already submitted our taxes through turbo-tax. It was approved. We owe the government $1200 and got back ~$140 from the state. I have inspected our paychecks, and we have adjusted our W-4s for next year.

We file married-jointly, and will be making ~$86,900 (barring no raises.) We have only claimed ourselves on our W-4s and have added an additional $50 per paycheck to be taken out. We get paid every 2 weeks and should have roughly 19 paychecks left each for the year.

We also pay to fedloans her student loan. We pay $400, even though the minimum has gone down to $372. I do not know if we are paying the principal, because fedloans has the ability to just type in a number in the payment box and it auto allocates the amounts. If somebody knows about this and could help explain, that would be greatly appreciated. However the write off for this past year was $2500, and I expect it to be another $2500 next year.

So in short - we just want somebody to double check - are we good for next year? I've gone to the IRS calculator, but I don't know if I did it right. We don't want to owe the IRS any more money, but we aren't 100% sure. We also live in Virginia, and on the VA-4 I have NO idea if we are on track to not give the state any money. We don't own a home or have any other deductions. Just the base one and school.

We need help budgeting. We have created multiple ""budgets"" however they never really work. The biggest problem is that we just don't follow them. This is self discipline for a big one - but I was wondering if anybody knows of a good budgeting software that has more visual representations, so we can see a pie chart of how much we are saving and what we are doing right and wrong? Again, my wife and I need to be MUCH better on sticking to a budget and that's on us, but I was just curious to see if anybody had any ideas of good visual budgeting software that's free?

So - my wife is working at an IT firm, where she is labelled as the ""help desk coordinator"" however, she's basically an upper level manager at this point. The company is beyond short-staffed, and at this point she is sometimes the only person on helpdesk. She got a pretty good raise last year (about 10%) however with the significantly workload increase and the work she's doing, is it unreasonable to ask for a higher raise? If she was at ~49000, would it be wrong to ask for a raise up to ~55000 (total, not the raise itself haha) at her second year mark? Or should she go even higher? While she's technically not at the office at all times, she's doing work outside of the office, she has to be alone on the helpdesk even though management keeps saying she shouldn't be, and we weren't sure if she should push for a raise or what. We just weren't sure when it's appropriate to ask for a raise and when it isn't?

We have debt in a few different locations and we're not sure where to focus. We have about ~29k in student loans, ~3.7k in car, and then ~8k in credit cards. What should we focus on first? We're paying the minimum on the credit cards and the car right now, but we're not sure if we should be putting more money into certain categories?

I know there's a lot, but the TL;DR:

1. Taxes are brutal, we are making ~86,900 married filing jointly with an extra $2500 student loan. We have only have 2 deductions listed on our W4s, ourselves and married, and we are also putting in an extra $50 per paycheck for the IRS. We have 19 paychecks each (38 for the rest of the year) we will be ok for the IRS next year?

2. We need to discipline ourselves with budgeting - that's a given, but does anybody recommend any good visual budgeting software? Or one that has goals? That would help. Again, we need to kick our butts in gear for better budgeting, but a visual aid would be great.

3. When is it good to ask for a raise? My wife is working her butt off with multiple hats (it happens) but when is it good to ask for a raise? She just got one given to her at ~10%  last September (didn't go into effect until Jan) when would it be good to ask for another one and at what %? She's been given a lot more responsibility over the past year and is essentially a manager now.

4. We have debt with student loans, a car, and credit cards. Where is the best place to really focus down? Right now, we're paying more on the student loans, but the minimum on everything else.

Thank you everybody for any help!",finance
personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to use an out-of-state mortgage lender?,"I am buying a condominium in Illinois, and after shopping around for rates at a variety of lenders, by far the best deal by-the-numbers is the MIT Federal Credit Union, which is located in Massachusetts.  On top of that, I have experience with them, and know they have good customer service and are responsive to my questions.  

However, I have read online warnings against using out-of-state lenders in general, especially a relatively small institution like the MIT FCU, since they lack experience in the local market and therefore may not know reputable people in the area (e.g. appraisers, title companies), or have experience with the particulars of how mortgages work in IL versus MA, etc. etc.  MIT FCU says they lend in all 50 states and have experience doing so, but obviously most of their business is in MA.

personalfinance,Calculating 2018 withholdings after having large tax payments due,"Hello, PF!

I am married, filing jointly, 2 children (one school age, other entering kinder in the fall).  Both hubs and I work full-time jobs.  Our 2017 AGI was $164,083.

Per our 2017 tax return, we were responsible for $21,353 in federal taxes and $11,990 in state taxes.  We had to pay $3404 in federal and $1495 to state.

With the big payments we had to do this year, I ran our numbers through the 2018 IRS withholding calculator to see if we could get closer to breaking even (we don't mind paying a bit but generally don't want to have large refunds, either).  Between our childcare expenses, pre-tax contributions to retirement, pre-tax flexible spending and other deductions, the calculator suggests our 2018 anticipated income tax as $3808.  Is this truly accurate?? I ran the numbers multiple times and it just seems like madness that it is so low.  We have already paid nearly twice that this year.  Calculator says we would have an overpayment of $14,577 if we keep everything the same.

So, is something amiss here, or do we fall in to the category of earners who truly benefit from the 2017 tax law changes?

personalfinance,I disputed a fraudulent credit card charge to FedEx which was then refunded. FedEx has sent the debt to collections. What are my next steps?,"Last fall I noticed a $200 charge to FedEx on my capital one credit card statement. I immediately reported it as fraud and the charge was removed.

I now received a letter from a collections agency for this debt. Is this disputable? Whoever used my credit card had my name and parents address but not my current address. Luckily my parents still live there which is how I've been able to receive these letters. What should my next steps be? Thanks in advance for any advice.

BlockChain,Blockchain Viewpoint Summary from Boao Forum for Asia,"On April 8, the annual meeting of the Boao Forum for Asia in 2018 opened in Boao, Hainan Province. The theme of this year’s conference was “Open and Innovative Asia, a Prosperous and Developing World”.This forum also set up a sub-forum on blockchain again on April 10, following the establishment of the “Digital Currency and Blockchain” sub-forum for the first time in the Boao Forum for Asia last year.

Governor of the Central Bank Yi Gang, Central Bank counselor Sheng Songcheng, Vice President of Renmin University of China Wu Xiaoqiu, former Governor of the Bank of China Li Lihui, Thunder Group CEO Chen Lei, Inspur Group Chairman Sun Pishu, and Visa Vice Chairman Ai Ruiqi all talked about the blockchain during the forum.

Bianews organizes the relevant sections of the Boao Forum on blockchains as follows:

**Vice President of Renmin University of China Wu Xiaoqiu: I studied 4 years and I don't know what the blockchain is.**

Wu Xiaoqiu, vice president of the Renmin University of China and head of the Institute of Finance, at the media meeting of the 2018 annual meeting of the Boao Forum for Asia on the 8th that he had studied the blockchain for four years and never knew what it was.

""Frankly speaking, I was chained to the blockchain. I never knew what a ghost it was. I had a lot of people studying the blockchain. I started to get this stuff three or four years ago. I even found people who wrote books about the blockchain., but I still haven't figured it out. If I don't understand it, it's very difficult to get this stuff.""

Wu Xiaoqiu said: ""I'm not very stupid, but some people deliberately made it very mysterious. I take a wait-and-see attitude toward this kind of financial phenomenon. But the penetration of Internet finance is highly valued and I can see its value. Therefore, there is great development prospect for science and technology finance.""

**Central Bank counselor Sheng Songcheng: The combination of blockchain and virtual currency will have no future**

Sheng Songcheng, counselor of the People's Bank of China and executive dean of the China-EU Lujiazui International Finance Research Institute, said that the combination of blockchain and virtual currency has no future.

**He believes that blockchain is a technology. Bitcoin is a virtual currency. It is just an application of blockchain. If blockchain is combined with virtual currency, blockchain will have no future in virtual currency. . Because the virtual currency is not money, we just use a bitcoin.**

The economic regulation and control in all countries of the world is mainly economic and monetary policies. The basis of monetary policy is that the state controls the currency issuance rights and legal currency. If the virtual currency is flooded, monetary policy cannot be implemented.

Blockchains should not be combined with currency. The combination has no future. It is also better not to use it in finance.

Now that the traditional financial system can already be used for daily use, the use of blockchains in financial efficiency is rather low.

**Yi Gang, Governor of the Central Bank: Strictly Supervising Virtual Currency and Studying the Real Economy of Services**

Yi Gang, Governor of the People's Bank of China, stated at the Boao Forum for Asia that virtual currency has less service to the real economy, some speculation and even some money laundering, or other acts. So in China we have always been cautious about virtual currency.

Regarding the research of digital currency around the world, China’s research is ahead of others. We are also studying how digital currency can serve the real economy in the best possible form, develop safely in the best possible form, and avoid some possible negative effects, to make digital currency better able to serve the economy. This includes blockchain technology as well as financial technology. On the whole, our supervision of virtual currency is very strict. At the same time, we are also studying how to use the positive energy of digital currency and better serve the real economy.

While the financial industry is opening up to the outside world, it is necessary to prevent financial risks and propose three principles for the opening up of the financial industry.

The three principles of the opening up of the financial industry to the outside world are as follows: First, national treatment before access and negative list management. Second, the reform of the opening up of the financial industry and the formation of exchange rate mechanisms should be coordinated with the reform process of capital account convertibility and jointly promoted. Third, while opening up, we must attach great importance to preventing financial risks and make our financial regulatory capabilities match the degree of openness.

**Visa Vice Chairman: Blockchain Available in B2B Payment Scenarios**

Blockchains are not very large now, and they are not very fast and cannot be transmitted in real time, which is not enough to support most payment scenarios. Blockchain capacity and speed do not support retail operations because retail customers are very complex and very fragmented.

She suggests that it can be used in corporate transactions rather than retail customers, and revealed that Visa is exploring the use of blockchain in B2B scenarios.

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt Repayment Strategy,"My wife and I graduated in May of 2017. We started with $140,000 and now have about $118,000 in student loans. We are paying about $1,500 a month plus large one time payments whenever we come across decent cash. We are currently paying to be out of debt in 5 ½ years.

We both turned 22 in Nov. I make $68,000 a year with an expected 2% raise and a $5-10,000 bonus at the beginning of next year. She is currently making $20,000 but has received 3 raises since starting 6 months ago with expected raises and perhaps a partnership in the future. She also sells stuff on Etsy perhaps making $10,000.

Current expenses include rent, insurance, student loans, utilities, food, tithe, gas, just in case, cell phone and savings. This ends up being around $3,600 a month. Cash flow is around $1,000-1500

We have $25,000 in savings I have a 401k with a 6% match. I’m contributing 6%. Some suggest stopping contributing until debt is paid, but the tax benefits seem to be better to me.

I have a degree in finance so I feel like tackling the highest interest is the best, but I’m wondering about your feelings about the snowball method. 

I also am afraid of the unknown, so I am terrified of doing a $15,000 loan payment and only having a $10,000 bank balance. What are your thoughts on the $1,000 savings? Should I do $5,000 and pay $20,000 in student loans?

personalfinance,PAYE vs REPAYE for soon to be physician?,"I understand some of the basic differences between the PAYE and REPAYE plans (REPAYE subsidizes some interest, but has no caps on monthly payments and counts spousal income even if filing separately), but I am having trouble figuring out how to calculate which one will be best for me and my wife. I know (as much as anyone can) what our income will be like for the next 10 years, so I am trying to calculated things out, but I don't know how to calculate things like the cost of filing separately, for example.

We graduated college four years ago, I had zero student loan debt and hers was minimal. She has been employed since then (and has been taking graduate classes for her masters of education) and I have been in medical school. I graduate this May, and start my residency July 1st. She currently makes ~$45k/year, and I will make $58k starting July 1st. She has about $30k in student loans left, with interest rates ranging from 4%-6%. My loans will be almost exactly $100k, with interest rates mostly around 6%.

Our incomes will not dramatically increase during my 4 or 5 year residency and (maybe) fellowship. When I finish, I can expect to be employed with an income &gt;$200k/year. We currently have no children but would likely not have any until we are nearing that income bump, so we will likely both have our current incomes for 4-5 years. I may or may not qualify for public service loan forgiveness at the end of 10 years depending on where I go into practice.

So, how can I calculate which payment plan is better for me? They'll both have identical payment amounts while I'm in residency/fellowship, below the standard payment amount. When I start making ""real doctor money"" the REPAYE payments go up above the standard repayment amount, while PAYE stays capped. How do I figure out which option is better: Married filing separately under PAYE, Married filing jointly under PAYE, or married filing jointly under REPAYE?

My gut tells me that I should just go with PAYE, since that will cap the minimum payments, and when I'm an attending I'll be able to choose to pay more rather than being forced to, giving me a possibility of a bigger PSLF, for example. But I'm wondering if I'll be missing out on some of the REPAYE benefits that will outweigh those factors. I'll happily answer questions I didn't give enough information about or use a calculator or spreadsheet, but I can't find one that actually helps me determine the benefits/penalties of the spousal income/joint vs separate part of the equation.",finance

personalfinance,Over mileage on my lease. I have options but trying not to get screwed or overpay!,"As the title suggests my SO and I leased a new car in 2015. The lease is up this July and we are reviewing our options trying to figure out what the best move for us is. When we originally leased the vehicle we knew we wanted to purchase it in the end, but after speaking with the dealership it may make more sense to try and trade it in for something cheaper and used. 

We put $0.00 down in 2015 and have been paying $352.00 a month for almost 36 months now. The residual value of the vehicle will be approximately $16,000.00 in July, bringing the retail value of the car to ~$28,500. Now, we are due to be WAY over our allotted mileage of 36,000 due to two things. 

1.) Not worrying too much about it this whole time since we were expecting to purchase the vehicle. 
2.) Our secondary car has some issues that make it only good for short distances so we pile on miles into the main vehicle (the lease).

If we were to trade in the vehicle outright, we would owe somewhere in the realm of $5000.00 in overage fees.. so that has never been an option. 

As of now these are the options we are considering. 

Option 1: Obtain an auto loan for the residual value from our bank. We both have great credit so a low interest loan would be expected. If we can pay the loan over 36 months, we would own the vehicle in 2021 but based off the mileage we use it would probably have somewhere around 120K miles, not great, but could be worse. Obviously vehicles depreciate quickly, but our concern with this option is that we will have paid $28,000.00 over 6 years for a nice car that will have sort of high mileage after all is said and done, and that’s barring any necessary major work or repairs between now and then. This fear is what prompted option 2.

Option 2: The dealership has been HOUNDING us to bring our vehicle in for them to take a look at it and “asses the situation”. They clearly are aware that our lease is coming up on its end date and they know how over we are on miles. They make it sound like they can work something out to assist us, but I’m wary of that, since they’re obviously in it for their own profit. The only thing I am wondering is if they really can take the car off our hands in exchange for a lower mileage older used car, if it would be worth it in the end. For example, say we can get into a $10,000 car with similar mileage, finance it at the same interest rate and everything and own it within a few years, we save $6000 in the difference. This is all speculation because I have no idea what the dealership will say / what they will offer. Which leads me to the next point. 

I am wondering if anyone has any similar experience in this department. Is it worth taking our car in for their assessment and seeing what they have to say? I’m worried we’ll get suckered into a bad deal. The cleanest transaction in my mind is to get an auto loan from our bank, pay off the residual value to the dealership and pay off the loan until we own the vehicle. However, if there is an alternate solution that can save us money I would love to take that avenue. 

Before anyone asks, we know it probably wasn’t smart leasing a new vehicle with $0 down expecting to buy it at the end of the term agreement. If we could go back we would have definitely purchase a USED vehicle for half the cost :( lesson learned though.",finance
personalfinance,"Federal and state withholdings on wife's paychecks low, but end of year burden high. Can a tax professional help this situation?","My financial situation has always been basic so I've done my own taxes with various tax software.

This year, filing joint married, my wife's W-2s show a noticeably small amount of Federal and state tax withheld. She works part-time at a coffeeshop so her check amounts are low. I understand that the payroll withholding calculations go to $0 for Federal and state withholdings with a low enough check amount, which is what I believe happened here.

However, the 1040 form shows that we owe a couple thousand because it only takes into account gross income. I get how this makes sense, but doesn't it seem unfair/incorrect to in essence punish her for having small paychecks by taking so much at the end of the year?

The house is in decent shape - though the roof should be replaced in the next few years, and there's probably $5k - $10k more in various repairs/improvements that could be done.   

Every time I read a news article about booming home values in the area, about buyers offering way more than asking prices, etc, I wonder if I should be reacting somehow.

personalfinance,Prepping for a move and graduate school,"So I'm just trying to cover all my bases before some pretty big financial changes that are coming up and was wondering if anyone had any advice on things I should be aware of.

I'm quitting my job and moving from CT to Montana to go to graduate school this upcoming August. (For a PhD program, so I'm looking at 5 years at a minimum). Before I do that, I'm getting married (early July).  My last day at work is 5/31. Me and my spouse are combining incomes and what not, and plan to have between $7k-$11k in the bank come moving time (depending on how some stuff shakes out). I was hoping to have more, but some medical issues siphoned about $2000 away, and some issues with her family resulted in us finding out we were paying for the wedding a couple months ago. (Fine by me, just wish they hadn't insisted on paying for it for the first 8 months we were engaged). I'm going to be make ~$22k before taxes as a grad student, and she doesn't have a job lined up there, but is graduating with an M.S. in Animal Science, so I'm assuming she can at least find something that makes $30k/year or so. 

She has no debt, I have ~$70k in student loans and $16k on a car loan. Half the student loans are with SoFi, half are PAYE. The two total $380/mo. The car loan is $227/mo (not worried about repairs as it's under full warranty for 8 years), and the car insurance is $90/mo. She'll need insurance for her car (which is paid off) so we're looking at about another $90/mo for that, or so. We're (hopefully) living on campus with everything included for $850/mo. Plus things like winter tires, a little storage unit, insurance for my bike, etc (none should be too expensive). We also may need to replace her car at some point. That said, I can defer the student loans for while I'm in grad school, at least until she finds a decent job and then the plan is to start throwing all our discretionary income at them. Is this a good way to proceed with them? Should I focus on paying off the federal, PAYE ones first? My SoFi interest rate is a little lower, but the term is also shorter.

The part I'm really worried about is between June 1st and August 1st (or possibly September 1st, not sure when I start getting paid). It's gonna cost a couple/few grand just to get across the country with all our stuff, plus I know miscellaneous expenses add up with weddings and such, phone bill, gas, etc. I'm losing my health insurance (not that it did much) when I stop working, and the health insurance at the college is $4000/year. (I don't have to worry about hers as she is staying on her parents' until she gets a decent job that offers it). So I could either pay COBRA, but I have no idea how to go about getting that, or finding out how much it costs, or look into something like Solidarity Health Share, which my parents have used and is cheaper than my current insurance, while covering more (my insurance covers 0% of everything up to the $5000 deductible so it's basically useless unless I get run over by a train). https://www.solidarityhealthshare.org/ They don't cover pre-existing conditions for the first year, but I should be OK there as I don't have any that I'm aware of. Does anyone know where I can find out how much I'd be paying for COBRA insurance? 

The other thing I was worried about is we're going to have all our possessions in a UHaul truck and want to make sure that they don't get stolen while it's parked in a motel parking lot on the trip, and if they do that it's covered. Would renters insurance cover that? Can I get renters insurance before I move into the apartment? 

Also, I have a TRS 401k with about $1500 in it (yay retirement) that I don't want to start having to pay for. Can I take that money out and put into something else? Or is it worth just paying the small percentage? 

Any other general advice for people that have been in similar situations would be welcomed, as well. Heading to work but I will reply later. Thanks!

My future plans include buying a house within the next few years and living a normal life in the northwest United States. I’ve made a basic outline on my loans and bills. Any input is greatly appreciated and I would be glad to provide more information.  

*Take home paycheck* $60,000 +or- $5K yearly for now, although my career moves are unknown at this time hopefully the pay will only go up or stay around the same. 

**Loan Breakdown**


Federal Student Loan, Direct Parent Plus under my father.

Current Payment: $412/month on a Extended Graduated Repayment plan - with a repayment term up to 25 years. My payments will gradually increase over time throughout the term.

1: $29,525 at 7.65%

2: $20,479 at 7.65%

3: $13,718 at 6.16%

Nelnet Student Loans



Current Payment: $0.00/month until October on a Income Driven Repayment Plan. (I was not working my current job last year when it was re-certified) 

4: $5,539 at 6.55% 

5: $4,526 at 4.41%

6: $4,608 at 3.61%

7: $2,316 at 3.61%

8: $7,088 at 3.15%


Total Loans: $87,795

**Current Accounts**

Ally High Interest Savings: $15,025

Checking: $6,507

Cash: $1,000

**Bills/Month**

Camper trailer loan: $80 with probably $8,000 left on the loan

Cell phone and auto insurance: $117

Gas:$100

Misc/Dog/Cat: $600 

Plane tickets: $400


So obviously I have a bunch of loans that I can clearly see are getting bigger and bigger and I really have no idea what I’m doing. I love the high interest savings from Ally and am reluctant to take anything out of there, all I want to do is put in, I’ve already made $25 by doing nothing! I own my car and live in my camper trailer on my parents land or with my boyfriend when I’m not away at work. I am comfortable and I put away money from every check, I use credit cards to get airline miles but pay them off in full every month. My credit score per TransUnion is 745. I feel like I could continue to make minimum payments and be okay, even after the Nelnet loans get re-certified in October. But is there a better way?",finance
personalfinance,Need help managing debt and my budget.,"Hello I'm currently at a point in my life where I'm always very stressed about money just like most people and I hate it. I'm ready to do something about it.

I'm currently 23 years old, working as a network technician making 35k a year living in Athens, GA. My plan is to work at my current position for a couple more years and use the experience to move into something better.

I make around 2100 a month. My current bills are as follow

* 450 - rent
* 280 - car payment
* 135 - car insurance
* 206 - loan 1 payment
* 65 - internet
* 40 - water utilities
* 360 - 1 month of groceries
* 82 - credit card 1
* 25 - credit card 2
* 25 - gas for car
* 20 - haircut
* 20 - gym membership
* 60 - entertainment
* 30 - coffee
total being 1798 a month for living expenses.

I have about 2500 in savings. 3500 in total for credit card debit.

I'm looking to reduce my bills by at least 200-300 /mo if possible. I have 2 Student loans, 1 parent plus loan that is co-signed with my mother for 26k 7% interest and the other is in my name for 11k 4% interest. The first loan I pay 206 /mo, Its income driven off my mothers income of 60k. My second loan payments are coming up and I'm expecting it to be anywhere from 80-120 a month. I have a car loan that is at 15k, I drive a 2016 Kia Soul with 20k miles. Looking to possibly sell it to get something cheaper.

I'm not very satisfied with my upcoming situation I'll be putting little into savings and paying off none of my debt until i get a better paying job. I came up with 2 possible? options I might be able to take to keep me afloat until I find something better.

* Option 1. I'll take out a personal Loan of 42k, Pay off my Co-signed loan, Pay off my second student loan of 11k, and pay off my car loan. All 3 of these current loans average almost 600 dollars a month on payments. Now If i pay them all off I'll be down to a single payment on the 42k loan. Will this payment be much lower or about the same as what I'm paying right now. Thats what I'll need to figure out. If this all goes well I could possibly sell my 2016 Kia soul for around 12-14k and then buy something cheaper for around 10k? Use the remaining money from that to pay off my credit card debit which would then reduce my monthly payments by another 100 dollars.

* Option 2. Take out a personal loan to pay off my co-signed loan with my mother and then have that debt in my name and possibly get a lower interest rate and monthly payment.

Not entirely sure the best route to take and any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Best way of trading crypto with other's money,"Hey guys,

My family has recently come into some money and after significant discussions about cryptocurrencies and the great opportunity to enter the markets right now I have convinced my parents to allocate a portion (approx. $10K) for investment in the crypto space. 

I am looking for the easiest way to trade these funds on their behalf, starting with converting from fiat to crypto. I will most likely have one of my parents create their own Gemini/Coinbase account to buy crypto with fiat (I already have my own personal account in Gemini and other exchanges, however, I am worried that buying that much crypto directly through my accounts could trigger issues; I am 22 with only part-time income, so this transaction would be highly uncharacteristic and would probably raise some FED eyebrows)

Once the conversion to crypto is done, however, can I simply send the crypto to one of my already-existing accounts on an exchange, or should I also create separate exchange accounts for my parents? Some of the exchanges I have accounts on don't require ID verification (KuCoin, Bittrex) and I will only be allocating a certain portion of the funds into alts, so I don't want to have to wait until the accumulation period is long gone to get my parents verified by an exchange, but I am worried about the implications that there could be for trading funds that aren't mine on an account that is. Does anyone have any experience or tips with this?

Thank you!",cryptocurrency

I will be an incoming medical student this summer and was hoping for some financial advice.  I have ~30k in savings at the moment and my tuition and fees for school will be ~20k a year.  I have no credit card debt or loans from undergrad.  What do you think would be the best use of my savings?  I was planning to pay off the first year of tuition and fees with the savings and keep the rest for emergency or any other expenses that come up.  For years 2-4, I would take out federal unsubsidized loans at 5.31% simple interest.  I thought it would be good to pay for the first year out-of-pocket since the interest on the federal loans accrue while in school.  Do you think this is good or should I plan something else?

personalfinance,How can i get my finances back on track?,"I'll save the long winded excuses at the start here, I have about $6000 in ""stupid young consumer"" credit card debt cause I got a $5000 credit limit on my first card and didn't plan ahead enough and shit hit the fan.

$5400 -CC 1

$360 -CC 2

$150 - Dr. Bill

$100 - outstanding car ins. Bill (I'm insured with a different company

$3000 Federal Student debt.

I've worked out a budget that should let me get everything but CC 1 and the student debt paid off by August, and get $500 down on CC 1 at the same time cause it's still gathering interest and I don't want that account to be marked as ""unobtainable"" or whatever they do that fucks your credit while I work on the rest. The car insurance just popped up on my credit report, I wasn't even aware I owed them before a month ago. Turns out, when I had car ins under my dad when I was 18/19 and we switched companies, he refused to pay their final statement or something - I was giving my dad cash for my portion of the bills - and it hit my credit finally. 

I looked into debt consolidation options but my credit, rightfully so, is garbage and I don't qualify for much of anything. There was one thing that I ""should qualify"" for, but the agent forwarded me to another company that was going to ""help me"" and they sounded super foreign and everything sounded sketchy so I opted to just do it the hard way instead of potentially risking ruining what credit I have left.

personalfinance,[AZ]Ex-Employer sent me a 1099 and W-2,"Throwaway just in case. I worked for a pool company from May 2016 until May 2017. I agreed to be 1099'd for all of 2016 because the employer was a friend of a friend and said he couldn't afford it. We talked and he said all of 2017 I would be a W-2 employee. He was kind of a lazy employer and didn't get me the W-4 to fill out until about February but said he would still make me an employee for the whole year and if I wanted to take extra tax money out from each check in order to get me caught up on taxes I could. Around the same time he went through some personal issues and started not showing up to appointments, missing day's completely, and just all around not being a good business owner. By May I was fed up with it and after he got upset with me for him not doing his job I quit on the spot. 

Since then I had to fight to get my full wages by filling a complaint with the Industrial commission of AZ. I had all that resolved but expected issues to arise tax season which they did. I didn't receive a W-2 by the deadline so I had to contact the IRS and try to estimate my taxes as well as I could as instructed by the IRS. Now 1 day after the deadline for filing I received a 1099 and a W-2 from the employer which makes me think he purposefully waited until the last minute to send it in order to be a pain in the ass but of course can't prove this.  Now I'm curious as to what my best options are going forward? I have a CPA but he is of course off today now that the tax season ended. Is this something I should contact a tax lawyer about or should my CPA be able to handle this?

Other info about my employment and why I don't think I should be considered a 1099 contractor. I worked for him on his pools and only his pools. He provided the truck I used and paid all of the insurance and expenses. He provided all the equipment and chemicals I needed in order to clean and service the pools. I never signed a single document stating that I would be on a 1099.",finance
personalfinance,My overtime has been unpaid for more than two months. What now?,"(Also posting this in /r/Jobs because I'm not sure where to share this exactly)

tl;dr
I work in a retail store, covered a second store for a couple weeks, and one day I was late so I was never punched in, manager said she'd handle it, she tried, someone above her took it out because they thought it was suspicious, and it made my hours for the week 42 instead of 48, leaving me without overtime. All efforts to reinstate the pay by my in store managers has been met with denial in one place or another, now it's more than two months later and my manager tells me she can get me the money for the shift but not the overtime ""yet"" How hard is it to pay your employee?

--------------------------------------------------------

I work in a retail store, and another nearby store was short staffed for a week so I filled in working both stores. (Let's say Home and Away)

On one day I worked at Home store, I was eleven minutes late, which prevented me from clocking in on arrival, a manager would have to do it later. I worked 9:11am to 3:04pm with a 30 minute break in the middle, then went and worked closing at Away store from 3:45pm to 12:20am.

When I left Home store, I was unable to punch out which means my manager hadn't added my shift yet. I said something to her, she said she'd get it later. And she did. I had to ""approve"" it in the work computer as an edited shift, and that was that.

Had nothing changed, I would have gotten eight hours of overtime at Away store on my last day of the week. Only 2 were in. Then, I noticed that the edited shift had vanished from the computer's time-cards. Asked my manager, she told me someone above her had taken it out. She didn't know why, and she would try and fix it.

She never got to fix it. Every time she put it in, someone else took it out, and then the pay-period past. So then they stopped trying until I could ""prove"" I wasn't paid for that time with a pay-stub. Now, I'm almost convinced this was a ploy against me because they knew my access to my electronic (I went paperless) stubs had been locked for more than a year. The ADP customer service is garbage, and it took me calling them nine days in a row before I finally snapped and yelled at someone, (while assuring them I understood it wasn't their personal fault) telling them how ridiculous it is that they can't tell me why my account is locked or get me into it. So, they unlocked it and I had the ability to show what the hours were on that pay period.

But, that raises another question; How is it no one in my company was able to tell my manager or me what I was paid? In what world does an employer not know what their employee was paid? Why make them prove it themselves? I could have even faked the printed paystub if I wanted to.

Now repeat that, from February 5th until now. I have still not been paid for the missing shift, nor paid the overtime I would have accumulated from Away store. To their credit, I know my managers are trying, but every time they put it in, no matter how many times they email the DM, or make phone calls, I have sat and watched them do it, someone else keeps pulling the shift from my time cards and I have not been paid the shift or the overtime.

Now, my manager tells me yesterday that she has it set up where I will be paid for the shift, as Home would have paid for the shift to start with, but since the overtime would have accumulated at Away, I will not be getting the overtime yet.

I'm so frustrated and so tired of this. I've been patient, very understanding, and non-aggressive with anyone in the situation working to solve my issues because I can literally watch my managers spend an hour or two on the phone trying to fix it, get it applied, then get it yanked out from someone above us who thinks there's a fraudulent action occurring, apparently.

Should I take any extra steps? I've been suggested to contact the Labor Board, or at least /say/ I'm going to, possibly even call the DM's personal work number listed in our break room and tell him the short of it;

""I know you know of this issue. All four managers, being SM, ASM, and Supervisors have been trying for over two months to fix this. I've been patient, I've waited, and I just want this dealt with. Even getting the pay now I still feel cheated and played. The damage was done. I understand that [Company] is not inherently malicious, that it's not a slight against me, but even if I had the money today, the damage to me and the trust I had has been done. I would like to solve this simply in-house without having to contact the Labor Board if I could. I just want it dealt with by now. is there anything you can do, or I can do, to solve this faster?""

Does anyone have any suggestions or additions to what I should say to my DM, or even the VP of our Zone?",finance
personalfinance,How much is a car worth TO YOU?,"So, I guess this is more of a car finance-related question, but I want to see if there is a general consensus between people who don't lease their vehicles. I've come up with an equation, which I'll refer to as PWV (Personal Worth Value) or how much car you actually need versus how much you can afford. Here's the rundown:

So, the general consensus is that you should lease a car at or below 10-50% of your annual income, we'll use 35% to maximize options, whilst leaving wiggle room for fuel consumption, insurance, repairs, etc. We'll also use the 60,000 annual income as that is the average for most Americans, per BusinessInsider

35% of 60,000 = 21,000. This is how much you should aim for when looking to lease a vehicle for no more than 4 years. Less is ideal because of interest rates.

So, we have our 21,000 car. Probably your average sedan or hatchback, but do we really need a 21k car? Here's my thoughts.

The way that I value a car is how much it is worth every day that I own it. How much is this car worth to me on a daily basis?

Well, look at it this way.

If you take 21k and divide it by the 4 years it takes to pay it off, that's 5,250 a year. Going down the rabbit whole, that's 437.5 a month, 109.375 a week, and 15.625 a day, shown here:

21,000/4 = 5,250
5,250/12 = 437.5
437.5/4 = 109.375
109.375/7 = 15.625

I'm paying 15.625 dollars every day to simply own the car. Not drive it, own it. Again, this is not including insurance, down payments, etc. This is a simple as it gets, folk.

Doesn't sound too bad, right? Well, contemplate this for just a moment. Are you driving this car every day? To most people, the answer is no. At most, if you work the standard 9-5, 5 days a week, you'll only really be driving it 5-6 days a week. 

There's a 1-2 day gap there.

I personally only am home maybe 5 days a month, and I drive a company vehicle, meaning my Personal Worth Value of a vehicle is significantly less than someone who drives 5 days a week. (4 times less).

So if I go back and look at my daily cost of owning a 21,000 vehicle, 15.625, and multiply it by 5, that's 62.5 dollars a month. Multiply it by 12, that's 750 even. Multiply that by 4, that's 3,000 dollars even, as shown below.

15.625 x 5 = 62.5
62.5 x 12 = 750
750 x 4 = 3,000.

Subtract 3,000 from 21,000, and you get 18,000. That's 18,000 dollars you have LOST by owning a vehicle you are not driving. You are not maximizing your money spent owning a 21,000 car if you only drive it 5 times a month like I do. 

Any thoughts, questions, comments? I thought it would be interesting to break down not just how much car you can afford, but how much car you actually need. Me? I don't need a 21,000 car because frankly, I just don't NEED that much car. Would I want it? That's a whole other story.

personalfinance,"Buying House, Renting out Rooms","Hi everyone, first time posting here so take it easy on me.

I'm a recent mechanical engineering grad, been working about a year on the East coast, making $72k. Have about 20k in student loans left, aggressively paying them off, but will only pay the minimum when I get to about 10k left, because those interest rates will be only about 3%. No other debt.

My goal is to move to the Denver area and buy a 3 bedroom house, and save a lot of money (potentially have the monthly mortgage payments paid for) by renting out the other 2 rooms to people. I have had great success with roommates in the past and actually prefer to have roommates. I have friends in the Denver area, plus I'm into hiking in a huge way, and have always dreamed of living near the Rockies. This is all of course given that the job situation will work out in that area- will be looking into jobs and will move if the offer is right.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to achieve that goal, and consider if it's a feasible one or not- specifically with buying a house. What are some of the steps I should take to buy the house? How feasible is it in expecting to have the mortgage payments covered 100% if two roommates are there paying rent? Really if I have to pay some out of pocket it wouldn't be a huge deal, plus I understand I should increase my emergency fund for maintenance costs associated with the house. I've also heard you can get loans for as little as 3.5% down payment, so I would probably go for that. I understand you'd then have to pay an extra mortgage insurance payment, but I think it'd be worth it with two roommates there. Any advice would be much appreciated!",finance

I have been using the excess to try to build our 'emergency fund', a separate account to build a 'down payment fund' and reducing credit card debt. Our household expenses including debt payments and student loans are $3,100/month - I am working on building an emergency fund of $9300 (3 months of expenses).

Currently: $3300 in emergency fund $2100 in down payment fund (lease is up in August, and if we have to move we will need to put out $3600). 

I have a bill for summer tuition due in early May, for $3,817.50. I will have to pay this out of pocket, as federal student loans are not disbursed until after this summer term. To pay by card there is a 3.5% processing fee: $133. 

So, where the request for advice comes in: We're planning on kids soon, but I need to be on more solid financial footing before we start. Currently I have $11,200 in credit card debt - $1800 of which is at 1.99% APR, the remaining $9,400 is at 0% until February 2019. 

I also have $21,000 in student loans at a 6% APR. $8,300 at 6.8% APR, and $3,400 at 3.28% APR. (All federal) Since I am enrolled over half-time these are currently deferred - and I am not making payments during deferment. 

My fall semester will cost $5,200, which will be covered by a federal loan. The loan rate will be 6%, and I am eligible to take out up to $10,500. 

1. What's the best course of action to attack these debts?
2. Is there any benefit to taking out the excess amount at a 6% APR, and paying down the 6.8% APR loan?
3. With kids coming is it better to focus on building up the emergency fund, or should I aggressively pay down debt?

Thanks all!",finance

personalfinance,"What is a ""normal"" APR for someone with good credit? Chase won't lower mine.","First, some data about me: I have a Slate card open with Chase, my first and only credit card from a major financial institution, which I have had open for four years now. I have no other lines of credit open other than a store credit card. My credit score, regardless, hovers around 775. My CUR is usually below 15% at any given time, and the highest it's ever been is 20-25% one month.

I called Chase the other day to see if they would lower my APR, which is currently over 24% (!). A supervisor gave me the runaround and said that they don't wait for folks to call and ask, but rather reduce APRs as they are able (something that makes no sense to me—why would they do that as a business?). He attributed the card's high APR potentially to my lack of credit history, despite my high score.

Would this really rationalize that high of an interest rate, or should I be looking for a different card starting yesterday?

Thanks in advance.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Are The USA Tax Authorities The Ones That Want Crypto To Crypto Tax Profits From Exchanges Based In Other Countries? And Is It Fair In Your Opinion?,"I've been reading from various posts on Reddit that the IRS wants crypto to crypto trading profits, even if it's from other exchanges in other countries. In my country, they only want crypto profits only if it has been converted to fiat, which is fair I think. But things might change in future.

I don't think it's fair for the IRS to demand taxation in crypto to crypto profits in overseas exchanges IMHO. There are two reasons for this:
1. Because the US government doesn't have jurisdiction on other countries, AFAIK. Therefore, they shouldn't demand taxation on an exchange they can't prosecute in case funds are lost.
2. AFAIK, tax is only when assets are converted into fiat? The Federal Reserve only has jurisdiction on the federal reserve notes, and no jurisdiction (third and last time I use this word) on cryptocurrencies. Therefore they shouldn't tax something they have no control over.

What are your thoughts?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,IRS tax refund offset: Federal tax withholding minus Calculated Refund,"I was overseas for about 6 months last year. During that time, I kept my tax exemptions the same as if I were back in the US. My company contracted an accounting firm to do my taxes. They calculated a tax refund of $10. When I got my refund, the IRS only gave me $7. My federal tax withholding was $17. So, it looks like the IRS subtracted $17 with $10 to calculate my actual refund.

I searched on Google to find out more. I saw this IRS page: https://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/get-help/offsets. None of those factors apply to me. I don't owe any taxes or other debts. I live in FL, so there is no state income tax. I also have not received any notice of an offset.

What does it mean when the IRS subtracts my federal tax withholding from my calculated refund?",finance

Firstly, Im not into canabis so I wasn’t looking for a weed coin but while I was researching coins I did find Ganjacoin (MRJA). The reason it got my interest was that it has a clear use case. Its aim is to provide a currency for dispensaries who at the moment can’t use banks because in the US its still illegal at a federal level so they wont handle their assets. The coin is actually commodity backed by feminized cannabis seeds and they are opening a dispensary which will allow for each coin to be traded for one gram of cannabis! They have their mobile wallet in works and are in talks with multiple companies about potential adoption.

personalfinance,"Starting a new job, how to handle tax withholding to minimize refund?","I recently was offered a new job after graduating college in engineering. Base salary is $72,500 paid semi-monthly, with a start date of April 23. I've calculated that my gross pay for this year will be $49,983. My fiance and I will be getting married this year, so for 2018 we will file jointly as married. Applying the standard deduction of $24,000 means my taxable income for 2018 should be $25,983. Looking at tax calculators for 2018, and double checking with published tax tables, my expected federal income tax owed should be $2,736.96 and my state (NC) taxes owed should be $1,494.02 which brings my total tax burden to $4,230.98.

Of my 17 paychecks I expect this year, I would want $248 withheld each time, correct? Looking at online calculators with one withholding, $420.00 will be withheld. This means I could expect a refund of $2,718 if I only claim one withholding.

How do I go about knowing how many withholdings to list, to make my taxes withheld correct for both Federal and State?

I also expect to adjust this for the year of 2019, where my gross pay will be higher.",finance

personalfinance,Cash-out mortgage refinance rates are not always higher than regular (non-cash-out) rates!,"In doing my research for a cash-out refi I'm trying to do, I dug up this interesting fact.

Check out this spreadsheet I made: https://imgur.com/a/e6gDF6J

I created it by manually plugging in all of the numbers from Table 1 and Table 2 in https://www.fanniemae.com/content/pricing/llpa-matrix.pdf . What you see in my spreadsheet is the difference between the number in Table 1 and the corresponding number in Table 2.

Red (positive) numbers represent an increased interest rate, which is the common-knowledge expectation for a cash-out refi.

But note that there are green (negative) numbers there too, which show that for certain combinations of credit score and LTV, it's actually cheaper to do a cash-out refi than it is to do a regular loan!

And, there's a whole swath of circumstances (LTV between 70.01% &amp; 75% w/ credit score under 720; or LTV b/w 75.01% &amp; 80% w/ credit score b/w 640 &amp; 719) where the common-knowledge ""cash-out rates are higher"" is simply not true.

Keep this in mind if you're considering a cash-out refi!

(Of course your mileage may vary, since the investors putting up the money to fund your loan may have their own criteria. But this is good ammo for negotiating a lower rate for yourself.)",finance
personalfinance,Credit score dropped 20 points because of automatic deferment on loan from California wildfires. What to do?,"I was notified last month that my federal student loan provider was automatically giving all CA residents 1 month of deferred loan payments because of the wildfires. As far as I can tell, they didn't give me an option, they just applied it automatically. I called the lender just to double-check and they said that it was being applied to all CA accounts and that automatic payments would begin again in April. 

I have never missed a payment or made a late payment. 

I go on Credit Karma this morning to find that both of my credit scores dropped 20 points. 

The explanation is that the ""affected by natural disaster"" remark was removed from my account. 

Why would this negatively affect my credit? What can I do? I'm frustrated because I didn't even ask for this in the first place. I was ready to make my payment last month the same way that I always do.",finance
personalfinance,ARM vs VRM: Mortgages.,"When applying for a mortgage, a variable rate may be enticing with the promise of rates going down. In my experience, people often mistake an adjustable rate mortgage with a variable rate mortgage. Although your annual interest rate is based on the posted prime rate plus or minus an adjustment factor for both products, there are some important differences: 

With an adjustable rate mortgage, your payments will actually fluctuate. If the rate goes up, your payment goes up accordingly. Banks are not required to send out individual mailers or reminders of prime rate changes. They do however post them immediately following the change. If your payment bounces as a direct result of the increased payment amount, you will be responsible for all incurred bank fees.

A variable rate mortgage differs since the payment amount will stay the same throughout the term, your amortization (life of the loan) will change to account for the changes in the posted prime rate. This means that if the rate goes up, your principal will be reduced more slowly and visa versa.",finance

personalfinance,Selling a Used Car Online? Be Aware of a Possible Scam,"Hi PF.  Long time listener, first time poster.

I'm trying to sell my car online by owner, because the trade-in price is a joke.  In addition to the usual remote-buyer scams (i.e. ""please consider it sold, give me full name &amp; address to send a check""), I've encountered 2 or 3 instances of a slightly more involved scam.

Essentially, you'll get a phone call from a random number. If you answer, the caller will use a canned line -- something like ""Hi, I'm wondering if your car is still for sale?"" I'm pretty sure it's a recording.  Once you respond, the line will go dead, but not hang up.  If you hang up on the call, within a few moments you'll receive a text from the same number saying that they're having phone trouble.  They'll ask one or two obvious questions (even if that info is in the online posting).

Then, they'll ask if you could go to some shady URL to pull a report on the VIN number, and then send it to a random email address (like firstname349864 @ yahoo.com).  If you respond, like I have, that you already have a CarFax report available for their review, they'll pretty much ignore your responses and press you to go to the URL they provided.

In the latest iteration of this, the person told me to go to platinumvincheck.com.  I did some cursory Googling, and nothing came up -- although a crapton of other, similar fly-by-night VIN check services did come back.

I'm honestly not sure what the endgame is by pushing feckless car sellers to a random VIN check website.  I imagine at the very least, they get money from you to ""run the VIN"".  Who the hell knows if that is accurate.  Plus, by doing so they get your full name, address, birthday, and CC details.  Just imagine all the wonderful ways they can screw up your life with that info in hand.

Remember -- Google Voice is your friend.  You can block these idiots easily, and they never get your actual phone number -- just the spoofed number Google assigned to you.

personalfinance,"Mortgage broker is pushing CRA loan with only one of us on the mortgage [PA, US]","Hi PF,

Long time lurker, first time poster.

Background: 
My husband and I are applying for a mortgage on a house that we are currently under contract with.  We are getting quotes for both 5% and 10% down, but 20% is not feasible without raiding my retirement accounts, so we can't avoid PMI.  We have a comfortable income and are buying well within our budget for monthly payments, we just fell in love with this house and aren't willing to wait for our savings to grow to 20% (when house prices and interest rates will continue to rise).  We are happy with our decision overall, but I'm a bit perplexed by this one bit...

We have one company who can offer 4.625% on 5% LTV, for which we can buy down to 4.5% and plan on buying out PMI up front. They seem trustworthy and reliable and I have complete confidence that they can get us to settlement on time with no problems.
 
We have another company who seems to keep pushing for us to go for a CRA (Community Reinvestment Act) loan.  Together we do not qualify, our household income is well over the LMI parameters.  However, she is suggesting we put the mortgage in only one of our names.  Since I have the better credit score (around 800) I would most likely be the lucky volunteer, but I'm not really comfortable with this.  If god forbid we get divorced I'd be on the hook for the whole thing, and if god forbid I get hit by a bus, my husband would have to refinance for himself.  Also, something stinks about jumping through hoops in order to qualify for a loan designed to support low income households in buying a home and achieving the American dream.  It just feels unethical, regardless of the financial benefits.

This mortgage person is offering a rate of 4.375%.  She has pulled up a quote for a regular conventional loan with our parameters (PMI buyout) but every time she sends us the quote we ask for she also sends the quote for the CRA loan.  She was recommended by a colleague who used her for his mortgage and is happy with her, so I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt.

The idea of saving ~$5k is tempting, though.  Is this a shady proposition, or am I needlessly paranoid?  We are going to set up an in-person meeting to get a feel for how we feel about working with her and to let her make her argument for why we should trust her to get us to settlement on time.  Any questions I should ask?

Thanks, PF, you're the best!",finance
personalfinance,"[Taxes] Screwed up account info for electronic withdrawal, Q1 estimated payment overdrew and got reversed, what to do?","I am an owner in a LLC and our taxes are done by an accountant who uses an online tool for us to submit our tax information. In this tool I opted for automatic electronic debit of my 2017 taxes due and 2018 quarterly estimates. Last year, for the 2016 taxes, I submitted a different account to withdraw the taxes due, but not the 2017 quarterly estimates, I paid them via check throughout the year.

I did not receive the copy of my taxes showing the information they submitted for the electronic withdrawals until after the first ones had already occurred. Because they used the wrong account, I did not have enough funds in it for both debits. The payment for the 2017 taxes due was processed successfully, but the payment for the Q1 2018 federal estimate was returned due to insufficient funds. When I called the IRS, they confirmed they received the payment for 2017, but they couldn't find any record of the attempt for the Q1 2018 estimate payment.

I'm not sure what to do here. I have reached out to my accountant to see if they can help, because it seems like at this point the IRS can't. I'm fine with eating a bit of a penalty if the payment is received late, I'd rather wait and resubmit after it's confirmed that the original payment failed and will not be retried, than try to submit payment again now and have them try to redo the original debit later and cause another overdraft.

Not sure if anyone else has dealt with a situation like this before, but any advice you guys have would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Used my car as collateral for a debt consolidation loan but want to refinance the loan. Suggestions?,"I'm 23 and live in the US. I had about $3,000 in credit card debt, $2,800 of which was on a high-interest card (about 22%). I got a loan from a local credit union to pay it off, but only got an interest rate of 15.69% due to my credit score (about 640 at the time). I used that money to pay off my credit cards and now my credit score has jumped up to 735.

I would really like to pay off that loan asap for a few reasons: one, because the interest rate sucks and two, because it really makes me nervous using my car as collateral. It's worth $8,000 (well over the cost of the loan) and was a gift from my dad when I graduated college. I didn't tell him about the loan because he doesn't know about the credit card debt - when I mentioned even having a credit card, he got super freaked out and said credit debt is the quickest way to ruin my life. I think it would just be a big dramatic thing if he knew and I would like to avoid having him find out. I'm worried that he'll somehow find out because he pays for the insurance on the car. I feel anxious and guilty using his gift as collateral even though legally the car is mine. But I thought about it for months before getting the loan and really feel like it was a smart decision financially - I was paying so much in interest on the cards that I was barely making a dent in my debt.

So, does anyone have any suggestions on how to go about refinancing this loan for a lower rate? I've thought about balance transfer cards with an 0% APR intro promotion, but I've done some research and know that not all balance transfer cards allow transfers from auto loans and even if they do, it's not uncommon practice for them to approve you with a stupidly low credit limit. If I were to refinance with another loan, I feel like I would want to go for a personal loan as opposed to an auto loan so my car wouldn't be used as collateral, but I don't know if my credit score is high enough to qualify me for an unsecured personal loan with a lower interest rate than my current loan. If I got a new auto loan, it would only solve my interest rate problem, not my anxiety about using my car as collateral, but maybe that is an option.

Anyone have any thoughts? Maybe it would be better to just stick with my current loan and just try to pay it off as quickly as possible? I used a loan amortization calculator and determined if I pay $200 a month, it would be paid off my November-ish 2019. Any advice is appreciated.

(Side note: my credit card debt was 100% frivolous spending that I didn't start tracking at all until about August of last year. I realized pretty quickly once I started budgeting after graduation that I am not to be trusted with credit cards. They've all since been shredded and I'm not incurring any more debt from them.)",finance
personalfinance,Should we refinance our second home now or in a few months? Tough call!,"My wife and I were recently married and have been renting out her home for the past few months.  I recently took a deep dive into the mortgage she has on it and have come the conclusion that we should probably refinance, but can't decide whether to do it now or in a few months.  Here's the situation:

#Current mortgage
She received the mortgage through the USDA farm program, which allows for $0 down, but it comes with a type of mortgage insurance which apparently you cannot discharge once you reach a suitable equity.  You essentially have to carry this mortgage insurance for the life of the loan, turning it into an additional interest cost.  

It was a 30 year mortgage at 3.875%, but with this mortgage insurance cost factored in, it's more like 4.6%.  The loan is 3.5 years old.

#Current refinancing options
From what I can tell online, we could get a 20 year loan at 4% interest with $0 fees.  This would increase our monthly payments by $140, but it would also increase the amount going towards principle by about $225 a month (and increasing over time!), as well as paying the home off 6.5 years earlier.  This seems like a fantastic deal to me.  We would still make more off rent than the mortgage, and we still have plenty of disposable income, so there is little risk of this causing financial hardship.

#Future refinancing options
Here's where it gets tricky.  We're currently carrying about 25k in credit card debt (all at 0%) due to paying for a wedding, honeymoon, and major renovations to our main home.  This debt has dropped my credit score to the 690s/700s and my wife's to the 720s.  We are on track to have this all paid off by October, at which point the credit simulators we run put us both well into the 800s.

So the question is this: Should we wait until we have our credit cards paid off to refinance the rental property?  Just how much benefit do we gain from a higher credit score?  Is there a point of diminishing returns where higher credit no longer gives as much help?  And if anyone wants to speculate on the interest rate expectations over the next few months, I'm interested.

Side question: Why aren't there 25 year mortgage loans in the US?  We'd love to find one of those at a good rate, as it would allow us to maintain the current payment amount while putting more towards equity.",finance
personalfinance,Can I lock in mortgage rates with two different lenders?,"Long story short, one bank had slightly better interest rates and points, so I locked in my rate. Rates are climbing, and it seems that they will be near 5% soon.

When I value it on KBB, I get a range of $12-$14k, and when I took it to a dealership once, they valued it at $11k (the oil pump was broken at the time, so that was the price after the estimated repairs they needed to make.)

The car is too unreliable and expensive for me. I owe about $16,500 and the interest rate is in the double digits. I pay $374 a month, and about half of that payment is going towards just the interest, so it's been slow going paying this thing down. It's also tough because I'm so underwater, no one is willing to buy the car from me, with the best offer I've gotten being nearly $3k under what I needed, and I think he wanted to make payments. So I can't really do a private sale, despite continually trying.

It doesn't help either that I lost one of my two jobs, and am working on getting another, should have one within a week. But anyways. I don't really have any more money to put towards the loan at this moment, as once I have another job, I want to work up a small savings before I start really attacking this loan. 

But my question is, do I have another way? Could I approach a bank, let them ""buy it"" and give me a loan to buy another car, minus the negative equity on this loan? I know I could go to a dealership and do this (once I have another job and can prove the income, so like a month from now), but I got fucked over so hard on the interest that I want to avoid in-house financing if I can. Plus, getting a bank loan would let me look at cars on Craigslist, opening up an entire avenue of cars that I couldn't get before. 

I know most people are going to want to tell me I'm an idiot, and I know I am. I know I'm probably wrong on several different things. I'm tired of getting judged harshly every time I ask about this garbage situation. I know I screwed up, and now I'm trying to fix it. I just want to know how I can get away from this car and pick up something small, efficient, and reliable - like I should have gotten in the first place. So can I approach a bank and do what I've suggested? Do I have any other options besides going to a dealership and trading it into something else and rolling the negative equity into another crappy loan? Thank you for your time.",finance

personalfinance,Clarification - auto loan rate shopping?,"Hey everyone,

I'm shopping for a ""new"" pre-owned car soon. I have an idea of what my budget should be ($17,000 OTD or less), but the final number / limit will be based on the best interest rate I will get from my approvals (1 bank, 2 CUs). Thanks to some advice from other Redditors I will apply for more than I need anyway though.

To ensure that I have all of my documentation in order and that I have enough time to handle surprises before I close the deal at the dealership, I will be seeking the first approval from my local credit union 30 days before my own ""deadline"" I've set for my purchase due to life circumstances. I'm also trying to space this stuff out so I'm not caught up in the excitement of purchasing my first financed vehicle, and end up making a hasty / bad decision as a result.

**Would someone be so kind as to clarify the ""rate shopping window"" in regards to hard inquiries on auto loans and credit scores?** Some places say 14 days, others say 30, others say both 30 and 45... It's somewhat confusing to me as a first-time buyer.

Example. I will be getting the three bank / CU inquiries all in the same week, on Wed-Fri April 25th-27th. I could be making the purchase as early as Wed May 9th, or as late as Thu May 24th. If I go to purchase on, say, that very last day, and I show the dealership my approval and they get me a better rate, would that count as 2 inquiries, since it has been longer than 14 days between my last local bank inquiry and the inquiry the dealer made? Or does everyone use the 30-day window now?

Mid-20s, one credit card and one student loan with no missed payments, 7-year credit history, 740+ TU FICO 8 for over a year, credit card always paid off every month. These auto loan inquiries will be the first hard inquiries I will have on my credit report since my credit report started, and I don't want to hinder my credit score if I, say, try to find an apartment in six months. I've already done the budget crunching, so I know that I can handle the payments. Unless I get some ridiculously wonderful interest rate, that $17,000 (out the door, of course) is the highest I'll go come purchase time.

Thanks so much!",finance
personalfinance,I really need some debt advice - please anything helps!,"Hi there - so I am really in need of some advice on how to even begin with a reducing-debt plan. Unfortunately, I've made some credit mistakes in my college years with taking out extra loans and credit cards (mainly because I had no other option.) I also had 1-2 years after college where I had to step in and help take care of my younger brothers financially and took out lines of credit then. In 2017 I was unemployed for about 4-5 months after being laid off and I let a lot of payments go. I was so carefree to finally have a break from working for the first time since I was 16 that I just decided I'll deal with it later. (I know, that was stupid. Please spare me the lecture because I'm already on the verge of a breakdown.) I've been working again but it seems like I'll never be able to catch up and some have gone to collection agencies. In the past I've tried to apply for a consolidation loan but was denied and am hesitant to apply again. 

I would deeply appreciate some guidance on where to begin. Are there any recommended finance advisers or is that not a good option? Debt relief programs or plans? Seriously, ANYTHING would help.

For reference: I'm 27 year old female, have paid my bills and rent since 18. Not that I'm blaming that, but I've never really had a chance to save so it's always been money in and money out for me. Currently make $50k/year (again as of a few months ago started this job.) My debt includes - fed and private student loans, amazon credit, paypal credit, 2 other credit cards, fingerhut credit in addition to my monthly rent, car payments/insurance, utilities, living. I would say my debt is about $40k/50k.

personalfinance,"Starting at a 4 year university this fall. Get school for free (grants), and loans were not apart of my financial aid award, but need extra money to live(?)","Hi guys! First time posting to PF. 
I know this is a bit long, but my question is should I take out (a minimal amount of) loans so that I can keep a healthy work and school balance, or does that seem completely unnecessary? Or what tips do you have for me after reading this?

I'm 26 and after restarting my life and working extremely hard I just got into my dream school! I started at community college and am finishing my second year next week.

Community college was completely covered by grants and scholarships. However, I took out $4,000 to help pay for a new car. I'm literally surprised every time I drive my current car that it doesn't just quit on life. Anyways, I'm currently 4,000 dollars in school loan debt. I haven't spent this money yet, as I have not found a new car.

I just got accepted into one of the top universities in the country. Because I'm older, make very little money, and am independent my education is completely covered by various grants and scholarships. The est. amount for tuition and fees is $8348.19. My grant and scholarship total is $14,448.19. My net estimated bill is -$6,100.00, meaning I get $6,100 in my pocket for various expenses (housing was included when estimating my aid, or so it says, and this where my concern primarily lies) when the term starts.

The town the university is in is OUTRAGEOUSLY priced to rent a room. For example, I was shown a room today that was probably 4X6, without a closet for $615.00 (this is pretty much worse case scenario, but still). 

I work about 25 hours a week at one job and get $250 per week.
I have a side online marketing gig that pays me about $55 every two weeks (pretty much no time commitment). I'm also starting to pick up a shift or two at the physical location of the job where I do online marketing (time commitment of about 12 hours), which will equate to an extra $300.00 every two weeks.
All in all about $850 per week.

I need time for my studies and probably will be making closer to $500-600 every two weeks when the semester starts.

My goal is to have all my bills be about $700 a month. (I know this comes nowhere near the percentage rules of how much one should spend on housing, but I don't see too many other options).
Because my financial grant packages were so extensive (I think), I don't qualify for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. I could go private loans, but am unsure if it's worth the interest rates.

Any insight on how I should go about my finances when at the university? I do know I have a cake walk compared to some- I get a world class education for practically free. Not to be smug about it, I'm just aware that I have a good thing going on. Should I take out a small loan each semester from a private loaner (say $2,000). Should I be okay? Am I over zealous in thinking I'll actually get $6,100 in my pocket every semester - are there many hidden fees I should be weary of? School is my priority in this scenario.
Thanks for your help, hopefully this made sense!",finance

Realistically; Do I need to be worried about my savings sitting in Ally considering it's almost 100 year old financial institution. 


**Update** Thank you all for the overwhelming response. I feel more assured about my decision to make Ally as my primary bank.  I had Chase saving as they gave *one time* 300$ for opening account and depositing 15,000$ within 30 days. Post that; I got almost nothing i.e. &lt; 10$ per year. I moved my money to Ally (22000) and at their interest rate; I would get more in the longer run every year.

personalfinance,Is this a proper way to handle my current car situation?,"Background:

Two years ago (Feb, 2016) I financed a 2012 Scion tC at around $13,700 ish for 72 months and 20.01% interest rate.
I have made 25 payments to date and still owe $10.2k on it. The car is in good shape and currently has 56k miles.

Due to my legal status (DACA recipient) I have not found a bank/lender who is willing to take the loan for a lower interest rate. I stopped by a credit union and learned my LTV value to be 133% (as of Feb '18) and I needed to bring it down to 125% for them to even consider the application. 

The options I think I have are the following:

1) Stick to it. Learn from the expensive mistake. Pay it off.

2) Trade it in and roll the negative equity into a lower interest auto loan. The reason why I even thought of this is due to the amount of interest I still owe on the loan, which is 5.1k, is much higher than my negative equity. Can someone elaborate on this, please?

3) Find a co-signer. I rather not bring someone else into my misery.

4)????

personalfinance,To consolidate or not to consolidate (student loans),"Hello! I was hoping someone could help me figure out if consolidation is a path I should take with my student loans.

Right now I have 8 federal student loans, ranging from $400 to $5,500, and interest rates from ~3.5% to ~6.8% (the larger loans were taken later, and have a higher interest rate than the smaller ones). I have an income of about $2,200/month, and am paying down two credit cards (slowly) and have monthly bills of about $1,100/month. I'm moving to another state and am having to travel to it every month for interviews and apartment searching.

Right after college I fell into a pretty deep depression, and along the way didn't make payments for about 8 months ... Which means I have 8 missed payments on each of 8 student loans. I've been in remission for some time now and have really turned around to get my personal and financial life together, and those missed payments are killing my credit report. I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with consolidating loans, and how that will affect your credit. Talking to someone at MyFedLoan yesterday, he said the loans would show up as ""paid"" and a new, large loan will appear. I don't know how this will affect my credit report, I just don't want it to sink any lower. If anyone has had any experience with this, it would be great to hear how it went for you.",finance

personalfinance,I am estimated to substantially overpay my tax liability: why is the IRS Withholding Calculator telling me to claim 0 allowances and an additional amount on the W4?,"For context, I lumped both of my jobs together and added the federal tax liabilities for them. The pay dates are staggered such that I am paid weekly. I am not sure this would affect the math on the estimation though.

The IRS withholding calculator gave me the following response: 
""Based on your responses, your anticipated income tax for 2018 is []. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $Y withheld for 2018 resulting in an overpayment of $X when you file your return. If you want your withholding to more closely match your anticipated tax of $Y-$X, change your current withholding arrangement by claiming 0 allowances plus an additional amount of $Z for the balance of 2018.""

If I am going to overpay, why the hell would I claim an additional amount of $Z, spread out over the remaining weeks over the year (estimated to be 35)? Wouldn't that be counterintuitive?

If I want to decrease my withholding, shouldn't I estimate a maximum number of allowances, each worth $4150 for 2018, such that a minimum amount is withheld from my paycheck?

personalfinance,Planning for my financial future (4th year medical student transitioning to residency),"Hi all, I want to start off by saying that this sub has been absolutely helpful to me as I plan my financial future. I'm currently in the middle of reading ""Millionaire Next Door"" and ""White Coat Investor"" and they have both changed my life in regards to really thinking about my spending habits, avoiding the temptation of lifestyle inflation, and building wealth for the future. I grew up in a lower middle class single parent home in which we lived paycheck to paycheck. My mom did her best to limit her spending, but with the income she was bringing in, it was difficult to save while at the same time paying off the mortgage, my primary and secondary education tuition bills, and other bills. The one thing that she did invest in was my education as I was able to go to private school from K-12 (with the help of financial aid of course) which provided me with the opportunity to go to a high profile university which had the type of endowment  and rich alumni to cover most of my educational expenses which limited the amount of  undergraduate loans that I needed. I ended up going to a state-sponsored medical school which gave me a bit of a scholarship allowing me to limit my graduate loans. Between my undergraduate and graduate school loans, I owe the federal government about $133,000. 

I plan to enter an income-based repayment plan after graduation and also take advantage of the PSLF program which would allow me to make 120 months of income based repayments and then having the rest forgiven/paid off by the federal government (although the balance that the government forgives will be taxed). Given what I want to do currently with my profession, I'll be in training for a good amount of those 120 months , being paid only a resident and fellow's salary and working for a non-profit organization. This plan makes the most sense to me as it really limits the amount I have to pay the government and I get to give back to society by working for a non-profit organization. 

Given that I have my debt repayment plan fleshed out, I wanted to figure out what I could do now to improve my financial future and built wealth. I'm planning to implement the 50/20/30 philosophy toward my biweekly paycheck and monthly budget. I also plan to take advantage of my residency program's hospital 403b program to start saving and investing in my retirement. I have a 6 month grace period before my loan repayment plan will kick in, so I was planning to shunt as much as possible toward my basic savings account until I build up enough cash to open and maintain a Money Market Account with a high annual rate of return. Eventually, I do want to open a Roth IRA account within the next year and try to get as close to the $5500 annual contribution. My plan would be use the IRA to invest in a low cost index fund that would allow the account to gain slow and steady earnings. My goal with the IRA isnt necessarily to save for retirement (as I'll already have a retirement plan with my employer sponsored 403b/401k), but to save my contributions and build up enough earnings to put toward a down payment for a house within the next 10-15 years (I'll be able to withdraw my contributions from the Roth IRA tax and penalty free at any point, and withdraw earnings at a very low penalty and tax rate if it goes toward buying a house). I'm currently single and have no dependents so this seems like the best plan for me as I anticipate starting and building a family within the next 10-15 year time frame. Does this seem like an alright plan so far? Does it make sense? Are there other ways for me to invest? Thanks for taking the time to read and respond back!",finance

personalfinance,"Save more money for eventual down payment on a home, or to pay off student loans first?","My husband and I are going to have the opportunity to stay with family later this year for about six months rent free. We will still be buying our own food (about $200 a month), and possibly contributing a small amount for utilities. But nothing like we've been paying in rent for this past year (one year married, 23 years old, no children). 

During the six months, my husband plans to work full-time, and I should be working full-time, or very close to it. We should walk away with something near $20,000 saved up. We have about $14,000 out in student loans, and about $1,500 of that is currently in our account unused, and we may not need it. By the end of the six months, I will be a full-time student still (or at least taking enough credits to stave off the beginning of the grace period) and my husband will be in the grace period still. So there will be no interest on that loan money. Once we got married we qualified for the Pell Grant, so our school is paid for now plus some, so we won't need to pull out loans again. 

Should we just rid ourselves of our student loans entirely, or mostly? We would save enough for an emergency fund, plus about 2-3 months of living expenses ideally. But the rest would go to student loans for us to get them down at least 75%. 

That would mean that we give up a large chunk of money that could more quickly become a down payment on a home. So we will be stuck renting for longer. But if we did decide to save more of it, that of course means that we give up the chance to get rid of all or most of our loans before they start to accrue interest, and pay more on them in the long-term.

personalfinance,Debt paydown in 8 months,"Just a heads up, this is long. The TLDR is I think I have a good plan to get a bunch of stuff paid off and save money by January but Id love some insight and advice. I originally wanted to give y’all specific numbers on everything but wasn’t sure that’d be appreciated. 


I'm looking for any suggestions to add into my plan to get debt free and welcome any advice in general. 

* I made the decision to get as debt free as possible because I get out of the military in January and realized that I don’t know how im going to pay for all of my debt and my wife's student loans as well (she will get a job, I just don't know how long it will take for both of us). I will be starting school in january so I will have some GI bill income (1400 a month in housing allowance but we will be staying with family until we find a place to live) and my wife should be transferring to a retail position in the area making about the same a month. Our potential “income” at that time will be around the same as I alone make now.  I decided that I couldn’t possibly pay off all of this by then, so I needed to figure out what I could get rid of. 

* The first thing I did was figure out how much debt i actually have vs. how much money i actually make. I make the same amount of money every 2 weeks, no exceptions. I make 1334 dollars every 2 weeks after taxes. My actual debt amount is high. It was sitting around 18 grand before this, and I’ve paid 1530 dollars off of these accounts since february. Because the balances have lowered I could pay less and be done by October, or keep it up or even increase it to be done sooner than July. 

* I added up my debts. I have several credit cards, a student loan, a personal loan, and a car loan. I have a few recurring payments that I have to make every month (insurance, hulu, groceries, and phone bill). Per month this adds up to 1830 dollars, if I pay my current payment plans and nothing changes on insurance, phone, stuff like that. 

EDIT: Rewrote this section. It didn't feel like it made sense. 
* I took all of my debts and found the ones that were reasonable to try and pay off in a relatively short amount of time. I can't afford the payments I would need to make to pay off the car and personal loan early so I chose to focus on the smaller debts and try to get rid of them so I could stop nickel and diming myself. Once paid off they will free up 604 dollars a month (as of what I paid on the 1st of April) 

* I put my taxes and some extra money I came across into my debts. This was around 600 dollars and I can now be paid off by the end of july if I increase my payments instead of lowering them because the balances are low. 

* I moved all of my daily expenses to cash. I keep all receipts and at the end of the day I write them down on an index card and staple the receipts to them and keep them in a box. Every week I balance it like a checkbook and make sure it matches up (it does, so far). Cash keeps me from doing something stupid because I can see the direct results of my spending. 

* As soon as I pay off my planned debt I’m going to save like crazy. Once I've paid this off I will throw all that money into savings. We have a months of expenses saved but had to spend some on an emergency last week, it took about a month away from us. I want to have 5 grand saved up by the time I get out in January. The financial advisor at my bank said that would mean a minimum of 415 a month if we started from scratch and they are suggesting I put it into a mutual fund because its 1.72% apy while the savings account I have with them is .01% at anything over 1k so I think that’s what Im going to do.

personalfinance,What is the quickest way for me to make enough money for a semester of college?,"Hello! I'm a 25 year old undergraduate student. I'm quickly approaching my Federal Student Loan aggregate limit. The remaining loan money I have is enough for about 1 more semester, but I have about 3 (maybe 2 with some finesse) semesters left to complete my degree. They're unfortunately upper-level courses that can't be completed at a community college. I don't qualify for private student loans, not only because I have no cosigner, but also because there were some fraudulent charges made in my name by a family member which have resulted in a few derogatory marks on my credit. (I've tried challenging the the marks, but it seems like there's nothing I can do without pressing charges for Grand Larceny, which I've chosen not to do). My plan is simply to take some time off from school, work a job of some kind (hopefully to be determined in this thread), and save approx. $15,000. I'd like to do this as quickly as possible, within a year being my best case scenario. I have a family member I can live with for nominal rent, at least initially.

I have two years of administrative experience working at a Title &amp; Escrow firm. I have about 11 years of food service experience (family business since age 14). I also freelance doing music composition for films, and have a broad understanding of audio equipment, studio recording, music composition, etc. but this usually pays very little.

What sort of job should I be looking for? Do my random assortment of skills/experience qualify me for anything lucrative that I might not be aware of? Is my one year/$15k timeline reasonable? Is there an alternative loan option that might let me simply continue school without a break?

personalfinance,Car purchasing update and advice,"I have made a decision on the offer and car I want. I'm getting a Prius c for $3500 off Msrp with 0% interest rate.

This process was very stressful for me. I'm not confrontational, don't like businesses and how my info is shared, don't like pushy salesman, have current car issues, and general money concern. Big purchases scare me.

At some point I realized it's not that bad. I chose the car I wanted after looking In person. I called up every dealership in the state and asked for a quote. I tried getting email quotes. Don't do this. The process was very slow through email with several internet employees just trying to get info from you and not listening to what you are actually asking. When you talk to them in person they can get a much better idea of where you are actually at.

When you call in person let them know you are several hours away and are calling every dealer you can for quotes. Ask for a certain price. I finally told one it would take $2500 off with 0% interest and they hit the number. After that I started mentioning what my best quote is. I had one beat it by 200 than another beat that by 200. I was nervous to ask for a better deal from the first good quote as I already told them what it would take. Well I bucked up and just asked him to match my best offer as he was the first one to give me a good offer and is a tad closer. He came back with 600 less than my best quote and 1000 less than I told him what it would take initially. 

When they go to their managers for the deals and have to call back ask for a text and say you won't be able to talk. You will have something on paper if another dealership wants proof of an offer. It never was an issue for me but it could help. My first car buying had this happen. I found it insulting personally and went with the company that didn't require it but if they had offered to beat the offer by a chunk and not just match it with proof it I would of went with them probably.

I was told to wait until the end if the month but I got this deal which I consider good on the 19/20th

Good luck to everyone looking for a new car and please take this into consideration. I find the middle men obnoxious and wish we could buy straight from the factory. Car buying shouldn't be difficult with many different prices people can get.

Edit- LOL. Looks like a couple car salesman want to downvote me.",finance
personalfinance,How to invest our fun fund,"As a little background, my wife and I both work and we do fairly well. We have a home, no debts besides our mortgage and we have a reasonable security fund. We earn enough to cover all of our essential expenses, invest 20% into retirement accounts (including maxing out our 401ks) and then have extra to set aside into what we call our “fun fund”. 

The fun fund is money that we don’t have a specific plan for, but will likely use within the next 3 – 5 years for things like a vacations, a home extension or a vacation house. We do not specifically need any of those things, but we may choose to splurge down the road. 

My question for the group is how to best invest the money in our fun fund. My personal feeling is that CD’s pay such a low interest rate that it doesn’t make sense to lock up the money in them. On the flip side I don’t want the funds subject to full volatility of the stock market since our time line is relatively short. I am looking for something in the middle. Ideally I want an investment that beats inflation in the long run, but wouldn’t expose me to annual losses of more than the 5-10%. I am considering things like corporate bonds and or high dividend equities in stable industries, but I am open to any and all suggestions. 

I am not looking to stock pick or actively manage my investments. I lean towards ETF index funds or passively managed mutual funds in my retirement accounts.

personalfinance,Previous Employer Terminating 401k - Looking for advice on my thoughts of what to do with the money.,"I have $12,000 in a 401k from a previous employer I worked for about 5 years ago. I never rolled the money over when I left the company. I was informed they are closing the 401k and I need to make a decision to of what to do with the money.

I know conventional wisdom says to roll it over in some type of investment account. However, I wasn't sure if it would be better for me to take that money now with what I'm currently looking to do.

I have some housework I have to do (new roof) and have a slight less need to do (fence in backyard on one side is practically nonexistent). 

My wife and I have been looking into taking a personal loan to do this work. The roof will be around $12,000 and the fence would be around $5,000. Unfortunately this is something we just started thinking of so I don't have any quotes on interest rates.

I was wondering if it would make more sense to take any penalties I may receive on the $12000 instead of taking out a $10,000 - $15,000 loan to do housework. If I do use the 401k, I may be able to cover the difference with a new credit card that has introductory no interest payments if paid within 18-24 months.

My only debt is my mortgage and car lease. I have no credit card debt. I'm 30 years old in California. I do currently have a 401k with my current company around 16k.",finance
personalfinance,Interstate taxation while working remotely?,"So I have an interesting question that I'm not sure of the answer to, and I'm not sure who I would talk to outside of reddit to get a definitive answer and perhaps assistance.

I realized after filing my 2017 taxes that I'm not sure if MD nonresident taxation applies as I do not physically work in the state of MD, that's just where my company is headquartered. Since WA has no income tax, am I due a very large refund from MD, or are the taxes I'm paying to MD legitimate?

He owes $560 in federal taxes for 2017 (set up payment plan - $60/month) as well as 2017 + 2 years worth of back state taxes (just filed Voluntary Disclosure and Compliance Form). We don't know what his state tax burden will be yet but anticipate at least ~$2K (??).  

He has 3 credit cards w/ combined balance of ~$9K and 24% APR. He has stopped using them and has been diligently paying the minimum balances + a little extra as he's able.  

We wanted to consolidate his CC debt through a 0% intro-period APR balance transfer CC but he was denied Chase Slate and Bank of Americards due to low credit score.  

Qs:  
-Are there any other CC 0% APR options he can take advantage of?  
-Is it even worth attempting a CC reconsideration phone call w/ the CCs?  
-Should he take out a loan w/ lower APR rate and pay off the CCs altogether?  
-Assuming he needs to prioritize all tax debt first, OR can he stick to tax payment plans which have much lower interest/penalties and focus on paying down high-interest CCs first?  
-Other options I'm not thinking of?

personalfinance,Where to park money that is needed for medium-term?,"Basics: 28 years old, 3 years left in residency training. Married, expecting a baby in a few months. I make about $60,000. My wife currently makes about $100,000 but will be staying home with the baby indefinitely once it is born. She has been earning for a lot longer than me which is why we have a good amount of savings right now. No student loan or other debt.

I have $200K sitting in a bank account not doing very much (collecting a very small interest rate) and I have put off figuring out how to invest or otherwise manage this money for years as I am in the middle of a busy residency program.

Once my wife starts staying home, we will be dipping into our savings to pay living expenses/rent for the three years that I still have left in residency (my take-home is around 4K which is almost the same as our rent in a very expensive city, so we will need the savings to help pay the roughly $2700/month in other living/baby expenses). This comes to a deficit of about ~2,700/month or about 32,000/year for three years (total just under $100K), approximately half of our $200,000 savings.

I think it is pretty obvious that I should use the half of the $200,000 that we won't need in the near future to first max out our retirement accounts and then invest in a taxable account (I will be using the Fidelity target retirement date index mutual fund).

**My question is this:** How can I allocate the ~$100,000 that we will definitely need over the next three years in a safe way that might maximize interest? Is the savings account the best way to go? Or should I buy short-term bonds with some of the money ($32000 for 1 year bonds and $32000 for 2 year bonds, so the funds are available at the start of the year that we will need them)? My risk tolerance for this money is low because my wife does not want to work when we have an infant.

**TL;DR:** What is the best way to allocate roughly $100,000, all of which I will definitely need in the medium term (3 years), but most of which I won't need for 1-2 years?",finance

1- i had been getting nickled and dimed with repair cost
2-insurance was crazy for me (22 yr old m at the time)
3-was paying high interest (really wanted the car should have walked away)
4-where im at in life right now having a truck is almost a neccesity

The advice im looking for is what to do now. my insurance is lower with the truck, the loan amount on the truck is less than the subaru, but im still paying close to 500 a month combined insurance/ monthly payment. i had a late start to building my credit and both parents dont have great credit so my interest rate right now is 9% with a cosigner.

Ive finally got an emergency fund setup, and today i get hit with a check engine light that could set me back $1000 dollars (hopefully not but wont know until monday).

personalfinance,"60k Student Loan debt, 30k CC debt, credit score &lt;600, what are my options?","Hey PF, I've searched through the archives for advice regarding my situation but didn't find what I was looking for. So, my story is that I went back to school a few years ago to get my RN license and took out about 60k in private/public loans. During school, I had some medical and automotive catastrophe's that brought me up to around 30k in CC debt. I now have a job making ~3.5k per ~~week~~ month (after taxes), and am living with my folks to save money. I've been putting as much as I can towards payments on the CCs, and have spoken with the banks regarding hardship programs - however I haven't qualified for any of them. I've also spoken with a few third party CC debt managers, but am apprehensive about using them considering they charge for their services. 

The student loans aren't as concerning considering the interest rates are much lower than the CCs (~7% compared with ~16% respectively) and I'll be working for nonprofits for at least 10 years, meaning my federal loans will be forgiven after 120 payments. I try to pay more than the minimums on my private loans, but I'm not as consistent as I'd like to be. 

My strategy is to pay off the CCs as fast as possible, while paying the minimum on the federal loans, and adding what I can to the minimum payments to the private school loans. I was considering taking a personal loan to pay off the CCs, and drop my average interest rate a bit, but my score plummeted about a year ago - seemingly out of the blue - making this a challenge.

My entire adult life I've had stellar credit (700+), which changed when I started school. The only thing that's changed is I've accumulated a substantial amount of debt. I don't miss payments, and have only had a few late payments (never more than 2 weeks). I'm upset that my score dropped so much so fast, and I'm not sure what else could be contributing.

Are any of you folks aware of programs that would benefit my situation? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks PF!

financialindependence,I [27 M] Need Help,"I'm hoping you guys/gals might be able to offer some insight on my situation. I'm in a pretty decent spot, but I feel like I'm missing something and screwing up on my finances. I want out of the work force ASAP and I'm familiar with all the general principles of FI/MMM/etc. I have a harder time implementing them, though.

**Career**

I have a Ph.D. and I do quantitative/statistical modeling/programming for a bank. I work and live in Charlotte, NC and make $120,000/yr base \+ $20,000 bonus on average. My job is in the center of downtown. My wife has a job opportunity that we expect will pay between $40k\-$50k, but her ability to take it depends on us finding a decent daycare option for our newborn son \(see below\). My after tax/insurance take\-home pay is roughly $3,500 every two weeks. 

**Insurance**

We have a United Healthcare High Deductible healthcare plan which has really boned us this year because of the baby's birth. Lots of medical bills have been flowing in and it has hurt. They took about $200 bi\-weekly before baby and now that we have added him, it's going up to $300 bi\-weekly. Because of this, switching to a lower deductible plan seems crazy because I know it be even more out of my paycheck. 

**Housing**

We pay $1,595/mo to rent a 2 BR condo in the 4th Ward neighborhood, which is a part of downtown \(uptown\) Charlotte. My commute to work is a 5 minute walk, which I love. We are willing to move out a bit, but I dread the idea of adding a 1\-1.5 hour daily commute on top of my already 9 hour day. The cost savings seem hit or miss anyway, as many of the nice suburbs are no cheaper than our current neighborhood. 

**Debt**

I owe $106,000 \(6.8&amp;#37;\) for federal student loans and my wife owes $25,000 \(3.5&amp;#37;\) in the same. We have paid off about $10k of this in the past nine months. We also owe $14,500 on our car, which is a 2013 sedan and in great shape. We have no credit card debt. 

**Assets**

We have $11,000 in an emergency fund. It's down from $15,000, as we used $4,000 to pay for our son's birth. That's about it for the assets. Aside from the emergency fund which we try to keep at $15k, we are dumping **all** of our extra money into our student loans. I have a hard time justifying investments or home purchases with this looming debt. We could probably have a lot more saved right now, but paying down debt seems like a guaranteed huge return, so that's been our strategy thus far. My company doesn't match 401k until I've been there for one year, so I decided to wait until then to start using it and dump that money into student loans instead. 

**Day Care**

So far, we can't find a day care for our son. They're all booked and on wait lists, some as long as 15\-18 months. My wife has a great job offer looming, but she won't be able to take it if we can't find a good daycare for our son. If she can take the job, it will increase our annual income by probably $40\-$50k, which would be huge. 

**Numbers**

*Monthly Income After Tax***: $7,000**

*Rent:* **\-$1,495**

*Phones:* **\-$180**

*Car Insurance:* **\-$50**

*Car Payment:* **\-$359**

*Student Loan \(min\):* **\-$1,000** \(usually more\)

*Electric:* **\-$80**

*Internet:* **\-$50**

*Gas:* **\-$12**

*Groceries:* ***\-$400***

*DayCare Estimate:* ***$1,000***

*Other:* ***$300*** *\(eating out, rock climbing gym, etc.\)* 

So this leaves me with an estimated $2,074, which lately due to the baby's birth has been mostly dumped into medical bills. Before baby it was mostly all going to student loans. I think they will stop soon. This feels like a glacial pace given how much money I make. My wife's job will obviously improve things substantially. Does anything stand out as foolish or do you notice any obvious room for improvement? Thanks.",finance
btc,CheapAir: A Letter to its Customers,"A Letter to Our Bitcoin Customers
Dear Traveler,
Since 2013, CheapAir.com has been accepting Bitcoin as a payment option for flight and hotel bookings and we hope to continue to do so well into the future. During this time, it has been a thrill to meet so many extremely smart, incredibly passionate members of the Bitcoin community and we appreciate to no end the support and loyalty that the group has shown us.

However, today we face some challenges and we’re asking for your help in finding solutions. We were recently informed by our processing partner, Coinbase, that they will no longer support “custodial” solutions for merchants, and are removing a number of the tools and features that we rely on to accept Bitcoin from CheapAir.com shoppers. These changes are scheduled to occur in a matter of weeks.

Rather than dwell on this, we are taking this as an opportunity to deliver to you an even better solution with even more digital payment options. In the coming weeks, we hope to:

Begin accepting additional digital currencies like Bitcoin Cash, Dash, and Litecoin. We have already begun testing these.
Establish a dedicated customer service phone line and email inbox staffed with advisors who have a deeper understanding of digital currencies and how they work. Admittedly, that’s been a challenge with our call center team (my fault, not theirs) and I know this has led to some frustration.
Automate some processes that have been semi-manual, so we can issue refunds more quickly, or generate/re-generate a BTC invoice for a booking made over the phone or by email.
To go where we want, however, we need a reliable processing partner. The reality is, as much as we love Bitcoin, our travel supplier partners (airlines and hotels) just aren’t there yet. Because we have to immediately transfer to them most of what you pay to us, we have no choice but to convert BTC to fiat as payments come in. Coinbase has been providing that service for us, but at the end of the month they are getting out of that business, leaving us scrambling for an alternative.

Our intention at this point is to use BitPay as a processor. We have had a great experience with them so far and our integration is largely complete. But our one giant concern is that Bitpay does not support “non-payment protocol wallets” (wallets that aren’t BIP-70 compliant). So if you do not have a compatible wallet, you would have to get one and use it as an intermediate stage for your Bitcoin payment.

We understand what Bitpay is trying to accomplish. The issues they are trying to address–delayed or incorrect payments–are real and were especially rampant back in December and January when transaction volumes spiked. On the other hand, I am not keen on the idea of asking our customers to, in many cases, do more work or change wallets just to be able to transact with us.

This is where we’d love your input. Do you buy from other Bitpay merchants? Do you find the BIP-70 wallet requirement to be reasonable or too onerous? Candidly, would this make you more or less likely to do business with us?

Please feel free to reach out with thoughts or suggestions by commenting on our blog, tweeting @CheapAir, or emailing me directly at jeff@CheapAir.com.

Thank you again for your continued support,

personalfinance,Switching lenders in the middle of buying a home,"My wife and I are in the process of buying a home. The due diligence period ends on May 1 with a closing date of June 1. We’re using my VA Loan and are using USAA as our lender. USAA had an advertised rate of 4.275% on a 30 year fixed mortgage and then because of certain circumstances (longer closing period, and the loan officer saying that 4.275 was a “historic low”) we were assigned a rate and  I locked in with a 4.625% interest rate. The rate is ok, but it could have been better, especially with my credit score of 796 and my wife is rocking an 840. 

I came across a post in r/mortgage with another veteran stating that Navy Federal Credit Union had given him a 4.25% on a 30 year fixed. So I checked their advertised rates out and they are offering a [3.75% interest rate on a 30 year fixed if you meet their creditworthiness](https://www.navyfederal.org/products-services/loans/mortgage/va-loans.php#). Also, Navy Federal doesn’t sell their mortgages off to a larger bank. 

With this new information, should I at least check out Navy Federal and is it too late to switch lenders with being in the middle of the buying process? Our loan paperwork is still with the processor at USAA and hasn’t gone to the underwriter yet.

TLDR: Mortgage paperwork hasn’t gone to underwriting, still in due diligence period, don’t close until June 1, is it still early enough to switch mortgage lenders for a better rate?",finance

Forex,A letter to all newbs,"I've been trading for over a year now. Busted 4 accounts. Started my journey from imarketslive. Left immediately after. I've taken both academic micro and macroeconomic classes.

And I just found out that you can get past reports from the central intelligence agency. Every February and July the federal reserve make census reports.

If you have been trading for 3 months and think you've mastered the market sit down. I'm never going to learn enough and I know for a fact I had no idea what a fundamental lot size was in my first 3 months.

""It's just the size of your position. Bigger the lot size the more money you make. I have no idea why they use them but I'm suppose to plug it into my calculator"" -literally me right before I blew my 2nd account.

It takes time. It takes effort. It'll be the most psychologically mind melting experience watching 6 months worth of rent slip from your hands each month. The feeling that finally figured it out and that you should give it one more try happens over and over again. Even federal reserve's have had to reevaluate themselves every time there's a depression or recession. We still don't understand the markets 100%.

If someone offers you a ""secret"" or ""the stuff banks don't want you to see"" trust me the federal reserve would love to pay 1000x more than you will ever make in your life to learn that secret.

It's a scam.

Edit: good info for all traders who are still learning about fundamentals. The institutional traders are the house and there playing the game the central bank's designed.

Learn to play the rules. Don't miss opportunity. And don't ever bet against the house.

If you follow these rules you can make unlimited amount of income. George Soros used opportunity and leverage to crash Bank of England. Knowledge is power.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Satoshi Nakamoto really might be Ilya Zhitomirskiy Founder of Diaspora,"Bear with me, because I truely believe I am onto something, and it wouldnt surprise me if his name was mentioned before.   I'm only a 14 months new to crypto currency so I wasn't around all these other years when people talked about it, and came up with ideas,

Keep in mind, Diaspora was revolutionary. I even if one of these guys weren't satoshi, Diaspora might have been the creation if not one one of creations that sprung blockchain into what it is today. 

First I must explain what Diaspora was/is.  

##They were the first fully decentralized social network##

Copied from my other post...

They were everything crypto currencies were without using crypto. They had Dapps built off their protocol such as ""The Federation"". Diaspora was complete , and released 3 years before the ethereum crowdsale. A full version was released in 2010.

They were the first decentralized social network run off PODS(Nodes). Best part? They only needed $200,000 from kickstarter. Not billions like some overhyped cryptos need and don't even have a working product, but that's a conversation for another time.

Anyway,

**what happened to diaspora?**

The co-founder Ilya Zhitomirskiy died suddenly of suicide at age 22. Theories were ""Pressures related to Diaspora"". Conspiracies say although Mark Zuckerberg donated to their kickstarter, he was responsible for llya's death because Diaspora was a threat to take down Facebook. Something about the donation being a decoy to steer attention away. Again, that's a conversation for another time.

Long story short they find it odd someone who was so motivated with the world of opportunity at his feet would just fold under pressure enough to commit suicide after most of the work was done.

##""Our distributed design means no big corporation will ever control Diaspora. Diaspora will never sell your social life to advertisers, and you won’t have to conform to someone’s arbitrary rules or look over your shoulder before you speak""##

Diaspora is still being used today. Said to have about a million users , and about 5000 total PODS(Nodes) registered with some inactive.

There were a few ways you can join. Open signups by joining in on someone's pod if they left signups open. Running your own pod that dealt specifically with just your profile, or hosting other users at a central location.

Right now it seems to be an underground dedicated community just like open IRC was.

As much as some people don't like to believe ""stories"" , you have to give credit where credit is due because we all have Diaspora to thank for laying down the ground work for all the crypto platforms we have today. Including Ethereum.

BitCoin opened the door for using crypto currencies, Diaspora proved BitCoin right.

**Diaspora: An open source decentralized P2P protocol for social networking.**

**Founders**: Ilya Zhitomirskiy, Dan Grippi, Max Salzberg, and Raphael Sofaer

**Taken from Wiki**

*""The word diaspora is Greek in origin and refers to a scattered or dispersed population.""*

DiasporaFoundation.org

Back to who satoshi is. 

So this guy 

Ilya Zhitomirskiy died in November 2011.  Apparently from too much pressure over Diaspora he killed himself, right.    6 months earlier in April,  it was claimed *""Satoshi is never coming back""*.       

If you look deeper into what lead up to his suicide , you will find it was around about a year prior in 2010 he started getting worried, and paranoid he was going to be killed.  He told his peers he felt someone was following him around, and he started coming up with off the wall conspiracies, and the project is too much for him.  Apparently he was talked into taking a break a few months before he died.(around,the same time official Satoshi was said to have his last words.   

He wanted to quit but was talked out of it, It wasn't until after he kiled himself (or so the reports say)  that his peers started believing his rants. It was thought Facebook CEO Mark Z sent out a strategic hit on him because Decentralized Diaspora was a threat to take over Facebook.  



So get this.  

** In order to be Satoshi , you would obviously have to understand how blockchain works, and how to code it.**

He knew how for sure.  His Diaspora speaks for itself. 

**A lot of people think Satoshi was russian including the NSA**

He's Russian.

Satoshi started to Disappear around the same time Zhitomirskiy went cuckoo before apparently killing himself .   diaspora is still running today because its decentralized, and BitCoin is still running today because it's decentralized.   

This makes total sense to me. 

If not him, then someone close to him.

Then I moved overseas and had other immediate debts to deal with.  Due to that I am now deliquent with my loans and it's severely affecting my already bad credit score.

personalfinance,Student loan balance (interest included) not responding to payments as expected,"Hi PF

I have a (US) federal unsubsidized  student loan managed through fedloan from my first year of graduate school.  I was nervous about supporting myself and my gf on what was a very meager stipend.

After that first year I transferred to a better program, with a better stipend, and never felt compelled to take out any more loans.  

The principle on my one loan was 8 grand.  They started charging interest while I was still in school, which I'm pretty sure is not kosher, but I'm not 100% sure because I transferred from one university to another (better) university.

Anyhow, I'd basically accepted that it was what it was.  I finished grad school a few years ago, and have been making payments on the loan every month, usually around 100 bucks.  

Today I had a look at my payment history, and noticed that following a payment of $100, my balance (interest included) would only drop by about $64.  

[Here is a cropped picture of my payment history](https://i.imgur.com/sCLrwEb.png)

Is this normal?  I haven't seen anything about them charging 40% fee on my payments.  My interest rate is just about 4%.  

I know I should just pay it off in big lumps until it's gone, but I decided to take this first year and save for a car, because my current car isn't especially reliable, and is far from practical.  This July I'm buying the car (cash), and I'll start making big payments... but I'd be pissed if they only put 60% of those big payments towards my debt.

Any advice welcome. 


EDIT: What occurred to me right after I posted is that they first apply your payment towards any interest accrued since your last payment.  So I guess I'm pulling down $36/month interest... that sucks.  Is there anything I can do about them charging interest while I was still in the phd program?",finance
personalfinance,Nelnet removed interest that was capitalized in error?,"I received an email from Nelnet yesterday that has left me confused but hesitantly happy? Here’s the text of the email: 

“As your federal student loan servicer, it’s our responsibility to ensure your student loan details are accurate in our system. In a recent review of your account, we found that unpaid, accrued interest was added to your outstanding principal balance (this is called capitalization) in error.

To correct this, we removed the capitalized interest and adjusted the outstanding principal balance, accrued interest, and current balance on your affected loans. Please note, the amount of interest paid reported on your 2018 IRS Form 1098-E may be impacted by this adjustment.”

When I compared my record of last month’s student loans balance to the ones they included in the email, it has gone down by about $1600. I’ve never heard of a financial institution correcting an error in the borrower’s favor, especially since I hadn’t noticed it and didn’t request the correction. Is this legit? Also do I need to amend my taxes? I paid less than $1k to my student loans last year, and all of it went directly to the interest. 

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,"Newlywed Primary Care Doctors, graduating residency. ~500k yearly income, ~1M student loans","Hey all figured i'd ask for opinions and advice going forward with our careers. My wife and I will be starting work this fall and are looking at about $450-500k salary combined working 40 hour weeks. Our student loans are at $930k combined, all federal 6% interest, and all with 3 out of 10 years of PSLF qualified payments. We have some big decisions to make in the coming 3 months which will obviously affect us for the rest of lives.

The first option is to continue working for non-profits and put 10% of our income toward the loans for 7 more years. I think that comes out to about 2.5k a month for each of us, which will pretty much only cover interest essentially freezing our loans at the level where they are now and wait to see if the federal government will do their part (I'm not too ecstatic about it). With this plan we can afford to save for retirement now and hopefully mortgage a starter condo whose equity we can use to purchase a nicer home once the loans are taken care of. This is obviously the most attractive to us right now but relies too much on loan forgiveness.

The second option I see is refinancing into private student loans at about 3.5-4% and pay it off in either 5 or 7 years (about 8.5k or 6.5k$ per month for each of us respectively). This doesn't leave anything for savings, we will have to rent an apartment, and we'll be living at or below our current level of resident salaries. We can work 60hrs a week, and increase our income that way to help start saving and not have to resort to eating top ramen as professionals in our 30s. 

I'm wondering if there is a middle ground between these two, as in perhaps setting aside 8.5k a month each, using 2.5k of that to pay our PSLF for 7 years, and using the remaining 6k a month into some sort of savings/retirement account that can appreciate a bit and that we can pull out full force to pay the loans in a lump sum in the event PSLF is abolished. We would love to hear opinions or any new ideas you may have. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Complications during filing of taxes (because of crypto) and advice on how to overcome them,"Did anyone else run into a similar issue? I used a service Bitcoin Tax (http://bitcoin.tax), which was extremely helpful. I entered all the opening lots, all the trading activity, etc, and the tool, after a few hours of processing, produced results. I then chose a relief method that best suited my situation (LIFO), and exported the data out as a 2017.txf file and also as 8949 PDF file.

The problem occurred when I tried to import the 2017.txf file into TurboTax Home &amp; Business 2017 edition. This is the most expensive version of the tax preparation software that I purchased to help with 2017 tax year.

The error that I got was:

We notice you have more than 3,000 financial transactions to import. TurboTax wasn‘t designed to handle this many transactions. We apologize! Please contact us to request a refund (go to www.turbotax.com and select Support).

This happened because I had over 13,000+ trades. I am now at a loss as to what to do. Because of the timing, I have decided to file for an extension. I had sent my estimated tax amt to both FED and STATE, which was also problematic, since both had issues on Tuesday, but I finally managed to do it late Tuesday night...

The question is, what am I supposed to do now? Some of the material I see online says you are supposed to e-file your tax and then print out and send the 8949 PDF in paper form to the IRS within 3 business days. For me, this means roughly 1,650 pages of (little) trades. Is this the only thing that I can do? Somewhere else, I read that all I need to do is simply to summarize the trades into categories (Short term gain, Long term gain, etc).

I am a graduate student in the U.S., who receives student loans (at full amount) for living expenses. My tuition and fees are paid for by school. This semester, I made some really dumb spending decisions that essentially evaporated my student loan money and left me spending 6,000 on my CC (which has a limit of 7800, APR 17.15%). 

My next loans come at the end of June (14k). I spend 800/mo on rent and will not be able to stay under that 7800 limit until then, and I do not want to ask parents for help (I insist on this point). I'm going into a fairly well-compensated field and am happy to take out more loans..well not happy, but I would much rather add loans to my longterm pay-off (right now my loans are around 90k total, deferred until graduation, w/ expected loans of 150k before graduating). I know that I can't ask for private student loans since I have used all of my maxed federal student loans. So, my only options appear to be private loans or a new cc and transfer the balance at a lower interest rate. I do not have an income, and would prefer not to ask my parents to be cosigners, as I'd rather not disclose my stupidity this semester, as it will not happen again. Please don't scold me for my dumbness, but I feel a little trapped.

Ideally, I'd like to take out a personal loan to pay off my cc and will be able to budget myself come July and make monthly payments on that loan. I could afford 100-150/ month of payments given my rent is fair and the total cost of attendance is overly generous. I don't know of any companies that would give personal loans without an income, unless I can report my federal loan as income (which I wouldn't feel bad doing since i can totally afford to payoff a personal loan since my federal loans are all deferred until I have a salary). I appreciate your help!

I aim to pay off my debt with around $750 of what's left. The remaining $400 is for myself as a treat.

I don't want to fall for lifestyle creep but I believe I deserve a slight lifestyle upgrade.

Any and all suggestions to make things better are welcome. I am certain there are things I am missing and could improve upon. 
Advice on how to tackle the debt or manage my retirement contributions 
to get the most benefit would also be beneficial. 

**TLDR:** Getting a F/T job (60k) in Fall and looking for advice on my financial plan. Goal is to eliminate debt and save enough for retirement. How should I allocate my remaining income? 
Perhaps, I should max more retirement accounts and just pay minimums on debt depending on interest rates?

financialindependence,Consulting FI: Am I ready to FIRE?,"Hey FI, throw away account here.

I think my wife and I are ready to FIRE, but things seem a bit more complicated for us. I wanted to lay out my situation here to see if you all see any blind spots. We sold our company about 6 years ago and went into the public sector. It's been far less rewarding than either of us thought, and we work for less money. We know we've been incredibly fortunate and lucky. We've only recently talked about FIRE so we're okay to keep working, although it's been a draining few years. We're in a HCOL area and want to stay here. We bought our current home two years ago for $850k and have $330k in equity, 30 year mortgage is $35k/year. We have $1.1MM invested in stocks. Our expenses are being tracked in YNAB and, without the mortgage, are $32k/year.


This obviously doesn't add up for a good FIRE SWR. But five years ago, we also purchased my mother a property that's now worth $2.1MM, we currently have $1.6MM in equity there with a 30 year mortgage at 3.75% interest, $60k/year payment. It might not have been the best move. It was based on different priorities at the time and no concept of early retirement, but it also has been a good return on investment so far. My mom worked really hard all of her life and we're happy to have done this for her. She knows that she won't live there forever, and it's not a great age-in-place property anyway. But she does like living there for the time being and we want to give her another 10 years there. The plan is to downsize her to a place that costs about $1MM when she moves after that.


Based on those figures, our current net worth is 3MM. The plan is to retire and spend down the invested money until we downsize my mom, pay off the mortgages, and reinvest the remainder. If our current net worth stays the same, that should give us about $1.1MM to reinvest and have a solid SWR on. The only way that happens is if the market outperforms our mortgage interest rate of 3.75%.


Does this look correct? We have retirement accounts and we plan to have side income streams in ""retirement"" but I want to know that even without those things, the numbers work out.

personalfinance,"Debt has really started spiraling and my income is minimal, what are my options?","Hi folks, last month I got myself into some legal issues and will probably be going to prison once everything is said and done. After my arrest, my mental health went down the tube and I was hospitalized for a few weeks. I am a disabled veteran so I receive a little bit of disability money every month and I also have a rental duplex that brings in a little cash flow too, once the mortgage and water/sewer bills are paid. Needless to say, my debts have gotten out of control and my income is not very much. Since my arrest and hospitalization, I have lost my apartment and I am back in with my folks unfortunately. I was able to get over to my old apartment today to catch up with all my old mail/bills and I found that I owe the VA $2500 and my old school about $2000 (on top of tons of other debt of course) since I dropped out a few months ago due to depression and drug addiction. Things are quite rough and I don't really know how to get out of this hole. I can max out my credit card to pay some of these debts but the credit card has a high interest rate, so I feel like I will be getting nowhere making payments on that.

personalfinance,Are there any reasons to not refinance my federal loans?,"Hi! I'm 24, recently graduated, and working as a physical therapist with a major (nonprofit) hospital system. My starting salary is 78k whereas my total debt is 105k, with 61K of that being private loans and 44k being federal debt.  I'm basically continuing to live like a grad student (simple living, multiple roommates) and putting the majority of my take-home pay towards my loans which is $2,500 a month. My current track is I'll be able to pay everything off in a little under four years. 

Basically, I'm wondering what the pros and cons are of refinancing my federal loans. I have great credit (730s) and was surprised when I was able to refinance my private loans this month from ~7.3% to 4.88%. I wasn't even planning on refinancing my federal loans but now that my private loans have lower interest rates than the 5.060% and 5.590% of my two federal ones, I'm considering it. If I don't refinance my federal loans, should I then prepay my federal loans first as opposed to my private loans? Where does student loan forgiveness come into this?  I'm working for a non-profit hospital now but I'm not sure if I want to work in inpatient PT for the next 10 years anyway...plus I was hoping to be debt free come 2022 so I can start thinking about buying a property.

economy,"This video ""What Really Separates the Rich From the Poor"" is wrong, and i'm going to refute it's points!","I think it goes without saying that you should watch the video first. Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtzRxeaf5NQ&amp;t=10s

The reason i'm not posting this on youtube is because my post goes over YouTube's comment limit, &amp; this forum also seemed appropriate for the subject. 

I put some links after each refutation to facilitate further reading on the subject. 

- The rich pay themselves first? No. This point ignores the fact that it's very hard to save when you don't make that much money in the first place. American wages have been stagnant since the 1970's, and the 1990's saw a rise in the rate of home ownership which peaked in the mid-2000's. The stagflation in the 70's mostly eliminated working-class saving habits, and many people used the 1990's United States Boom to buy houses which lead to an increase in mortgage debt. I'd also like to draw attention to thumbnail of your video, which is a diagram of two people (labeled as rich and poor), showing the disparity in the prices of their clothing. This can be explained by pointing out the stigma that comes with being labeled as poor, which contributes to social pressure for the poor to spend more of their income on status-goods (expensive clothing, jewelry, etc.) as a way to avoid being labeled ""poor"" (usually when you label someone as ""poor"" it's because you're trying to shame them, like how you're doing in the video).

- The rich base their decisions on long term rewards rather than instant gratification? Yes, but the way he frames it ignores several key factors (Surprised, right? You thought I was gonna 100% disagree with all of these didn't you?). He assumes that working class people (who are the majority of lottery winners) play so that they can quit their jobs and stop working, but studies show 85.5% of of lottery winners in the US don't quit their jobs after winning (most likely because lottery winnings are treated as taxable, at least in the United States. In Europe, lottery winnings are not taxed and the percentage of people who keep their jobs is lower; 62% in Sweden, 41% in the UK). He also doesn't bring up the way that the lottery is marketed, as most states advertise the lottery as being a way to contribute to funding education. Lastly, he fails to mention the role evolutionary psychology plays in human decision making (though to be fair he probably doesn't even know it). The big problem is he frames the argument differently for each character. For the ""poor"" character he frames all the decisions made in terms of loss, but he frames all of the decisions made by the ""rich"" character in terms of gains. This is disingenuous because it doesn't accurately portray how humans make decisions. Human loss aversion leads us to take more risk to avoid losses, but that's only in cases where we have less and stand to gain more taking risks. If you have more, you're less likely to take risks because that would hurt your gains. So the reason working class peoples are more likely to take risks with their money is because they stand to gain more trying than they lose, and they wouldn't gain more saving it (in the case of the lottery) because the lottery is such a minor expense that the amount saved by not participating in negligible in the best possible terms.

- Rich people have several sources of income? Yes, but the way he frames it ignores several key factors. When he talks about passive sources of income, he's referring to investment (allocation of money with the expectation of beneficial returns in he future). While this can take many forms like retirement funds (401k, Individual Retirement Accounts), it most often refers to Exchange-Traded Funds and Stocks. The thing is that investment is almost exclusively done the upper class, as nearly 50% of Americans have no investments of any kind, in the stock market or otherwise because they have no spare cash to invest with. Mirroring my first point, it's hard to invest when you don't make all that much money in the first place. Another thing he gets wrong is that most working class Americans do not only have one source of income, as 32% of working class people need a second job or more because they can't make ends meat with just a single job. Unfortunately that percentage of people is on the rise. Once again he either ignores the facts or deliberately or frames the question in a disingenuous way.

- Rich people continuously invest in themselves? There isn't even a point here, it's just padding before he shills his audible link. There is barely a skeleton of an argument here, other than ""Don't waste your time reading books which have facts in them, read shitty self-help books because it will make you smart like me!"" Next.

- The rich never blames, but take full responsibility for their failures? No. Firstly, Income has not been rising with inflation. As stated in my refutation of the first point, wages haven't kept up with inflation since the 70's. More irritatingly he tries to obfuscate the role that politics plays in economics. The reason working-class people blame politicians for their bad circumstances is because politicians notoriously take money from the upper class and vote for policies that contradict what the majority of the working class support, and directly contribute to the their financial disadvantages. To dispute his claim that the rich always take responsibility for their faults, we simply need to look to the causes of the 2008 recession and the people involved. In the 2000's, investors started putting money in the housing market because it seemed like a low-risk investment with potentially high-returns. They pooled together many individual mortgages and sold the shares of those pools to investors, and the credit ratings agencies assured investors that these bets were safe. Soon the demand for these ""low-risk"" mortgages made lenders lower their standards by giving loans to people with low income and bad credit, often using predatory lending practices such as making loans without verifying income. These lax lending practices and low interest rates drove housing prices up, which made the mortgage pools look like an even better investment (they weren't). Suddenly these rapid price increases meant that people couldn't pay for their houses which had mortgages far more than what the houses were actually worth, so homeowners stopped paying, which meant they lost their houses and those houses were now on sale in a market that had no demand for them, &amp; that meant the mortgage pool values dropped leaving the lenders with no money to pay back the investors who'd bought stocks in those pools. While all of this was going on, big financial institutions sold insurance to investors cover in them if the mortgages in the pools defaulted (Credit Default Swaps) without any money to actually back those up. All these bad bets tied together with each other meant that when it collapsed, the whole financial sector would feel the ramifications. A big reason that this happened is that banks &amp; lenders we're willing to lend these subprime mortgages because they planned to sell ownership of those mortgages to someone else, and everyone who bought these mortgages did the same thinking they could pass the risk off. Finally, the decades before the recession had seen years of deregulation in the financial sector because people believed the people running these financial institutions because they thought would be responsible. Does any of what I just explained sound like something responsible people would let happen?

- The rich don’t sleep in? No. Everyone needs to sleep, because sleep is necessary for survival. 7 hours of sleep a day is the bare minimum you need to remain healthy and energized. The group that gets the most sleep are seniors over the age of 65, and each age group down the line gets less sheep from the last. This 
means that the groups that get the least amount of sleep who are working, are parents with young children &amp; people who live in low-income areas. Finally, the upper class is mostly made up of people on the older side of the sleep spectrum. So this means the more money you have, the older you are and therefore you get more sleep on average that every other group of people in the US. It is literally opposite of how he says it is, so he's just lying.

- The rich have clear vision or purpose? Yes, but once again he's ignoring key factors &amp; aspects of human psychology (though once again, I should point out he probably doesn't know them)! So let's visit Maslow's hierarchy of needs to get an idea of how human motivation works, which I should point out is not perfect because it doesn't take into account the birth circumstances of the person and how that affects their needs (but it's a good start and reference for debunking this point). Maslow's framework says that each tier of needs must be fulfilled before a person can work on fulfilling needs higher up the hierarchy, so before needs like ""purpose"" (Self-Actualization on the hierarchy) can be worked towards, basic survival-related needs must be satisfied first. In our society, money is how one facilitates the needs on the lower end of the hierarchy. So basically it's easier for the rich to be working towards ""purpose"" since their survival-related needs are already fulfilled for them. Working class peoples who work paycheck-to-paycheck don't have a lot of time to work towards fulfilling their ""purpose"" because their survival-related needs are in jeopardy. Now it is true that people who are more motivated tend to be more financially successful across every level of society, &amp; money isn't what's driving them. The link between compensation, motivation, &amp; performance isn't so simple. There is a strong possibility that higher pay actually demotivates people because it creates a conflict between motivations that are extrinsic (financial &amp; tangible rewards) &amp; intrinsic (enjoyment, sheer curiosity, learning or personal challenge), which interferes with our ability to preform at our best. So he is technically right with this one, but can't explain why using facts and has to shame working-class people in place of an actual argument.

- The rich makes progress before entertainment? No. This is mainly just an extension of his last point, except he stopped being accidentally right and just when back to obfuscating actual issues. So the reason human beings crave entertainment is main for the purposes of distraction &amp; comfort. Most people aren't very good at multi-tasking, which sucks because we usually have a lot on out minds. entertainment (whatever form that takes) allows people to wind down, take a step back &amp; clear our heads, let us think about things in a way that can be productive, soothing, &amp; even fun. Of course it's important to not let distractions get in the way of our responsibilities and obligations, but with the torrent of life crashing down on everyone non-stop it's no surprise that working-class people are more prone to distractions than those that are financially better off. It probably has something to do with people like you trying to shame them for things that are beyond their control, or the fact that they live paycheck-to-paycheck working multiple low-income jobs, or maybe it's all of the other reasons i've brought up refuting your points.

personalfinance,Confused about estimated taxes vs lump sum,"As the post title says, I am confused. 

This year, my wife and I owed more than 10K in federal taxes. We both received two sizable bonuses this year (for a total of four bonuses) in addition to our normal W2s from our corporate America job. In addition, I was forced to sell a boatload of stock and had some earnings on that cash. In the end, I wrote the check for 10K and I thought I was done. 

Now I have a friend telling me that the four vouchers that TurboTax provided to me also need to be paid throughout the next year for basically double what I just paid - totally around $20K.   I have questions:

1. Am I required to pay the estimate or can I just wait until next April and pay taxes as usual?

2. Work takes federal taxes out of my paycheck and my wife’s paycheck but I guess I need to increase the amount I am having withheld? Does t matter if we don’t typically owe? As stated above, this year was unusual because of the four bonuses. 

Thanks for any advice.",finance
economy,How we can fix the US economy,"I have an idea on how to fix the US economy. We cannot raise wages, but we can lower the cost of living. If we build about thirty five million units of micro-condos which are sold at no more than five thousand hours of the local minimum wage rather than rented, we can lower the largest expense people face while giving them the ability to build equity which can be rolled over into larger homes within a few years. This would also create jobs, not only through the building and sale of these homes, but also through the economic stimulation an increased disposable income would provide and the future home sales as people upgrade. Next, we would need to tax robotic labor used to automate humans out of the workforce at a level roughly equivalent to human labor. This would slow automations stranglehold on taking over the economy while opening up the new sources of government revenue to replace lost income taxes, allowing us to better balance the budget and not risk social security going bankrupt. After that, we need to replace whatever remains of the welfare system with a workfare system operating as a county works program so that people can earn a basic income and provide for both themselves and their families while adding value to the economy rather than being a burden upon others while giving nothing back. This would increase civic pride both due to a sense of purpose as well as the improvement of local communities as this labor was used to fix the issues therein, as well as lessening resistance to poverty reduction programs since taxpayers would see that they were getting something back for their investment. From there, we could redirect subsidies towards energy independence, improved agricultural programs like vertical agriculture, and rebuilding our infrastructure. These would all add value to the economy. Since the value of money is based off of what it can buy, and the amount money can buy is determined by how much that money represents divide by how much money there is, if enough value were added, we could print enough currency to cover whatever remained of the debt without significantly devaluating the dollar through inflation. Of course, much of the debt could already have been eliminated since 1) the war on poverty would already have been effectively ended by the building of the micro-condos, 2) the economy would have been greatly stimulated, resulting in more taxes, and 3) new tax revenues on mechanical labor would have been added. Eliminating the debt would further increase what should be a budget surplus by then, which is illustrated by the roughly 6% of federal expenditures being interest on the federal debt and 2012 budget deficit being roughly 30%, which means roughly 20% of our 2012 deficit was just what we owed in interest. Having more funds would allow for increased spending on social programs (schools, workfare, etc...), infrastructure (power plants, roads, bridges, etc...) and defense (troops and equipment), all of which would further increase jobs. We could even add a basic payment to citizens of a percentage share of government surpluses acting like a universal basic income.

personalfinance,Auto Refinancing Advice?,"I bought a used car in June of 2017, and got stuck with a high interest rate (21%) because even though my FICO score was around 720 at the time they said I had no Auto FICO because I hadn't financed a car in nearly 8 years. I bit the bullet because my old car was in dire need of replacement.

Fast forward to today my FICO is nearly 750 and I've not missed a single payment or been late on any payments in almost two years. I have no idea how to find out what my ""Auto FICO"" score is, but I'm wondering if that's what my bank was going off of instead of my actual FICO score?

I went to my bank who I have a checking account and credit card with to look at refinancing my car for a lower interest rate and was immediately denied. I'm kinda at a loss at this point because their reasoning doesn't make any sense to me.

Short average age of accounts in your credit bureaus report or no record

My car has been on my credit report for almost a year, and my two credit cards have been there for about two and a half years.

Too few accounts in your credit bureau report or no record

I only have three accounts on my credit report, my car loan, and my two credit cards. I don't need anymore credit cards, and the area I live in is far too expensive at the moment to consider trying to buy a house. What more could they want?

Insufficient equity and/or down payment

The loan officer never even mentioned I might be able to put money down, but it's a refinance is this even necessary? My car is a car that retains it's value pretty well too, and it's in prestine shape still.

Insufficient recent satisfactory credit history or no credit file. Applicant

I have nothing on my report that's anywhere near bad and haven't for two years. I'm even three months ahead on my payments for my car.

Has anyone gone through this sort of thing before that might be able to give me some pointers? A few co-workers recommended trying a credit union instead of my bank. I'd rather not keep having things inquiry my credit report though because I know it can drop my score.",finance

Bit of side info, I currently live with a buddy who owns his home. I pay him $550 a month, and it covers my rent and utilities. My student loan payment is $315. I just made up a budget for food ($70 for groceries, $40 for eating out, $30 for drinks weekly). Probably on the high side, but I take my gf out on dates once or twice a week. I pay $9.99 for spotify, $29.99 for a gym membership, and about $125 for dog food. Car, car expenses, and cell phone is paid for by company. I may add like $100 or $125 for miscellaneous expenses. 

I don't currently invest in a Roth IRA or have savings specifically for house down payment or wedding/rings, but depending on the advice I receive, I may start. In the budget sheet, I just have 5% of take home pay for Roth IRA, 3% house down payment, and 2% for wedding/rings. Should I not invest in Roth IRA, or save for house down payment and wedding, and put every penny towards getting student loans paid off? Should I dip into 20k of my savings and make a lump sump towards student loans or max out Roth IRA? Should I not touch my savings, and follow something similar to my budget sheet where I'm putting about 5% in Roth IRA, 5% into savings for house down payment and wedding/rings, and just paying $315 on student loans. Once again, I have 20k in savings, 2.5k in checking, 29.2k student loan debt, and my goal is to have all my student loan debt paid off, be married, and own a house by the time I'm like 31 or 32. 

EDIT:
I have 20k in a high yield savings. Nothing is really tied down to anything in particular. It is just money I've been saving for emergencies, down payment for a house, wedding, etc. I'd like to break it down somehow though and have a gameplan. I.E. $6k is for emergency fund, $2k for house down payment, $2k for wedding, and then pay $10k to pay off student loans with 6% interest rate.

I live in a midwest city that is not Chicago, so the cost of living is fairly average. My job is secure. There is no need for me to be worried about being let go. The company has been expanding every year since 2008 and operates in about 15 states. As I mentioned, I know the expected pay scale for my position. If everything works out, I should be making around 70k to 80k by the time I am 31 or 32.

However, I also was just offered a business opportunity. A bar owner in my hometown is wanting to retire ASAP and is selling his bar. He is selling the building, which is in an old building downtown in a small midwest town. The bottom part is the store front and above the store is an apartment/living space. The business comes with the building, the business, all the inventory, liquor and decorations, and the liquor license. All the owner wants is 10k down payment and 140k over 70 months no interest, so 2k a month. He offered to sell it to my parents, and they asked me if I wanted to go 50% in with them. They are supposed to look at his books to see how profitable the bar is. It would only cost me $5k for my half of the down payment.",finance

Initially, when we went in we were thinking about a 48 month car loan as we wanted to have the car paid off in full in no more than four years.

After talking with the salesperson, he mentioned to us it might be smarter to get a longer car loan (I don’t really want to more than 60 months cause the interest rate increases right) and pay off whatever the difference would have been towards the principle. 

I’m sure situations vary, but would getting a longer loan and paying off the principle make more sense than a shorter loan without paying towards the principle?",finance

personalfinance,"Grad school, Air Force, or test the job market?","Hello everyone,
I'm a college junior about to enter my senior year (I will graduate in the spring of 2019) and I recently crunched the numbers. 
Upon graduation, I will owe 25,000$ in federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans. That number includes all accrued interest.
Upon graduation, I will owe 95,000$ in parental plus loans. That also includes total fees and interest. 
I originally went to a private university for two years but was getting decimated by the loans I was taking on so I transferred. I now go to a well known and respected top 10 public university and I'm paying about 1/3 that I was at the private university. Definitely the smartest decision I've ever made. 
Now, I will be getting my degree in political science. It's not as much of a laughable degree as everyone thinks it is, as it has legitimately taught me a lot of great writing, editing, communication, and other critical skills. That being said, I know it's not as something as secure as say engineering or IT. It's too late to change that now, but I digress. 
Now, realistically my three options are- Go to Grad school, join the military, or test the waters of the job market. 
I really want to get an MPA (Masters of Public Administration) as I would love to work for the federal government. If I were to pursue Grad school, my total tuition, room and board, fees, etc. for the area I would like to go to school in is just shy of 100,000$. I do not have the funds to pay for that, and I would have to take out more loans if I went right to Grad school after completing my undergrad.
I've always thought about joining the military, and looked really into ROTC in high school, but the private university I went to previously only acted as a satellite school and I would've had to travel to another college to participate. I didn't want to deal with that hassle (and I don't own a car) so I didn't end up doing ROTC. However, it is my understanding that if I join the military (I would like to join the Air Force if I had my choice) with a bachelor's degree it will grant me two things: Rank, (which comes with increased pay) and utilization of the GI Bill. I've had several people suggest to me that I could do 4 years in the Air Force, then use the GI Bill to get my master's. I'm pretty sure I would only have to pay next to nothing to go to grad school, which would be fantastic. I could save my pay from my 4 years in the military (since a lot of your life is subsidized) and go to Grad school while paying off my undergrad debt. I'm sure I'd have to speak to an accountant to be certain about that, but through my research everything I've said about joining the military so far is accurate (if you know I'm wrong, definitely comment). 
Last is test the job market. I could attempt to get a job after graduating. My brother attended the same university as I am currently. He graduated last year with a degree in history and makes 40,000$ in a marketing job. So it's definitely possible for a liberal arts major to make it. There's also some government positions I can apply for that pay roughly 35,000$-45,000$ a year, but only have room for promotions if you have a master's degree. I know that I could take a year to attempt to find a job and join the Air Force or go grad school regardless if I find a decent paying job in that time or not. 

Thanks for reading and have a great day. 

TL;DR, I will be graduating next spring and I'll have 120,000$ in student loans, with a degree in political science. Should I go to graduate school, join the military, or test the job market?",finance

Fed up, I asked my bank how this was happening and got a canned answer: ""It's usually skimmers at gas stations, blah blah blah."" Convinced it was a shady-ass gas station across the street from my office, I stopped going there entirely. In the interim, I opened a new credit card with Bank 2 (unrelated to this issue) and stopped using my card with Bank 1 entirely. Even though I wasn't using my card with Bank 1, I got a notification that it had been used out-of-state. I confirmed that I had not used the card and Bank 1 said they'd issue a new one (as per usual) and when I pressed again why this was happening or what I could do, all I was told is that I could keep my card ""blocked"" and just unblock it whenever I want to use it.

Long story short, I currently have an auto loan at 6.9%. I've had this loan for almost four years, and it was the first loan I ever applied for (I'm 22 years old). Outside of this loan, I've never had any type of credit building devices, save for the rent I've also been paying for the last three years, but I've never been late on any payments. The only issue with that is I'm unsure if those rent payments were recorded anywhere (That's a whole separate topic). In a few months, I plan on trading in this car for a new or slightly used Subaru. The issue is I've also been waiting for a while now to apply for a credit card because it's about time I got one. I've had a ton of offers come in the mail from both Capital One and Discover, and I'll probably end up applying for the Discover card. 

The thing is I have a memory of reading that it will affect my chances of getting a loan (At a preferable rate) if I've also recently applied or been approved for a brand new credit card. If this is true, should I wait on applying for the credit card, or should I hold out on trading in the car?

I've read some places may want the rest of the loan up front, which I just don't have. I have also read they may reevaluate my interest rate since  he was the one who brought the good credit to the table. I have read over my financial agreement a few times and even emailed the dealership where I got the car, and had them send me a copy of the financial agreement to make sure I had every detail of the contract and it doesn't mention anywhere what happens in this type of situation. I tried all their FAQs on their website and tried googling to see if anyone with this company had this happen and can't find anything. 

I'm hesitant to call the company directly because of what could potentially happen when they find out he has passed.

We have yet to miss a single payment in two years \(and by the way we do have online access to view the accounts and make payments... it's just not in our name\) but getting a straight up loan from a bank for 85k seems unlikely.

personalfinance,Promotion at current employer or accepting a new offer.,"So here is my situation: I've been working as a bank teller part-time (34hrs/week) for the last couple months for 13.50/hr. I like the job ok, but it is really not my cup of tea (natural introvert) and am considering taking a job with my local city as a codes inspector. It at first seemed like a no-brainer. The city job would be full-time, 30 miles each way less driving, the pay is the same, CoL raises each year, and the benefits are significantly better for less cost. 

However, I found out this last friday that my bank branch is going to transition to a new model and promote all tellers to ""personal bankers I""s so everyone can do everything. My manager at the bank is notoriously stingy on raises since her job is redundant and she minimizes labor to make the branch look more profitable which has lead our branch to be particularly chronically shortstaffed. (the largest non promotional raise anyone has gotten was .08/hr under her tenure). The other teller has been there 3 years without any raises. When asked about potential compensation for this dramatic increase in responsibilities all she said was she asked for approval from corporate to give us increased compensation which seems like she's going to weasel us out of it and claim corporate denied it. However, an open part time position we have would likely be eliminated and us 2 part-timers be made full-time and after 6 months we would get promoted to PB IIs (also no mention of increased compensation in hourly) which would get us incentive pay for loans, CDs, and the like for the branch, but didn't give any ballpark numbers for what that would look like. And I can't transfer to a closer branch (assuming there are openings) for another 5 months (finished probationary period plus another 6months on the job is required before transferring)

I feel like the bank job is a better resume builder long term, but financially, unless the increased compensation is significant, the local city job is the better job for now.

Thoughts please? I'm really struggling here on it. What would be reasonable to ask for at the bank if they try to negotiate for me to stay?",finance

However I'm getting ripped off on fees (2%+) for everything in the plan (even Vanguard's S&amp;P500 by name, which I have in another 401k at ~.15%). So doing short term bonds doesn't make sense (2% return, 2.5% fee ftw), but I noticed this fixed account doesn't have a fee.

personalfinance,Getting out of debt + good credit-card to transfer balances to? [US/PA],"Does anyone know of any good credit cards that I can transfer balances onto?

Here's my current situation:

* 800 at 8% interest rate (normal APR)

* 3,200 at 3.5% interest rate (balance transfer from card #3)

&gt; Credit Card #2 - $7,500 CL

* 5,020 at 21% interest rate

&gt; PayPal Credit - $800 CL

* $550 at 0% interest rate for 5 more months, 21% afterwards if it's not paid off (accrued from date of purchase) 

I'm aware that utilization is incredibly high for three out of my four accounts - I made sure to take the balance from my highest-interest card and transferred it onto my lowest card via a balance-transfer promotion. My current plan of attack is to pay off the $550 and $5K first, and snowball the rest onto the lower interest debt.

Regarding *how* I got this much into debt, I was laid off for a year and was scraping by on retail wages. I have just recently been hired with a new salaried job that pays 65K/year, with full benefits (started mid-March). I try my best to meal-prep by cooking with a crockpot for meals at work.

I also do have a part-time job that's winding down; I have about 4-5 more weeks of work with this position, at about 10-20 hours a week. There was a payroll issue with backpay, so I am expecting to be getting a paycheck worth about $500 soon (with normal checks being paid out regularly as we reach the ending of this project).

I'm also hoping to be getting about $1,000 from my other employer in unpaid backpay; it's no guarantee - but I have threatened legal action - and I have been reassured that they're working on it as well.

Finally, I also drive Uber - *but only on days where I think I'll make money*. This weekend I made $1,000 - I put 33% away for taxes, and put the rest towards credit card payments.

Regarding budget, I still need to perform an exact break-down of living expenses (groceries, gas, etc.) but after rent, utilities, car payment, insurance, IRA contribution, etc., I have about $1000 in free spending money.

Finally, my credit score is between 650 - 720; I filed for bankruptcy in 2010, and got my debt discharged in January 2011.",finance
personalfinance,Need help deciding whether to pay down whole student loan or invest in index fund (NOR),"So I currently have enough money to pay down my whole student loan. The interest rate for it is 2,159% variable, but I can get it fixed at 2,315% (3 years), 2,677% (5 years) and 3,144% (10 years). One has to go back to mid 2009 to see the variable rate for student loans go from 2-3% to around 5-6% in my country. 

I have no other debt, credit card related or otherwise, and I also set up an emergency fund that is of good size. Part of my salary matches to my retirement fund. Now, I've been reading a bit up about low-risk index funds, and I see that an expected annual return can sit at around 5-7% average. Is it wiser for me to take the money I have and put it in one, and continue paying the monthly student loan payments? I figure I'll earn about 4% more interest doing it this way. I'm thinking long-term anyways, and I'll probably have the money sitting in the index fund for at least 10 years or probably more. That, or I could put the money in a special savings account which gives a fixed 3.2% interest rate. Also, I'm in a stable situation and can pay my student loan payments on time each month. 

What would be the best way to go? It's very tempting to just get rid of the whole loan, but it would also be nice to earn around 4% on the money each year, seeing as it's quite a decent sum.

investing,Buying a home: It may not be your best investment.,"I am in my mid 30s and I live in London with my family. One of the questions I frequently face is, “Why haven’t you bought a house yet?” to which I reply, ""I don’t think it is a good investment.” I am usually frowned down with contempt for making this statement. I soon find myself debating with a group of people who collectively oppose my opinion. I eventually lose my argument and they walk away victoriously.

I would blame most of that on my inability to explain my thoughts on-the-fly. And in other cases I can sense that the debaters have either made up their mind already or don’t like being told that their recent investment was not that great. If it is the latter, they find it convenient to counter-argue their way out of this uneasiness thereby ignoring the fundamentals. Their points look valid at the first glance but can a detailed analysis prove otherwise?

Before we start I recommend you to have an open mind while evaluating my arguments. Usually, when you have made up your mind, your mind tricks you into finding numerous reasons to justify your decision. I guess this is normal; it may be because the person's mind is too focussed on just one thing.

**#1: You save the rent**

To an investor, saving the rent is akin to dividends received on an investment. If you are buying a house on mortgage, which is likely in most cases, your down payment is usually 10% of the price of the house; you borrow the remaining from a bank. This is called a 'leveraged investment' where the investor takes a calculated risk to maximise his gains by borrowing n-times more than his principal. This works well if you know what you are doing but the downside of this strategy is that your losses could be terrible if things go bad. In the case of housing the general consensus is that nothing will ever go wrong.

Let us consider a hypothetical scenario. You found a company that ticks all the boxes to be a long term investment. It will pay you a dividend somewhere equivalent to the rent you are going to be saving. You are fairly certain that nothing could go wrong with this company. 
1. Would you bet all your savings on it? 
2. Would you borrow money from your parents and friends to buy shares of this company? 
3. If you could get cheap loan, would you borrow 10 times more than your savings to invest in this company?

You probably answered no to all the three questions. A seasoned investor assigns no more than 10% of his portfolio on a single asset as there is always room for something to go wrong. Famed investor Warren Buffet advises not to test the depth of the river with both your feet. But here you have put not just 100% but 10 times of your entire savings into just one asset for a return of 3-4% annually. Historically, the stock markets (S&amp;P500) have paid more than 11% annual return on an average. A good investment fund should give you more than that.

**#2: Housing price always goes up**

This is wrong and to prove my point we don’t need to look very far into the history. The 2008 financial crisis showed us just this. The counter argument here is that even if the price falls it cannot go too low and that it will come back up quickly. This assumption is wrong too.

The only reason housing prices bounced back up soon after the great recession is because of the cheap monetary policies implemented by central banks around the world to stimulate economic growth. They gave the banks money that was created out of thin air. These retail banks then multiplied this money supply by lending them to consumers using the technique we know as fractional reserve banking. The interest rates were reduced to near zero, the cheapest we have seen in 5000 years of human history, to make consumers borrow as much as possible. 

The mortgages that were once expensive are now dirt cheap. The monthly payments became much more affordable to people who couldn’t once afford to buy a house. With artificially induced buying power people raced against each other bidding up the price of houses. 

To make the situation worse, some countries like UK, implemented government sponsored help-to-buy schemes that looks like a great relief to the buyers but only superficially. What a buyer fails to notice is the fact that many others like him, in the property market, also have access to the same help-to-buy schemes who then collectively drive up the prices. In reality, these schemes help the sellers (real estate industry), not the buyers. 

You may have noticed the flaw in this monetary policy by now. The debt induced artificial economic growth cannot sustain very long as the number of credit worthy consumers diminishes over time. House prices soon go above the affordability factor for most buyers again. The high prices can only be justified if the economy is booming and the wages are growing at the same pace. Unfortunately, that has not been the case in the past 10 years.

People who bought their houses right at the bottom of the economic downturn around 2010/11/12 did a great job. Like me, many of you, missed the boat here. It seems like we are now reaching the end of the government stimulated economic growth a.k.a. 'business cycle’. And with interest rates now slowly creeping up, it is highly likely that the economy has started slowing down again.

**#3 The government can fix it.**

Historically, the central banks have been fixing the problems that we call an economic slow down, a market crash, a credit crunch or a recession by increasing the consumer debt. People are encouraged to borrow and spend which then stimulates the economy. This is done by reducing the interest rates. Housing is just one asset class distorted by this fixing game. 

It is widely argued that somewhere close to 97% of the money we see in the economy today has been borrowed into existence.

If the number of creditworthy people fall, the amount of money borrowed into existence also falls, leading to a reduction in money supply. Now that the central banks have gradually reduced interest rates from about 20% in 1980s to close to 0% today, this fixing game seems to be almost over. In other words, it seems like they have ran out of ammunition at least in increasing money supply in the form of debt. 

There are other measures they could possibly try. Tax relief, tax refunds, free basic income are some examples that could potentially be used to increase the spending power of an average consumer. This will cost the central banks nothing but such policies will have their own repercussions in the economy; details of which are outside the scope of this discussion.

**#4 Interest rates will not go up too quickly**

The real estate industry directly depends on the interest rate at which consumers can borrow. And the interest rates are closely dependent on inflation. Inflation makes a dollar today worth only a fraction of what it was worth a while ago. 

The income generated by the governments through taxation isn’t enough to cover their expenses; so they issue bonds which is a promise to pay the investor his principal plus an interest on the maturity date. If the investor thinks his returns are not going to be worth his initial investment because of the inflation, he wouldn’t be interested in buying those bonds. So the governments across the globe always have to make sure that the interest rate paid on their bonds are always at par or slightly above the inflation to keep them attractive.

The central banks inflate the money supply to fuel economic growth but at the same time have to keep the bond markets attractive. This is like walking on wire; as long as they can hold the balance the markets are happy. This is a confidence game and the balancing act could tumble to either side anytime.

If the inflation picks up, the interest rates automatically rise. If that happens the financial institutions don’t have to lend you cheap loans as they can get better returns elsewhere. In other words, you may have to pay higher interest rates in order to secure a long term mortgage.

**#5 Short term price fluctuations are trivial, housing is for long term**

Your house is only worth what another person is willing to pay for it. If the economy slows down, other houses in your locality may start selling for a much lower price than what you had anticipated. This may be insignificant to you as your aim is to hold on to your house for a very very long time. But if you are buying the house on a mortgage you should also know that it doesn’t come with a teaser flat rate for it’s entire life. 

When the teaser rate expires, irrespective of whether you decide to remortgage or not, your bank revalues your house to assign a new interest rate on your mortgage. The new interest rate, flat or variable, may or may not be in your favour. If the bank's valuation is significantly lower than what you bought it for, your equity on the house could possibly be less if not negative. This is risky for the bank and a risky loan always comes with a terrible interest rate.

The affordability of mortgages may not always be unwavering for consumers. When the monthly mortgage payments reaches the tipping point of unaffordability, home owners put their houses up for sale. As more such houses starts coming into the market the prices start falling and this market behaviour feeds onto itself in a vicious circle like what we saw in 2007/08.

**#6 Other arguments**

Some people want to buy a house for the pride of owning one, “what would others think if I don't own a nice house?"" You actually own the property only on paper; the major equity holder of your house is the bank. Pride is complicated - the pride of owning a Jaguar; the pride of flying business class; the pride of having an expensive steak dinner - these are not investments for obvious reasons. 

Some of other reasons other put forward by families for owning a house are freedom and escape from letting agents. In a worst case scenario, the costs associated with these are insignificant considering amount you are investing.

By taking a mortgage you are also risking your predicted future income thereby locking you up from making any further investments for the rest of your productive life.

Owning a house is also very expensive. Apart from the initial expenses incurred in the form of stamp duty and fees paid to the estate agent/surveyor, a house comes with a lot of maintenance cost. But if anything goes wrong with your rented property, all you need to do is to call the landlord who is legally obliged to fix it within a reasonable time.

You may also find that you are geographically tied to your house. You will either have to disregard good career opportunities away from home or commute long distances that may soon turn frustrating.

**Conclusion**

The media shows a lot of sympathy towards us, the consumers, for not being able to get on the ""property ladder” (whatever that means). They also express unhappiness for our locality not having enough houses. Nevertheless, we don't see those people who cannot afford a mortgage living rough on the streets. I consider these as noise that can be safely ignored. 

When it comes to investing, I do shop around for opinion as this helps me gather as much information as possible. If you are planning to buy a house, doing some research stirred with a little bit of rational thinking wouldn't hurt. 

This article was an attempt at explaining my thoughts on why I consider buying a house today is not a good investment. It may have been a good one in 2010. I guess I have been able to give a reasonable summary to defend my contrarian thinking that may help you before making the biggest investment decision of your life. 

And finally, the workings of any economy is obviously very complicated. It is highly likely that I may have missed something important as I don't know all the moving parts. Also, your personal circumstances may be different and I recommend doing your own due diligence. Do not take this as a financial advise and I am not a financial advisor. After all, I am only a computer programmer. :-)

personalfinance,Negotiating Student Loans and IBR Plan,"Hello PF,

I recently spoke to my financial adviser regarding student loans and my IBR plan.

Currently I make approximately ~37,000 annually before tax, and my total expenses are under 12,000. I am blessed for sure.

I have about 37,000 in student loans though, 1/3rd of which is at a 6.8% interest rate.

My initial plan was to:
1) Throw about 1k a month at these 6.8% loans and completely pay those off by the end of the year
2) Then try to whittle away at the second 1/3rd of my loans, which are at 5.4%
3) The last 1/3rd I would just pay double the interest and slowly pay it off as it's a measly 3%.

He suggested I only pay the total interest and save my extra income and then try to settle in bulk with the loan companies. This sounds like bullshit to me as from what I've read they're really not keen on settling. But he stated that he has done this in the past, and is currently doing that with a client.

He works for a non profit, and highly reputable CBO in my community, and so far he has been pretty helpful in getting my finances together.

But I'm not sure what to do. He claims that if I throw 1k a month at my loans, next year the loan servicer will think they have made a mistake and will charge me way more in minimum monthly fees, and that it's better to settle. This sounds like it might be true.

I am confused and would like a second opinion. As I don't think settling student loan debt is possible for an account that's been active for less than 10 years and is in pretty good standing. I don't see the incentive.

Most of my student loans are federally funded, and are not private loans.

Please let me know your thoughts, I am confused and it sounds like bullshit, what he's saying. 

EDIT:
Just to clarify he is not suggesting I default on the loan or anything like that, he is suggesting that the banks would prefer a lump sum payment and would settle for under the total balance owed by a few % points.

He claims that this is advantageous to them because they are able to lend again to another person that may not be able to pay it off as quickly.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Market Prices / SEC Futures / Manipulation,"With all the recent talk about big money starting to trade OTC for bitcoin a lot of thoughts start to come to mind. Specifically when considering that these OTC markets are supposedly set up for high networth individuals as to not influence the normal market (lol). I mean WTF does that even mean?

I mean I'm sure that there are pieces of this puzzle that I'm missing but here's the scenario as I see it today :

Big money finally understands and accepts bitcoin is the future and wants in. They also want to be able to control price as much as possible. In order to do so they create futures products on the CME, CBOE, and soon to be NASDAQ. All of these are regulated by the SEC. Ironically the bitcoin markets themselves are not.  Enter OTC markets. Now, while all of the normal people are using the typical Coinbase, GDAXs, kraken etc , they want to buy and sell in a good old boy network that average people are financially locked out of. Worse yet is that these large block trades that would have originally been forced onto the GDAXs Krakens etc are now completely offline and don't move the prices at all! To top it off they try to sell this to the masses as a good thing!  This is not a good thing IMO. The big money is pouring in billions of dollars and the value of Bitcoin as seen on the exchanges is barely budging. Furthermore now that they have federally regulated futures products there's nothing stopping them from simply placing huge sell orders with these OTC bought coins on the GDAXs of the world and causing a plunge in the price of bitcoin.

personalfinance,What is the best refinance option to drop PMI and open a HELOC for home addition?,"I went onto my mortgage lender's site and looked around for refinancing options. I did a pre-approval on a cash out refinance and a rep called me soon after. He was asking how much I think my home value was worth and we pinpointed it down to $280k from comparables and zillow estimate. The bank would offer 80% of a new loan off this refinance. 

I am looking for about 40-50k to do some additions to the house and the rep suggested that I do a two step process. First do a rate and term refinance for a lower interest rate and getting rid of PMI. After that, I would then apply for a HELOC. 

What do you all think about this? 

I currently have a FHA loan with this bank for $220,000 from 2016 and currently owe $214,000. Again, from comps and zillow estimate, home value might be worth $280,000. This is the first bank i've contacted and will continue to shop around but after hearing this two step option, it sounds okay but I don't know what's the best refinancing option in order to get rid of PMI and use some equity to add onto the house.

btc,I'm at my wit's end with Bitpay,"Well, Bitpay used to give me actual invoices that I could see an amount for, but then when I went to open it in one of the wallets that they claim support BIP 70, it always says ""invalid invoice."" (Bitcoin.com especially) 

This happened 3 or 4 times on completely different occasions trying to buy from Newegg, finally I got so mad I decided I will not even attempt to spend crypto at Newegg anymore and have been using my debit card there exclusively since. (very bad) 

Weeks have gone by and I have simply been avoiding spending crypto with any merchant that takes Bitpay because I literally am not able to no matter how many times I try and it always leads to extreme frustration

Well just today I decided to try Bitpay again, with a brand new merchant I have never tried before and I get an even more absurd problem...

Bitpay is now just generating a blank page instead of an invoice for some orders. No error message. Nothing. On OSX Yosemete 10.10.1 Have tried refreshing the page, reloading the invoice, nothing but a damn blank page...had to use my debit card, AGAIN. 

At this point, Bitpay is the single entity that is MOST preventing my from spending BCH and I'm beyond frustrated. This is literally the **5th** time I have attempted to pay for something through Bitpay, failed, and used my debit card instead. I know if a diehard BCH supporter like myself is fed up to the point of just using a debit card then there must be a very serious problem with Bitpay and I know I can not only one who feels this way.

Please, someone tell me I am doing something wrong...

It would also give me 3% cash back on gas, which I do not get currently unless it’s a rotating category with my current cards, which is 5%. 

I was wondering if this would be frowned upon or not. I have a 762 FICO score with  4 credit cards opened. The only debt I have now is my car loan. I do plan on trying to obtain a mortgage in the next 1.5-3 years. 

Would this be dumb or should I just take the hit and deplete most of my savings. I figured with the card I could pay it off steadily while maintaining my savings and would be able to reap some benefits off of it.

personalfinance,Car finance: new vs older,"Hi all,

I am a new grad with a job starting in a couple weeks about 80km drive from my home. I need a car and I am looking to finance a used car but was wondering everyones opinion on financing an older, cheaper car with no warranty VS. a newer, more expensive car with factory warranty.

Specifially, I am looking at spending around 10-14k on a 2010-2012 Genesis coupe, jetta tsi, maybe Madza 3 2.5L, or something similar with a little get up and go. I would finance this over 36-48 months. I have been pondering whether this is the best option for me though. My other thought was picking up a 2016/2017 jetta tsi for around 20k since it should have factory warranty on it for a while. This i would likely be looking to finance over 60-72 months.

I am looking to put about 2k-2500 down and finance the rest. I do not have a very good credit score as Credit Karma has me recently moving up to a 651 score. I have been turned down by the bank for financing due to not being finished probationary period at this job, but he specifically mentioned not for financial reasons and that in 3 months i would be approved, once probationary period is through. Problem is I need the car to get to the job. The bank representative's manager actually suggested I go through the dealership and just not mention my start date, and to tell them my realistic expected earnings (~50k pre-tax) and that after 3 months i can go back into the bank and re-finance if my interest rates are not ideal.
Originally I wanted to be stuck in payments for the least time possible but now I am wondering if the factory warranty will actually help me spend less in the long run.

Any opinions welcome.",finance

personalfinance,Friend's inheritance. Is my advice valid?,"Hello everyone,

I'm very sorry to say my friends mother passed away. It was very sudden and unexpected but she's handling it as well as can be expected. Her mother was a wonderful person and prepared herself very well in advance.

My friend after paying off some debts and dealing with the estate now has:

-a fully paid off house worth around 375k

-350k left from a life insurance policy

-100k in a state farm death benefit account at 4.5% apy

-and in the next few months will be receiving another unknown amount from retirement accounts, probably in excess of 100k

She reached out for me for help and the basic plan we hashed out was this:

Keep the house and rent it out. It should rent for approximately 1800-2000 a month. About 1200-1400 she will take for living expenses and the rest will be kept in a fund to handle costs with the house.

50k liquid in high interest saving account (for school/living expenses)

The 100K will be left in the state farm account as the interest rate on it is rather decent for the amount of flexibility it offers (can be withdrawn from at any time, pays around 300 a month in interest)

The remaining 300k from the life insurance is what were not sure on. My suggestion was to just place it in a vanguard 2050 target fund as that is the general advice I've seen offered time and again here. 

The other question is the retirement accounts, is there anyway she could roll over the accounts directly into her own retirement to avoid the tax penalty hit from withdrawing the money? This is the area were not familiar with. We don't even know exactly what it was in the first place as its through the postal service. Does anyone know what kind of fund it would be using?

Any other advice would be appreciated. As for her current situation she lives about 400 miles from the house but has family nearby it and a good property manage service they've used for a long time on another home (grandparents) that she has a part share in. She rents a apartment and bought a new car as her car failed while she was up handling the estate. No debt liabilities.",finance

Ripple,Faster Payment Taskforce of Federal Reserve might go with the proposal of Ripple?,"The Faster Payments Task Force was convened by the Federal Reserve in May of 2015. The task force has focused on identifying goals and attributes of effective faster payment systems; proposing solutions and assessing their capability to achieve those goals; and championing the payment industry to take steps toward implementation and adoption of faster payments capabilities. (Source: https://fasterpaymentstaskforce.org/) (Source Ripple: https://ripple.com/insights/federal-reserve-task-force-ripple-improves-speed-transparency-global-payments/)

Part of the steering commitee is Ryan Zagone (Director of Regulatory Relations at @Ripple. Steering Committee of @FedPayImprove. Advisor to @BetterThan_Cash.) (https://twitter.com/RyanZagone). 

What will bring this taskforce to us?

Well, here you find all the solution proposals. Including that on from Ripple (I assume they made the deal): https://fasterpaymentstaskforce.org/effectiveness-criteria-and-solution-proposals/

All recommendations: (Source: https://fasterpaymentstaskforce.org/goals-and-recommendations/)


**Recommendation 1** - Establish a faster payments governance framework: A voluntary, industry-led framework for collaboration and decision making is needed to execute on many of the task force recommendations and to achieve ubiquitous receipt – where all payment service providers are capable of receiving faster payments and of making those funds available to their end-user customers in real time – by 2020.


**Recommendation 2** - Recommend and establish faster payments rules, standards, and baseline requirements that support broad adoption; safety, integrity, and trust; and interoperability: Establishment and enforcement of cross-solution rules and standards will aid in achieving the core ecosystem goals of broad adoption; safety, integrity, and trust; and interoperability. These cross-solution rules and standards would encompass a baseline set of requirements that enable payments to move securely and reliably between solutions, and ensure end users have predictability and transparency in certain key features pertaining to timing, fees, error resolution, and liability.


**Recommendation 3** - Assess the payments regulatory landscape and recommend changes to the regulatory framework: The task force asks the Federal Reserve to initiate an effort with relevant regulators to evaluate current laws and regulations to ensure that they are suited to the unique characteristics of faster payments. The task force also recommends that a stakeholder group within the governance framework be formed to prioritize regulatory concerns and engage with relevant regulators on these issues.

**Infrastructure Recommendations**

Second, the task force recommends enabling needed infrastructure to support faster payments. This includes:


**Recommendation 4** - Establish an inclusive directory work group to identify and recommend a directory design for solutions to interoperate in the faster payments system: Developing a design for directory services is important for achieving the core ecosystem goal of interoperability. Recognizing there are a number of directory services currently in existence or under development, the task force believes that work on this effort should begin as soon as possible upon publication of this Final Report to progress toward a recommendation for a commercially viable model of directory services.

**Recommendation 5** - Enhance Federal Reserve settlement mechanisms to support the faster payments system: The task force asks the Federal Reserve to determine the optimal design of and implement a 24x7x365 settlement service to support the needs of the faster payments system. The task force believes that broader access to Federal Reserve settlement services will level the playing field and enhance competition among providers of faster payments services.

**Recommendation 6** - Explore and assess the need for Federal Reserve operational role(s) in faster payments: As faster payments are implemented in the market, the task force asks the Federal Reserve to explore and assess the need for an operational role(s) in the faster payments system to support ubiquity, competition, and equitable access to faster payments in the United States. In addition to providing for a settlement capability, such roles might include provision of directory services, transaction processing, network access, security, and/or cross-border payments.

**Sustainability and Evolution Recommendations**

Third, the task force recommends that the faster payments system in the United States be future-focused and able to address evolving security threats, meet changing end-user needs efficiently and effectively, and enable continuous innovation through new technologies. An effective system also requires an ability to monitor progress toward achievement of the task force vision, while taking action to address identified gaps and broaden end-user participation. This encompasses a variety of activities, including:


**Recommendation 7** - Recommend, develop, and implement methods for fraud detection, reporting, and information sharing in faster payments: Timely detection of fraud is important to building integrity and trust among end users in faster payments. As such, there are benefits that can be gained from timely fraud reporting and information sharing across solutions because it can highlight patterns in fraud and/or breaches that may not be visible to individual solutions alone.

**Recommendation 8** - Develop cross-solution education and advocacy programs aimed at awareness and adoption: Education and advocacy programs for both end users and service providers are an important part of achieving the core ecosystem goal of broad adoption. For end users, awareness and understanding of faster payments in general should be the focus. For service providers, programs should focus on awareness of the Effectiveness Criteria, particularly “Usability” (U.2) and “Accessibility” (U.1), as well as the baseline requirements for faster payments established under the governance framework.

**Recommendation 9** - Conduct research and analysis to address gaps in cross-border functionality and interoperability: Research and analysis should be undertaken to advance understanding of the requirements for cross-border interoperability with various jurisdictions, and develop recommendations to enable interoperability between faster payments solutions in the United States and faster payments solutions in other country jurisdictions.

**Recommendation 10** - Continue research and analysis on emerging technologies: New technologies have the potential to change the payment landscape. As such, it is important to deepen understanding of the risks they may pose, as well as the potential they might offer, particularly with regard to enhancing security and/or meeting largely unmet needs in cross-border transactions and among underserved end users.

**The Path Forward and Next Steps**

The task force believes that implementing these recommendations will lead to a payment system in the United States that is fast, ubiquitous, broadly inclusive, safe, highly secure, and **efficient by 2020**. To meet this aggressive timeframe, executing on these recommendations must commence this year and be sequenced to ensure appropriate resources are deployed in a timely manner and used effectively. As such, the task force recommends that work on critical path activities begin immediately and proceed as follows:

**Steps for 2017**

To provide early direction for 
the development and evolution of faster payments solutions already in and entering the market, the task force recommends the following activities start as soon as possible following publication of this Final Report:

Develop a governance framework proposal
A critical first step is establishing a governance framework (Recommendation 1) that will ultimately have responsibility for implementing many of the remaining recommendations. In fact, this work has already begun with the formation of an Interim Collaboration Work Group (ICWG), which will develop, publish, and solicit public comment on its proposal for a governance framework.
Stand up informal work groups
The task force expects groundwork to begin as soon as feasible on rules, standards, and baseline requirements (Recommendation 2); applicable regulatory requirements (Recommendation 3); and directory design to facilitate interoperability (Recommendation 4).
Begin work on a 24x7x365 settlement system
Because broad access to settlement services will help level the playing field and enhance competition among providers of faster payments services, the task force calls on the Federal Reserve to begin efforts immediately on a 24x7x365 settlement service (Recommendation 5).
Begin to assess the need for Federal Reserve operational role(s)
To ensure ubiquity, competition and equal access to the faster payments system, the task force calls upon the Federal Reserve to initiate an exploration and assessment of the need for Federal Reserve operational role(s) by year end (Recommendation 6).

**2018 (and beyond)**
Completion of the work of the ICWG will lay the foundation for a substantial amount of critical work to take place as soon as possible in 2018. This will include:

Establish the governance framework and its members
The governance framework will enable collaboration and decision making on cross–solution issues that are vital to the development of the faster payments system. This will include taking the groundwork provided by the informal work groups and using it to facilitate establishment of cross–solution rules, standards and baseline requirements (Recommendation 2) and a commercially viable directory design for solutions to interoperate (Recommendation 4). In addition, the groundwork provided by the informal work group on regulatory requirements will support ongoing engagement with relevant regulators under the governance framework (Recommendation 3).
Carry out the work envisioned in Recommendations 7–10
The task force expects the members of the governance framework to convene and provide resources for groups to execute on the desired deliverables for key activities as quickly as possible, including fraud detection and information sharing (Recommendation 7); cross–solution education and advocacy (Recommendation 8); research and analysis to address gaps in cross–border functionality and interoperability (Recommendation 9); and research and analysis on risks and potential benefits of emerging technologies in the faster payments context (Recommendation 10).",cryptocurrency

My husband and I are are on a tight closing/move deadline - we feel confident that the loan officer associated with the documents below can deliver on our timeline. However, I am concerned that the interest rate isn't as attractive as we may get if we continue to shop around. Considering we have excellent credit, 20% down payment, and a low debt to income ratio, is there any reason to believe we would *not* be able to receive a lower rate? 

Do the fees and costs in the documents otherwise appear in-line with normal expectations? Do you see any opportunities for negotiating fees? Any other info you think I'd find helpful?

We are cutting it close at this point as we're invested in a May 23rd closing date and may be out of time to continue shopping around.

personalfinance,To continue to pay or to walk away (auto loan from predatory seller/lender),"About a year ago, my girlfriend (right about the time we started dating), needed to purchase a new vehicle. Having some credit issues, she wasn't able to get a standard loan... So she made a vehicle purchase from one of those predatory dealers where they list a crappy vehicle for well over book value and offer you one of their loans at an ungodly interest rate. 

Today, after we were discussing finances more (and talking about how to work toward being able to purchase a house together eventually), I found out just how badly she's getting screwed. To date, she has paid about $4100 on the vehicle with the original price for it being $9500, and she still owes $7600.

She's determined to get her credit back to a better place, and I'm happy to help her do so. My question is this: I have an extra vehicle I'd be willing to let her have. If her credit already isn't very good, would it be worth it for her to just walk away and let them repo the vehicle at this point? It's not in very good shape and needs quite a bit of work. Blue book value on it is approx. $3000. Just looking for some advice on the best way for her to proceed.

personalfinance,How the heck does one pay for college?,"Hello,

Here's the situation:
I've completed my gen eds at my local college in my freshman year for relatively cheap; I was able to pay for nearly all of my expenses from this year and only took out a small federal loan.

I've been accepted but have not accepted enrollment at a great college where I qualify for in-state tuition. This college undoubtedly has excellent programs for what I want to do (English bachelor, TEFL minor) and many opportunities for internships at publishing companies that'll hopefully become careers. The only problem is that this university costs about $14,000 for tuition alone each year. I'd also have to pay for housing (about $6,000 a year) and a meal plan (around $2,000 a year) plus I think I could probably keep my spending on books under $200.  So, $22,200. Per year. For probably 3 years-- $66,600.

My parents are not in a financial position to extensively help me, but because of circumstances, the FAFSA *thinks* they'd be very helpful and because of this my initial FAFSA estimate for next year is only about $4000 in unsub, sub, and work-study. Obviously not enough.

I work a retail job, making a couple thousand more dollars a year that'll help, but still not enough. 

And I'm applying for scholarships, but I can't necessarily rely on those.

I know that I could take a gap year and make as much money as I can... but I don't know if I want to spend another year at home. It feels like giving up, like failing. And anyway, how much of a dent in my future debt could my crappy retail job really make?

The thing is, I need to accept enrollment at this university in the next month. I'm 18 and I'm the first kid in my family to go to college and neither of my parents went to a 4 year college, either. 

My questions to people who have gone through this: if I take out bank loans to help pay for this stuff, is it possible to pay off so much money in a lifetime? With all that student loan debt, are you still able to travel, to live somewhat comfortably? Are there other options for paying for college that I'm missing? 

To be honest, I'm really afraid to take on so much debt. Anything you can tell me will be appreciated :)",finance
economy,ECB policy is extremely dovish yet inflation is only 1.3% and economic growth is slowing.,"Policy is still extremely dovish with the goal of normalization in the next few years. Peak growth at the beginning of this process is a disaster. The biggest problem is normalization has gone too slow. It would be interesting to see what policy would be put in place if Europe were to fall into a recession in 2019. Clearly, the US is in much better shape as the Fed has raised rates to 1.69% and started unwinding its balance sheet, all while the the US economy is stronger than Europe’s economy. These factors could be bullish for the dollar versus the euro.

personalfinance,Phones I didn't order show up at my door- Snam?,"Hey guys- something smells fishy.... TLDR: Verizon wireless phones I didn't order show up at my door, how do I protect myself and my credit?

I work from home in medicine so I get packages all the time.  My FedEx guy shows up to get my signature for some packages (nothing out of the ordinary), I sign and go about my day.  I open the packages addressed to ME to find two brand new iPhones with packing slips in Spanish from Verizon wireless.  

My credit has been locked down since the Experian hack and no suspicious charges have hit any of my accounts.  I have no legitimate accounts with Verizon Wireless.

I call Verizon Wireless and let's say they are less than helpful.  The social security number associated with the account is NOT mine so I can't access the accounts.  I want to know: What is their process for opening an account?  How do they verify identity?  Why didn't they catch the name and social didn't match?  Who paid for/will be paying for these phones?  Don't they pull credit when someone gets a phone? They just want me to return the phones to them and refuse to help me further and lady proceeds to call me a potential scammer and emphasizes that they won't/can't do anything until they receive the phones back.  This was the legimate phone number for Verizon Wireless.  

I've seen a few scams involving phones, but none quite like this.  What's the scam here?  How do I protect my credit?",finance
personalfinance,My dad worked for the railroad for 20 years and apparently had 500k saved up in retirement when he left. He's now reaching retirement age and doesn't know how to access it.,"Hey! So my dad worked on the railroad for 20 years from 1975-1995. He was sort of let go (there was a lawsuit, which he won). I know that there wasn't any sort of legal decision regarding his retirement, and the last statement he got said he had 500k in. He's almost retirement age, but has no idea how to get access to it, or if he even can. He worked for Burlington Northern and the lawsuit/him leaving occurred right when it became Burlington Northern Santa Fey. 

Edit: The railroad apparently went federal with their retirement and its in the hands of the U.S. Railroad retirement board.

CryptoCurrency,Implications after Central Banks introduce tokens?,"Crypto is bringing Forex trading to the masses, even if not on purpose. 

Everyone knows the value of BTC changes daily relative to USD. In the general public, few people realize the value of USD changes daily relative to other currencies. When the US Gov. / Fed. releases a token, I imagine that (1) **many people will slowly become aware of the changing value of what they thought was stable or ""good as gold.""** Combine that with the realization that they (2) **don't need to primarily hold USD in their account**, since every currency can be instantly converted. 


If I wanted to hold something other than USD right now, I would drive to an airport or sign up for an FX account. Soon, people will be able to instantly buy/sell between anything. They will be free to not even use USD at all if they want. Is this a negative in the eyes of the US Gov. (and every gov.)? It seems like it has been a benefit for central banks that their native population is predisposed to use the national currency, and difficulty in exchanging it increases stability.

What are the implications? So far it's obvious that those who owned BTC are more wealthy than one year ago if they held USD. Why would I ever want to hold a USD token and can we ever expect relative stability in the currency market? 

Is there a future where the majority of people hold a stablecoin like MKR/DAI, and let investors and traders speculate with other currencies?",cryptocurrency

financialindependence,My early retirement group says a maximum of 2% annual distribution is logical for a 50-year retirement,"First, there was the 4% rule and then the financial community shot that down and pushed for the 3% rule instead.  They said low-interest rates requires a conservative maximum withdrawal of 3%.

Now with professional and healthy people living longer and many people retiring early and expecting to live for 50+ years in retirement. Now the 3% rule has become the 2% rule.

Of course, a 2% withdrawal of even a million dollars is chicken feed, so very few people will be able to retire and live a good life on that.  But people are told by the financial media that they have to be conservative.

Here is an article from the USA TODAY Newspaper that states that someone who retires early should use an age divided by 20 rule.  So if you retire at age 40, the maximum you should withdraw is 2% of your portfolio a year.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/powell/2016/08/11/new-retiree-withdrawal-rate-formula-4-percent/86877234/

personalfinance,Loan Consolidation:Worth it in this case?,"Hi all-

I have a bit of credit card debt. I make okay money, with overtime available,  but one card is giving me a specific issue. 

I opened the card when I was 18. I didn’t realize this truly until last year, but it has a whopping 29.99% interest rate. (Or maybe it’s 39.99??) either way, my interest payment is literally my monthly payment. For example, this statement states my minimum payment is 204.51, and my interest payment is 203.00. My balance is 7632.44. I’ve been throwing an extra thousand on this card occasionally, and try to pay at least $50 over the minimum every month for the last year and have gotten the balance down from just over $10k. It’s suffocating me. I have a couple 2k balance cards that I feel I could pay off if I could just kill this one.

I recently applied for a debt consolidation for this card and was offered 7800, at 14.63% with a 3 year term, $438.51 origination fee. It’s through Upstart.

To me it seems simple enough. I’ve already shredded the card years ago and don’t have access to it, so won’t charge back to it. 


I’m supposed to get somewhere between a 5-10k bonus at the end of the year which I planned to put all on the card but the thought of all that interest accruing till then is sickening. 

To me it seems the math is simple and I should do it, but wanted a little advice on if I should do any further investigation into this.


Thanks for any and all advice!",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan servicer reduced principal without any additional payment.,"I refinanced my $75K in student loans in August 2017. I am following an aggressive repayment schedule over 5 years in order to get a lower interest rate (currently ~2.77%). I reconcile my payments and interest monthly and despite every amount paid and categorized to interest and principal matching, in September 2017 an additional $900(ish) was reduced from my principal balance. That month's statement only shows the one payment I made, correctly identifies the principal and interest amounts, but for some reason lowers the outstanding balance by the additional amount. The statements from that point forward show the reduced balance and 6 months later I still have this ""credit"", but no underlying payment or line item adjustment to support it. 


You're probably thinking, why complain? I'm not complaining. I'm just asking for advice on whether it is my duty to notify the loan servicer? If you reconcile the account, you would identify the error fairly quickly, but given that it was last year and they still haven’t figured out I don’t think they will.


The last thing I am worried about is that this should likely have been counted as income on my 2017 taxes, right? Or am I overthinking this? Should I think about heading to /r/legaladvice?",finance

personalfinance,Advice on buying family car,"So right now my partner and I have a 2dr 2006 Chevy Colorado and a full size Nissan sedan. We are expecting a 4th child shortly. We are looking for a crossover SUV or minivan.

Would you guys suggest new or used? Here are my pros and cons for each:

1. New- (25-$30,000)Original warranty so hopefully longer life, cheaper financing, cheaper on insurance, plan on keeping until older kids start driving (10 years,) and can hopefully get better trade in value for truck from dealership. Now some negatives are greater cost overall (as much as 10 to 15k more) and it will almost definitely be more basic model. 

2.Used- (10-$20,000) cheaper, but more expensive financing (1.9%vs3.9%) several years older, less durability and life, possibly more luxurious model, lesser trade value for current vehicle. 

We plan on having 5,000 cash to put down plus  my Colorado to sell or trade. The Colorado on KBB lists 3,500 to 4,700. If I go to the dealership my parents have been customers at for the last 15 years they will possibly offer a greater value on my truck, they have done so with other vehicles in the past. 

If I'm buying a new vehicle I wouldn't mind tacking an extra year or two on the loan to lower the monthly payment as long as the interest rate is low enough. I plan on getting 8 to 10 years out of the vehicle.

So what do you guys think? 

Also would it be better to trade in my truck against the total value or sell it and pay off principal on loan?

TL;DR should I go for a new car that will last longer and cost more but at a cheaper rate then for used?

personalfinance,When does a Traditional 401k make sense over a Roth?,"I started my 401k when I was 26, making around $50k / yr in NJ.  I was single at the time, renting, chose a Roth 401k (no company match), and contribute 8%.  

I'm now 31, making $58k / yr, but life circumstances are totally different.  I'm now married, and own a house with my SO.  Our household income is $150k, and we file taxes as married, filing jointly.  

I just got a raise and want to increase my contributions to 12%, but I think a Traditional 401k would be better at our combined income.  If it matters, our various federal deductions are : 

* $8k health insurance premiums 
* $10k NJ property tax 
* $4k mortgage insurance (I know this is high, we're working to pay it down and refi) 
* $7k ish in NJ state income taxes

personalfinance,Which loans should I pay off first?,"Right, this should be simple. Pay off the loans with highest interest first. However, I have a dilemma.

I have about $50,000 in student loans with a 5% fixed interest rate. Each month when I get a bill it is for $0. I can pay according to what I make each month, and typically I put 10% of my commissions (I'm paid with 100% commission) into my student loans as I get paid.

I also have an $8,000 car loan at 3.79% interest. The payments each month are $250. 

Here is my dilemma. Because I am paying the $250 each month, and because I never know when my next check will be, I am scared to put more money towards my student loan debt. Being new to this job, I don't have a solid clientele at this point. I know I can swing the $250 each month for my car, but I would rather just pay my car off in bigger chunks so that I can begin putting a steady amount toward my student loans. 

Is it ridiculous to pay off the car loan first so that I can devote a solid $250 each month, PLUS 10% of my paychecks to my student loans only?",finance
personalfinance,"In laws took out loan in their name, gave us the money for student loans, but we are paying off the in law's loan","Hey PF,

I am unsure how my wife and I need to do when we submit our 2018 taxes. 

First off, I am very lucky to have excellent in laws.  They are good people.  

My wife has about $150k of students loans. These loans had various interest rates between 5 and 7%. Her parents took out a loan on their land for $110k at about 3%. They gave us this money to apply to my wife's student loans. However, this money wasn't given to us for free; my wife and I have to pay off this $110k loan. Even though the money wasn't free, it is saving us hundreds per month and thousands through the life of the loan. 

For the $110k loan, we we're given a coupon book and we will be sending a check to the bank every month. The loan is in her parent's name, but my wife and I will be paying this loan directly. 

My wife and I have planned out how we are going to pay off these loans, so that isn't my question. 

My question is this: when we submit our tax forms in 2019, what do I do about this money?

Thank you. 

Edit: I think I might need to clarify my question better: I am not asking if I get to deduct the interest, my main concern is if I need to claim this money as income.",finance

Bitcoin,"The ""Bitcoin Foundation"", a supposedly community driven bitcoin advocacy group, has now been taken over by 'Bitcoin Cash' supporters","I just received an email from the 'Bitcoin Foundation' this morning, written by a man named 'Llew Clasen'.

Llew Clasen is Vinny Lingham's business partner at Newtown Ventures. Vinny, of course, supports BCH and thinks Bitcoin is failing. 

The 'Bitcoin Foundation' has a substantial budget and a mandate to promote bitcoin in a positive light and to advocate for it with government regulators.

However, it has now been taken over by bcash supporters.

Roger Ver now controls numerous media outlets and is spending a huge amount of money spreading the lie that bitcoin cash 'is the real bitcoin'.

Meanwhile, bitcoin itself has a PR budget of exactly zero dollars and zero cents.  Other than guys like us posting on social media, that's it. 

The damage being done by this social engineering and media attack is not insignificant.  People who are thought leaders within the community should stop sitting on the sidelines, and make a concerted effort to correct the lies, fraud, and propaganda being spread by Roger Ver and his supporters.

He owns bitcoin.com, the bitcoin twitter account, now the bitcoin foundation, there is no end to his willingness to socially engineer a PR campaign to spread lies and disinformation.

Here is the complete text of the email that was blasted out this morning:

------------------------------------------------------

Dear John,

A warm welcome to our new members. Every month, I send out an operational update to all members and highlight key operational issues arising since the last members’ update.
 
Here are our operational highlights for March 2018:
 
The Foundation’s 2018/19 planning
Much of the Foundation's activities in March revolved around planning for 2018/19. The Executive Director (ED) and Chairman of the Board prepared a financial, marketing and operating plan to commit $5 million to scale up the operations of the Foundation and to take a more prominent role as an advocacy organization in the industry.
 
This plan was presented to potential backers in San Francisco, the board and also to the members of the Foundation during a webinar on April 9. It was well received all around. Thank you to all our members who attended the webinar and so actively engaged in the Q&amp;A session.  

Marketing and Operations plan 2018
Financial reports and projections 2017/2018
Speaking engagement, Bitcoin Cash conference, Satoshi’s Vision
The Foundation’s ED attended the Bitcoin Cash conference, Satoshi’s Vision, in Japan March 23-25. The primary intention was to better understand how this project was evolving, meet with stakeholders and better understand how the Foundation should engage with this project going forward.
 
Our plans for 2018 and meetings at Satoshi’s Vision suggest that the Foundation has an opportunity to continue to represent the interests of an industry under siege even if there is disagreement on approach between projects.
 
Lobbying
The Foundation continues to engage with lawmakers in New York state and Washington DC to influence both state and federal legislation in a way that is fundamentally positive for the industry. We expect to be able to make a few announcements on progress shortly.
 
BlockShow Europe 2018, Berlin, Germany (May 28-29)
BlockShow Europe 2018 is an event that brings together the global Blockchain community. The Foundation’s ED will be speaking and we look forward to participating. We have a special promotional offer of 25% off for our members. Use code: 25BITCOINFOUNDATION when buying tickets.
 
WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2018, Vienna, Austria (May 16-18)
WeAreDevelopers brings together developers from across the world to share their knowledge and experience. Dubbed “The Woodstock of Developers” this year’s event focuses on current tech trends including Blockchain. We have a special offer of 25% off for our members. Use code: BITCOIN-FOUNDATION25 when buying tickets.  
 
Member Telegram group
If you haven’t already,  join the Foundation and fellow members in our new Telegram group.  
 
The Foundation's financial position 
March’s revenue included membership contributions of $2,001. There were 13 new members. Operating expenses for the period were $7,588 which is higher than usual. Some of the larger expenses this month included flights for the Foundations ED to San Francisco to meet with the chairman of the board to discuss plans for 2018 and meeting with potential funders ($2,455) and professional fees for marketing and accounting services, especially 2018 planning ($2,829). The net operating deficit for the period was $6,192.
 
March’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) high was $11,480 with a low of $6,844. Total cash assets including BTC and USD were $5,467 at 03/31/18.
 
The Foundation's income statement and balance sheet are available to members for download.

We appreciate your continued support. 

Yours in the service of Bitcoin,

personalfinance,What is the best way to pay for home renovations?,"I bought my primary residence about 9 years ago. Great location, great neighborhood, but the house was a fixer-upper. The previous owner had neglected almost everything, and foreclosed on it. So I purchased it as one of those 'worst house in the best neighborhood' types. Over the last 9 years I've been investing more into renovations, taking one project at a time and have been making some nice progress.

That is, until I discovered termite damage under the house. They chewed up a couple joists, and they need to be replaced. My contractor has estimated it will cost a total of $10-15K, which I am confident is a very reasonable price. I have checked with my insurance company, and there is very little chance they will cover any of it. Next step, how do I pay for it?

I have about $7K in personal savings, and this property is really my #1 investment. My mortgage is very affordable, and I would like to avoid refinancing or taking out a home equity loan. My credit card debt is currently at about $2500 at 0% (promo rate). 

My first instinct is to split this cost (maybe 40/60) between my savings and a credit card -- or perhaps ask about a personal bank loan (depending on the interest rate). I am also a small business owner, so I may be able to temporarily increase my pay rate to help compensate for this. 

My goal is to get this paid for while minimizing additional finance charges, interest, etc... With that said, what is the best course of action? Are there any options that I should be considering?",finance
personalfinance,"Commissioning into the military, anything I'm missing on reducing my financial expenses further?","A couple of questions so stick with me:  I'm commissioning as a Lieutenant (O-3) in two weeks in the U.S. Coast Guard.  At my current job I make $82k and using a pay calculator I'll be making $72k (including applicable area BAH) when I go active in a month not taking into consideration the better tax implications at the end of the year.  I plan on living with my parents while at my first assignment so I can use the BAH money elsewhere (currently I pay $1050 a month in rent.)  I am also currently a resident of a state without income tax and plan to retain that state's residency during my career in the military to reduce my tax burden.  

I've a large amount of student loans, around $280k public and and around $30k private. Currently I pay 3 loan companies around $700 (public,) $600 (private) and $60 (public) a month. The public loans I pay on an IBR plan, with the reduction in my pay I believe I can have the amount I pay reduced even further based on IBR. Immediately upon commissioning I plan on using SCRA to have all my loan interest rates reduced to the federal maximum of 6%.  I plan on staying in for 20 years to get the retirement new dual 401k/pension thing they introduced this year (ya I know and tried to get in in 2017 when they still had the straight pension but the feds are slowwww.)  Upon reduction of my public loans I plan on paying a much larger portion a month to the private one to get rid of it ASAP.

At year 10, I plan on using the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to get rid of the remaining public loans (my biggest driving factor in joining, so fingers crossed it's still around) so I have no real interest in paying them off at more than an IBR rate.  This does put a HUGE tax burden on me at year 10 though, which I'm assuming I cannot wiggle out of?  I believe this to be a taxable income of 77-83k (assuming I'm O-4 or O-5 at that point with over 8 but less than 10 years of service) + lets just say 280k in loan forgiveness that would also count as income would equal to about $100,000 in federal taxes owed that year.  Am I missing something or should I start saving up? 

I also have a 6-year car loan that is $360 a month that I'm almost halfway through that I negotiated at .9% interest (so not really worried about this.) 

Occupational licensure costs I am reducing from $260 a year to I believe nothing while in the military.  

Finally I have about 10k saved as an emergency fund and another 10k saved for career transition expenses (uniform costs [2k+,] upfront moving costs [reimbursed later,] etc.)

Anything else I should also be considering or planning for? Any services or plans for service-members that I can take advantage of that would help me?  Thanks for your insight in advance.",finance

I understand that rising rates essentially devalue older bonds issued at lower rates, and I would presume that this would also encourage more investing (as investors will receive more $$ over time for the same amount of principal) I was wondering though what exactly the significance of the 10 year hitting 3% is.

Bitcoin,Federal Reserve Bank Denounces Cash in Favor of Crypto,,cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Advice on financing a used car purchase or paying cash,"I recently purchased a car for $6300 after taxes, title, and dealership fees. I have the option to finance the car. The loan requires a $1000 down payment and has a 5.74% interest rate over 36 months. The result is a little over $500 in interest paid over the life of the loan.

Financially I could pay cash for the car and be done with it. I also haven't owed money (other than a mortgage) in years. Owning the car would also allow me to lower my insurance premium.

The downside I see is parting with a lump sum amount that would otherwise be invested and the potential lost earnings there. The upside is, as mentioned above, not owing additional money and, potentially, the lower insurance premiums.

I could also look into credit cards with 0% interest on balance transfers for 15-18 months, to pay it off at a slower pace (~12 months) and avoid the additional amount owed. I would pull from my monthly investment amount to cover the amount due each month.

Anything else I should be considering? Is there a clearly better option that I should go with? Thanks.",finance

40M/40F/One kid. Household income is 100K. 37K in 401K (started 3 years back), 7K in HSA. I contribute 6% to get full employer match. 44K saved up in an online HYSA. Car is fully paid. No student loans. Monthly expenses are in 3K range. All credit cards are paid in full every month.  

I am in US on a work visa (H1B) since last 8 years. Wife is a stay-at-home mom since she cannot work on dependent visa. We plan to stay in this area for long term (as long as we are allowed here :) ). Long-term plan is to get permanent residency here but for my country, there is a huge backlog of permanent residency applications(~10 years wait). All our friends who came with us have bought homes here (some big, some small).  
I don't have an Emergency Fund although if we decide to buy, I don't plan to use all of my savings. If I lose my job and can't find another one in 30-60 days, I will have to leave country. Job market seems hot and my job is relatively stable. 

We currently stay in a apartment complex (2BR, Rent: 1350) where rent has increased 5% every year. Median values of Single Family homes in our area is 450K. Zillow predicts a 3% growth. My wife wants us to buy one of those condos which are in 200-250K range (with hoa 200-400 every month). Her reasoning is sometimes emotional (make memories in our own home), sometimes financial (doesn't want to be priced out of the property market). We both are aware that rent is not 'throwing money away' and owning a house comes with its own set of challenges (property tax, maintenance, HOA etc.)  

As for me, I don't really have a preference about buying or renting. NY Times calculator for buy/rent suggests renting though I am not sure whether I have made  right assumptions about growth of property price, investment returns etc. I sometimes worry whether the rising interest rates or the new tax law will impact property price growth but my crystal ball is cloudy :)

personalfinance,100k in debt and &lt;30k a year in income,"Don't really know where to start. I guess I'll start by saying I blame no one for this but myself and I want to do everything possible to manage these loans. The bulk of my loans have been consolidated and are federal loans (70k consolidated. Currently doing income based repayment, these payments start next month)

Now for the shitty part... I have 30k in private loans (gasp). 20k is to Sallie Mae and another 10k is actually a private loan from my university (How the hell I let that happen is beyond me. Freshman year I accepted the university's assistance because I could not pay my tuition. I was under the impression  this was another federal loan until my university called me yesterday to inform me payments were due in June). I called my university today in an attempt to sort this loan out and consolidate it... which failed miserably. 

I'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed and helpless at the moment and I wish to change that. 

My sallie mae payments start in May and will be 400 a month. My private university loan is due in june and will be 213 a month.

 I can expect another 200 a month in federal loan repayments. 

With 800 a month coming out for student loans and an estimated 1000 dollars in monthly expenses, I can afford to exist and that's about it. 

I realize that this is the worst my situation will ever be (ideally). I will get established and my degree does have value (Environmental Science) I finally have my foot in the door at a company who will train me well and at the very least, make me more employable.

I am only making 15/hr right now but it is full time with decent health insurance, this pay will ideally increase to 20+ in 3-6 months when I am properly trained and coherent in my position. Im sure my situation is not unique and I'm sure many people have felt their debt was insurmountable.

And now, we're 32 years old, almost 11 years since graduating college, and we've followed the personal income spending flowchart all the way to the end. We worked our first full year in 2008 with a combined income of 61K (unmarried at the time) and ended 2017 with 170K in combined gross income. During that time we've actually managed to decrease our overall level of spending (as we have one combined mortgage instead of two separate rents and bills) and in 2017 was the first year we've managed to max out our respective 401Ks and Roth IRAs.

At this time, all we have left is a 270K mortgage balance (13.5 years left on a 15 year term) with a 2.75% interest rate, no PMI. PITI is $2450 a month, with the P&amp;I being $2000 of that. My wife would like to put any additional money we have outside of our existing emergency fund to pay down additional principal. I'm conflicted, as  2.75% is such a low rate, that it appears to be a decent inflation hedge. I also cannot find any good literature on how much of our net worth should be in our primary residence, and I fear that paying it earlier (vs investing) would be akin to putting too much of our net worth into literally a single thing. However, it would be nice to be debt free as soon as possible and free up that cash flow. Currently, our equity in the house is about 25% of our net worth.

Has anyone else had to choose between paying down a low interest mortgage vs invest? How did you make the choice and what factored into the decision? After a few years of that decision, would you make the same decision again?",finance
personalfinance,Planning on buying a house in less than a year. Pay off my student loans?,"Sorry if this has been addressed- I searched for this and couldn't find anything specific.

Financial standings:

* Total assets: ~$360k, diversified into an emergency fund, high yield savings account, investment portfolios, etc.
* Maxing out Roth IRA every year (no 401k offered at my place of employment)
* $45k in credit line availability over various cards
* 0% credit card utilization
* ~$9,500 in total student loan debt through Navient, split across 6 direct loans
* No other loans or liens on vehicles
* Credit score 785 TU / 796 EQ, Average age of credit history: 5 years

I currently rent and will be buying a house within the next year. I am planning on using ~$200k of my holdings as a down-payment on the house (looking in the $300-400k range), provided mortgage rates stay similar to what they are now.

Finally to my question: I hate having debt, and could easily pay off the entirety of my student loans. I've had someone tell me that I should pay off 5 of the 6 individual loans and keep the one with the lowest interest rate open until a mortgage is secured to maximize my credit score. Another has told me that it's not going to make a difference. Any advice? Thanks!

EDIT: My salary is currently $60k. Expecting $65k in a month, $100k in 5 years. I have built my current assets from years of saving, very high-risk investments that paid off extremely well, and a life insurance payout. I have since scaled back my investment risk substantially to what I would consider moderate.",finance

personalfinance,Withholding Question,"Hello,

I have been trying to get our withholding correct and it's a confusing process for me. Last year we under-withheld and owed a lot of money at tax time so I looked to prevent that from happening this year. We both currently are set to Married, Withhold at Single Rate with 0 allowances and it seems like a good chunk of money is coming out of our checks for the Feds each pay cycle.

This year we are expecting a baby in July and with that my wife will miss 3 paychecks for unpaid maternity leave. We also will have to send him to day care in Fall after her leave ends and we will spend more than $3,000 on day care expenses. That apparently qualifies for the dependent care expenses deduction.

I went to the IRS Calculator and entered in the information that I've provided. 

Wife is currently on pace to make about $98,700 and grosses $4167 per check with $665 withheld per check. She also contributes %6 ($250) to her 401k. She had a mid-year raise that bumped her up $5,000.

I will make $85,850, gross $3,307 per check, have $442 withheld, contribute %4 ($130) to 401k and chip in $316 per check for pre-tax benefits.

A lot of information but I wanted to be provide enough to make sense.

Does the screenshot of the calculator results make sense? I subtracted 3 paychecks from her estimated total salary from $98,700 to $86250 to account for the unpaid leave.

investing,Discussion: what in your opinion from a macro-economic point of view has changed from 2007 in the global economy?,"Hi All,


First of all, this isn't a doom &amp; gloom post. I invest automatically every month in a broad, diversified portfolio. With that said, I can't point to many fundamental differences in the global economy between 2007 and now. Explaining why the financial crisis of 2008 occurred seems akin to describing the Fall of Rome, everything seems to have a favorite villain: greedy bankers, incompetent government regulators, clueless consumers, etc. But from my mind there is broad consensus that global economic imbalances were a key cause:

* a large US deficit that created US dollars across the world looking for investment opportunities
* trade imbalances between US &amp; China which lowered real interest rates and enabled US / OECD consumers to leverage themselves
* wage stagnation and income inequality caused consumers to rely on credit to maintain their standard of living (healthcare, education, housing) 
* unrealistic expectations of future growth in an asset class, housing, which blinded investors to downside risk

When I look out at 2018, I see many of the same issues:

* The US deficit is projected to sharply increase despite an economic expansion due to the tax reform bill
* The US trade deficit remains quite high and the same global trade imbalances are present
* While US consumers have reduced their mortgage debt levels, students loan and auto debt has increased. (although debt servicing levels are lower given interest rates)
* wage stagnation and income inequality have coupled with rising housing, education, and healthcare costs to further pressure consumers budgets

Furthermore, certain areas are actually worse in 2018:
* China has undergone the largest credit expansion in human history
* The US has limited tools to combat the next recession due to a high debt load and less room to lower interest rates
* Demographics across all OECD countries &amp; China indicate an aging, less productive populations longer term
* of the formerly touted BRIC countries, two are in severe recessions 

This isn't to say that there haven't been improvements, notably financial regulations and improved corporate balance sheets. Yet it's hard for me to see in the short-medium term how we maintain  growth. At some point without either large wage gains for OECD consumers or a dramatic increase in consumption in China it seems we will need to de-leverage.

personalfinance,Auto Loan Question. Help Meh!,"First of all I hope this is the right place to post this, sorry if it isn't.

Quick question. I'll be in the market for a car in the couple of months, because the one I have now has too many problems to fix. I'm going to be looking into joining a credit union (along with other options) to inquire about a auto loan and all that jazz, and you can see I'm trying to do my research way ahead of time.

My credit score is under 600, roughly 570 and once I pay this small student loan of $1600 (the only debt left I have left on my credit) I'm sure it'll go up but lets just say my credit stayed under 600 by the time I was looking to purchase the car (which is ideally around late June early July). Last month my buddy and I figured out a couple of things with his business that allows me to make on average $4k a week, direct deposit and I'll definitely be able to show them the paystubs as proof. Financially I'll definitely be able to afford the car I want, the problem really would be that my credit is still subpar and I can't really wait for my score to climb up and up with this particular decision.

So my questions are this: 1. What are the chances of me getting a loan for a $29k car based off the income and credit I mentioned? 2. Realistically from a credit union and with the credit/income is a 4% interest rate still achievable? 3. Do you think there is a better alternative than a credit union based off of my situation?

Anything helps. Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Federal TSP v. CA State CalPERS,"Hello! 

I am just starting with the California State Department of Transportation. It is a relatively recession-proof place to work with lots of potential advancement and I plan to spend 20-30 years working here. I left a federal job for this, after less than 12 months. So, I am of course having buyer's remorse and wondering if I made the right choice. 

I would like to know what PF thinks is the best retirement package: Federal or CA State. Below is what each offers. Here are [some images](https://imgur.com/a/0GGDr1n) of a simple spreadsheet calculator and graphic for the first 7 years of work at both places, with Best, Medium, and Worst case scenarios. 


Federal:

- TSP 401(k), matches 5% 

- Defined benefits pension, 1% x Highest Salary x 30 years (min) 

State: 

- Defined benefits pension, 2% X Highest Salary X 20 years (min) 

- 457(b) offered 

For me personally, based on my prior federal supervisors and experience, I believe I could rapidly advance with the federal govt to a point where I had a higher salary and better manager's title (and more work) than the state, although my annuity would be smaller than with the state, and I would have to work longer. 

With the state, it seems harder to advance past a certain level, and there is no matching employer contribution to a 401(k), but the annuity will be much better.",finance

personalfinance,"Reddit, I need a better budget and I don't know where to start.","Reddit, I need your help and advice in getting on track financially.

My current budget, debt, and income information is available **[https://imgur.com/a/aMxvBfl](https://imgur.com/a/aMxvBfl)** for your review. 

I'm a 27 year old female resident of Pennsylvania. I'm married. My husband and I both work full-time; both of us individually work between 45-50 hours per week. My 25 year old sister lives with us, works, and goes to college part-time. 

I grew up in a single parent home (mother) in the midst of poverty and crime (less than $11K/year in total income). We didn't have much and I learned to live in happiness without most things in life. I'm the first person to graduate high school and the first person to earn a college degree (Associate's) in my mother's family. I met my spouse in college, and we were married about 5 years ago. My spouse also grew up in a moderately poor family, but their parents are still together and earned about $50K/year as a family. My spouse's family acquired a lot of debt in their lifetime, and offset the issue by taking out 2nd and 3rd mortgages. My spouse has limited experience in financial planning.

My sister moved in with me when I was 21 (she was 19) due to the increased level of abuse from my mother. My husband and I helped my sister graduate from high school after she moved in.We continue to support my sister financially through college (she pays for school with federal and state grants due to my mother's income). My sister works around 10-20 hours part-time (around $100/week), so she is unable to help pay for utilities and/or rent reliably. The goal is for my sister to earn a degree so she can acquire a better job and ultimately become independent of us.

My biological father moved in with us back in 2013 and lived with us through 2015 -- my husband and I covered all of his financial expenses. When my sister moved in with us, she had nothing. We opened a number of credit cards to help purchase clothing, furniture, healthcare, school equipment, food, toiletries, etc. Occasionally, I help family and friends out financially when I have the means to do so... which is not lately.

My short-term goals are to:

* Create a workable, livable budget
* Identify what debt I should apply additional funds to
* Identify whether or not I should consider bankruptcy

My long-term goals are to:

* Pay off my credit/loan debt within 36 months
* Work towards saving to purchase a home
* Work towards building a retirement plan
* Work towards being financially secure enough to have or adopt children

Currently, I do not have the following:

* Savings plans or retirement plans
* Life insurance
* Real estate or other tangible assets

Some of the companies we have credit/store/loan accounts with:

* American Express
* Capital One
* Chase
* Citi
* Discover
* Lending Club
* Synchrony Bank

My student loans are currently in deferment (luckily), but this may end within the year. IF and WHEN it does, I may be looking at a up to a $1,500/month payment to student loan debt. Our credit scores are between the 640-680 range due to the debt-to-income ratio. I missed one (1) payment on a store card last year and that took my score down a bit. I would like to potentially fight that remark on my credit report, but I don't really know if I have a leg to stand on.

I am not sure what I can or should do, I would greatly appreciate any advice or recommendations that may help me gain a different perspective. For all of my life, I feel like I have been only focused on survival and finding my footing in life. I've taken care of others along the way, but now I know I need to take responsibility for those decisions and create a better financial future for my husband and I.

We currently have less than $100 in our bank account. I am desperate for guidance.

MachineLearning,[D] How resistant is CNN towards invertable (one-to-one) transformations made to input ?,"I was working on a Markov model in one of my project for time series data prediction and thought of giving CNN a try for it. accorting to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00327.pdf) time series data can be converted to images which can then theoretically be fed into CNN. How ever these transformations to time series data does not seem to be invertable (with one to one map). 

So this led me to the question, in general, how resistant are CNN to me applying a transformation to the initial set of test data (basically scrambling the data but still 100% retrievable since it can be mapped back to the original image ), where the transformation is one-to-one? 

I googled, but could not find any answer !

Thanks in advance ! 

PS: am a theoretical physics student, which makes me no expert in ML, so i understand this might trivial or obvious question 


Edit: to frame the question better - if I train a cnn with series of animal images but apply a transformation where all the images are [conformally transformed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map)would the network still be able to work if I test it with a  conformally transformed picture of say cat and predict its cat? 

Edit 2: FOR PEOPLE SEARCHING FOR THE ANSWER: apparently CNNs  not only fail to respect one to one but also do not marry well with isometric transformations according to this  [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00356.pdf). The author proposes an alternate idea that looks at norm preserving features using connected graphs.",technology
personalfinance,Pay off student loans or buy house in an expensive and competitive area.,"Hi! I really would appreciate some insight from this community. We live in a community where entry level 3/2 houses cost 500,000 to 600,000. The market is averaging 8-12 percent increase from year to year. Houses in this price range get anywhere from 5-20+ offers. It's a zoo.  We have no CC debt, but have $30,000 in a 10 percent loan and have $100,000 in 4-6 precent student loans.

We plan to rent out my house and purchase a new house. I got a good deal on my house and we don't expect to have a problem cash flowing from my property. 

My husband finished a dental residency about a year ago and I am a CPA. We have about $20K of credit card debt from our wedding this month that we'll knock out here in the next few months, in that same time we'll be paying about $20K for a continuing education course my husband will be taking.

My husband qualifies for a 97% LTV physician loan with no pmi. Our total mortgage payment (PITI) is currently $1,150, we'd like to purchase a house that would put our total payment into the $1,900 range. 

In an ideal world I would like to wait to buy a house until CCs are paid off, CE course is paid for, and we have a nice big emergency fund saved up. But my concern is that with interest rates on the rise we should go ahead and buy something (the increased mortgage payment will not be super impactful to us) but we plan to be in our next house 5 - 7 years so a higher interest rate could be very impactful. 

Should we wait and tidy up our financial position, or go ahead and pull the trigger to lock in a lower rate?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Block Array (ARY) Project Update,"Now that market sentiment has started to grow bullish again, I thought it would be helpful to provide an update on a low marketcap but very high-upside project, Block Array.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with it, Block Array is another entry in the supply chain sector.  While supply chain is generally a fantastic use case for blockchain tech (and a number of large projects such as VEN, WTC, AMB, and MOD already exist in the space), Block Array focuses on a massive but more specific subsector – the trucking industry.


**General Overview of Use Cases**  
I’m not going to go through the precise details of how the platform will work and the specific functions that the ARY token (Block Array’s native currency) will serve, but suffice it to say, this is a project with actual real-world needs and application.  The trucking industry is nearly a $1 trillion annual market, and under a recent mandate by the U.S. government (the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s Electronic Logging Device rule), truck drivers need to use electronic logging devices to electronically record many aspects of their driving status and record keeping.  Enter Block Array, which will assist fleets in ensuring that they are ELD-compliant.  Separately, Block Array will aid in a host of other transportation-related tracking use cases, again initially targeting the massive trucking industry. 


**Project Status and Key Updates**  
The Block Array team is incredibly communicative (mostly in Telegram but in Discord as well), and they provide weekly updates on the project status.  As it is based on the US (‘Murica ftw), they are also quote focused on legal and regulatory compliance, which is an added bonus.   


Several weeks back, they announced the details for a masternode beta program.  The real masternode program will be rolled out later this year, but the beta selected about 130 ARY holders to test-drive (see what I did there?) the node system to ensure it is fully functional by the time the real masternode program goes live.   


More recently, they’ve announced that they are planning a large pilot study—actually the second pilot study they’ve run—and they will provide real field reports so that people can see how Block Array will actually be used in real life.  I cannot stress enough that, although it’s not flashy, this is lightyears beyond the many projects that simply have an idea in concept, with no working product.   


The team is also updating the whitepaper and is going to be releasing portions of the new whitepaper this week on Github.  Definitely worth keeping an eye on.  


Finally, they will be shortly announcing their advisory board, which will likely be comprised of transportation and blockchain insiders.  


**Last, But Certainly Not Least—Price**  
I’m not sure why, but the price on this has been skyrocketing recently.   The volume has been growing as well, as more and more people are finding out about Block Array through word of mouth.  The team hasn’t even started marketing yet, and the token supply is incredibly low compared to some other supply chain coins (for example, the circulating supply of VEN is about 10 TIMES that of ARY).  The market cap is still under $30M, which means that even with the recent spike, it has a ton of room to grow.  I expect the growth to increase even more dramatically once masternodes lock up a good number of the tokens in circulation.   

I’m not going to predict a particular price, but I’m very bullish on this project and am really hoping it succeeds.  

**TLDR** – Block Array is good.  Price has gone up and has significant room to grow.",cryptocurrency

History/Details: 
I've been working for a veterinary mobile vaccination clinic on/off for the past 5 years. I've worked in many capacities--as a vet tech, as a team leader (in charge of marketing and sales for assigned clinic locations), and did some operations management (they once flew me out for 2 weeks to a satellite office to assess operations, do hiring/firing, training, office work, inventory reconciliation, etc). I joined the company just as it started--doing mobile clinics on weekends in their minivan and teching for their day practice on weekdays. They have since sold their private practice, focused on mobile, and have grown exponentially with clinics/satellite offices in multiple states.

Despite how long I've been with the company, I have pretty much maintained my hourly pay rate (mostly due to the fact that for the past few years I've only worked for them when they were desperate for someone or when I've needed the extra cash so I never asked for a raise). My work experience outside of this company includes 5+ years of being a veterinary technician (private practice, emergency practice, and laboratory setting), 2 years of being head vet technician (private practice), 1 year as a biomedical research assistant, 1 year as a science tutor for a state college, and 2 years as a wildlife educator at Disney World (yes, working for Disney World especially at the age of 18-20 was awesome)

In the time that I have been with this company (since 2013), I have gotten my bachelors degree in Biomedical Sciences, did a year of veterinary school (decided I didn't want to do clinical medicine, so left after first semester), and I'm just over halfway done with my Masters of Public Health. I have tons of veterinary clinical experience, and my MPH is focused in Health Practice so it's focused heavily on healthcare organization management.

They are in immediate need of a field operations manager that will cover a 3-state territory. I know the responsibilities of the position pretty well, and it's no easy job. It is very involved. I'll be in charge of staffing (hiring, training, firing) teams that will go out every weekend to do the actual clinics (and when short staffed, I'll be the one out on the field), supervising employees (mostly indirectly, sometimes directly), increasing sales/average per client transactions, increase volume of clients, supervising marketing (construction of marketing materials as well as proper distribution), overseeing inventory, general office duties, and quality management/improvement. There is approximately 3,640-6,240 actual clinic events across 3 states that have to be staffed, marketed, executed, and accounted for annually. All of this to say: it's a demanding job.

My academic and experience makes me very qualified for the position, I have no doubt I'd do a damn good job, and I have demonstrated my commitment to the company by sticking around all these years. 

However, as with any employer, they are going to want to pay the least amount possible for the most gain. I want to make sure I'm not put in a position where I'm being taken advantage of, especially since this position would require me to relocate to another state (and soon). I'm expecting an official initial compensation offer sometime this week, but so far have been told the position would include benefits such as health insurance, PTO, salary + bonusing based on performance. They are flying me out with the National Director next weekend to the satellite office to get a feel for how operations are currently going and to meet the current employees, and get a feel for the area.

Given the details of my qualifications, job expectations, and my history with the company: what salary should I expect/ask for? What relocation assistance should I expect/ask for? How low is too low of a salary for this kind of position?

Thanks to anyone who read this whole thing, this is my first salaried job offer and also my first job offer that requires relocation so any guidance is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Buyers remorse on car, financing not final","I bought a new car today and regret it. 

I had been waiting on a new model. This morning, I went to a dealer and ended up buying an old model 2018. I don't really want the car, I mean it's fine, I just was anxious to have something, so I bought it. 
My bank's rate was better than the dealer's, so they let me drive it home awaiting a check from the bank. I signed a paper stating I would return the vehicle if the bank did not approve the loan. I got a call from the bank on my way home with an interest rate different than the one I was preapproved for. The dealer I went to is 120 miles from where I live, in a farming area, so I couldn't get to a computer before the rep went home for the night. The loan officer is off work tomorrow, but said to get the signed papers in by 5 pm tomorrow, or I lose the financing. There are no papers in my email inbox, and I have to work tomorrow and can't sign anything anyway before 5 pm.
 
Can I just drive the car down and drop it off at 10 pm tomorrow? Leave the keys in their mailbox or something? I am OK with giving the dealership something for their trouble, like a restocking fee, and cost of the miles. How would you proceed with a new car that's fine but you're not thrilled about and haven't signed a financing contract for? Is this going to impact my ability to get a loan for a car in the future?",finance
personalfinance,Home Loan Issue with Research Fellowship (ORISE),"Hi All,

My girlfriend and I are trying to buy our first home (in Atlanta) and we've run into an unexpected problem with her research fellowship and our ability to get a loan. Our mortgage specialist let us know today that because she has an ORISE fellowship through the CDC (https://orise.orau.gov/stem/internships-fellowships-research-opportunities/index.html) that we probably won't qualify for the usual 30 year fixed mortgage. 

Has anyone else run into an issue similar to this? It smells a little bit fishy to me as we've been under contract a couple of times previously and this has yet to come up (specialist says it was a clerical error on their end thinking that my GFs position at the CDC was just a CDC fellowship). I don't know the complete inner workings with the ORISE fellowship, but from what I understand it is more of a 'stipend' and that the federal government (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac per the specialist) views it as an educational experience, versus a straight up job (her contract is 1 year at a time, she is going to renew at least one more year, up to 4 more years). I did a quick google search and couldn't find anything specific about this issue and I haven't reached out to anyone else besides our real estate agent, but we plan on talking with another mortgage specialist and our local credit union, hopefully tomorrow. 

A friend of ours also has this ORISE fellowship and bought a house with a 30 year fixed rate mortgage this year as well, but their place was a bit cheaper and I'm wondering if this couple had the other person making enough that they could just put one name down on the loan. This makes it all the more confusing :/

personalfinance,"My credit score is standing still, what do I do now?","Hey, I got my first secured credit card 8 months ago. I have a secured card with a balance of $1300 and an unsecured card with a balance of $500. My credit score has been around 680-690 for 5 months now and it doesn't seem to change. I use my cards a good amount and pay them off by the end of the month. I played with the simulators and I just can't seem to figure out how to make my credit score go up other than to wait years for a longer period of 'on time payments'. I was looking into financing a car soon and I'm starting to see the harsh reality of high interest rates. I'm making 95k/year and have over 15k saved up in cash but I can't even get pre approved for a car loan (tried capital ones pre approval). At this point I'm just thinking of saving up the rest in cash instead of getting a loan but I also hear that having a car financed will boost my credit... but it feels redundant to pay a high interest to attempt to boost a credit score which is intended to keep interest rates low.

Anyone have any advice for me? What can I do?",finance

personalfinance,"In Graduate School, Attempting to Budget/Plan","Hi all,

I'm looking for help on planning for the future. I'm in graduate school and in my mid-twenties. I want to make sure I maximize the most of my meager income. I receive a stipend of 23k a year. I work a second job that brings in about 10k a year. However, I live in a high cost of living area and this past year I took a pay cut (from 33k to 14k) for a prestigious fellowship to do research abroad (in addition to helping me complete my PhD faster, it'll also help me land a job after I graduate). 

**Here's a look at my monthly finances:**
Rent: $700
Utilities: $200 (internet, heat, water, electric)
Food: $120 (for groceries, ""eating out"" is my social life budget)
Cell Phone: $60 (3 GB of data plan)
Student Loan Deferment Payment: $200
Expenses for school: $50
Social Life: $100
Netflix: $10
Dental: $25 (Health care is paid for by my program)
Transit: $75 (MBTA pass)

Total: $1440
Income: ~$33,000 (2750)

I spent the last year building my e-fund up from $500 to around $10,000. I'm now trying to figure out what to do moving forward with the ""excess"" money of roughly $1310.

**The debts:**
Credit Cards (note: 0% interest rate until December 2018): $1000
Student Loans (note: I made a dumb decision going to my local state school thinking it was the cheapest option. I cannot change this now):
Loan 1: SallieMae, 14k @ 8.25%
Loan 2: SallieMae, 15k @ 9%
Loan 3: SallieMae, 22k @ 9%
Loan 4: Gov't, Unsub., 5k @ 4%
Loan 5: Gov't, Unsub., 7k @ 4.5%
Loan 6: Gov't, Sub., 7k @ 4%

Total debt: ~70k

Final note: I'll be living on my reduced salary until September, at which point I begin teaching again and will be getting my full salary plus my wages from my part-time job.

**My plan, which I'd like critiqued:**
I figured in September I'd take money from my e-fund, since it is also 12 months of expenses, and pay off my credit card debt. 

With this sorted, I will turn to the ""left over"" amount after all bills: $1310. $1000 would go towards my loans, targeting the 15k @ 9%. Why? I have to pay a deferral fee while in school on all three private loans. For this one, the cost is about $150. I figured if I target this one and pay it off, I could then put that $150 towards another loan.

Once I get that first loan paid off, I figured I'd tackle the 22K loan, then the 14k loan. The federal loans are smaller, but I also receive more protections as a debtor from the federal gov't than from SalleMae, so I figured I'd hold off on paying those. 

I also planned that any additional money I receive, such as from teaching summer courses or from a tax refund, will go towards my loans. 

After paying towards my loans, I thought $310 could go either towards rebuilding the e-fund or to a retirement plan (Roth IRA, I think, would be best?). However, according to the PF flow chart, I'm not sure if I should start retirement planning, since I have the debts. 

When I graduate in three years, I'll make around 50k-90k, depending on what job I get and where it is. (Some may ponder: why the wide gap? If I get the job I'm hoping for, I will most likely make 70-90k; however, it is unlikely, given the job market, that that will happen. I've planned for this and have found that my back up career choice would pay around 45-60k. As I have a lot of experience in that field, I should be able to get to the upper end of the pay scale with my experience). I'm hoping I'll be able to tackle the debt with what I make as I can certainly continue to live on this budget if it means I get out of debt before I'm 65...

So yes, please offer critiques on my plan. I understand I was a fool for going to college, but I cannot change that so I'm trying to figure out how to pay off that mistake and prepare for my future.",finance

I did my taxes a few days before they were due and found out I owed $2,500. Living in an expensive city, that was everything I had saved.

Now I'm trying to figure out if I need to pay quarterly taxes because I didn't know those existed until last week and the first deadline has already passed. I'm currently job searching and am feeling really overwhelmed. 


I used Turbo Tax and it looks like they tell you if you need to based on your return and they didn't tell me, but I want to be sure.

Edit:

""To avoid penalties, it's essential that you determine whether or not you must pay estimated taxes each quarter. In general, individuals who expect to owe less than $1,000 in taxes, after subtracting federal income tax, are exempt from making quarterly payments.”

&gt; **Edwards Lifesciences** – The company came in 11 cents a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.22 per share. The medical product's maker's revenue was below forecasts and it also issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter. The revenue miss was driven by lower than expected sales for the company's transcatheter heart valves.

personalfinance,Anyone direct deposit into a savings account?,"I've always wished for a single account that combined the functionality of checking with the interest rate of savings into a single account. Since that doesn't really appear possible anywhere, are there any banks that let you direct deposit paychecks into savings and then **automatically** pull funds into checking to cover withdrawls from checking?

The closest I can find to this setup is Fidelity - direct deposit into the brokerage (core position SPAXX, 1.25% interest), set up the cash management account (checking) to have $1 and pull money from the brokerage when debits occur. Since it's a brokerage account there's no 6 transactions per month limit.

Schwab lets you set something up similar, but the core position on the brokerage doesn't earn much interest.",finance

personalfinance,"Victim of reoccurring monthly credit charge, now vendor is sending bills. need help.","This happened to a family member of mine and will try to give details as best I can.  

60yr old female with a business credit card had a fraudulent charge from a monthly subscription to some popular acne cream.  She never received any product, contacted her local bank through which the CC is issued from and they process the fraud, create a new account number.  

Next month the charge comes through again.  She contacts bank, starts getting the run-around and they file a chargeback.  Third month comes around, new charge from the acne cream vendor comes through and here is where it gets odd.  One of the prior chargebacks is  credited but another is reversed stating she made the purchase.  She calls the bank and is getting nowhere, since its a business account its handle by this one person, who seems a bit flaky, unavailable.  This has been going on for 5 months, every month new charge, chargeback every month with varying results.  

I recommend at this point the bank is failing her as a customer , file a CFPB to have all charges credited to her account, and then close the account completely with the bank. This has not been done yet but will start the CFPB today.  

Concerning the vendor, they have sent her two bills, likely for the chargebacks.  She called them directly, stated they would stop the new charges, but could not give out details about where the products where actually being sent to.  Appears there are two addresses on their account for her, neither are her actual address.  I'm still wary at this point if they will continue to charge her, and also how should the pending bills be handled.  Is a written letter to them disputing their bill charges sufficient or is there another agency/complaint form we should fill out for that.  Since much of this crosses state lines, is there any federal agency we can get involved to dispute those fraudulent charges.

personalfinance,Car Accident Compensation: Pay off credit card or car loan?,"Question is pretty simple, but I'll elaborate:

Recently got into a car accident, other drivers fault, my vehicle totaled. Expected to net ~$10k compensation for vehicle. Balance of my car loan is $5k, interest rate of 4%.

I also have $10k on an AmEx, with an APR of 15%.

To me it makes the most sense to take my $10k accident compensation, pay off the AmEx, continue paying the existing loan, and get another vehicle with a similar loan condition ($10k @ 3-4%).

It seems like I would save A LOT more money on interest going this route, but I've never dealt with this before so I'm not sure if there's any downsides or reasons not to go this route. Also not sure if the bank cares that the vehicle I'm paying on is essentially worthless now. Another similar option would be to pay off my remaining car loan of $5k, pay down the AmEx $5k, and get a new car loan with no down payment.

Any thoughts or advice on this is much appreciated, there's always helpful info in this sub. Thanks for your time!",finance

My real question is, what are the negatives you might not know about when going through with a debt consolidation loan. Also, are there any other alternatives worth looking into? I just am very inexperienced here, and don't want to act hastily and regret my decision. Thank you r/pf!

personalfinance,"I owe $3,920 for a car I no longer have due to Hurricane Harvey and it was Ally's fault!","My car got flooded out by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. I had a 2013 Hyundai Elantra. I financed it through Ally with a 10% interest rate (I bought it 2 days after my 18th birthday and I had little to no credit history). In all, I owed $13,383 for the car initially when I purchased it and I was paying $248 a month for 72 months. I had the car for a year before it got flooded, so here is where the problems began. When my car flooded out I made a claim through Statefarm and a few days later Statefarm contacted me and called Ally and we were all on a conference call together. Statefarm asked the Ally representative what was the loan pay off amount and the Ally representative stated it was $6,455.96 and Statefarm had already valued my car at $9,643, so they sent me a check for the difference ($3,188), in which I used to buy a cash car because I hate car notes. I also had gap insurance and an extended warranty on my car, so I'm under the impression everything is all fine, dandy, and taken care of. I get a phone call a few days later and Ally is requesting $3,920 from me and come to find out the Ally representative quoted us the wrong loan payoff amount.

personalfinance,When is a good time to get a second credit card?,"Hello everyone, longtime lurker here and finally decided to take the plunge with something I have been thinking about lately.

Over the past 3 or so years I have been carefully cultivating my credit, building it up from nothing to where it is currently sitting at the mid-780s. I have primarily been using a secured credit card through my bank (which has since become unsecured). I have kept the line of credit rather low (~$2000) and use somewhere between 15-25% of that limit monthly and pay it off entirely. Additionally I have a high credit limit card that I share with my parents for emergencies only and it stays at about 10% utilization (It shows up on my credit). I will be coming off this shared card in the next year-ish, so I am starting to plan ahead for that.

While I know they are an easy trap to fall into because of their outlandishly high interest rates, I was looking at some kind of card with a rewards system attached to it, either cash back or something else that I could use in much the same way as my other card which doesn't have any kind of rewards associated with it. My goal is to continue to cultivate my credit, but do so in a way that both expands my credit history and perhaps rewards me somehow.

Edit: also, does anyone have any particular suggestions on rewards cards.",finance

personalfinance,Receiving sudden windfall. Eliminate debt or build Emergency Fund?,"Hello all,

I am receiving a sudden windfall of $5k in the next few days.  I'm curious to know what you think I should do with the money.  Some background:

- $75k salary
- $6k credit card debt (19.49% interest rate)
- &lt;$1k student loan debt
- $960 monthly expenses
- No emergency fund
- Contributing 4% of net pay into 401(k) with employer match

&amp;nbsp;

Based on the wiki flowchart I have a few choices between eliminating the credit card debt almost completely, create an emergency fund, or invest the money.  What would you do? Would you use the full amount on the card debt? Would you save $1000 as suggested by Dave Ramsay and put the rest on the card? My thought is to eliminate the credit card and save what would amount to $2,300 in interest savings and use the payments I would normally make to build the e-fund.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: I decided to put $4k directly on the credit card and $1k into a savings account for immediate emergencies and up my payments to be clear of the debt before the end of the summer.  Thanks to all for the advice.",finance

I have 2 interest free credit card purchases I just paid off.

I have a pretty good credit score, I know credit karma isn't 100% accurate but it says 750+

When I was a kid my parents put money away for me to have to use for college. It is some wierd account where if I use the money for school it doesn't count as income, but if I take the money it counts as income for that year and I pay a tax on it. I don't know exactly what it is but I feel like it's around 10% plus if I took enough it could increase my taxable income at the end of the year so I don't know how that works.
This account fluctuates as it is based on stocks I think, last I saw the value it was 35-40k.

My only debt is my car I am paying off I owe just under 11k on it now with a very good interest rate (2%) thanks to a local credit union.

I currently have about 8k in my savings account. I was hoping to build this to about 10k which I guess I never really thought beyond that. I feel like 10k is a good reserve so after that I am not sure what to do with excess savings other than put them in that account. 

So my goals are to pay off my car but I'm not sure how much of my savings I should use to pay it off versus how much to keep as savings, and with my income increasing soon I need to be prepared with what to do with it.

CryptoCurrency,Pikciochain Secretly Banned USA Participants From Bounty Four Months After It Ended,"TL/DR: Despite no mention anywhere, Pikciochain refused to pay bounty payments for USA participants, four months after bounty ended. Deceptive practices from unregulated ICOs prevent crypto going from mainstream.

I spent a lot of time working on the Pikciochain bounty in November and December 2017. I maybe put in 20 hours. At the end of the bounty, I was given a number of tokens that I would receive. Great, promised payment for services rendered.


Since the bounty ended, the ICO was extended at least twice. Originally an ETH token, I was told in January to urgently add a NEO address (as they switched) to get distribution in January. After which, distribution did not come.


**Today, I find out distribution is coming, but KYC is required by April 30th or else.** Fine with me. I sign up on Pikciochain.com, type in name, country, etc. Next page, I’m asked to submit my documents – drivers license or passport, cheesy selfie with it. Done. Next page is disqualification for being a USA resident.


I get on Telegram to ask questions. After a few indirect responses and a few more questions, they confirm that USA residents are now disqualified from bounties. Over four months after the bounty ended. After, I got banned from the Pikciochain Bounty telegram and the Pikciochain telegram (which I haven’t posted to in maybe 3 months)

No mention on Pikciochain website about USA residents.


Instead of solely complaining, I have some lessons learned that I hope they would adopt but hopefully future ICOs can adopt:


*  Be upfront with country restrictions for a bounty - or even for a crowdsale. Pikciochain also refuses USA for crowdsale, but does not mention it anywere (I understand we are in a constantly changing regulatory environment, so this is a little hard)

*  Don't advertise offices in locations where you refuse to do business - Pikciochain claims to have a Boston office in their whitepaper (per whitepaper: Pikcio AG is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland with offices in Paris, Brussels and Boston (USA).)

*  Put notice of restrictions on bitcointalk or website - never done by Pikciochain

*  Announce material changes to policy

*  Keep the bounty pending for residents of areas that are currently restricted. Allow them to get tokens if the areas are opened up eventually - This is not possible for Pikciochain because the end of April deadline to do KYC will be missed by USA residents (since they cannot KYC right now)

* DO  NOT ask for me to send in my passport/ID and selfie (or any NPI) AFTER I submitted my country, to which after submitting my documents I received an auto disqualification message - this is just stupid and now Pikcio has my NPI

In addition to advertising a Boston office in the whitepaper, the terms and service state that they are domiciled in California and use California law. Why refuse to do business with USA residents then?

&gt;This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without reference to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. For any disputes relating to the interpretation, execution or enforcement of this Agreement or arising from the dealings between Provider, Customer and any third parties under this Agreement shall be dealt with under the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of California, sitting in San Francisco County, or the United States Federal Court for the District of California, and the parties irrevocably submit for all purposes to the jurisdiction of each such court.

Lastly, their registration page [here](https://pikciochain.com/en/accounts/signup/) states the following restricts New York and no other states.

personalfinance,Deferring Student Loans to kill PMI?,"Hi so I am going to be starting my Master's in CS in august part time. This means my Earnest student loans in the amount of 62k (5.78% interest) are possibly eligible for deferment. 


I am also closing on a studio next month using a DC Down payment assistance program so I have a mortgage for 233k (5.725% interest) which has PMI of $105. I am at 98% LTV on house because I financed some closing costs into loan. I also have a mortgage credit certificate that gives my back 20% my interest and PMI as federal tax credit so effectively the loan is 4.725% with $84 PMI.


My question is should I defer the loan and place the $450 minimum student loan payment towards my mortgage. By my estimates, it would take about 4-4.5 years of extra payments to get to 80% LTV to remove PMI. It is a studio so I plan on possibly upgrading in 5-6 years since several  ""deadlines"" pass at that time (work requirement for my grad school funding 5 years, work requirement for my federal loan repayment bonus 6 years, Dc assistance time owning requirement 5 years, I expect to be married for a year or 2 then unless current relationship sinks). This upgrade isn't set in stone but in my mind 5-6 years is when I like to plan to allow myself some mobility. So if I was sure I was living there longer  I know removing PMI would be the best thing but at this time frame I am not sure.  There is also the strong possibility that my gf moves in a year and pays me $1000 in rent which I would place into the mortgage making defer until PMI is gone definitely the be option. However. I don't want to count money before I have it.  

Any advice which to do? 

TLDR Defer student loans to try and remove PMI from condo I plan on living in for 5-6 years


Edit : Want someone to double check my math. Deferring costs the interest on the payments at a rate equal to Student loan interest - effective mortgage interest so 1.5 % estimate. I can track it as a sort of negative investment, use a regular investment calculator and then subtract my contributions back out at the end. So at 1.5% with 5 years of growth and 435 dollars monthly contributions. I get a lose of about $1000 so basically if I get a year off of PMI I come out ahead.  Right?",finance

After going through all the normal identity checks the bank manager said they have two new questions they need to ask all customers that the Federal government is requiring:

1.  Are you involved in the sale or purchase of marijuana and will this account be used for funds related to that purpose?
2.  Are you involved with cryptocurrency and will this account be used funds related for that purpose? 

The manager apologized and said they were new and that she understood the pot issue since they have been dealing with that, but she didn't really know what cryptocurrencies are or why they need to ask about them.  She had to check boxes on the new account paperwork, they are not just verbal.

personalfinance,What to do with a broken car now that I have a newer car?,"My 2002 VW Passat with 200k miles on it had the fuel pump fail and I was sick and tired of fixing it, so I went out and got a newer car.  The dealership was only offering $350 for the Passat so I kept it thinking I might fix it one day.  Now it's been sitting in my garage for 6 months.  Honestly, I wouldn't even feel right fixing the car myself and selling it on because it does not reverse and has other safety issues (air bags, emissions, could possibly stall).  If I donate to charity they will take it off me for free, but I don't think I will benefit at all because I can't itemize deductions.  I found a website that offered to pick it up and pay me $10.  A really crazy guy at work offed to fix it for me and split the sale price, but he will probably just hang out at my house and annoy the shit out of me.  What should I do?

personalfinance,"23 y/o Car loan and Student loans. I'm making payments just fine. I want to get more aggressive, Dave Ramsey Style, and need help with the Car Loan.","**Car Loan**

*Remaining: $10,705 at 5.67% (Highest interest rate)*

Just start hitting this one aggressively, and I started to regret making this purchase especially because I cashed in a handful of bonds to make the down payment. Now this car is a 2016 Hyundai Sonata, it is very reliable and all around great to drive, but if I really want to start knocking out these student loans in my mind it makes sense to sell this car. KBB has this car selling privately on average at about $12,879, and the car I was looking at getting is a 2000 Buick Park Avenue with 106,000 miles (Grandpa car of the month). I found one selling in my area for $3,995, and KBB has it selling commercially on average at $2,678.

In my head, I'm like holy crap if I can manage to sell my car at the KBB value privately and talk the dealership down to the KBB. I can pretty much come out the other end with little to no car loan! Fantastic! But part of me is nervous about running into car troubles with an older car (Which is the original problem I ran away from when I got the Sonata) because sometimes I need to make long distance drives with it (700 miles roughly 1-2 times/yr). Also, biting the bullet that my bonds will have went to waste is eating me up. What do y'all think about this? I have a feeling Dave Ramsey would have the Sonata on Craigslist yesterday.

**Student Loans**

*Remaining: $31,998.00 ranging from 3.51% - 4.41%*

*About $3,600 at 5.00%*

*and a Parent Plus Loan that my parent's are refusing to tell me how much is owed and are insistent that they pay it back, but they have said that it's no more than like $60/month (sketchy I know)*


**Edit:** 

2016 Hyundai Sonata has about 62k miles, and I think it's just out of warranty

personalfinance,Sanity check on loan for dental work.,"I recently had a consultation with a dentist for some work I need done. I broke an adult tooth as a child and had it bonded. As a teen it got infected, so I had a root canal. I put stupidly put off going to the dentist during college due to tight finances and dentist anxiety. Fast forward to today I've graduated and have a good job but I discovered that the area between the broken tooth and the one next to it (#9 and #10 for the dentally inclined) is infected again and splitting at the root. Dentist is recommending two implants to replace the affected teeth. I also need a filling and my wisdom teeth removed. All told after insurance it comes out to $7,400 for me. As someone who has worked for less than one year after being a broke paycheck to paycheck student I don't have that kind of money, so I'm exploring payment options.

* Dental office plan #1. I pay a down payment of $2,219 (not bank breaking, but would about wipe out the emergency funds I've managed to save) and have a loan for the remaining amount plus a 15% ""administration fee,"" totaling $6,287 to be repaid over 48 months (~$131/month). Total cost of treatment: $8,506.

* Dental office plan #2. I get a loan of $5,300 at a 25% interest rate and pay the rest out of pocket. The loan is repaid over 60, 48, 36, or 24 months. No penalties for early repayment. I could conceivably have this paid off in 18 months, for a total loan cost of $6410, more with slower repayment. Total best-case cost of treatment: $8,510.

* Private loan. I get a $7k loan from my bank and pay the last $400 cash. My credit is OK, not amazing. They offered me a 14% interest rate over two years, for a total loan cost of $8,066, worst case scenario. I can make larger payments than the minimum.

The best option is the private loan with aggressive repayment correct?

From what I can tell, implants don't really get much cheaper than this, even if you go to a dental school or Mexico. The opportunity cost of having to take 2-3 trips to Mexico isn't worth it to me for a couple thousand dollars, considering I'd have to take a couple weeks of PTO throughout the year and as an entry level employee I don't get a whole lot. I haven't run any numbers but it might not even be cheaper after multiple hotels stays and flights over the months.

As a side note, go to the damn dentist, even if you're broke and/or anxious about it. This could probably have been mitigated for much cheaper years ago without having to lose my teeth.",finance
personalfinance,I'm supposed to be getting a 20-year loan but it looks like a 5-year in the paperwork. Am I reading this right? (US),"I'm about to close on a property and was looking over the loan documents.  Here are highlights of the only bits referencing payment:

&gt; Borrower will pay this loan in full immediately upon Lender's demand.  If no demand is made, Borrow will pay this loan in 59 regular payments of $848.32 each and one irregular last payment estimated at $102,442.64.  Borrower's first payment is due May 20, 2018 and all subsequent payments are due on the same day of each month after that.  Borrower's final payment will be due on April 20, 2023, and will be for all principal and all acrued interest not yet paid.

...

&gt; The interest rate on the Note is 5.750% per annum based on a year of 360 days.  Payments on the Note are to be made in accordance with the following payment schedule:  in 59 regular payments of $848.32 each and one irregular last payment estimated at $102,442.64.  Grantor's first payment is due May 20, 2018, and all subsequent payments are due on the same day of each month after that.  Grantor's final payment will be due on April 20, 2023, and will be for all principal and all accrued interest not yet paid.  Payments include principal and interest.

...

&gt; This is a Fixed Rate (5.750%) Nondisclosable Loan to an Individual for $120,000.00 due on April 20, 2023.

So this to me sounds like a 5 year loan, but for some reason at a 20-year payment rate for 5 years before paying off the balance in one lump sum.  Is this some weird way of handling a 20-year loan?  Like are we expected to ""extend"" every 5 years or something?  Or is this a mistake?  I was expecting a 20-year loan at 5.750% interest with payments around $848/month.   I can't find any references to extending or 20 years.  All the loan end dates are listed as 2023.",finance

It's bizarre seeing such an uninformed viewpoint coming from someone with executive level ties to the financial industry. Even the CEO of JP Morgan had the balls to pull a 180 on his FUD and eventually proclaim: “I regret making comments saying Bitcoin is a fraud. The blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that, ” said Dimon.

Fallacy #1: Talking about cryptocurrency as if it operates in a vacuum. He makes all of these negative comments about cryptocurrency without drawing any comparisons whatsoever to the limitations of traditional currency. No mention of runaway inflation, predatory lending techniques, counterfeitability, escalating federal debt, the catastrophies of the Federal Reserve, limited security, or any of the other problems that are rife in fiat. People can find all the issues they want with cryptocurrency, but those criticisms only matter insofar as whether or not such criticisms make crypto an inferior option to fiat. Furthermore, crypto upgrades and revamps itself on a daily basis. When was the last time we saw any major improvements occurring in traditional finance? It's near impossible to make major upgrades to fiat currencies or stock markets without it taking years or decades to implement.

Fallacy #2: YOU WORK FOR A FUCKING DOLLAR BASED BUSINESS, BILL. Your entire income stream depends 100% on the success of the dollar. This means that you have fundamental cognitive biases based upon the success of the traditional system which are well established by psychological research, because if cryptocurrency proves to be vastly more efficient than all of the bullshit that your financial company or Paypal has been building for decades, then you're fucked. This means your ability to reason objectively on this matter is literally fucking nonexistent. I'd trust your judgment of cryptocurrency about as much as I'd trust an oil executive's read of solar technology. You're making yourself look like an utter fool as a billionaire. You should have kept your damn mouth shut, but instead you decided to make a shot across the bow at a technology you sound like you've spent about 3 hours and a Youtube video researching. This is seriously like VHS stakeholders shittalking DVD tech right before DVD comes and takes the whole damn market.

Fallacy #3: Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin. No mention in any depth of anything other than Bitcoin, and even the information he gives on that is half-assed. Dear Bill, do you know that IBM is partnered up with Maersk (largest shipping company on the planet) to use their Hyperledger fabric alongside Stellar Lumens to incorporate blockchain into the global supply chain? Do you know that Amazon just released developer tools for Ethereum and Hyperledger fabric? Do you know that Stellar Lumens is virtually feeless and instantaneous, and can process thousands of transactions per second? Do you know that IBM has literally developed a pinhead sized solar powered computer that it will be using to place on products being shipped for blockchain-driven tracking purposes and to carry information? That's just one cryptocurrency. How the fuck do you think the realistic transaction volume for thousands of these currencies compares to the traditional financial products that your investment firm is holding, or the glorious fucking Paypal that you were ousted from? 

Bill, if you don't see the inherent value in secure, crowd-verified, fixed supply currencies that can be processed at a collective rate of hundreds of thousands or millions of transactions per second, then it's because your brain doesn't work very well, not because crypto is a scam. Currency, clearly, doesn't need to have an explicit value, as fiat has proven for hundreds of years. Even if that weren't the case, most cryptos are reflection of computing resources. Processing power and storage space being two current prevalent examples. There's also now cryptos which use the inherent value in location data to create value. So the notion that cryptocurrency categorically has no explicit value is simply false on a very objective level. It's the same thing as saying that Amazon's Web Services computing platforms have no value. There's absolutely no logic whatsoever to the statement. 

Furthermore, going back to Fallacy #1, we have to consider the opportunity cost. The opportunity cost is traditional bank data centers and stock markets processing all of these transactions instead. The cost requirements for those functions are astronomical, Bill, as you should realize as someone who runs a capital investment company. Pull your head out of your ass and learn how to do some genuine analysis of financial fundamentals. It's pathetic to watch a high class person well into adulthood flounder around with technical ideas that are highly relevant to their own business, whilst still having some baseless overconfidence on the matter. What an absolute joke.

I'm tired of this horseshit. I'm tired of rich dumbasses who get full of themselves because they had one streak of success, and then pretend that because they have a lot of money it means that every garbage idea that floats through their head is gospel. A lot of it probably boils down to overcompensation for extensive insecurities that these people never had the courage to genuinely address. I see it a lot in his generation...people who have pretty lackluster emotional maturity, but have dealt with that fact instead by achieving extreme practical success, somehow in spite of the fact that sometimes their reasoning ability is compromised. So now, their incompetence ends up infecting huge portions of our culture, due to their overblown ego clouding their ability to make informed decisions. It's fucking embarrassing to the entire tech community and to educated adults everywhere. How the hell is this jackass a billionaire? Dipshits like this belong in low level IT jobs, not running fucking Paypal or a major financial company. I guess at least he was ousted from Paypal recently, but he's still running a major investment company with this type of arrogant and unexamined mindset on significant and emerging financial technologies. It just illustrates very clearly that Bill Harris has a toxic relationship with information. He doesn't think like an objectively reasoning person with self-doubt. Yet somehow these are the types of people that make it to the top.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"My high school finance class had a ""reality fair"" today to show us how much stuff actually costs, but I felt like some of it was not at all realistic.","Basically, it was set up so that we were given a job right out of college and we had to balance a budget along with paying for things like rent, student loans etc. 

I chose to be a plumber from a list of given jobs, mostly due to the fact the associates degree was from the same local trade school I actually plan on attending and the salary is very close to the field I'm actually interested in. 

Yearly Salary: $46,270
Monthly Gross Salary: $3,885.83
Monthly Net Salary: $2,580.71

The Net was calculated based on things we were given, like how much would be taken out for social security, federal taxes, health insurance, etc. From then, we had to select all the different things that would be included in a budget and basically balance the budget. 

Savings (10% of Gross): $385.58
Rent for a one bedroom one bathroom apt: $800
Utilities: $150
Renters Insurance: $10
Auto Loan Payment on a used sedan: $225
Auto Insurance: $50
Gas/Maintenance: $80
Food (groceries and eating out once a week option): $300
Clothing (casual, jeans, shirts, etc): $100
Wellness (haircut and gym membership): $20
""Night Life"" (Described as getting one cup of coffee week and one movie): $30
Internet: $100
Furniture: $160
Cell Phone: $115
Student Loan (Tuition totals $8,000 with a 2.5% interest rate over 60 months): $141.98

Total comes to $2,667.56, which overall sounds reasonable, but certain aspects of this sound completely off. I can't imagine why I'm paying $100 a month to buy clothes if I'm a plumber. I myself am not a very socially active person, so $30 sounds reasonable for my social life, but some people might argue that I would need a lot more. $300 for groceries for one and 4 nights out a month seems a little steep to me. Don't know why the hell I would be paying 160 dollars a month for furniture if this is my first job and first apartment, same for things like internet or phone bill. Gas seems way to low, should probably be at least $100 if not a little more. 

The point I'm trying to get at here is that I'm not really sure how realistic any of these numbers are, as to me they all seem slightly off the mark. I'm just looking for some opinions on whether or not I can actually look at this budget in regards to whether or not it's accurate, as this would be right around the ballpark of what I would be making and doing myself.",finance

personalfinance,Bay Area real estate is making me anxious and I’m not sure what to do next. Should I sell?,"Hey everyone,

I bought a house about 2 years ago in the East Bay because I grew up here and I know I don’t want to leave the area. I (single) managed to save up 20% down and bought a home that was about 4x my income - well within my budget. I played it very conservatively and now it’s giving me second thoughts. 

I like my house and don’t regret buying, however, it is very much a starter home (850sf) — and while it’s fine while I’m single, I know I’ll outgrow it in the future. I also don’t like how car-dependent it is.  

My income has gone up a decent amount since then and now my mortgage is only ~2.2x my income, and my house has appreciated greatly (30% in 2 years!). Sounds great except that I know I don’t want to keep this house forever and fear that homes I do want long term will become out of reach (They’ve also gone up 30%). 

Would you consider trading up so soon if you were in my situation? As interest rates and home values (and the taxes that come with it) climb I feel like I’m going to get stuck.",finance
personalfinance,Need help understanding tax consequences of ESPP sale,"I was enrolled in ESPP for my company for a few years, and then I unenrolled about 10 years ago.  I just recently sold all the stock that was remaining in this account.  I figured it was all long-term capital gains as it was so old.  On my statement I read this:

""Your reported sales transactions include one or more sales of shares you acquired through an
equity compensation plan that are ""disqualified dispositions"" for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, which may give rise to ordinary income instead of or in addition to capital gain or loss.
This sale may cause you to cease to qualify for favorable tax treatment of your grant. Consult
your grant agreement and your tax advisor for the rules applicable to your grant.""

The shares were all very old.  In thinking through this, I am assuming that the dividend proceeds were used to buy more stock.  These, while very small, would have been short term.  If that is the case, in that I sold it all, will I be taxed on the entire thing as short term, or only that portion?  My statement lists the total proceeds less the cost basis as ""Long-term Gain.""

personalfinance,I’ve made a stupid rookie mistake,"I went to a bank yesterday to open a CD for the first time. 
I was prepared but they weren’t. I had to wait three hours for them to do this. I didn’t have lunch. I had to take care of this before I eat because the banks close at 2pm and it was already 12. 
After the first hour I was ready to leave but I stuck it out.
Why? They’re the only bank that offers to open CD’s for you at 1000TTD. Everyone else requires a minimum of like 10K.
I couldn’t return another day because I took a day off to do this as well as a lot of other errands.
By the time I made it to the desk I was beyond hangry. While the girl was talking I was so mad and I just wanted to get something to eat and be done with waiting I messed up. 
I agreed to a 6 month term at 0.4% interest rate. 
I could have easily agreed to a renewable CD with 2000 at 0.2% but I was so mad and hungry and didn’t want to do math I just went with it. 
I was intending for this to be a more short term investment. 
I learned my lesson, don’t worry. Plz don’t yell at me. I should have been better prepared. I’m sharing this so I can somehow own up to it and hold myself accountable. 

I’m now planning to return to this same place and open a CD with 5000 on a monthly basis providing that it auto-renews.

personalfinance,Lowering monthly payments by switching from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate on student loan debt?,"Loan information;
Total private debt: $67,427.23, broken into 4 loans (2- $20,000+ and 2- under $11,000). 3 of the 4 loans have variable interest rates.
This debt is from undergrad. I have paid off one smaller loan of $7,000 in the last year while in school. I am currently paying down the balance every month on one of the smaller loans. Though, I can not continue to pay more as I'm applying to med school and the process is costly. So, I plan on paying only monthly interest and fees, as this is all I can afford during application time.

My interest rates are continuing to increase, sometimes 0.2-0.4% every month, coming to around 1% increases within 3-5 months. The increasing rates are alarming as I am not able to pay off this debt quickly enough. I think I may have come up with a solution to the growing rates... Take out loans at a fixed rate (only if the interest rate is lower than current rates), pay off the loans with variable rates with these ""new"" loans, and then work on paying off the loans with fixed rates. Basically, replace the variable-rate loans with fixed-rate loans. I'll have a little more piece of mind as the economy changes and the life of the loans grows with a fixed-rate rather than a variable-rate. Plus, entry into medical school will mean more debt and more time for the loans to sit and build, as I won't have an income. I've also heard about refinancing the loans into one large loan. Is this something I should consider?

I don't want to make a rash or stupid decision due to the anxiety of seeing the numbers increase. Interest rates increase as the economy increases and decrease when the economy slows. The economy is doing well now, but by the time I get around to paying off these loans (after med school) the economy may dip and my rates than dip too. 

Is this crazy? Should I just keep the variable rates? Has anyone ever tried to do something like this replacement or refinancing?",finance

Whenever I see people throwing around their target numbers, I often wonder if that is pre or post tax?  Due to current tax code, it seems that you would be able to spend a fairly large amount yearly and pay little to no taxes on it (state depending).  

&amp;nbsp;

For ease of calculation and understanding, I have made a lot of assumptions and simplifications of the portfolio and tax treatment.  I am not an accountant or tax lawyer, so take the math with a grain of salt (and please point out any incorrect assumptions/calculations).  I did not take into account Roth Rollovers, tax-lost harvesting, qualified vs. non-qualified dividends, selling least depreciated shares first, child tax-credit, mortgage interest deduction, etc.  These would all further improve tax efficiency.

__Assumptions:__

- Two adults, no children, MFJ
- For simplicity, living in a state with no cap-gains/dividends tax
- Portfolio: $2,000,000.  

          a) 50% Tax-deferred, 50% Taxable

          b) Tax-deferred is 50% 401k and 50% Roth IRA

          c) Portfolio is comprised of 50% gains, 50% principle

          d) Asset Allocation: 75% Stock, 25% Bond

          e) Asset Location: Taxable is 100% stock, 401k and IRA are 50% Stock and 50% Bond

- Spending down taxable accounts first, then 401k, then Roth IRA
- Taking Social Security at 70

&amp;nbsp;

__Scenario 1:__

- Age 45-60, spending from taxable account
- Gross ""Income"": $80,000

          a) Dividends: $25,000 (2.5% on $1mil in taxable accounts)

          b) Return of Principle: $40,000 (from brokerage)

          c) Capital Gains: $15,000

- Taxable Income: $40,000 ($16,000, less standard deduction)
- No taxes on principle, within 15% bracket, no taxes on capital gains
- Federal Taxes Owed: $0

&amp;nbsp;

__Scenario 2:__

- Age 60-70, spending from 401k and Roth IRA
- Gross ""Income"": $80,000

          a) Ordinary Income (from 401k): $60,000

          b) Tax Free Income (from Roth IRA): $20,000

- Taxable Income: $60,000 ($36,000, less standard deduction)
- Federal Taxes Owed: $4,000 (5% gross rate)

&amp;nbsp;

__Scenario 3:__

- Age 70+, spending from Social Security and Roth IRA
- Gross ""Income"": $80,000

          a) Social Secruity (combined benefit): $50,000

          b) Tax Free Income (from Roth IRA): $30,000

- Taxable Income: $50,000* ($26,000, less standard deduction)
- Federal Taxes Owed: $0

&amp;nbsp;

__Observations:__

- When it comes to taxes, asset location (and subsequently, draw down strategies) is just as important as asset allocation
- The state/country you choose to retire in will have significant impact on your tax liability
- As seen, taxes can be a very small or non-existent line item in your retirement budget, but they still need to be accounted for
- Everyone's tax situation will be different, so be weary of blanket statements and recommendations
- If the standard deduction change remains, most everyone in retirement will not be itemizing unless you have some combination of a very large mortgage, state income tax, medical expenses, and charitable donations

personalfinance,WHY should you do that with $X amount?,"A lot of folks ask a lot of questions in /r/personalfinance on a daily basis about “I inherited $X…”, “We have saved $X…”, “What should I do with $X amount from my tax refund…”.  All these boil down to the same question: “What should I do with $X” or, more basically, “How should I handle my money?”

And the #1 answer is: read [the Prime Directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). The sidebar contains a bunch of valuable links, but probably none as important and oft-referenced as the Prime Directive, a wiki which tells you in step-by-step format (and even has infographic [here](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) and a simpler version [here](https://i.imgur.com/fb7Dtmh.png)!) *exactly* what to do with any amount of money you may have.

Some dispute its effectiveness and why some shouldn’t follow it (emotion, risk tolerance, increased cash flow, etc.), but the fact of the matter is that **following the prime directive in the order listed will generally yield you the most bang for your buck** (read: the least amount in your money paid to other parties / the most amount of your money kept, and the best strategy for earning more money with that money).

While the wiki does a great job of explaining exactly what to do and in which order to do it, there are also some pretty valid reasons as to ***WHY*** you should do it in the order listed (some of which are explained in the wiki and some of which aren’t). I’d like to take a second and elaborate on the ones that make the most sense to me (and hopefully others) below.

-----

***Note: this is by no means an exhaustive list nor a 100% correct one, but just my thoughts on the matter, and I’ll edit it with additional info as/if other comments come in.***

-----

#Question: “Why should I…”

#Step 0: Budget and reduce expenses, set realistic goals

**Answer: to know how best to spend your money, you need to know where your money is going in the first place.** Budgeting allows you to see where you’re spending your money and allows you to see where you can cut back and reallocate funds towards the higher steps listed here for the most efficient use of the funds you have.

#Step 1: Build an emergency fund

**Answer: to ensure real emergencies don't become financial emergencies.** If something unexpected comes your way (job loss, home/car maintenance, unexpected travel, medical emergencies, etc.), you don’t have to worry about what credit-affecting monthly minimum you'll have to forego. You’ll have the financial security of knowing that you have quick access to funds that will allow you to at least pay for your minimum necessities: utilities, rent/mortgage payment, car payment, monthly minimum credit card payments, etc.

#Step 2: (Take advantage of) employer-sponsored matching funds

**Answer: it’s free money.** If you’re lucky enough that your company offers you a retirement savings plan and even more lucky enough that they also match it, you should take full advantage of that match. But, getting to the heart of it, the number one thing I see is folks questioning “Why should I do this before paying down my debt?” Short answer, again: it’s free money. Long answer: whatever the match rate your employer is offering you is a guaranteed return on investment (ROI), and one that’s likely a far better ROI than paying off that 5% car loan, or a 4% mortgage, or even paying down that 15% credit card balance you’re holding. (Note: by paying off a debt amount at X%, that's a guaranteed return on investment of X% on that same amount, so it can be compared to the ROI you would receive elsewhere in other investments.)

For example, as my employer does, if your employer matches 25% of your contributions up to $4000 and you contribute that max of $4000 each year, your employer is simply handing you another $1000 in free money every year. That’s a guaranteed 25% ROI (not to mention the gains that money will have in the market over time), versus with the ROIs just mentioned.

Hell, even if you don't invest a penny of it and/or it's a matching HSA contribution or something similar, it's still likely a higher ROI than if you were using that money to pay down debt that's at a lower interest rate than the match rate.

#Step 3: Pay down high-interest debts

**Answer: because of the stock market.** This is the step that probably makes the least sense to folks and leaves them asking “Why just my high-interest debts?” The long answer: the benefit of paying off low-interest debts (commonly referred to as anything with &lt;=4% interest rate, though I’d personally suggest and use a figure closer to 5-6%) is generally probably not going to outperform the ROI you would get if you put that money in to the stock market which has a historical average return of ~7%.  So, essentially, the money saved by paying off that 3% loan when you could have invested that money at (at least) 7% (and thus yielded a 4% net gain, or 7% - 3%) isn’t the most beneficial choice financially.

However, queue the often-stated disclaimer of “Past performance is no indication of future results.” and to quote the Prime Directive specifically: “While this has been true in the past, keep in mind that paying down a loan is a guaranteed return at the loan's interest rate. Stock performance is anything but guaranteed.” Basically, that means to invest at your own risk: a 7%+ return is no guarantee, which leads some to have some doubts and modify this step to pay off ALL debts prior to investing further, which generally isn't the most financially beneficial thing to do.

#Step 4: Contribute to an IRA
#Step 5: Save more for retirement
#Step 6: Save for other goals

**Answer: again, because of the stock market.** Same as above, the money invested is likely still going to yield a higher ROI than using that same money to pay down low-interest debts. There are far more details as to how and in what exact order you should perform steps 4 and 5 (generally, max out tax-advantaged account before taxable accounts) that I won’t go into here but feel free to read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_5.3A_save_more_for_retirement).

Beyond that (and sort of mixed in with the previous two steps), it’s generally debatable and discretionary as how you should spend: sock it away in an HSA if you have health problems or a growing family, a 529 if you have children that will go to college, pay off the low-interest debt if you have a low risk-tolerance, contribute to taxable investment accounts, sock it away in a high-yield savings account, etc.

financialindependence,Beginning FIRE,"Hey everybody! I've been a reader on this sub for close to a year, and about 6 months ago, I started my journey to FIRE. I see a lot of posts on here about people who have progressed well into FIRE, hit a Net Worth Milestone, or have finally pulled the trigger. And I should see a lot of these posts, as that is the end goal! But I thought I would lay out my plan as someone who is young and just getting started, and then we can all pat me on the back for doing so well, or call me a bundle-of-sticks for being so naive. 

**Background**

I am 22 and recently got my Bachelor degree ('17), and am working in a business role, the details of which are irrelevant. I am engaged to a lovely 22 year old teacher who got her degree in 2016. I am currently in graduate school getting a STEM degree while working full time and should be done either August 2019 or December 2019, depending on my workload. Fiancee is going back for her graduate degree in June, she will continue to work during the program, and she has a more structured program, and she will finish December 2019. We have two incomes and no kids.

**Current Status**

Me

* Retirement Savings: $6,000
* Cash: $3,000
* Assets: $5,000 (Fully paid of car, if that even really counts as an asset)
* Debt: $40,000 (All student loans, for both Bachelors and Graduate degrees)
* **Total Net Worth: -$26,000**


Fiancee

* Retirement Savings: $1,000
* Cash: $3,000
* Assets: $0
* Debt: $3,000 (Her parents paid for school luckily, but she has a car loan)
* **Total Net Worth: $1,000**

So as you can see, we are pretty much starting from the bottom. Fiancee is basically at $0, and I am in the negative from student loans. Luckily we have no other debt other than car and student loans, both of which have fairly low interest rates (and my student loans are deferred until 2020 since I am currently in school).

**Current Income and Savings**

Me

* Income: $45,000
* Savings Rate: 33.7%
* **Annual Savings: $15,175**

Fiancee

* Income: $43,000
* Savings Rate: 12.8%
* **Annual Savings: $5,500**

You may be looking at these saving rates and wonder how I got to them. For my fiancee, it is very simple. For now, we are not married, so her finances are hers, and I don't have (or desire) control of her money. But, I was able to convince her to at least max out her Roth IRA, so she is contributing $5,500 annually. For me, I am maxing out my Roth IRA, plus contributing 5% to employer 401k (with 100% matching), and 10% to employee stock (on which I get a 15% discount). All added up, 33.7% of my annual income ends up in my retirement accounts. 

**Goals**

* Amount: $5 million
* Age: 52
* Withdrawal Rate: 4% ($200k)

Now before you look at these numbers and think that those are high numbers, the way we came about our goals had more to do with her career goals than our joint finances. She loves her job more than anything, and she could probably work forever (and maybe she will!), but at 52 she will receive her full pension which will equate to around $60,000/year when it is all said and done. So we based our plan around the idea that she will retire at 52, but we will be financially independent in the traditional sense around age 40. Here is a road map of our plan with a check-in every 5 years:

**Age 27 Check-in:**

Income and Savings

* Combined Income: $140,000
* Combined Savings Rate: 42.8%
* Combined Annual Savings: $60,000

Net Worth

* Retirement Savings: $330,000
* Assets: $60,000 (home equity)
* Debt: $260,000 ($240,000 mortgage + $20,000 student loans)
* **Net Worth: $130,000**

The three big things to point out in this check-in is the huge increase in income, huge increase in savings rate, and the huge increase in debt. At this point, we will both have graduated with our Masters degrees, and my expected income should be around $85,000, and hers around $55,000. At this point going forward, we will likely receive no more than cost-of-living pay increases, unless I get a large promotion. The savings rate increase is due to our plan to contribute 75% of our post-grad-school pay increase towards savings. We get enough to cover the extra taxes and get a little pay boost ourselves, but almost all of the rest goes towards savings. And you will notice the debt increase is due to a mortgage. We plan on buying a house in the next couple years, and our expected cost will be about $300,000. It is also at this point that we plan on starting our adventure into parenthood.

**Age 32 Check-in:**

Income and Savings

* Combined Income: $150,000
* Combined Savings Rate: 40%
* Combined Annual Savings: $60,000

Net Worth

* Retirement Savings: $865,000
* Assets: $160,000 (home equity)
* Debt: $140,000 (mortgage)
* **Net Worth: $885,000**

Not much has changed at this point, other than the fact that we will have paid off a significant portion of our house. We continue to put away $60,000 a year, and any pay raises or promotions that we get will just be used to offset the cost of kids, and any leftovers (dreaming here) will be ""splurged"" on quality of life upgrades. If everything goes to plan, we will be popping out our last kid right around here. 

**Age 37 Check-in:**

Income and Savings

* Combined Income: $160,000
* Combined Savings Rate: 37.5%
* Combined Annual Savings: $60,000

Net Worth

* Retirement Savings: $1,650,000
* Assets: $320,000 (home equity)
* Debt: $0 (Woo!)
* **Net Worth: $1,950,000**

At this point, we hope to have our house paid off. It might not be quite there, but it should be 80-90% paid off or more at the very least. It should also accumulate some more value as housing costs rise. Our $1 MM mark will hopefully be far behind us, and this is the point where the growth really starts kicking into overdrive. At this point, we could probably both retire and live a good life. And who knows, maybe we will. But if we are still enjoying our careers, I really think we won't be quite ready to give it up yet. 

**Age 42 Check-in:**

Income and Savings

* Combined Income: $100,000
* Combined Savings Rate: 0%
* Combined Annual Savings: $0

Net Worth

* Retirement Savings: $2,807,000
* Assets: $350,000 (home equity)
* Debt: $0 
* **Net Worth: $3,157,000**

Around 40 years old is the point where I think we will first consider a major lifestyle change. I think I will likely move to a part time or freelance role. My income is likely to take a hit, but we should be able to make enough where we can both stop contributing to our savings and maintain all of our spending. This is the point where I think we will officially consider ourselves ""financially independent."" I won't fully retire becuase my wife will likely continue to work full time, so I don't want to retire alone, but we will have the summers off (teacher perks!), and we will probably spend a lot of time traveling. Kids will be 10-15, so they will be a little more independent as well, so we can do a nice combination of family vacations and trips between just the two of us. I don't think we will withdraw anything from the account at this point, and just let it sit and grow. 

**Age 47 Check-in:**

Income and Savings

* Combined Income: $100,000
* Combined Savings Rate: 0%
* Combined Annual Savings: $0

Net Worth

* Retirement Savings: $4,123,000
* Assets: $380,000 (home equity)
* Debt: $0 
* **Net Worth: $4,503,000**

Not much has changed financially. Wife will likely continue to work (assuming she is still loving it), I will continue working however much I want to, and kids will start going off to college. We may withdraw a little bit to help pay for college, but it probably won't amount to a huge change in the overall plan. I may officially retire as well and begin withdrawing 1% or so to supplement our income. But for the sake of plans, I will say that I am still doing freelance consulting or an easy part-time gig. 

**Age 52 Check-in:**

Income and Savings

* Combined Income: $60,000 (pension)
* Combined Savings Rate: 0%
* Combined Annual Savings: $0

Net Worth

* Retirement Savings: $5,058,000
* Assets: $1,400,000 (home equity + island home)
* Debt: $0 
* **Net Worth: $6,458,000**
* Withdrawal Rate: 4%
* **Total Retirement Income: $262,000**

The big day comes, and we call it quits. We get to collect my wife's pension for working 30 years. We buy our second home, a dream of both of ours. A little place on an island in the Caribbean. We figure this will cost around $1,000,000 (give or take a few $100k), which we will be able to pay cash. That leaves us with $262,000 per year, a HUGE amount. This will go towards a boat (island home), maintenance (island home), and traveling. There is a good chance that this will be more than we use, so the nest egg would likely continue to grow. We may also upgrade our main home if we feel necessary, but we will have plenty of money for this, so I'm not too worried about the actual cost. 

At this point we will have made it to the RE part of FIRE, and we will do what we want for (hopefully) the next 50 years or more (here's to advances in health technology).

personalfinance,Are we missing something? Trying to pay debts intelligently.,"Curious if anyone can think of something I didn’t. Or rate the options as I see them…

Bear with me this is a long one.

I’m trying to sort through “next steps” for our family’s finances. It feels like I have taken our family’s finances as far as I can go by myself and I have been trying to find a financial adviser who will be creative, diligent, and extremely knowledgeable. The meetings I have had with CFPs in the area so far are coming up short. I find that I’m the one presenting the ideas I’ve come up with to move our family forward and they often have nothing to add. They are able to give opinions on the ideas I was presenting, but I haven’t gotten anything new out of the sessions. I guess I was hoping to find someone who knew something I didn’t. Maybe reddit will have that someone.

Context Facts:

-Family of 3 (soon to be 4)

-Family makes about $74,000 after taxes per year (give or take). I recently moved diagonally in my job and I expect to make about $85,500 after taxes this year (fingers crossed)

-I work a full time job, spouse stays home with children, both spouse and I work on a data entry side job I secured last year, and I coach high school students to help get a bit more into our coffers each month.

-We have over $200K in student loans. We are currently paying back on an IBR program. They ask us to pay about $450 per month; I am currently paying $1K per month. (This the crux of our problem)

-We have no credit card debt

-We rent

-Good with budgeting, good with keeping to the budget. (i.e. we eat healthy and well for about $60-$80 a week although I budget $100 per week) I go over our family’s finances twice a month to make sure we are on track.

-We don’t buy anything unless it is a true need (i.e. both spouse and I are letting our socks/underwear go to about the four hole minimum before caving and buying new ones).

-We have a 529 set up for both kids

-We have a 401K with an employer match program

-I have moved our extra HSA savings from the previous year to an investment account as we are no longer on our insurance’s HDP.

-We have 5 months’ worth of savings. With Credit Card Limits/Unemployment Benefits we could last a full year before running completely out of money. (it won’t happen, I know I can get work quickly in the career path/location I’m in, at most it would take me 3 months should I lose my job for any reason).



I am holding onto our Tax Refund for the moment. In the past I’ve just poured it into our student loan payments. However, I’m wondering if there’s a better use of that money (and yearend bonus money).

 

Problem:
It’s taken me two years to get our family to this point (in October of 2015 we had $24.75 left  to our name, now we’re in as good a place as we can be, Glory to God). And I really don’t know what’s the next best step.

Clearly the biggest financial problem is our Student Loan Debt. While the IBR Program makes it easy to make “minimum payments” we are still accruing interest at an alarming rate. The monthly payment calculated and requested by the IBR program doesn’t even cover the interest accrued. I was throwing every extra dime we had at the student loan payments, but recently did some math that has caused me to pause. I calculated how much I would have to pay to pay off our loans in the course of different year spans. 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 25. Only the 20 and 25 year calculations made it possible for us to also live while paying off our loans. (which is the full term of the IBR program in the first place) These would allow us to live on 66%/70% of our after taxes pay. Even if I used half of our take home pay to pay off the loans, it would take us 10 years to get anywhere (and all our other accounts would suffer for it).

So here are the ideas that I came up with. I’m curious if anyone else has ideas or how you’d rate the below options.

1.       Keep the course. Pour every dime into student loans, letting go of everything else (including children’s 529, our retirement 401K plan, etc) See where we can go after the 10-20 years it takes to accomplish that and then pour funds into other accounts.
2.       Open an investment account and pour all extra funds into that (while maintaining “minimum IBR Payments for the loans). As the markets will generally beat our student loan interest, maybe we can dissolve our investments at the 8 year mark and pay off the entirety of the loans. (Market rate interest will out pace our student loan interest rate).
3.       Pour funds into savings to buy a house. Put an equity lien on the house, pay off the student loans with that lien. A $200K mortgage with a $200K lien will create a $400K  mortgage payment that will still be less than 10 year student loan payment amount. Plus we wouldn’t have the rent payment on top of that. Means we could likely add nearly $2K to our mortgage payment to pay it off as fast as we can. At the end of it all we’d be debt free and own our own home. (no idea if this plan is feasible but the small amount of research I did makes me think it is). Also this plan would likely require me to travel nearly 2 hours to work and 2 hour back every day as that is the location of homes we could even begin to afford.
4.       Open an investment account. Keep allocating funds into the different pools we have (401K, 529s etc). Pay the minimum IBR required payments and wait for that 20 year time limit to pop up. Under current rules the remainder of the debt would be forgiven at that point (granted it’s taxable, but by then I’d have enough in our savings account to pay off whatever tax bill we incur without issue). It is also always possible that the IBR Program will be revoked by changes in the government, for better or worse. 


Anyone have experience with the above? Anyone have an informed idea as to why/why one will work better than the other? Right now, this tax refund money is just sitting in our account and I want it to be doing something useful. But I’m stalling on what is actually useful…

First time posting here, figured this was an important enough question to ask. 

Some background; I'm 22, in the military, and a college student.

I'm currently bringing in 42k a year at my rank and fairly comfortable income wise. I don't have car payments or any massive debts. I have been renting since 2014 at two separate locations.

I have access to about that amount in equities - some in a Nasdaq-focused mutual fund and the rest in a blue chip tech stock. If you were in my position, would you liquidate the equities or take out debt at ~5-6% interest rate? In other words, do you think the market will grow at a rate greater than the interest rate? Would capital gains taxes make the debt-financed option more attractive?

personalfinance,Buying a Condo,"Hello,

I am a student and will be moving to a smaller city in the next few months. I have around $50K saved and want to use that as a down payment for a $100K condo (mortgage on a 15Y/10Y ends up being cheaper than renting at around 1000/mo).

I will live in the condo for next 4 years, but after that I will be leaving the city and leasing my condo out to other students.

What would the best tax setup be for this? Should I open an LLC now and purchase the condo under the LLC? Can I get a mortgage for the LLC (I know I probably will need a personal guarantee--my credit score is in the upper 700's)? I will be taking out ~200K in Federal Direct Stafford loans.

Not sure if this is the best place to post in so please let me know if there's a better place. (cross posted from /r/accounting)

Oh, also I do want some privacy, hence purchasing under the LLC sooner rather than later.

edit:

I guess another question is should I just pay my first year tuition and rent instead of purchasing? My main concern here is I can afford the down payment and the money I'd take out in loans to pay for mortgage is actually coming back to me (in terms of real estate investment) instead of going to someone else (if I rent).",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Approvals -- Sebonic Financial vs Other Lenders -- Help!,"Currently tearing my hair out trying to figure out what to do.  Need to decide which mortgage company to work with tomorrow.

My wife and I have an offer accepted on a 375K house contingent on the sale of our house.  We will have plenty of equity going over into the second house to cover 20% if we like.  I've decided to put 10% down and either buyout PMI, or finance it, largely because I want to pay off my student loans and because the real estate in my area is really booming and I don't expect PMI to last very long.

We have 800+ credit scores, plenty of income, and very low debt.  

I received an approval from a large well known mortgage company for the following:

ALL ARE 30 YEAR FIXED!!

----------------------

10% down.

4.875% interest

337500 Financed

8500 taxes

2000 HO Insurance

Cost to buyout PMI:  $3,000

Total Payment + Interest + etc = $2636.08

-------------------------

I also applied with Sebonic Financial.  They gave me several options:

10% down

4.24% interest

2.4K in lender fees

337500 financed

8500 taxes

2000 HO insurance

Cost to buyout PMI:  4,800 or 84/month

Total PAyment + Interest + etc = $2526.33 (plus pmi if not bought out)

-------------------------------

Same terms with no lender fees

Interest Rate:  4.375

Total PAyment + Interest + etc = $2551.33(plus pmi if not bought out)

--------------------------------


Same terms with no lender fees and no PMI

Interest Rate:  4.675

Total Payment + Interest + etc = $2601.33

-----------------------------------


I have very good impressions of both lenders, in fact I've been super impressed with the guy from Sebonic.  He's been ultra responsive.  

The catch?  Several people I've spoken to about this who work in the industry are very suspicious of the offer from Sebonic, advising that this rate is well below what someone should be able to offer given they aren't fronting lots of points.

I guess I'm just looking for feedback on Sebonic, or other mortgage companies, or how they can make an offer like that when everyone else is obviously not able to get close.  When I brought the offers I had from Sebonic to my other lender to see if he'd get close to them, he basically said he couldn't do much to get that low and thought they had to be pulling some kind of bait and switch given the current rates.

Bitcoin,"PSA: There are many signs of the world going into the last phase of this economic cycle. Please be prepared, if you have debt I suggest you decrease it.","As the title say.

I strongly believe the world is entering into over-extension when it comes to debt and economic activity, for this cycle at least.

There are many reasons for this, but most importantly lower unemployment rate, and interests sharply increase! Every time interest rates has increased sharply markets (traditional markets) have tanked. 2001 and 2008 are good examples of this.

I am only writing this here because I believe that after a long while thinking, the best position to enter into when this cycle ends, is LONG Bitcoin. I do no longer believe that gold will be the best safe haven asset.

Therefore I urge all members of our community to handle their debt levels right now, so you don't have to dip into your holdings to alleviate the pain when interest rates go up 3-4%-points.

As for myself I will pull around 80% of the money I got in the stock markets the next couple months. And then watch Bitcoin closely awaiting entry. But who am I? You probably shouldn't take your advice from a 21 year old soon to be Econ undergraduate. So do your own research!


TL;DR: Interest rates are looking up, looking at history that is a sign that the economic cycle is about to turn. handle your debts, so as to not lose any coins in the process.

personalfinance,Considering doing PAYE for student loans,"I have massive student loans from law school and undergrad (250k+).  I'm lucky enough to have a well-paying legal job, but, even though I spent last year making 3k/mo. payments on my student loans, it seems that most of that money has been applied to interest. 

I'm thinking it might make more sense financially to sign up for PAYE, which would cut my monthly payments by almost 2/3rds and allow me to put a little bit more away now (I don't spend a lot of money).

I'm pretty financially illiterate, so I just wanted to test the waters here and get people's feedback on whether they think the above is a good idea.  I'm concerned that doing the PAYE might not make sense if I can't invest my savings such that the interest rate on those investments is higher than the rate on my student loans.  On the other hand, I barely dented the loans last year, so I feel like paying more into the loans is just burning money.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.",finance

Bitcoin,What is the best offshore destination for Bitcoin trading?,"You might consider Belize as the of still available options.

Belize's main financial regulatory body - the International Financial Services Commission (IFSC) - has appeared in crypto-news feeds a few times in a past couple of years to warn public about unlawful or suspicious activities of several crypto-companies. That, to say the least, is highly unusual for a state's monetary watchdog. We all have been already a little tired to see multiple presumptuous memorandums and nonsensical declarations issued by world's financial regulators, which right from the first page proclaim Bitcoin with the rest of crypto to be the enemy of humanity.

Against this background IFSC looks as a typical Marvel's guardian of the galaxy, endowed with an ugly face, and manners but of a just soul. Figuratively speaking, Belizean ""Groot"" is going after bad guys one by one as opposed to all-knowing ""Ego's"" indiscriminate slaughter. Matter of fact, compare to most world state finance guardians' quick-meal, flash-bang, shoot-first-ask-later modus operandi, IFSC's case-by-case approach to new digital economy participants may be considered as almost civilized.

Of course, at this early stage of crypto-industry's life most of us would prefer to have either nor regulation at all or a self-regulatory body staffed with crypto-professionals instead of clueless politicians and greedy lawyers. Alas, it's not the direction things are aiming for most of us. Belizean crypto-community may feel proud for itself being able to steer clear of any official regulations for so long. Coupled with IFSC's relative civility that may provide crypto-enthusiasts in Belize with a shadow of hope for a better than average crypto-future.

personalfinance,401k Loan from Parent for Credit Card Debt,"Hello, r/personalfinance. I was approached with an offer from my mother tonight that sounded completely insane. She's been helping my wife and I get through a very rough patch financially due to my wife being out of work. Part of our agreement is that she wants to be involved with our bill-paying. Her thinking is that she's making an investment into our futures by helping us stay afloat when we can't cover our expenses. We agreed to this and we're all just fine with that. All this is to say, she is as involved in our finances as my wife and I, and we've realized lately how bad our situation is.

We have no savings.
We have about 30k in credit card debt.
We make pretty decent money to have kept afloat this far after two auto loans, the mortgage, utilities, phones, etc. but we are struggling to tread water.
We have very large hospital bills which we incurred during our miscarriage and two D&amp;C procedures.


So here is the offer she made us, pending the numbers work out in a way that is feasible for both of us:

She would pull out the funds to cover all of our debts besides the mortgage, cars, and bills like phone and utilities. Many of our cards are behind so we're seeing the penalty interest rates. Paying all these off in one fell swoop would save us on these interest rates. Her 401k would require repayment by automatic payroll deduction, and then we would pay her directly to supplement her income back to where it should be. In theory, it seems like we make out like bandits.

But I'm worried about her losing out on interest money. I don't fully understand how she loses that, because it seems like you pay interest back into the account as you repay? But I keep seeing sites that say you'll be losing out on some interest.

I've been looking for some kind of calculator for this online because I don't understand the math involved. Could anyone help shed some light? Is this a good idea? What potential pitfalls am I probably not considering? How do we do the math to say ok in two years, you'll be back to even like you would've had we not done any of this?",finance

personalfinance,"Selling old house to pay for new house...want to refi for 15 year, but now rates have gone up. Thoughts?","I bought a house in 2008 during the housing crash for $210K, and it looks like the market value is now somewhere around $250K.  The remaining principal on that loan is $125K, so I'm hoping to pull somewhere around $125K out of that home and put it towards the home I just bought (perfect home for my needs and had to jump on it right away before moving out of old house) in December, where the principal on that is $225K.  The mortgage for the new home is a 30 year mortgage at 4.125%, with a $1415 monthly payment including property taxes (~$3200/year) and insurance (~$700/year).  

My plan was to take the money from the old house and refinance my current mortgage into a 15 year, thinking that the lower principal coupled with the lower rate that's given to a 15 year compared to a 30 year would make the payments the same or less than what they currently are (I actually didn't think my old home would be valued as high as it is, so I know have a bit more to play with here).  That was before they raised the interest rates, and now they're no longer as great as they once were...which means I'd likely pay a higher interest rate if I refinanced for a 15 year mortgage than my current 30 year mortgage.

What's the best thing to do here?  Use the money from the old house to pay off a bunch of principal on the current 30yr/4.125% mortgage and continue to make current monthly payments?  Pay extra each month to turn the 30 year into a 15 year via paying extra monthly (tougher to swing given that just leads to a higher monthly payment, but that also means I could spread out that $125K to do so)?  Use money from old house to pay off principal and refinance for a 15 year mortgage at the higher rate (google says it's currently 4.25%, but even with my ~800 credit score, I never seem to get a rate as nice as what I see online)?

I'm very much out of my league here, so I'd appreciate any help that you fine folks can provide.  Thanks in advance.

CryptoCurrency,"My Crypto taxes in Germany - 2017(18), actual status","Ola ppl, 

yesterday I finally had my ""date"" with my official tax accountant from a major German tax union in Hessen. He does all my official tax work and is legally responsible for my tax return. Since I had some trades in 2017 with BTC, (and a lot in this year!), I was looking forward to this meeting to get all my crypto-tax questions cleared. 

The state is as follows:

The German Finanzamt doesn't know how to tax crypto, again. There was a EU judgement (case „Hedqvist“, C-264/14) in 2015 which defines Bitcoin and Crypto as currency and therefore can’t be taxed. This view has also been strengthened by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) in this year (2018) which has the same view on Crypto. This resulted in the ""mess"" that we are in (for us in Crypto in Germany it is great actually) tax regarding.

To sum it up, this was told to me from my Tax-man, for a private person doing private trades: 

1. I dont need to report anything Crypto related. Not my BTC buys, not my binance trades, no airdrops, no mining, no passive income from holding, nothing.

2.  The German Finanzamt simply doesnt care for cryptos now, the volume and tax amounts are insignificant and it is now defined as currency-type again. If you are not dealing with SIGNIFICANT amounts of €-value in Cryptos, nobody will even ask you about anything. If you are dealing whit amounts which raises the questions of the ""Finanzamt"" (hence ""Significant""), it is about money laundering and the likes of. 

3. The  ""Finanzamt"" has, for now, no LEGAL way of requesting/tracking trades on crypto-exchanges (except for cases when they go to court), since exchanges are not official banks/financial institutions, they have no legal authority over them.
In turn, Crypto exchanges have no official/standardized way of reporting taxable trades/buys/etc... like financial institutions have. No one is going to manually track and calculate your trades unless they are said to do it by court (again, example money laundering and such cases)

4. I can and should keep a record of my trades IF the legal situation changes. It is highly unlikely, but you never know.

5. I should never invest more than I can afford, and don’t put everything in Crypto 

Cheers

~~tl;dr: For now, in Germany are NO TAXES to pay on anything crypto related. Cryptos are defined similar to currency and not taxed.~~

EDIT: I see this is blowing up, I will try to directly talk to the ""Finanzamt"" about this since the opinions and experiences range from: "" You are fucked and going to jail"" to ""Great, thats it"".

EDIT 2: German ""Finanzamt"" doesnt give statments regarding procedures, I shall contact a legal tax adviser or preferably a union. You cant make that shit up. Back to square 1, will make a second meeting with a different adviser to check it explicitly on that matter. What a legal swamp....",cryptocurrency

Forex,CAD/JPY: Review &amp; Forecast,"The rates have consolidated due to a lack of stimulus for growth. The deals to BUY seem the most effective with expectations of the trend resumption.

In April we saw a tendency to increase the demand for risky assets amid a decrease in geopolitical tensions. This led to a weakening of the yen, which peviously strengthened due to geopolitical tensions and a possible trade war. The extremely soft monetary policy of the Bank of Japan, which is not going to change the rate until it approaches the target inflation rate, has a negative impact on the yen. The Canadian dollar has received a significant stimulus amid this \- high oil prices and the achievement of long\-term price peaks, as well as stimulus due to the optimal situation in the Canadian economy, which has allowed the Central Bank and its head, Stephen Poloz, to maintain an aggressive monetary policy, unlike his colleague from Japan. According to Stephen Poloz, Canada's economy is recovering from the crisis caused by low oil prices, as evidenced by the achievement of 40\-year lows in unemployment, so the rate will be increasing in Canada if the situation does not change.

Two weeks ago the rates consolidated in the range of 84.32 \- 85.7 JPY. Both currencies for a while couldn't find new incentives to growth. Economic statistics in Japan do not impress investors and do not demonstrate economic growth that would allow the Bank of Japan to change its position on monetary policy. In Canada the situation is better and there are not enough risks for the Canadian economy that would put pressure on the CAD, but the decision of the Bank of Canada last week to leave the rate at the current level could not have a positive impact on the Canadian dollar, although investors expected such a decision and expect the Bank of Canada to raise the rate in July. As a result, volatility has decreased significantly.

personalfinance,College Student facing an upcoming financial dilemma,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I am currently a sophomore year college student facing a financial dilemma.

So currently, I am working at a job where I make $15 an hour. The past year and a half I worked full time, and was able to amass $6k in an employer 401k, $1.2k in a Roth IRA, $5k in a 529 education account (father set it up years ago), and $1.2k in a high yield savings account.

Here is my dilemma: I currently save around 50% of what I make after tax, and project to have around $5k in Savings by the end of the summer (Start of next semester). My retirement accounts will increase by about $1k each as well. My school schedule conflicts directly with my work schedule, and there is a high probability I will have to quit the job, but I will try to do what I can to keep it (20hrs a week max).

Given that I quit, would it be in my best interest to cash out the 401k plan if I leave? After federal and state taxes, minus the penalty, I should get approx $5500 back. My expenses only include car insurance and gas, which total to no more than $350 a month. I figured if I just cashed it out, I would have money to cover my bills for the next 3 years, and even then I'm on track to have a decent paying job out of college (CS internships).

In the case that I don't cash out, however, by the time I retire (47 years approx), the money would be worth north of $150k with a rate of return of 6%, minus inflation cost. That would be valuable money in retirement.

In the case that I don't leave the job, and resume working a forecasted 20hr a week schedule, all my expenses would be covered without worry, and each 6 month period, minus car insurance, my savings would have a net gain of $1k, so $2k a year total in savings gain, and my retirement accounts would also increase, albeit a lot slower than I am used to.

personalfinance,How to prepare financially to care for aging parent?,"Hi everyone, there are some controversial topics I touch on here but keep in mind that they are all part of my life and that I'm asking for objective advice :\) thank you  \(tw for mention of abuse, nothing in detail\)

My mom was violently kicked out by my abusive father last year and she only works part time at a grocery store. She and my father were undocumented for 25 years here in the US and so my mom does not have much of a history of income. Although they filed income taxes every year since they came to the US, she has only been able to legally work in the US for the past 5 years and has since worked mostly part time. My father had enough tax credits to ""retire"" \(he's 63...\) and have social security based on those income taxes. Idk how much he gets a month as I'm not in contact with him for obvious reasons. But I can't imagine it's much because without papers they both worked for below minimum wage jobs and we were homeless a lot. 

She's 60 now and wants to move closer to me \(1,000 miles away from home city\) and wants to be further away from my abusive father. She applied for a transfer to a store closer to me and was approved. She will be paying her own way up and I will likely give her $800 or so to make ends meet the first two months. 

I love my mom so much, she protected us from him a lot and while I struggle to forgive her for staying with him all these years I do understand her situation and I'm so happy she won't be in it anymore. 

TLDR;

I realize that while my mom is very energetic and strong \(honestly she looks 40\) she is aging. With so little SSI and her small 401k \(from working part time these past few years\) I do not want her to live her older years uncomfortably. I think we have a solid 10 years before she's unable to work at all so I think that's enough time to plan.

How can I financially prepare to care for her? I see that long\-term care insurance exists but is that something I should look into? I do plan on moving her in with me in a few more years \(maybe in 6ish years\) but I don't know that I want to buy a house. I figure renting a home would be cheaper upfront, but should I consider buying?

I have about $35,000 left to pay off in federal student loans \(down from 55,000\) but make $80,000/year now. I plan to have this debt paid off within the next 6 or 7 years. I don't have a car and don't own a home, have about $1,200 in credit card debt \(which I'll pay off when I get paid this month\). 

I'm engaged and will be getting married in two or three years and my fiance is very supportive. He is on\-board to having her live with us in a few years. We do want kids so it would help to have her around to help us with that, too. But I'm a planner and I just don't know where to start.

btc,Why Bitcoin Cash is NOT Bitcoin (yet),"Imagine that because of the corruption of the US federal government and it's continual destruction of the Constitution, that Texas decided to secede and strictly follow the original constitution.

However, if over a period of time more and more states decided to secede and join with Texas in following the Constitution to the point that only California and New York haven't done so, then Texas and the other states might get the name ""America"" back.

While we were waiting, I was shown a table showing the relationship between credit score and the interest rate they would offer based on your score. After a few minutes, they came back and stated that my credit score was XXX and that I would have to go with their highest interest rate of 8%...

I forget what the number was that they told me, but it was nothing near what I remember it being (I hadn't checked my score in months and I hadn't brought anything with me showing what my score was).

personalfinance,"New 401k, Bought a Car, and Refinanced Student Loans This Month; How to Restructure Budget","I am starting a new job on Monday, bought a car, and just refinanced my student loans today, so I was hoping this amazing community could assist me in restructuring my budget in regards to these areas:

1) Student Loans: I now have around $34,000 at 4.5%, down from 6.2%.

2) 401k: My company will match 50% of my contributions, limited to a maximum of 8% of annual compensation in company stock. I have maxed out my IRA for the past two years and only put $1k toward my previous employer's 401k because there was only a $250 match for the first $1k contributed, and all options had high ER's. I have been prioritizing my student loans and haven't contributed this year yet because my career future was up in the air for a bit.

3) Bought a used Civic and took out a $6500 loan for it at 4.5%.

My gross income will be $65,000. I have a $12k e-fund and currently have $14k sitting in a high-interest savings that I'm trying to decide how to allocate. Where would you put this $14k if you were me? Also, do I consider my employer's 401k contribution to be a real contribution when it's just in their stock? Going forward, now that my student loan interest rate is lower, should I prioritize paying off student loans or saving for retirement?",finance

personalfinance,Update one year later after buying my first home.,"[Old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51yrwx/is_buying_a_home_in_east_bay_california_area_a/)

So against advice from this sub I went ahead and purchased my first home back in Dec 2016.

I bought my home in the East Bay for roughly $350k. It's a relatively small 3bed/2bath single family home. I did a lot of research in the area/compared similar home's that sold in the past. This home seemed like a great value for what I was getting, needed a little remodeling (good bones, just paint, carpet, etc).

Currently my home costs/income looks like this:

Home assessed value $389k (As of Dec 2016) (Purchased for $350k w/20% down, got 3% interest rate)

Repairs:

* Furnace broke day 0 in winter (not fun) ($750 out of pocket, warranty covered rest to replace. Received warranty with purchase of home)

* Broken garage spring ($65 out of pocket, warranty covered rest)

* Broken garage door opener ($200 out of pocket to replace, warranty expired I didn't renew).

* Broken dryer ($400 out of pocket, no warranty anymore)

Improvements:

* Fresh paint for the entire interior (~$1300 in materials, labor with help of visiting family!)

* Installed ceiling lights &amp; security cameras (~$800 materials, labor diy)

* Installed smart thermostat, motion switch (~$400 materials, labor diy)

New Monthly costs:

* Mortgage/property tax/insurance - $1700
* Lawn Care - $60
* HOA - $50

Change in financial situation:

* Pay is ~$92k/year
* Renting out each room @ $800/mo. ($1600/mo income, plus utilities split)
* Increased my emergency fund with help of rental income (~ $28k)

Overall I think purchasing this home has been well worth it for me financially speaking. The area is more suburban than I'd like but value has been steadily rising. My cost of living has stayed roughly the same (marginal increase in going out to restaurants/shopping, all bills in previous post remain the same).

**TL:DR**: I believe it was well worth it to purchase this home ($350k Dec 2016). Similar homes in my neighborhood with exact same floor plan sold for $450k this April 2018. The rent market in the Bay Area is incredibly lucrative, I had offers to rent out my rooms at $800/mo with utilities split. There were some caveats, such as repairs needed (~ $1500) discussed above. I also threw some money in for upgrades (Ceiling fan/light fixture, painting every inch of the place, motion detection switch, smart thermostat, security cameras) ~ $2500",finance

At the moment my money sits in Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (Settlement fund) and isn't doing much.  Does anyone have any recommendations for a fund to invest in that has appropriate risk for a 12-18 month period before withdrawing?

personalfinance,Help dealing with a large private student loan,"I graduated with my undergraduate degree May of last year from a private university, which had the exorbitant price typically associated with it. The principal is currently at $70,000, but the interest accrued over my four years at university has the total up to $80,000. My grandfather is a cosigner on the loan, and it currently has variable interest and is sitting at 7.25&amp;#37;. I also have around $20,000 in federal loans; however, they are currently deferred as long as I am in grad school. I am currently a grad student with a stipend of $22,000, which is not a lot compared to the massive loan I need to repay. Interest payments alone are currently almost $500 per month, but once my deferment is up in June the monthly payments will be more on the order of $600\-700 per month.

My parents are able to offer some assistance as they are in a better financial state now than they were during my undergrad years, but it is still a lot of money per month for both of us. I have tried several refinancing options, both with me as the primary recipient and as a cosigner, but they have all been denied citing the loan to income ratio. I will be getting married next year, and luckily my fiance has no student loan debt and a full time job, so that may open more options in the future. I have a good credit score \(755\) and so does my fiance \(750\+\), so that will not be and is not an issue. I also currently have no other debt.

Aside from budgeting, is there anything else I can do to help or possibly get it refinanced or lower the monthly payments? Will I just need to wait until I am married and then try again, or wold that be unlikely to affect anything?

personalfinance,My simple personal finance strategy,"I keep it real simple. I am open to suggestions but this has worked for me:

1. Take out no new debt - pay the minimum on existing debt. I have student loan debt and a mortgage. Both are manageable amounts relative to my income. The interest rate on the student loan is 5.5% and the mortgage is 3.65%. I make more than these investing over the long run. I am averse to all new debt. I have no credit card debt, no car loans, etc. However, I would rather accumulate assets than aggressively pay down the existing debt. I could pay it off quicker but it would mean less going to my 401k. I know this is contrary to the Dave Ramsey method of clearing all debt before investing but I have made about 10% a year since I started working 7 years ago. I feel like the math is in my favor. 

2. Max out my 401k. This is my only investment vehicle. But I max it out every year ($18.5k) and get a 4% match from my company. It is invested in low cost index funds. 

3. Emergency fund that is 6 months worth of expenses. Thus I will never need to take out new debt in an emergency.

4. Fund all big purchases (cars, furniture, vacations) with cash. This means sometimes my savings is over a year's worth of expenses, but this is only temporary because it will eventually get used for something. 

5. Spend the rest on fun things I enjoy. 

That's really it. All of my assets are in cash and retirement accounts. My only debt is on my home and student loans. According to an online retirement calculator if I just keep on doing this I will retire a multimillionaire.",finance
hardware,"Secure Erase+ - ""thank you"" MSI and Intel; now my SSD is freaking bricked :(","I have, or rather, I **had** an Intel SSD 330 Series that has been working perfectly ever since I bought it.

I also have an MSI B350 Tomahawk motherboard that I recently bought.

Yesterday I hooked up the SSD (previously used it in a couple of laptops) and installed Fedora on it because I was dissatisfied with Ubuntu 17.10 which I had installed first.

So anyway, the install goes well and all that, but I ran into some issues with Fedora not seeing any of the audio hardware so I decided I should do a reinstall.

I reboot and at the same time I go into the UEFI dashboard. There's an option to do ""Secure Erase+"", which I'd never done before but it says that doing so will make SSDs perform better and I figured that since I've used this SSD for a few years it might be a good idea to do this now. It warns me that all data will be erased and I say of course, thats what erase means and I tell it that it's ok.

The machine reboots and it shows a dialog for selecting which SSD to erase. I carefully select the one I intend to erase and it begins to erase the drive.

Then it stops saying that an error occurred and now apparently the drive is locked and I'm sitting here with a piece of metal basically that is useless for anything.

""Thank you"" MSI and Intel. This is *exactly* what I needed right now. Yes, when I got up this morning you know for sure that I had told myself, ""geez my SSD is just working too well, I wish someone would turn it into unusable garbage for me because it's not like I'm strapped for money already"". God f-king dammit :(

Anyway, why am I posting this? Well, I am posting this to warn others to think twice before they use Secure Erase+. From what I've now read online, in order for SE+ to work the SSD needs to have a password set first or otherwise this happens and it's bricked. There was no warning about that in the UEFI dashboard. The only warning was about the data being deleted. Which is what I wanted. What I did not want was to have my SSD bricked.",technology

I'm 25 years old, live at home with my mom in San Diego. I only have an associates degree, and have worked at a call center for the past 5 years (dead end job). 

Over the last several years, I have racked up a significant amount of credit card debt. It's been a combination of irresponsible use of my credit card, having to resort to my card for things like car repairs (because I have no savings), and some flight training from a couple years ago.

I'm living paycheck to paycheck, bring home about $2100/mo after taxes. A majority of my income goes towards paying debt, the minimum payments. 

Here is what my current situation is like:

* Car Payment: $305/mo ($11,000 left, 2014 Mazda 6)

* Upstart Consolidation Loan: $320/mo ($9500 balance)

* Navy Federal CC: $8000 balance ($12000 limit - ~$5000 of this is 0% for 18 months from a balance transfer)

* Amazon CC: $1800 balance


I have two HUGE expenses in front of me, and it's sort of do or die. 

I need to finish my flight certifications in order to become an airline pilot, and I also need to finish my bachelors degree (online). I have my commercial pilot certificate, but need several instructor certificates. 

It will cost me ~$10-$12,000 to finish my flying certifications/exams. Doing this over a course of several years is not an option because the longer I wait, the less money I'm going to make and if you're familiar with the aviation field seniority is everything. 

However, I have absolutely no idea where the hell I'm going to get that money. No one will lend it to me, and I couldn't afford the payments anyways.

I can't really sell the car because I owe essentially what it's worth so I wouldn't get anything out of it, and I'd be car-less. Also I use it for Uber from time to time to make extra money.

The only thing I really have going  for me is flying for a career since my current job isn't leading anywhere. Also, I have to quit my job ASAP because it's making me borderline suicidal and picking up unhealthy habits. And I can realistically have a job as a flight instructor within the next three months making $25/hr. 

I've created a budget for myself, found my weak areas, etc. I just have no idea how I'm going to get out of this mess.

If I could get a $25-$30,000 loan and consolidate everything with like a $500-$800/mo payment that would be incredibly helpful. 

If I could somehow win $50k that would be amazing. But obviously that's not happening. Lol.

But I'm 25, and I also need to start saving and investing. I feel so suffocated financially, and I feel stuck. :(",finance

personalfinance,Are we consigning ourselves to being house poor?,"My spouse and I are considering purchasing a home in the coming months but are considering the impact on our short and long term financial health. We are committed to living in the SF penninsula (by virtue of my contract) for a minimum of 7 more years.

Total: $292K--&gt;$314K--&gt;$354--&gt;$394K--&gt;$445K--&gt;$479K--&gt;$509K.

Current financial obligations: Our existing debt is student loans and a car payment. My husband has $181K remaining at 3.75% amortized over 8 more years ($2032/month payment). My loans are a total of $149K at 5.6%, currently in income based repayment (taxes are married filing separately to maintain this) with expected Public Service Loan Forgiveness in 10 years; payments this year are $1052/month but will drop to ~$100/month next year and for the remainder of the time when based on my salary alone (we are assuming no changes to PSLF program). Finally, we have a $432/month no interest car payment with 5 more payments remaining. 

Current assets: We are young professionals and my husband had been working for two years. I am just finishing graduate school and start work next month. We have about $20K in cash on hand and a total of $48K in our retirement accounts. He currently contributes the statutory max to his 401K each year, and we are determining how much I will contribute once I start work next month.

We live in the SF Bay area. Rent+utilities for our 1 bedroom is approximately $2300 a month and we live in a desirable neighborhood close to our jobs. Were we to continue renting over the next 7-8 years, we would likely move to a 2 bedroom unit in 2 years which we anticipate could cost somewhere between $2800-3200/month. We also anticipate having a baby approximately 2-3 years from now.

The biggest variable (other than earthquake/recession etc.) is if my husband will change jobs approximately 2 years from now. Doing so would likely be associated with a max of a 40%, min of 20% immediate pay cut, with potentially minimal raises each year after that. 

We are considering buying a 2 bedroom condo/townhouse/single-family home in silicon valley where we live and work. The NYT rent vs. buy calculator says that we should buy a house at ~$950K if we cannot rent a comparable property to rent for ~$2600. We have had a budget for years (we typically overspend the budget) and projected the impact of a mortgage against our budget in many permutations including:
--$900K home with 10% down (borrowing money from family with a flexible obligation to repay)
--$900K home with 20% down (again borrowing money from parents, although would need to repay some of this within 8 years)
--$1M home with 10% and 20% down with similar obligations as above.
--Each of the above scenarios accounting for a 20%, 30%, and 40% paycut for my husband. 


Our math says that we could do it relatively easily if he doesn't change jobs, but we would be tight month to month if he takes a 30-40% paycut. We haven't accounted for any tax benefit from mortgage interest deduction (given that this isn't a month to month benefit and occurs only 1x/year and is subject to changes). When we look at our budgets, our housing costs to income ratio, and our loan to income ratio (even including the nebulous obligations to repay our parents), it doesn't seem like a terrible financial decision. But given how unbelievably huge of a purchase this is, would appreciate some third party analysis of our situation. Given the nature of the area and our current situation, we aren't even sure what we can get in the 900K-1M price range. But, we are looking for a starter home, and want this to be a sound, rational, economic decision--not an emotional one. Are we crazy? Are we right? Should we wait and risk interest rates (and housing prices in the bay area) continuing to go up?

Banking,Help! TD Bank America is refusing to give me 2K in tax money in my credit only account,"I'm hoping for all help for a seriously awful situation that TD Bank of America is putting me in, where they're just waiting for me to give up so they can keep my tax return of 2K. I'm feeling so completely upset and defeated, and I really need this money- all advice is appreciated. 

- I left NYC in August 2017, and didn't close my TD Bank America account. I thought I had enough to cover banking fees, but of course that ran out. 
- I  moved home to Vancouver BC Canada, where I currently live.
- I set up my US taxes to go through my TD Bank America account
- then, I realized my TD Bank America account portal looked 'funny', and didn't show me any account. So I called them, and got redirected to collections. The cheerful woman on the account assured me that once my nearly $2K incoming tax refund covered the $19 account, I'd be able to transfer the rest to my Canadian TD Canada Trust account. 
- TD Canada Trust and TD Bank America are the same only in branding and the relationship they have that lets you transfer money across the border
- Federal taxes came through last week,  and so I called the same collections number. They told me that it was all good, and that they'd release the funds to me the following day. 
- Funds weren't made available to me in my banking portal. I called again two days ago. A man there told me he'd handle things, but I couldn't get the money through my account because the account had been closed due to the over due balance of 60 days. 
- I returned a call to my home bank branch manager, and told him that the man I had just spoken to was helping me at the collections center. 
- The man from the collections center didn't call me back, so I called today: First, a woman transferred me through to an internal store support account. The man there told me he couldn't do anything, and transferred me back to where I started. I spoke to another person at the collections center. He transferred me to a 'manager', who told me someone from my home branch would be contacting me. This 'manager' told me her name was Sally, and gave me an employee number. My home branch never called. I called back to the collections department- Sally wasn't a real employee and her employee number was bunk. The person I reached told me my account was locked, and he couldn't do anything to help me, that my home branch in NYC needed to. 
- In the meantime, my state refund appeared in my TD Bank America online portal. 
- My 'home branch' in NYC said no one had called them. The Assistant Manager told me I needed to open a new account so the funds could be transferred into that. He said I could do so online. (remember, I live in Vancouver BC). By then I was hysterical. He said to call back after that was finished but that he couldn't help me get my money because it was the collections department controlling that. 
- Setting up a TD Bank America account without a US address is impossible online. I need to go into a bank in the states, and will have to take a day off of work to go to Bellingham. Remember, I live in Vancouver BC Canada. 
- I wrote the bank manager, and asked for the next steps in writing. He backed off, and told me that he is sure that the bank manager I go see in the states to set up a new account will be able to help me, and they should call him if they needed clarification. 

I feel like this is just a big scam for TD Bank America to never give me back my 2K. Help? What can I do? I really need this money and I think they're just trying to discourage me into giving up on it.",finance

energy,Tragically Distorted Forbes Article about Renewable Viability,"A warning, this is long. It was necessary to make this long in order to provide a full scope of analysis of renewable energy, and why the perspective shown in this Forbes article is complete nonsense.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/04/25/yes-solar-and-wind-really-do-increase-electricity-prices-and-for-inherently-physical-reasons/#7e447c2417e8

To open with...people like this annoy the hell out of me. Mainly, because I have actually been to university to study these issues in depth, to understand the fundamental Physics involved, to understand the Engineering challenges. Then, dipshits like this come along with:

""Shellenberger was raised in Greeley, Colorado and attended college at Earlham College, a Quaker school in Richmond, Indiana.[79][80] He went on to receive a master's degree in Cultural Anthropology from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Shellenberger has two children and resides in the San Francisco Bay area.[79][80]""

And start attempting to talk about energy in an objective way, in a very self-assured manner, when every aspect of their writing indicates that they completely lack the ability to reason objectively. This man has made it very clear that he has a bias towards nuclear, which likely means he has invested in nuclear. If that's the case, then on top of lacking the technical education necessary to make these comments, he also harbors a fundamental cognitive bias based upon financial incentive.

So, to expound upon his points and why they are full of crap:

Some of the major points that he makes with his solar and wind FUD are that:

**a) Transmission lines are expensive, and they are required in larger quantities for solar, wind, and hydro.**

**b) Material inputs for solar and wind are high.**

**c) Energy produced by these methods is intermittent and dilute.**

**d) Energy prices have increased recently while renewable share has increased.**

The point made in a) hardly has any basis in the future of solar energy. The future of solar energy is rooftop, not centralized arrays in rural areas. With solar financing companies on the rise, and plummeting prices, rooftop solar is becoming increasingly viable, making the issue of transmission lines completely irrelevant. A vast majority of roofs in the country, both for residences and businesses, are ripe territory for this type of energy source. For more detailed information on this, check out: 

https://www.google.com/get/sunroof#p=0

The point made in b) represents an ignorance to engineering realities and current trends in solar manufacturing. Solar is moving away from materials that require high degree of unsustainable material inputs. This can be seen in research done on Perovskite solar cells (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perovskite_solar_cell), flexible organic solar cells (https://baogroup.stanford.edu/index.php/research-highlights/41-organic-thin-film-solar-cell-research-at-stanford-university), and similar technologies. Furthermore, solar panels last two to three decades, and are mostly recyclable after the fact, which of course most of the calculations on material inputs from critics rarely take into consideration. Once again, this represents a combination of distorted financial incentives from the authors of such criticism, as well as a lack of fundamental understanding of the engineering and physics involved. 

On the subject of material inputs for wind energy, once again, there is a complete lack of understanding of engineering realities. These days, we are getting to the point where Polymer Engineering is able to easily and cheaply utilize waste plastics to recycle into engineered structures. Given the staggering quantity of waste plastics, in landfills, floating in the ocean, etc., this material input is available in abundance. Furthermore, landfills and junkyards are also filled with components that are able to convert kinetic energy of a rotating turbine into usable electricity. One example that comes to mind is car alternators. These components exist in the millions in junkyards across the country, and can be combined with aforementioned recycled plastics to create wind turbines that are fabricated purely out of recycled materials, aside from a voltage stepper to take the 12 volt supply to 120 volt grid energy.



The point made in c), once again, is ignorant to technological realities of the present. The intermittence of energy is only relevant so long as energy storage is either nonexistent or prohibitively expensive. Obviously, this author has glossed over any research on supercapacitors that has been going on in the last ten years. We are on the advent of new types of battery technologies, where the input materials are literally carbon ashes. What I'm referring to is nanometamaterials such as Graphene, Borene, Silene, and similar. Specifically, in this case, I'm referring to Graphene. It was recently discovered that if you take sheets of graphene, and layer them at slightly opposing angles, they produce superconductive characteristics at ambient conditions:

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02773-w

This opens the door for batteries that can be made from inexpensive and sustainable carbon sources which exhibit performance characteristics that are orders of magnitude above Lithium-Ion technologies. Versions of graphene batteries without the recent discovery mentioned above have already been made:

https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05278

Beyond this new technology, we have more large-scale commercial application's like Tesla's grid-scale battery in Australia, which: 

""The big gas generators – even though they have 10 times more capacity than is required – have systematically rorted the situation, sometimes charging up to $7m a day for a service that normally comes at one-tenth of the price.

(You can read reports on how they do it here, here and here, and for a more detailed explanation at the bottom of this story.)

The difference in January was that there is a new player in the market: Tesla. The company’s big battery, officially known as the Hornsdale Power Reserve, bid into the market to ensure that prices stayed reasonable, as predicted last year.

Rather than jumping up to prices of around $11,500 and $14,000/MW, the bidding of the Tesla big battery – and, in a major new development, the adjoining Hornsdale windfarm – helped (after an initial spike) to keep them at around $270/MW.

This saved several million dollars in FCAS charges, which are paid by other generators and big energy users, in a single day.""

(https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/06/how-teslas-big-battery-is-bringing-australias-gas-cartel-to-heel)

Additionally, on this subject:

""Tesla’s 100 MW/129MWh Powerpack system near Jamestown in South Australia is proving to be so quick in providing backup power to the energy grid that 30-40% of the services it provides end up unpaid. The electric car and energy company claims that this is due to SA’s legacy utility billing system not being optimized for the big battery’s response time. 

Tesla’s earnings from its big battery installation currently follow the standards set by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), which breaks down a power provider’s response time into 6 seconds, 1 minute, and 5 minutes for energy to be fed into the grid. Tesla’s SA Powerpack farm near Jamestown, however, has been providing backup energy in as quick as 200 milliseconds. Thus, any amount of energy sent from Tesla’s battery into the grid that lasts between 200 milliseconds and 6 seconds is just too quick to be registered according to AEMO’s current specifications.""

(https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-sa-battery-response-time-billing-system/)

This type of technology allows renewable energy to be highly competitive with traditional forms. As also mentioned, it allows them to do so in an inexpensive and highly responsive manner. So the notion that renewables lack the ability to provide consistent power is basically operating in a logical process of not even factoring in the notion that batteries are a technology that exists. Once again, a complete cluelessness to current electrical engineering.


The point made in d) is a fundamental fallacy of data analysis. It's literally the fallacy of correlation without causation. He claims that because prices of energy have gone up while the share of renewables have gone up, that the two are certainly related. Here's the thing, you want to know what else has risen significantly during this same period? Overall energy consumption. This forces simple supply and demand economics to force prices of electricity higher, for ALL energy types, including oil. The only reason that some of this price increase has been stymied is that reckless natural gas production has been booming (and quaking), and prices for the energy source have plummeted. Meanwhile though, that same energy source has been emitting vast quantities of methane into the atmosphere, causing further sea level rise, which is already wreaking devastating havoc on low elevation coastal population centers, especially in Southeast Asia, in countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam. For a brief overview of the damage that this is causing, watch this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LlxeTL8XvQ

Furthermore, we also have the costs of pollution on human health to consider. A large number of lung cancer and heart disease cases are 100% linked to air pollution, but how often do we hear that talked about as a societal cost of fossil fuels? On the side of nuclear, I only have to point to the costs of the Fukushima disaster to make it clear that nuclear has massive external costs as well. That's not to say that nuclear isn't part of the answer, but pretending that only its end-user Kwh cost is the important value is severely naive.

We can't just sit around and calculate face value costs of electricity and pretend that those are the only factors involved in a financial analysis. Externalities MUST be added into the equation. When you factor in these external costs, and factor in the cost of massive subsidies for fossil fuels, it is absolutely clear that the cost of fossil fuels is astronomical, and that initiatives *must* be taken to increase the energy share of sustainable alternatives. We can talk about the current issues with renewables all we want, but ultimately, they are already in a great position in terms of these metrics that the author is criticizing, and they are making extreme progress by the year in terms of cost, material inputs, and recyclability. By contrast, the fossil fuel and nuclear industries have laughably slow rates of upgrading their fundamental technology, on top of being the type of technologies which mostly only benefit the super wealthy owners of plants, fracking wells, refineries, oil rigs, etc.

So please, people, think critically when you read articles like this. Consider whether or not the author has had any genuine accredited education regarding the topics they are discussing, and think about how their financial incentives stand to distort the worldview that they are trying to push on you. Authors like Michael Shellenberger should be ignored at all costs due to these reasons. Listen to the scientists and engineers, not someone who majored in anthropology at a Quaker school. It's obnoxious, as an engineer, to see uninformed clowns like this have such baseless arrogance about a subject that they don't genuinely know much about, yet for some reason feel the need to spread their convoluted perception of the matter to the general public.",energy

personalfinance,Should I sell my house to get out of debt?,"For those that read any of my old posts, you'll see that I have a lot of debt (over $50K of credit card and loan debt). At the moment, I've come to the conclusion that the quickest way for me to get out of debt is by selling my home... but I'm at a crossroads on this.

I've been in my home 10 years now, so while selling the home is an option, I have to wonder if it's the best option. It's a big place. 2 Bedroom, 2 1/2 bath townhome with a garage and half finished basement. I bought it for $310,000... put down $100K on it, took out a $210K mortgage and now owe about $160K on it. The home's value is about $255K now. Thinking about this, I can make my deposit back, use it to pay off all my debt and then have a little extra for living in somewhere smaller.

Besides this, anyone have any other suggestions? Being in constant debt and not being paid off ""right away"" takes a mental toll on someone like myself. I've already ruled out debt consolidation from a large loan (I won't qualify, even if the interest rate is absure), getting a roommate because I just don't trust or do good living with other people in my own space, and a second job as I'm already working 12 hour days or more on my normal job (salary, no OT).",finance

personalfinance,"My mom co-signed a student loan for brother, he defaulted, and they've ignored the issue for years. Anyone know where to go for advice about dealing with the situation?","So, my mom (who is in her late fifties) came to me (her youngest son) this morning with a secret burden she's been dealing with for a number of years.  She told me that when my oldest brother left for school (a for-profit college), she co-signed a student loan for him.  Unfortunately, he defaulted at some point in the past, and now the balance has ballooned to an estimated $42,000.   She has never paid a penny on the loan, and I assume my brother hasn't either. From what I've gathered, this is probably a private student loan, and not a federal loan from the Department of Education.  Neither my brother nor mom have advanced educations, so they are really at a loss for how to get control of the situation.

Obviously, the best course of action is NOT to just ignore the problem.  But, as the situation is somewhat complex (e.g., brother the borrower is alive, mother is alive but has severe medical issues, loan is in default but apparently no one has filed suit to collect, no one has started garnishing wages, etc.), I don't know where to turn for advice.  Long run options seem to be either (1) negotiate with creditor to reduce loan balance in exchange for payment plan; (2) discharge in bankruptcy; or (3) attempt credit counseling.

personalfinance,Condo in the SF Bay Area: to keep and rent or sell and invest in something else.,"Hi all,

I am a long time subscriber of /r/personalfinance, but since I am posting more details that I normally would on reddit, I am using a throwaway account.

So here's my dilemma:  Back in 2012 I bought a condo in the SF Bay Area, in late 2017, I was fortunate enough to be able to buy a house near by without needing to sell the condo.  The original plan was to keep the condo and rent it out.  Now I am not so sure about that decision and I am thinking about selling it.  I am looking for input on how to think about this vs alternative investment options.

**Some details about the property:**

* 3 bedroom/2.5 bath.  The condo is in immaculate condition and would require very little prep to sell now.  It has a great view and would fall into the class of luxury/executive condo/rental.
* Purchase price: ~$730K
* Current market value: ~$1.4M
* Taxes: $9K/yr
* HOA dues: $500/month expected to increase 5% annually
* outstanding mortgage balance: ~$500K
* Mortgage interest rate: 3.5%
* Cash required for all expenses: ~3800/month (PITI, HOA)
* Expected rent: $4300-4700/month

If I sell it now, I would expect to net $650-700K after taxes, real estate commissions, closing costs, etc.

The way that I have been thinking about this is that I either sell it now or be prepared to hold it for 10 years.  Obviously I could sell it sooner than that if needed, but between renovation work needed to prepare to sell it after renting (refinish wood floors, carpets, paint, kitchen, etc), loss of tax capital gain exemption for primary residence sale, and without being able to predict how the real estate market will perform over the next 3-5 years, it doesn't seem wise to plan on keeping for a short period of time.

The problem is that the demand for 3 bedroom rentals is not that strong and it can take a long time to find tenants.  The condition and amenities of the unit make it great for resale, but don't seem to be things that help a lot with the rental price.  The real estate market is pretty hot right now and it seems like it would be a good time to lock in the gains. While no one can predict a the peak, the current trends are pretty unsustainable, so it seems reasonable that prices could soften in next couple of years.  There is also some concern that in the surrounding cities on the peninsula, there are a lot of apartment buildings being built.  While this is great for the housing stock, it means there may be more limited upside on the current rents.

While I like the idea of having a rental property, I work a busy job that doesn't give me a lot of time to deal with finding tenants and the other things that are required of a landlord.  I am also concerned that this unit is not the most ideal rental, given the particulars of the unit and the expensive and rising HOA dues.  the cash flow also doesn't seem to be all that great and looks even worse if I consider a using a property manager.

I don't need the funds in the near term and I am looking at this as a part of my retirement nest egg.

So my question to you all is, should I:

1) hold it and rent it, 2) sell it and look for another rental (likely a duplex or quad), 3) sell it and invest the gains in diversified equities, 4) something else entirely?  And why is that the best option?

Keep in mind that if I sell and purchase another rental of similar value in today's market, I will see a near doubling of the property taxes.

I should add that I am fully funding employer matched retirement accounts and have an emergency fund, so no need to recommend those as alternative options.

Thanks for your help.",finance
personalfinance,Medical School and a Line of Credit (CAN),"Hi,

I recently was accepted to a medical school in Canada. For me my future expenses (summed for all 4 years of medical school) are looking like this:

&gt;Tuition (all 4 years): $60,000 (approx. $15K/year)

&gt;Rent: $50,000 ($12,500/year)

&gt;Food: $12,600 ($3150/year)

&gt;**Total: $120,000 (approx.)**

At the same time, I will be receiving grants from the government, and have been working this past year. Here's the breakdown:

&gt;Grants (total over four years): $40,000 ($10,000/year)

&gt;Income (2018-2019): $30,000 (after tax).

&gt;**Total: $70,000 (approx.)**

As you can see, my liabilites/costs for the next four years exceed my assets currently (which is fine).

At the same time, I'll receive the following loans:
&gt;Government loans (4 years): $36,000 (at 5.95% interest, only accrues after graduation)

&gt;**Line of Credit**: **$275,000** (at 3.2%, interest accruing all the time, I believe?)

I believe the smartest thing to do is to max my government loans (to the total of approx. $36,000), and use the LOC for the remaining $14,000 (which would not even be necessary until my last year of med school, meaning only one or so years of interest). **When medical school is over, pay off the government loan with my LOC, so that my interest rate on whatever is outstanding is at the LOC rate, rather than the government rate.
**
After medical school, I'll likely be a resident making $60,000 with an approximately $5,000 pay increase for the next 5 years up until $80,000 in my final year. Then, I'll be making money as a doctor. The average doctor (all specialties in Canada) makes about $300,000.

**My questions are:** is this a good plan of action? Do you see any glaring flaws in my outline? I've given myself a high rent budget, but I will be in an expensive city and do want to live well. Also: should I allow myself about $3,000-$4,000 for a two-week trip this summer? While it's obviously not a necessary expense, I may not get free time like this again, and at my age.

**Most importantly, is there a way to utilize my line of credit to make passive income? Would index investing be a possibility with a small fraction of the LOC? For example $10-20K? Or is this too risky to allow? Are there other smart ways to generate a small income as a medical student?**

personalfinance,Deciding to pay off motorcycle,"So I've come to the conclusion that I've made a financial mistake buying my motorcycle. I was naive and I overpaid. I bought the bike for $13,000 at 7.99% for 5 years and now I have 3 years at $8,000. I currently have $7000 to my name and I'm not sure if I should pay off the bike completely or continue paying it in payments while I try to sell it.  The loan is non-transferable so in order for me to receive the title to sell it I'd have to pay it off regardless. 

I've also considered paying $4000 out of pocket and getting another loan to pay the difference. Obviously the interest rate would be higher but my monthly payments would drop from $235 which is what I currently pay, to about $100 depending on the interest rate of my new loan.  Once I sell the bike then I'd use that money to pay off the loan.

Or, just riding it out till my current loan ends.

Either way I'd go upside down on the bike but like I said, it was a financial mistake. 

Thanks in advance for your advice and if you guys have any other ideas please let me know!

personalfinance,How does tax refunds work with Roth 401k (or traditional)?,"This is probably going to be a silly question and I apologize in advance as I am not too familiar with 401(k) or how taxes are done. 

So currently I am contributing 20% into a Roth 401k and 10% into a traditional 401k. I like the idea of paying everything upfront and avoiding taxes for the “gains” in the Roth 401k. Especially this approach will be handy whenever I retire later in life. But when I evaluate my cost of living, I am literally living paycheck by paycheck even though I have a comfortable income. 

Another thing is that I am paying so much taxes every time I increase the percentage of Roth 401k (Federal Withholding, Federal EE Social Security, Federal EE Medicare, State/County Withholding tax). After some times I begin to wonder, **if I am paying so much in taxes, will I get some refund whenever I file for taxes next year? How does tax refunds work with Roth 401k? What about traditional 401k?**

Thanks!

**EDIT:** 

One more question, **if my employer matches x% of my income, is that x% part of the 18,500 individual contribution limit or is that separate?** Meaning for the entire year, can I contribute 18,500 of my own PLUS to the x% match? Not too familiar with this topic.",finance
Ripple,Question about XRP Ledger and a better metric for measuring XRP total value,"Just a quick disclaimer. This post is not meant to debate the validity of the market cap as being a measurement for digital assets. I know this has been exhaustively discussed in previous posts. This is about formulating a new measurement that may more accurately assess value.


By merely looking at the market cap (which I know is inadequate measure for digital assets), XRP seems like an established market. The current XRP market cap (~30 billion) is comparable to established companies like Lockheed Martin and FedEx. 


[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/18/06f2000_The-Forbes-2000_MktVal_3.html] (https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/18/06f2000_The-Forbes-2000_MktVal_3.html)


However, looking into the wallet data it is easy to see how infant the XRP market is. There are roughly 1.3 million wallets holding XRP. Approximately 1 million wallets have a balance over 20 XRP (the current wallet minimum). Only about 250,000 wallets have a balance over 1000 XRP. This indicates how small the number of investors there are in XRP. It highlights the infancy of the current adoption.

I believe a much more accurate representation of the money invested in XRP could be calculated. Does anyone know if each XRP token has some sort of ID? Correlating when each individual XRP token changed wallets to the price at that time may be a better summative statistic of the “market value.” 

Could this be done by digging into the XRP ledger or is it impossible to track individual XRP tokens?",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,How some central banks cursing at Bitcoin may occasionally help it local growth?,"Despite of a relatively high rate of fixed Internet penetration, which reaches to almost fifty percents, as well as the fact that Cape Verde Escudo has been devalued for more than 20% relating to USD in the past decade, local population doesn't seem to be too enthusiastically engaged with crypto-currencies business at all. However, as new class of digital assets continues to grow in popularity with investors around the world, this situation is about to change.

That was inadvertently confirmed by the Banco De Cabo Verde in one of its official ""comunicados"", signed at 29 March 2018 and named ""Alerta Criptomoedas"". This omnipotent one-pager presents itself the usual and all-so-familiar aggregation of anti-Bitcoin invectives. Various phraseologisms like ""transactions with virtual currencies pose a high risk"", ""offer no protection to consumers"" and ""its association with illicit schemes"" are spilled all over it. Notwithstanding, this ""Alerta"" might be as well viewed from an entirely different stand point.

Besides reminding residual investors about the existence of absolutely new, but not yet locally legalized assets class, the Banco's memo also demonstrates that crypto-phenomena has proved itself to be so omnipresent, that it has became nearly impossible to ignore it even for the absent-minded watchdogs living in the most geographically as well as financially remote parts of the world. With that said, however, we must add, that it might, still, be much more preferable for the local crypto-community (if such has ever existed) to stay hidden from the increasingly perceptive radars of the Cape regulators, which previously have never been noticed for a liberality of their views on the financial markets.

personalfinance,Would biweekly payments lower overall cost?,"I took out a $10,000 personal loan in October with 14.25% interest rate for 37 months. The minimum payments monthly are $354, but I always pay at least $400 towards it once a month. I've been trying to figure out the money game, and have been reading that sometimes splitting the one month lump sum into 2 payments a month costs less in the long run. Is this true? Would it lower the daily interest accrual amount quicker if I paid at least $200 twice a month?",finance

I used an amortization schedule calculator to determine the balances after each payment and rounded everything to the nearest whole dollar for simplicity. Because my student loans are actually split into 6 different loans each with different rates, I used a weighted average interest rate calculator to help simplify things.

The goal wasn't perfect accuracy, but rather to create a visual tool to motivate myself and make my debts feel more achievable. I made a copy of the spreadsheet and plan to fill in the cells with the actual amounts as they occur to compare to the estimated projections.

personalfinance,Should I rent out or sell my old house?,"In 2011 I bought my current house for 86k. It was a short sale, a steal, and I got a low interest rate because 2011. Then I got married, saved up money, and this year we are buying a larger house for our growing family. We are lucky that we have a 20% down payment to put on the new house without having to sell my old house first. The original plan was to sell my current house after we renovate the new house and move in, but now I'm not so sure. My current house is near a military base and a college. I'm surrounded by renters and could take home more than my mortgage. Or I sell my house and put the check in investments and focus on my family without all that renter bullshit. 

My current situation:
Assets:

 * 73k in merrill Lynch Managed account
 * 20k in liquid cash
 * we fully fund our retirement accounts every year
 * I'm not going to go into detail on expenses, but according to mint we average $800 extra each month. 

Debts:

 * 57k Owed on current property. I'm in year 7 of a 5 year ARM so the interest rate is 4.0% it started off 2.75%. I was planning on listing it for 125k, I'm not taking less than 115k

New house:

 * 145k homestyle loan (house has foundation issues) 5.65% we intend to refinance once renovations are complete. 
 * we want a new kitchen and possibly other things before we move in $20k? Perhaps I'll finance some of it on a 0% interest credit card. we dont need a new kitchen though. 


My current house could probably sell for 125k, or 115k at the lowest, Which would leave me about 60k after it sells. OR I could rent the property for $925. There is a similar property going for that amount in my neighborhood, so thats what I'm basing this off of. My monthly mortgage payment is appx. $600 

I almost certainly would use a property management company. We both work and don't have time to deal with renter bs. plus I've never rented and have no idea how to do this. So they would take a cut as well. I heard from a podcast that it's 10% so thats only leaving me with $225 a month more than the mortgage. 

Everyone we talk to says rent. But I'm so reluctant to do so. A few years ago, there was a bad renter across the street. They filled the house 3 feet deep in trash and left their dog there without food or water for a week. It took the landlord 5k to get the house back into rent-able condition. And they were underwater on their loan at the time too. That kind of financial catastrophe is just horrifying to me. Stocks seem much safer. Should I rent or sell this house once I move?",finance
personalfinance,Should I continue paying down my mortgage?,"Hey everyone,

Just wanted to get the group's thoughts on whether I should continue paying down my mortgage the way I have been.

In 2013, I bought a house and have been throwing about 1k extra a month into the principal balance. We've saved quite a bit in interest already, but I'm wondering if I should keep up the payments.

Here are the details:

- $370k house
- $275k original loan balance ($95k down payment)
- $192k remaining loan balance
- 30 year fixed at 3.5%
- Paying just under $1k/mo. extra toward principal

So far, we have saved $66k in interest over the course of the loan. If we keep up at the current rate, we will save $34k in interest versus paying minimums.

My question is whether it's worth it to keep up at this rate, considering that our interest rate is so low. If we drop to minimum payments, it will extend our loan by around 10 years or so.

I know this is a high topic of debate, but I'm wondering if it would be worth throwing this money into my three-fund portfolio instead since I have already hit the bulk of the early interest on my mortgage.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or questions. Thanks!",finance

I drive a 2014 model car that I bought in 2015 that was gently used at the time of purchase \(turns out it was a fleet car with 10k miles on it\). I haven't really put many miles on it \(9k/year\) as both jobs I've had since owning the car were/are short work commutes. I owe a little under $7,000, and my interest rate is 3.99&amp;#37;.

personalfinance,[Help] Can I Reduce Interest Rate on Auto Loan?,"Problem: 
My auto loan has 6.240% interest rate.  From reading comments and other threads, this appears to be a high interest rate.  I've seen some folks on this thread talk about sub 2% interest rates. 

Query: 
What options do I have available to reduce my auto loan interest rate?

Current status:
I'm a 28/m single earning $120k/yr income.  Credit score of 744.  Just recently dug myself out of a series of bad financial decisions thanks to /r/personalfinance tips on budgeting and following the prime directives / flow chart.  I have an auto loan of $23k where I make $495 payments monthly of which $130 is interest and the rest principal.  The auto loan is on a 2016 Honda Accord Sport. 

Background:
Two years ago I was in much worse shape financially, with a new baby making $50k a year and a credit score teetering between mid 500s to low 600s depending on the time of the month.  I didn't have a budget, wasn't paying my bills on time, and was in serious CC debt.  Think all the worst things.  That was me.  During this time, my car died and I decided to get a new one.  Another bad financial decision, but the past is the past. 

Note: I tried to think of and include details necessary to proactively answer questions folks may have.  Let me know if there is any further question that you may have!

They also scoffed at the suggestion to itemize the bill, even parts and labor split out.
I also suggested that the each panel installed was about $1700 and got told you can't think of it that way as another vendor made the same statement about kWh some time ago; just set a bad tone for the confersation without a good explanation of why.  At $100/month avg. bill for the last 5 years they quoted us 7.56kW system with a net cost of $15,500.  This would be 101% of our electric usage.  They mentioned the many benefits of the SunPower x22 panels @ 360w/panel and their warranty which are tangible but maybe inflated.  I want to get another quote but maybe I'm not asking the right questions or thinking about it incorrectly.

Quote is $37,300 system,  $11,200 fed tax credit, $10,600 SREC upfront = $15,500 Net out of pocket cost.  This didn't include the roughly $3500 heavy up charge.

CryptoCurrency,"Some things you may or may not know about Stellar, and why it's important.","Hi guys, I’ve invested in crypto and been following many blockchain companies since October of last year. There are a few things I’d like to say today more so now than ever; since many newcomers joining the sub will inadvertently see a lot of inadequate explanations or straight up misinformation about Stellar. I rode the highs and lows of Stellar and also did quite a bit of buying and selling; but one thing that stayed consistent is my continued efforts to research the company and its technology. I’ve also started building a project with a friend that will function on the Stellar Network but that’s a topic for another day. 

Now on to the main issues I’m here to discuss. There are generally a number of question types that I see come up over and over again about Stellar and many times the answers are very confusing and misleading. I’ve given many individual responses but I thought making a post about it would get more exposure and set some things straight (if only the simple questions I’m capable of answering). Some of these will just be copypastas of my responses to other people’s questions or comments.

- Isn’t Stellar a fork of Ripple? 

Probably one of the most asked questions, and the answer is a bit more complicated than a simple yes or no. Stellar was based on the Ripple Protocol when Jed Mccaleb first departed from Ripple and founded Stellar. It started out as a fork from Ripple with a few modifications. However after code review by Dr. David Mazieres of Stanford, many critical flaws were discovered and with his help (and many other contributors), the Protocol was completely redesigned, and became what is known as the Stellar Consensus Protocol. Stellar has been perfecting and growing its codebase of many major programming languages ever since.

- Stellar or Ripple? Will one wipe out the other? 

This is another one I see a lot of discussions about. A lot of people in this sub seem to have the “us or them” mentality, and it’s similar in the Ripple sub. Truth is, if we analyze the historical charts we find that Stellar and Ripple have followed very similar patterns during most price movements, save from a few very big news announcements that affected them individually. This really shows most of the traders (and bots) who drive the price movements associate the two together, if one does well so must the other, and vice versa. At this point many of us know Stellar and Ripple are indeed very different, whether it’s their consensus protocol or the companies’ missions and target consumers. We are at an early stage of adoption of crypto and the distributed ledger technology, and there will be many casualties along the way as indirect results of newer technologies replacing them and taking their market share. But so far, most of the ones that do fail are due to questionable fundamentals and shady dealings, not so much from the technologies being outdated, since in a sea of open sourced goldmines and talented developers, technological inferiority can be remedied. The competition between different crypto startups is what propels the technologies forward, this doesn’t just apply to Stellar and Ripple, because many of the cryptocurrencies have a similar end goal, which is becoming the store of value currencies that have the most network utilization. For companies like Stellar and Ripple that go after one of the biggest sectors – financial industry, there is more than enough pie for everyone.

- Centralization, what it means and how much of it applies to Stellar. 

It’s funny how carelessly the word “centralization” gets tossed around to make an argument in crypto these days. Centralization of trust in the financial world can be either two things – centralized ledger and/or supply. Having a centralized ledger is what traditional banking is all about. A bank will have all your digital records of your savings and investments etc. on their internal ledgers. Although they have redundancies to prevent loss of data, customers are still placing trust in just one institution, hence centralization. Because the ledger is not distributed by banks, they only need to keep a fraction of the total customer savings liquid to accommodate withdrawals. While showing you a full balance on your digital records/online banking, banks will actually double-spend most of your saving and loan/invest it to make interest. If you ever tried to clean out your savings account in one go, you’d realize how hard banks will try to preserve their liquidity, because they are leveraging their customers’ money to make money for themselves. Even Ripple is better than the traditional banking system in that sense because their ledger for the most part is public. Stellar has a publicly distributed ledger for all assets that move on the stellar ledger, it is as transparent as any other digital currency on DLT. Now about centralized currency supply. Every fiat currency issued by governing bodies is centralized in terms of its supply, which means monetary policies can directly influence its value and purchasing power. Prime example - The Federal Reserve prints USD when the US government doesn’t have enough money to pay for its treasury bonds that mature, in return for more IOU’s in the form of bonds, and it contributes to the growing debt, while devaluing the US dollar us citizens hold in our hands. They are silently robbing us of our purchasing power and it can’t really be helped until most of us see through this Systemic Violence known as Quantitative Easing. So how is Stellar any different since it also holds and issues all of its XLM right? While Ripple owns all of XRP supply and can sell them to financial institutions for a profit, Stellar does NOT own most of the XLM except for 5% of the total supply. The rest of the XLM is used as an incentive for adoption and granted to new participants of the network – Developers, Liquidity Anchors and Partners that all contribute to growth of the Stellar Network. The 5% Stellar does own is liquidated gradually to fund Stellar’s continued operations. A lot of critics of Stellar will point out that while all of this is true, participants of the network still has to place trust in the Stellar Foundation in the sense that they will not mismanage the funds and cause a market meltdown whether due to human error or malicious intent. This is not a concern of mine but a valid concern nonetheless for people who know much less about the company. But just remember, being a non-profit organization that’s also in the cryptocurrency space and provides financial service instruments in the US places Stellar under a lot of scrutiny. There are exceptions like the Church of Scientology that blackmails and strong-arms legislators and judicial branch into leaving them alone (clarifying for argument’s sake), but for the most part Stellar welcomes transparency if it’ll help them earn your trust. All of their SDK’s are open source and dev friendly. Stellar is built upon compliance and is in the crypto game for the long haul.

- If the Stellar Network is so cheap to use, and SDF is a non-profit, then they don’t really have a good profit model, why should I invest in XLM as it’s been proven time and time again that impact investing doesn’t bode well for investors? 

Since Stellar Network only collects a tiny fraction of 1 XLM for each transaction (1/100,000th XLM per TX), some people might suggest that XLM liquidity is not needed to make transactions work, and they are not wrong. For tokenized assets on the Stellar Network, i.e. MOBI, SLT, RMT, TLU, etc. even though they are stored on Stellar addresses, to move those assets you do not need to hold much XLM, since the TX’s are virtually free and the minimum balance requirements to add each trustline is only 0.5 XLM. But for most people, Stellar will become more than just a bridge currency but rather a store of value since it is the base currency for exchange for all other assets tokenized on the Stellar ledger. As the network use cases expand we will also see more liquidity anchors like SatoshiPay using XLM for transactions directly for their customers instead of creating another Stellar token, because it saves them the hassle of adding trustlines on each account for that new token and raising the base reserve requirements, when it’s easier to just use XLM. Let’s say a stock brokerage decides to incorporate Stellar’s technology into their back end to enable feeless P2P Stock trading on an open Ledger. Each stock/bond/ETF etc. a customer holds requires 0.5 XLM base reserve. A relatively small stock brokerage with only 1 million customers and 15-20 assets on average per person will need tens of millions of XLM not counting the XLM required to represent each customer’s base balance that they trade with, then we are looking at hundreds of millions of XLM required for liquidity just for this small exchange. Now there’s a valid point that XLM is subject to more volatility from speculative trading and a tokenized Stablecoin on Stellar Network backed by USD or Gold for instance makes more sense for financial institutions that want to protect their customers from volatility swings. This definitely holds true at the early adoption stage of Stellar and crypto in general. As adoption spreads however, the currency with the most utilization becomes the store of value. At the end of the day, will you trust a currency with fixed total supply and 1% fixed annual inflation, or printed paper that the Federal Reserve can inflate at will at any given time? When will this inevitable paradigm shift occur? On a related side note, Gold or rare metal backed Stablecoin however are safer assets than USD since the supply is virtually fixed and they hold their relative values against the USD quite well. But they also have very saturated market demand, so their potential for growth is much smaller if at all. Lastly let’s address the criticism of impact investing. Stellar IS a nonprofit, while keeping the network use virtually free for anyone that joins the ecosystem, how will the company grow? While Stellar makes nothing from the network processing TX’s, the foundation DOES own 5% of the total XLM supply, or roughly 5 Billion XLM. By spreading adoption of the Ecosystem and increasing network utilization, the value of XLM will increase and therefore the company’s equity will increase with it, giving the SDF more resources to grow and expand. The rest of the XLM will be given out for free as incentives to front-end service builders and liquidity providers that grow the ecosystem and spread adoption. The front-end UI/UX is a huge barrier to adoption of cryptocurrencies in general and Stellar has incentivized developers to build bridges for the common folks by giving XLM for free in grants and being one of the most developer friendly platforms out there today. So really, XLM holders are NOT impact investors. We are not holding securities issued by a nonprofit (which doesn’t make sense anyway) we are holding a store of value currency that will see more and more organic growth of demand for years to come.

- Stellar Vs. Ethereum, who will reign supreme in the ICO world? 

This has come up time and time again; and while many companies launching ICO’s are eyeing the stellar platform instead of Ethereum, many cryptocurrency enthusiasts are still not convinced of Stellar’s utility as an ICO platform. So let’s break down the pros and cons of each platform for tokenizing assets. Ethereum is no doubt an ingenious invention by Vitalik, who created a much broader spectrum of blockchain applications by introducing smart contracts and the idea of tokenization of non-fungible assets on the main ledger. It also solved the problem of the diminishing reward system in Proof of Work protocols for selfish mining since the supply is uncapped (granted ASICs are really messing with this reward system but the talented developers will probably find a solution soon). The beauty of Ethereum comes from its Turing complete smart contracts capabilities, which is not being utilized by most of the tokenized assets on the network. While not reaping full benefits of the Ethereum platform, a lot of these ERC20 coins will do nothing but contribute to the network congestion, and miners will choose the transactions that pay the highest fees to process first, no matter how frivolous they are, i.e. Cryptokitties. DApps on the Eth blockchain are great fun but at the same time take up so much of the network that will inadvertently cause some of the companies that need to scale to develop their own blockchain or move to another platform. Ethereum is a great construct and allows technology focused companies to build complicated backend structures. But what about companies that just want to leverage great technology without having to build too much back-end constructs to improve the Eth blockchain because they are more focused on the front-end goods and services? They shouldn’t want to deal with scaling issues and high TX fees or delays, and that makes Stellar a better fit. For companies that already have working products and a solid business model, they can leverage Stellar’s technology for free and just tokenize part of their business and move it onto the distributed ledger without having to spend much on R&amp;D to really delve into distributed ledger technology. This is not to say that Stellar’s Tech isn’t at the forefront of DLT like Ethereum, but they are indeed very different platforms. While Ethereum platform drives more creativity, Stellar excels at practical implementation, and I think the future is very bright for both platforms.

Lastly, nothing is without fault and I would be remiss to not mention some of the risks associated with investing in Stellar and Crypto in general. One of the concerns about company issued digital currencies is one that plagues Ripple as well - The foundation controls all the rest of the coins to be distributed and we as investors are placing a lot of trust in the SDF that they won't mismanage the funds. However, this is a bigger problem for Ripple holders as the company is for profit and they sell their XRP to introduce more into circulation. There is a monetary incentive for Ripple Labs to sell their xrp. For Stellar, since future lumens will be granted for free, they are extremely selective in the grants, and will legally bind their grantees from dumping their XLM. For any business growth is always a main goal, and we already see many companies that leverage Stellar’s technology become market disruptors in their respective sectors. As these anchors and partners mature, they will only need more and more XLM liquidity to accommodate their growth. As Jed Mccaleb has said before, the value of XLM represents the size of the pipe – how much value is able to move across the network, so naturally it will grow organically as the network grows. The price volatility from speculative trading represents a very small amount of XLM in circulation and for long term investors it should just be background noise. Another concern of mine is the lack of manpower in the SDF to handle the growth it has seen in the last year. Recent events have shown that many good projects that want to strike a partnership with Stellar have had their requests ignored or put on the side. The Stellar team’s explanation is that there’s an overwhelming number of requests from developers and companies to work with them, which is understandable. But for a company with great scalable technology, the company itself needs to be able to scale too. Having great technology does not directly drive demand, especially for the masses. Being able to sell that technology is key. Stellar enables the goods and services providers in the front-end to spread adoption of the technology, so really the partners and anchors are Stellar’s bread and butter. Not being able to address all potential partnership queries and satisfy their needs will turn some away and stifle potential growth.

This marks the end of my long post and if you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading! I have tried to be as factual as I am able but if you find discrepancies in my writing please feel free to DM me or comment. I am not associated with the SDF in anyway and I have not been paid by anyone or any organization to write this post.

I see that Heritage Bank increased the rewards checking account from 1.25% to 3.33% for balances up to 25,000. Balances over $25,000 will earn 0.15%. It can earn $500+ per year. 

Physical branches and ATMs are in Iowa and Minnesota, but an online account can be opened. 

https://www.depositaccounts.com/banks/heritage-bank/offers/

Features of the account:

* No minimum balance, but there is a $100 minimum to open
* No monthly charge ($4 fee can be waived with eStatements. shouldn't matter because eStatements are a requirement to qualify for the higher interest rate)
* $30 fee for closing within 6 months
* $25 per month in refunds for ATM fees and MasterCard cross-border/currency conversion fees for debit card foreign transactions.
* Mobile banking and mobile deposit

Requirements include (If requirements are not met 0.05% interest):

* At least 10 debit card payments and/or purchases.
* At least one Direct Deposit or ACH per month.
* Receive monthly eStatement.

All in all looks like a good alternative to Lake Michigan Credit Union (3% up to 15,000) if you want to carry a higher checking balance and/or want to get after the extra 0.33%. $25 refunds per month for ATM is important ($15 more than LMCU), especially if you are not baking in MN or IA (or near a branch/atm). The only concern is for how long it will keep it at 3.33% at 25,000. It had a rate of 2.14% back in 2008, but decreased to 1.26% for many years. I haven't heard much about this bank beside this announcement, nor do I currently bank there. However, on the surface, it looks good option if you don't mind the idea of ""online banking"" without a physical bank nearby.

personalfinance,Check my assumptions on a potential home purchase?,"I'm tentatively looking into trying to buy a small one-bedroom condo, and putting numbers on a spreadsheet. I'm not asking for ""investment advice"", so to speak, just wondering if a smarter person than I might be able to point out flaws in my line of thinking.

General Thoughts:
*I'm in my 20s, and aggressively in growth ETFs right now. The market has been good to me. But I'm a little concerned we've been running hot for a long time. Everything is expensive. I would have to pay a few thousand dollars in capital gains tax to liquidate (which is something I don't quite know how to value in this hypothetical). 

But right now I've got money I can get to make a down payment without touching my IRA. I'm not one to try to time the market, I realize I know probably just enough to get in trouble doing that. I typically just buy as soon as I get my paycheck every two weeks. But I would buy a house at some point anyway. Is it maybe a good time to take some money off the table when it comes to stocks?

*I don't love housing as an especially high return investment, so to speak. But I really like where I live. Rents and home prices have been going up. People keep moving here, the neighborhood is getting more and more desirable. Specifically, we're in the running for Amazon HQ2. On a local level, I'm thinking maybe it's time to make a play.

*Interest rates are going to continue to rise.

The numerical assumptions I'm working with:
*$190,000 home price
*$50,000 down payment
*$140,000 loan
*4.37% interest rate on a 30 year, fixed rate (Credit score is in the 770s, no late or missed payments, but I've also never had an installment loan. I don't have any debt at the time being. I got that figure off of a Zillow calculator)
*$3,000 in closing costs (I read 5% was a good rule of thumb, wondered if maybe there's more that goes into a condo purchase?)

Monthly, annual expenses (excl. mortgage, utilities, taxes):
*$700 first year home insurance (home value/1,000 X 3.5)
*$200 HOA (this seems to be a market rate for older buildings with few amenities)
*$1,000 annual replacement fund (I found a 1% rule of thumb, and cut that in half to account for not needing to worry about major exterior maintenance)

Which of these bullet points is just not making any sense? Thanks again!",finance

personalfinance,Best way to attack student loans?,"I'm currently working my way through a pediatric residency (finishing up year 2 of 3) with plans to go on to a three year fellowship right away. I live pretty frugally and after accounting for my budget and Roth/403B (emergency fund paid off), I'm able to put about 1,500 a month towards my student loans. 

Currently I have 8 loans through MyFedLoan with different interest rates (5.41%-7.9%) for my time in med school (undergrad paid off). I'm currently sitting at about 350,000 in total loans from this time, which accrues ungodly amounts of interest each month. Through the PAYE program, I pay about 300 a month minimum payment to all loans, and then put 1,500 a month toward the 7.9% interest loan and nearly have the interest accrued paid off. I'm also in the PSLF program, but not sure if that program will stick around and I would like to pay off these loans ASAP. 

I was looking at refinancing my loans today and I realized that refinancing all my federal loans would leave me with an interest rate around 5.4%, but I wouldn't be able to make the monthly payment (~3,500 a month). 
I feel like it would make sense in my career right now to refinance my highest interest loans (say my top 3 highest loans which are 6.8%, 6.84%, and 7.9%) and keep the rest in the PAYE program. This would mean about $300 in minimum payments on the remaining loans, and a more reasonable monthly payment of ~1,000 on the refinanced loans, which I would be able to afford. 

My salary as a resident is about 60,000 a year which may go up to about 70,000 throughout the remainder of residency and fellowship. 

Does this make sense for me at this point? Am I missing something? Any other suggestions? Thanks",finance
personalfinance,What to do about a defaulted loan that's been resold and I don't know who owns the loan?,"In the early 2000s I took out a loan for grad school. Unfortunately a few years ago I had a lot of financial trouble, and this particular loan went into default. I stopped paying it. The debt collectors called for a little while but soon the debt was resold and I haven't heard anything about it for years. No one's called or tried to get in contact. 

I'm at a point now where I could do something to address the default but I'm not sure what to do, or even if it's worth it. The default will be wiped from my credit report in 2021. I don't even know who owns the loan at this point or how I would get in touch with them. Since it is not a federal loan, I can't find it on the FSAID site.

Any thoughts or advice on what to do?",finance
hydro,"General Hydroponics' ""pH-Down"" product has a variance of 10-30% phosphoric acid- WTH? Does anybody use this?","I'm needing to bring down my 8pH (ugh) tap-water as my garden is essentially a form of top-fed hydroponics (a bonsai garden where the inorganic substrates are screened for any particles &lt;1mm, water isn't recycled it just falls-through of course but the principle is the same!)

In figuring-out why I couldn't correct an iron deficiency I thought this product would be my best-bet but I just found out that [its MSDS sheet](https://www.freshwatersystems.com/specifications/pHDownLiquid_MSDS.pdf) lists its phosphoric acid content at ""10-30%""!!  And its got 5-10% citric acid, so anywhere from 1/6th to 100% as much citric acid as phosphoric, I mean it could literally be a bottle with 10% phosphoric acid and 10% citric acid based on this MSDS sheet!  

Needless to say I was pretty surprised and am still not sure it could possibly be that I'm interpreting that MSDS right, just cannot fathom that there'd be such low control that there'd be a 3-fold difference in content from batch to batch (and am guessing the label has uniform instructions ie they don't adjust it based on the batch)

Have found a different brand of hydroponic 'pH-Down' based on phos.acid that does list a 29% (though I'll have to check their MSDS to be sure that it's really 29% and not '20-40%"", with them listing the average- never know strict/lax labeling regulations are in any particular area!), although if anyone here has suggestions on lowering pH **without** using phosphoric acid I'd love to hear it (I mean other acids, not rainwater/changing substrates/etc), as I don't want flowering and figured I'd just 'deal with' the flowering-promotion that the extra phosphorous would likely induce, if I were able to use something else - muriatic acid was just recommended to me by a bonsai nursery - with confidence that it's a-ok to use long-term, would love to find an acid that could just lower the pH and be done ie no left-behinds!

Thanks and sorry for being kind of rant-y, it just blew my mind to find  that  a top hydroponic manufacturer had such wild variability of their product (maybe they're not as popular as I was led to believe), can only imagine the problems that not knowing this batch-to-batch variability has caused gardeners who've relied on this product :/",energy
personalfinance,"Saving for retirement in NYC. Also, taxes.","Kind of answered my own question in the course of writing this. Figured it could be helpful to others.

-------------

I have embarrassing little saved for retirement considering I graduated in 2015. It took me about a year to start working and then I only contributed the minimum to my 401k to get the match. Turns out that at this particular company, you forfeit the match if you leave within 2 years. Which I did.

Anyway the bleak silver lining of knowing nothing about retirement savings is that I have about 15,000 in my savings account. I want to try and save the maximum amounts across Traditional 401k, Traditional IRA and HSA, but hoping to have it all calculated, because I'm nervous that I will go overboard and not be able to pay bills.

My salary this year is $75,000 but given that I started mid January I think I'll be paid $70,673 this year.

Figured that with $18500 contributed to my 401k, $5500 in an IRA, $3450 in an HSA, $136 towards medical insurance, and $1331 going towards purchasing my metrocard, I'll have $41769 left over. With the $12,000 standard deduction, I''ll be paying taxes on $29,769 which (I think) works out to $3382. I figured that was all well and good, though at this point I was feeling a bit nervous (seems like people making 30 - 40K have trouble making ends meet). Then I remembered state tax. And apparently there is city tax. And ALL THESE listed on my paystub. Ugh.

Federal Taxes NY SIT (State Income Tax) 
NY SDI (State Disability Insurance) 
Kings NY City Tax 
SocSec 
Medicare 
NY F.L.I.

To anyone willing to check my work, I would be eternally grateful. I want to be aggressive but I don't end up on the poverty line, which I am constantly worried about in New York. My googling revealed NY state tax ranges from 4% to 8.82%, and there is an $8000 standard deduction so I think I would be subject to $1825 in state tax. I also read that SS/Medicare is 7.65% tax so that would be $3195. Seems like Kings NY City Tax would be $1499 since my taxable income is between $41750 and $41800. NY FLI is 0.126%, maximum $85.56 which I believe is what I will pay. SDI looks like $0.60 a week.

Altogether comes to about $10,018. Hoping for a second opinion to verify whether this sounds right within $1000 dollars.

In unrelated news, if I chose to utilize a Roth 401k instead of a traditional, would I pay a 12% tax (as calculated above) or 22% which is where I fall according to my salary?

personalfinance,"I can't get a RV loan ($81,000) because my ""credit depth"" is too low/shallow?","I am in the process of trying to buy a class B motorhome.  My dealer tried to get me financing, but every bank/credit union he tried wouldn't give me the loan because my credit depth was too low, and I didn't have enough of a history paying off high dollar items.  I got my first car 5 years ago and my first housing situation where I had my credit run and paid towards a apartment complex 5 years ago as well.  I have never had a late payment, I make plenty of money a year, I am putting almost 15% down on the vehicle, and yet no one will give me a loan because of my credit depth, despite having a house, and two cars. 

So here is my question. My dealer got me one deal but the interest rate was 8.5% (regular RV loans are around 5.59%)resulting in a payment that is almost $175 a month higher than what I would like it to be. But he said if I take the super high interest rate loan, and pay it for about 6 months, that I can refinance and I will have a lot of banks that will give me a loan with a lower interest rate because it showed that I can make this payment.  But I don't know if my dealer is just trying to make a deal, and then when try to refinance, I am in the same spot and stuck paying a super high interest rate for what could be years.  

Has anyone had a similar situation?  I tried my local credit unions that my cars are financed through, but they either don't do RV loans, their interest rates are just as high, or they don't do a term as long as I want (15+ years).  Any insight to this situation would by much appreciated.",finance

I bough my first car from DriveTime back in September 2017. It's a 2010 Chevy HHR LT with 84,789 miles on it. I had little to no credit history but they gave me some wiggle room to be able to walk off the lot with it.

After all the charges were added up (GPS theft protection, extended auto warranty) the final total was $15,062.76. If I were to just stick to my $300 monthly payments I will have paid over $20,000 by the time I pay the loan off in full because of interest. A little over 5 years.

I was planning to move out of my parents house this summer, but as much as I'd like to, I think I should try to focus on knocking out a significant chunk of debt before getting an apartment. 

My monthly income is about $2050, and since I'm technically living rent free and am only paying under $200 in auto insurance, I figured I would throw some extra chunks of cash towards my monthly payments. Since then I've also gotten some credit history and my score is around the 640-650's.

So with the information above presented: 

Would it be possible to lower my interest rate of 13.216%? 

When would be a great time to attempt to refinance this vehicle, or is it possible?

Would it be wise to put an extra $300-$1000 towards the principal payments monthly?",finance

I have a ""friend"" that's advocating I put money into a cash value life insurance policy. I've read into it and clearly this forum isn't a fan of it. I'm definitely not an expert and finances, so it's hard for me to actually justify why I shouldn't need it. He argues that the CVLI would be good for saving for mid-range goals and doesn't helps diversify risk by not being tied to stocks.

I know the premiums look pretty high, and the interest rate is only ~5%, but he also argues that it's tax advantaged because there's no capital gains tax on it, and you withdraw money in some weird loan system (I don't understand that at all).

I'm not rushing in to get a CVLI, I want to find better options. I also already have term life insurance. What are some better ways I can save money?

personalfinance,"New Job, New Baby, Looking for Advice","Hi all,

I just took a new job, which will result in an extra $1,000/mo in my pocket (after accounting for taxes, DCSA and additional insurance purchases to protect my growing family in case of disaster). Shortly after starting that job, my wife and I had our first child (yay!). We had planned well in advance for this and were already prepared to live comfortably for a roughly 4-month maternity leave, and this job didn't change that, so we are truly looking at $1,000 of ""found money"" every month.

I'm looking for advice on how to spend this newfound money. We already chose to allow ourselves some luxuries, such as a lawn mowing service (my work is relatively demanding, and I typically spend 3-4 hours per week on lawn-mowing activities on a 1 acre property, so the trade-off is worthwhile to me), but given other adjustments we made to our budget, we'll still have the $1,000 to use.

We live in a modest home and plan to stay here for the foreseeable future, but a growing family will likely require additional space. Our goal is to have ~$125k saved by 2025, with which we will either add a second story to our current home (leveraging home equity to cover the gap between savings and the total cost of the addition) or buy a home to suit our family's needs at the time. 

So, here's the question. I could put the $1,000/mo toward $33k in MBA debt (finish repayment next year instead of in 2021, as currently envisioned, or 2028, as it would be if I made minimum payments); I could put it toward our addition / new home; or I could split the difference and invest some toward the new home and put some toward loans.

In terms of interest rates, I expect it to be a wash - average loan rate comes to around 5.7% (no tax benefit since we're over the income limit), which is basically what I would expect my average return (after CG taxes) to be over the course of 8 years - so I don't see a particular financial benefit to one over the other. I may be missing something, though.

I'm leaning toward investing as much as possible toward the home investment fund. My logic is that, given that there is no discernible financial benefit in repaying my loans early, I'd rather have more funds available in case something else were to arise (we have a healthy emergency fund, but extra can't hurt, right?). The 8-year time-frame is dependent on market conditions; we won't NEED to do anything in 2025, so it's more of a benchmark/general target we're looking to hit.

The manager sent an email to HR asking me to fix my work log because I was ten minutes over my working hours or some days 10 minutes less. 

This has become a game of minutes and I feel like my manager doesn’t care about my success at this organization. Being my first career job, I thought the training and mentorship would help me ease into my career but the fact is their training is mediocre at best. Furthermore, they are understaffed and always sticking to deadlines from the client. They don’t have time to train me. I am beyond exhausted asking for help after trying multiple ways to solve problems at work. I try to relax in the car before I walk into work and I am only 3 months in.

An elder friend can get me into a smaller company with the same title as a business analyst. The work culture is less bureaucratic in nature and since it’s a team of 60 employees I will have the benefit of taking on more projects and learning more. This company is growing and I see it expanding and providing long term growth for my career. I can match or beat my salary. Downside is that commute time will go from 20 minute car ride to an hour train ride. 

At my current role, I can suck it up and stick out the rotation and transfer in September or I can move out. The only negative is that I have to pay back the sign on bonus given to me since I didn’t stick out 12 months. The other option is to wait out 6 more months with my current F100 company and get a better rotation. But I’m thinking that if the manager and company isn’t willing to assist me now, how will they help me in the future. To be honest, I’m really unhappy at work. I feel like I’m being overworked and underpaid. The work is exhausting because there isn’t a resource to help with their software etc. I’ve learnt on the go and each project I’ve done is different. 

It’s so early on in my career and I don’t know what is the best step for me to take. Thanks for reading this far and have a good week!",finance

personalfinance,Home equity options for financing new house,"We just put in a contract on a new house.  We own our current house free and clear, but its not in a great part of town and there aren't too many kids nearby for my daughter to play with.

The new house is bigger than we really need right now, but with interest rates going up and the fact that the sellers elected not to put pictures up with their listing, I feel like it's a safe buy in a hot market.  I've seen too many houses in the past 4 months.  It's also got potential to add another full bath and another bedroom via a non\-conforming room that just needs closets added.

We don't have enough saved for a 20&amp;#37; down payment, but we're looking at a home equity loan to cover the gap.  I'm about 5 years behind where I need to be for my savings and I'm effectively a sole earner.

**Financing** **options:**

**Option A \(Avoid PMI\):**  Home equity loan at fixed rate\(hopefully\) to cover the difference between what we have and a 20&amp;#37; down payment.   This is aggressive and would consume gives us little flexibility finance\-wise until this is paid off.

**Option B \(Pay PMI\):** Forget about home equity.  Per our realtor there is some new law that keeps PMI from being removed before 5 years.

We'd pay off option A before that and the interest would be cheaper than our PMI rate over that 5 year period.

**Rental options:**

**Option  0:** Stay in current location and rent out the new place \(More rent money\).  Daughter starts kindergarten soon and will have no shortage of new friends to play with.

**Option 1:** Rent out current place and move to new place.

My steps moving forward:

• I will start building an emergency fund worth 4 months of expenses.

• I’m still learning about what a 401lk is and so far I’ve understood that my company matches 150% for the first 4% and 50% for the next 2% of compensation that I contribute, so I should be deducting 6% from my paycheck to go to my 401k to get all the matching correct? I currently have $0 in my 401k.


• I’m in the process of looking for my first credit card to sign up for, I don't think it's smart to only use a debit card. My credit score is ""very good"" so I don't think this should be an issue.

• I've downloaded Mint to keep track of my spending.

Questions:

Do these expenses seem reasonable? Should I be allocating money differently? Should I consider refinancing my student loans? Is there a specific credit card that I should be looking at? Any general red flags?

personalfinance,Need advice on allocating a windfall toward my massive debts,"Hello all. I have received a windfall of $16k from inheritance, and would like to make the best use of it toward paying off my debts. I have a considerable amount of debt due to some bad decisions, but all my accounts are current and up to date.  I would like to use the inheritance to start making some real progress on paying off debts.  Below are my current debts:

* Car 1 - $20k (410/mo), 5% [private sell value $14k]
* Car 2 - $16k (350/mo), 5% [private sell value $10k]
* Credit Card A - $17k (420/mo), 16%
* Credit Card B - $15k (340/mo), 14.24%
* Credit Card C - $9500 (280/mo), 20%
* Credit Card D - $2700 (100/mo), 27%
* Credit Card E - $2700 (80/mo), 19%
* 401k Loan - $36k (750/mo), 5%

My current take-home (after tax) pay each month is around $5200.  I have considered the following options for the inheritance:

1. Pay off Car 2 completely ($16k), sell it for $10k, use that $10k to pay off Cards D, E, and part of C.  This would save me maybe $600/mo which I can put towards paying off other debts faster.

2. Use the $16k to pay off cards in order of highest interest, which would be D, C, E, then some towards A. This would save me $460 per month which would go towards paying off other debts faster.

Now, both cars I have are upside down.  And I'm not sure if addressing that would trump paying off higher interest rate debts first.  I really just want to use this inheritance the best way possible, but the first option I listed is tempting just to free up a bit of money each month.  What do you guys suggest?

She has offered to help with the payments which I don't care if she does or not. I just want to help her out since she is not able to take out a loan and has to pay for her dental work in full before they can get started. 

I'm not entirely sure what my credit is but since I only have the car in my name and I've never missed any payments I would hope that its decent. I wonder if I'll have a lower interest rate with a loan if i decide to take one out.

personalfinance,Balance transfer or personal loan?,"Hello PF,

Here’s my current situation:
Current credit card has about 3100 in debt on it.  The card is the discover it card.  My revolving utilization is roughly 65%. Credit score around 750.

The issue is my apr is extremely high at 25% and even though I pay more than the minimum each month I end up losing a solid chunk due to the interest.  I no longer use the card, just paying it down.

After all rent, bills, and 401k I take home roughly  750 a month in savings.  I would rather not dump all of that each month so that I have some emergency fund setup.  

My question is, do I take out a personal loan from my bank to pay off the card and deal with a very low interest rate, or do a balance transfer?  I was leaning towards the loan since I rarely use my credit card so paying that off and dealing with interest on sub $100 worse case each month is totally fine.  The other issue is since I’ve had the account for so long my limit is much higher than I will get approved for elsewhere, which I like.(not extreme though).

I’ve talked to chase and they would only offer a partial balance transfer but would not give me 0% apr and I definitely don’t want to do that since it will defeat the purpose of lowering my apr.

Edit Option 3:
I currently have a 401k with my company, though it is a very small company and the institution they use for the 401k is definitely subpar. My 401k is at around ~$3500 that I have built up in 9 months of being here.  The fund's they've been working with have not performed very well ( over the 9 month's I have been here it fluctuated +-$5 since the start) and I was debating on lowering my payments and moving the difference to a new account and diversify it.  The matching from my company is also subpar, being a small company.  I was also considering cashing that out and paying off the CC and rebuilding, as it only took me 9 months to get here and I'm quite young at 25.  I also expect (extremely confident) that I will be here long and they consistently give us raises.  I understand this option may not be the best, but it would allow me to not have to open any new accounts/loans.

Any info is appreciated!

I’m very frugal, and good at managing money. I’m currently living with my parents after living on my own for 3 years. My monthly expenses now don’t exceed more than $500-700. As a result, I can now save a majority of my money, but realize that I need to do more than dump it in a bank account with a 0.01% interest rate.

I was automatically enrolled in my company’s Pre-Tax 401K contributing just a few months ago after hitting a hours-worked minimum. According to my benefits page: I’ve been contributing 2% pre-tax, and 2% pre tax bonus. I’ve decided to at least increase it to my employer’s max match of 4%. But now I’m contemplating whether to contribute to the Roth instead. Maybe both? 

Unfortunately, I don’t have a clear idea of what I want to do with my life. But I don’t plan to be with my current employer by the end of 2019. Or making less than $40K by then. My end goal is financial stability and freedom, with my first goal being working toward a post-tax income of $100K by the time I’m 30. Easier said than done.

Anyway, what are your recommendations? Continue to contribute to the pre-tax? To the the Roth? Maybe open up an IRA independent of my employer? All 3?

personalfinance,High interest debt and prioritizing monthly budget,"What interest rate threshold is debt considered high interest debt?

I received a few responses and most suggested I continue building up my savings first (I did not mention the student loan situation).

personalfinance,My parents completely messed up retirement planning and are now in a big mess. We have differing opinions on what to do. Would appreciate your take on this!,"Just a quick intro, my mom is 61 and my dad is 63.  Dad recently got laid off and is not able to work anymore because of medical reasons.  He will be receiving disability income starting this November ($2,500 a month income).  My mom still has her job with benefits and makes about $3,500 net a month. 

**Assets**: 
30k in checking account
318k in IRA


**The big problem**:  They have a massive mortgage (they fell victim to cashing out at the worst time and consolidating CC debt into home loan).  The first mortgage is 30 year fixed with a 600k balance at a good interest rate.  The second loan was a 10 year interest only and now they are in the 11th year so the payment is a balloon payment (Good chunk of principal and some interest), but they monthly payment is $1700 a month on a 150k balance!

**Mortgage Liability**
First mortgage payment: $3,100 fixed
Second mortgage payment: $1,700 adjustable (But it is a balloon payment since the 10 year interest only period is over now)

So the current mortgage payment is $4,800, however, it is important to note that they own a backhouse which they receive $1,750 of rental income, which essentially makes their mortgage payment $3,050.  


*Important Disclaimer* - They can't and do not want to sell the house and move somewhere else.  I know that might be the first thought, but please assume that this is not a possibility. 


**The big question** - Should they refinance into a horrible loan which has a manageable monthly payment or pay off the second loan overtime or maybe with one lump sum payment from IRA account.


* Here are the details of the refinance option - Consolidate the first and second loan into one loan at 5.7% 40 year INTEREST ONLY - Monthly payment would be $3,600.  Now here is another problem with this loan, the closing costs are 20k which are just ORIGINATION FEES and they would also have to pay 20k off the principal balance of the loan in order to hit 80% loan to value ratio.  

OR


* Pay off the second loan over time or all at once (because it is an adjustable loan and who knows how high the payment can go).  This option would leave them only with their first mortgage payment MINUS the rental income which effectively leaves them with a net mortgage payment of $1,400 a month.  Obviously, the downside is that they would burn almost half of their IRA funds to pay off the second loan, but then they would have a very manageable mortgage payment after that. 

So, what would you do in this situation.  I know it is easy to say they were very irresponsible and they just have to deal with their mistakes, but we are really looking for the best course of action given the circumstances.  Thank you for your time.",finance
personalfinance,How can I find out the details of my trust fund/money left to me?,"Hey guys, so around 2 years prior my grandfather passed leaving my uncle the positon of trustee. Now for the longest time I was under the impression I would receive partial/total control of my funds once i reached a certain age (21). My 21st birthday is in a month and I have long been planning moving out of my parents place. I had been approved for this really nice, near by cottage only to be told the rent was ""too much"" and for the sake of time, basically told me tough nuts, i'd have to figure it out on my own without help from my trust - mind you - the person telling me this has just returned from his semi annual cancun trip, the same person who used 100,000 of his trust to invest in a restaurant. I'm not judging here, but my uncle hasn't particularly been money savvy -having been unemployed for the past 15 years and mooching of my grandparents it was hard to hear him say he expected me to continue struggling - to 'grow as a person' (for context: my current place of residency has a cardboard box for a window pane and the floor is falling apart). I haven't been working full time as my family bribed me to go back and finish my degree, in exchange for ""supplemental income"" that would probably only work for a teenager's budget so I'm beginning to work again. I am not asking to live in excess, I simply just want help to begin my next chapter. It just bothers me how many empty promises I've been fed about them wanting to ""help"" me. Meanwhile my father nor I were """"allowed"""" at the reading of the will, and my uncle admitted that him and my grandmother attempted to revoke access from my father due to his substance abuse past but did not go through with it because it would freeze all assets associated with the account. My point being: i feel like the ""trustee"" is playing a little dirty, and isn't being completely honest about everything. Am I wrong to feel entitled to help in moving on my own? Particularly it being money left to ME? Should I seek legal help? What would you do? My biggest thing is he wants me to pay month to month but when I had decided to move out my intention in using my trust was to take out a years worth of funds (supplemented by my boyfriend and Is income) is this possible?

TL;DR I feel like the trustee of my family's account is jerking my chain and I'm just trying to get some help moving out, where do i go from here? Am i at the behest of the trustee or will I be able to use the funds at MY discretion when I am 21? What would your reaction be?
