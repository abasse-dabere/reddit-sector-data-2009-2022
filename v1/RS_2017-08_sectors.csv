personalfinance,Confusion between tax-deductible and reducing taxable wages,"I am using a salary paycheck calculator to estimate net-pay and am wondering how to apply FSA savings as a deduction. I plan on contributing 500$ a year to an FSA.

I read online that an FSA is not tax-deductible, but contributing to one does reduce taxable wages. But is that not what the point of something being tax-deductible entails? What does this distinction mean? Can I use FSA as a deduction in the calculator? Does it mean that the contributions are not exempt from any fed/fica/state taxes?",finance
personalfinance,"Repairing Credit, just paid off a collections agency. Wanted to confirm some things the agent informed me of.","Hi PF,

The collections agent informed me that because I had settled my account for less than the true amount owing, that I will most likely be punished by future lenders with a higher interest rate. 

His accent was heavily East Indian and there was a bit of a communications struggle, he also seemed a bit nervous, so I couldn't really conclude on how fast this would be moved from active to settled and how long it would take for my credit to improve or whether or not it even would. 

My Credit rating is 626 and there was only 1 collections note on it, which is what I hope to have settled asap. 

I don't have a credit card anymore, settled that a while back, I'm hoping to apply for a new one and figure it would be best to clear up the collections first. 

Thanks! Also, I'm in Canada.",finance
personalfinance,I made a costly mistake,"I purchased a brand new 50k Mercedes.
+ services + extended warranty + taxes + interest rate (2.8%) = 68K

I gave a downpayment of 22K.
Gotta pay the rest at 640 USD per month for the following 6 years.

If I sell the car now, Im pretty sure I will only lose the 22k I gave as downpayment.

When is it worst/better to sell it?
Should I lose the 22K downpayment now and get rid of the car and the debt, 
or keep it and water down those 68K year after year.",finance
personalfinance,Tapped out and Need Roof - Should I get personal loan / refinance or second mortgage?,"Hello PF!  Currently in need of a new roof on my town home but not sure what my best options would be to pay for it. 
There was a leak pouring water a few months ago and I emptied my emergency fund of $3,000 cash to have that portion of the roof fixed.
I should point out I live in Florida where it rains every day.  Since the repair, I have seen small drippings around my sky light but no other leakages that I know off.


Currently, have 3 estimates for the remainder of the roof. 
Estimate 1 -   $8,000   -  cash only to the person who did the repair, unsure about his quality of work
Estimate 2 -  $10,000
Estimate 3 -  $10,500


I was advised to get an interest only HELOC to finance it however my credit score is lower due to high amounts of consumer debt.  All the credit cards are near maxed out.  

Also, considering a personal loan for the finance however not wanting to take on more high interest rate debt.

personalfinance,Guide To Getting Out of Debt,"##**Guide To Getting Out of Debt**

Definition of **debt** according to [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=debt&amp;utm_source=search-action)

&gt; What America is in a lot of.

A quick google search shows the definition being ""something, typically money, that is owed or due"".

As one knows, debt is money you owe. It can be as simple as needing to pay a friend back for the dollar he/she lent you to buy that ice cream cone from McDonald's or can be as large as student loan debt or a mortgage.  

There's a difference between **good debt** and **bad debt**. An example of good debt would be using money to start a business (please note, not your whole life savings), owing a friend $5 for that beer that ended up in you getting a girl's number, and education (this can depend).Examples of bad debt would be credit card debt, consumer debt, and car debt. 

In reading the various posts about debt in this sub, I find myself thinking a few things and thought I'd present them here. 

-----------------

#**Identifying Your Debt**

**1) In order to get out of debt, you need to understand what debts you have**

The problem with debt is that unless it's a minimal amount, people tend to lose track of what debts they owe. They pay the absolute minimum and think of there being no way out. Similar to the old mob bosses of the 20's and 30's, you have to write out your debts. Writing out to whom the debt needs to be paid to and for how much as well as interest. This is best illustrated in a table:


Debt | Amount | Interest | Minimum Payment | 
----|-----------|------|--------|---------------|----
Student Loan | $4,000 | 12% | $100 
Car Loan | $15,000 | 12% | $20 
Credit Card | $6,000 | 22% | $25 

**Explanations** 

* **Debt**: Self-explanatory but for anyone who needs this, who do you owe the debt to or what is the debt for?
* **Amount**- how much do you have on the debt to pay off?
* **Interest**- how much money will you have to pay if you decide to just make the minimum payment?
* **Minimum Payment**- the absolute minimum amount of money that you have to pay each month on this debt
  
One might wonder how you gather or find out all of this information. Specifically for student loans, you can use the [National Student Loan Data System](https://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds/nslds_SA/) to find out all your information about student loans. In addition pull a [credit report](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_reports) in order to find out how much you owe on your credit cards, car loans, and mortgages.  

As a note, I love when people post on here asking budgeting questions or seeking help for getting out of debt. That said it makes it rather difficult if you don't give us (fellow /r/personalfinance) commenters all of the information necessary. 
[

**1.5\) Are these debts mine to pay?** (~~taken~~ borowed directly from the wiki)

If you take a look at the following section of the wiki entitled [""Are these debts mine to pay?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt#wiki_are_these_debts_mine_to_pay.3F) it will walk you through determining if any mistakes were made, identify fraud, inheritated debt, and even Parent PLUS loans.  



2) **Can I reduce the principal of my debts or the interest rates?** ([take a look at this wiki entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt#wiki_can_i_reduce_the_principal_of_my_debts.2C_or_the_interest_rates.3F))

#**Getting Out Of Debt**

**1) If you don't already, start budgeting**

The wiki has some fantastic information about budgeting. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting). 

**2) Determine how much money you can allocate to paying off your debt**
Following making a budget, you should have money left over. As basic rules of thumb to follow though is the [following points](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting#wiki_creating_a_budget): 

&gt; Your monthly mortgage/rent is more than 30% of your take home pay. You might want to consider getting a roommate or moving to some place cheaper.
&gt; 
&gt; Your monthly expenses on your car are more than 15% of your take home pay. You might want to consider carpooling to work, traveling less, or taking the bus or a bike. You may also want to consider moving closer or selling your car if either's an option.
&gt; 
&gt; Your groceries cost more than $300 per person. If you're trying to cut costs, you might want to look at more frugal options for buying groceries, such as buying in bulk, going for store-brand foods, or frequenting less expensive grocery stores.

Following determining how much money you have left over, now the fun happens, getting out of your debt!

**3)Your debt payoff plan!**

I'd like to first present the [two methods of paying off debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt#wiki_what.27s_the_best_way_to_pay_down_my_debt.3F), once again taken from the wiki though placed here for your convenience. 

&gt; **avalanche method**-debts are paid down in order of interest rate, starting with the debt that carries the highest interest rate 
&gt; 
&gt; * This is the financially optimal method of paying down debt, and you will pay less money overall compared to the snowball method.
&gt; 
&gt; **snowball method**-popularized by Dave Ramsey, debts are paid down in order of balance size, starting with the smallest

Now one might say that the avalanche method is best because you pay less interest. From a purely financial aspect it is. That said we need to factor in the psychological aspect. In the snowball method, being able to pay off your smaller debts first can motivate you to pay off your other debts. The downside is that for larger loans or loans that are at higher interest rates, these can cost more in the long run when not deciding to pay them off first. 

I'm going to show from a numbers perspective how long and at what interest each method takes. To illustrate let's introduce the tool [Undebt.it](https://undebt.it/debt-snowball-calculator.php). Another site is [Unbury.us](http://unbury.us/). Either site allows for you to put in your debt amounts, your interest rates, minimum payments, and can show you how long it will take to pay off your debts. 

Using the above table (towards the top of this post) I had initially, the [Undebt.it](https://undebt.it/debt-snowball-calculator.php) calculator states the following using each method

**Avalanche Method**

Debt | Debt Free By Dec 2019 | Total Interest Paid $3,783.46
----|---------------------|--------------------------
Credit Card | Paid off March 2018 | Interest Paid:$344.98
Car Loan | Paid off October 2018 | Interest Paid:$2,614.20
Student Loan | Paid off December 2019 | Interest Paid:$824.28 


**Snowball**


Debt | Debt Free By Jan 2020 | Total Interest Paid $4,053.66
----|---------------------|--------------------------
Credit Card | Paid off July 2018 | Interest Paid:$519.78
Car Loan | Paid off January 2020 | Interest Paid:$3,167.96 
Student Loan | Paid off December 2017 | Interest Paid:$65.96 

As you can see in the example, you end up paying nearly $400 more in interest that you can avoid using the avalanche method. That said as Dave Ramsey advocates, the psychological factor of dealing with your debts from smallest to largest can be more motivating. Aka there's no right way, just the way that works best for you.

To reiterate, your goal should be to get out of debt. Being in debt only holds you back from both positive cash flow but also from having the freedom to use some money for fun things like a vacation, the latest video game, or even a nice dinner out.  

**4) Additional Tools and Tips**

In finding a way to budget, there are some fantastic tools out there to help. Though there are spreadsheets, I'm a huge fan of digital tools. Personally, I'm a [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (You Need A Budget), user, though people also have success with Mint. My shameless plug for YNAB is simply because it deals with the money you have now instead of money you might have in the future. It also has free live classes that teach the method, a helpful Facebook Group (You Need A Budget Fans), and fantastic support. Although it costs about $5 a month, the first 34 days are free. 

Secondly, if through budgeting you seem to have money leftover unspent for the month, toss it into your debt pay off as it will help you pay off sooner.

##**Staying Out of Debt**

I'm just going to present some quick tips to stay out of debt. 

* Set up your credit card balance to be paid off on time

* Seek out inexpensive entertainment and events in your area

* eat out less as although it's yummy, it gets expensive quick (ex: avacado toast) 

* once out of debt, don't let your lifestyle change in a way thinking you can spend a ton of money. This is known as lifestyle creep. [This Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/55o2d4/nip_lifestyle_creep_in_the_bud_before_its_too_late/) does a far better job detailing it and steps to avoid it.

Finally, I didn't even deal with things such as side income, single income households, and other things. If this gets enough of a response, I suppose I might make another post or add what I can. 

Edit 1: Updated to clarify and stop advocating solely for the avalanche method and present it from both a financial aspect (interest paid) but also include the psychological benefit from paying off debt from smallest debt to largest.",finance

personalfinance,Shopping addict in debt (tale as old as time),"Hi, I'm Emily, and I'm an addict. (Hi Emily). 

I have a problem spending money. I grew up more or less comfortable, had a job since I was 15, have my college degree now and a full time job. But for the life of me I can't stop spending money. 

I made the mistake at age 18 getting my first credit card - to ""build my credit"". Big mistake. I now have three credit cards, a student loan, and potentially another card on the way (more on that later). 

I bring home about $1550 per month. 
My rent is $717.50, electricity ~$30, cable/internet $15. I don't have a car payment, and my mom is helping me with my car insurance and phone (by the way, I think I got this problem from her - she's also been in debt the majority of her life, which is why she and my dad split). Groceries have been a little expensive recently because I've been doing the Whole30 and have had to get a lot of produce frequently, so I'd say that comes out to almost $350/400 monthly (at least for this past month). Cat supplies come out to around $100 monthly. 

First credit card has a $1500 limit of which I'm just about $950, with APR 14%. Second card has $9000 limit of which I'm around $8400, APR 10%. Third card has $5500 limit of which I'm around $3000, APR 15%. My student loan is 12k (gaining interest) with 9% variable interest rate. 

I applied for a new credit card that has 0% APR (including balance transfers) for 18 months. I hope that the credit limit will be high enough that I can transfer the highest interest balance to the new card and then make payments on that and the next highest card simultaneously to make sure I pay off what I transferred before it starts accumulating interest. 

I really need some tough love to stop spending. Recently it's been on clothes and makeup, but I need to stop. I always find a way to rationalize why I need something and it's gotten to the point where I'm terrified about my finances. 

I have about $350 in savings ($250 or so in a high yield certificate) and I do maximum contributions to my retirement. I also have health, dental, and vision insurance taken from my paycheck for a cheap group rate.

I need advice about discipline. Being on Whole30 made me realize how out of control not only my eating was, but also my spending. I need help.",finance

MachineLearning,[Project] Open source auto/semi-auto audio mastering/processing. Ideas?,"So my experience with machine learning has been limited to a few courses that were basically case studies on implementation. I do have a strong background in software engineering and strong enough background in audio engineering to get this project going as long as I have guidance on what approach to ML I should take.

I have a data structure designed, and I've already looked into the feasibility of extracting all this data from audio files. It's actually fairly simple. Basically, a song is broken up into measures, and each of those is broken up into frequency bands that are essentially 1 measure long wavs. For each of those, I measure overall loudness using a standard algorithm, and stereo width based on an algorithm that I've already worked out.

A measure made up of bands, their loudness and widths make up the general sound of a mix as it encapsulates the parameters that go into the mixing and mastering process.

Now, the plan is to populate a database with mountains and mountains of records extracted from professionally mixed and mastered major label releases across a wide range of genres. Using this, we should be able to create something that when provided a sound profile on any rough audio mix will build a target profile based on the dynamics found in similar sounding professional recordings. Then a standard loudness normalization algorithm can be fed target values from this target profile. A similar algorithm will be adapted to adjust the stereo width.

In mastering audio this is called multiband dynamics, using a technique called compression, and it's done manually and takes a lot of skill, parameter tweaking that depends on other factors and time. Instead of compression we can achieve the same effect using normalization because we don't have to be linear.

There is a company that offers this as a proprietary service, but they offer a one size fits all process that provides ""good enough"" processing to pass off as mastering, but my intention is to also provide a GUI that will let the user use actual audio engineering skill to easily adjust the values, but in manageable numerical values in chunks of one measure at a time as opposed to drawing linear automation to manipulate an audio signal.

Any help, insight, suggestions would be greatly appreciated. If you have ideas on theory I can handle implementation no problem, and I think the data I'm working with should be very manageable. 

My only documentation so far is a commentated javascript object prototype representing an audio file built as I researched how this could all be done earlier: https://github.com/dabbamont/brainy-mastering/blob/master/design-docs/object-prototypes.js",technology

CryptoCurrency,Poloniex updated terms,"Poloniex has suddenly updated their terms. There are a lot of small changes in wording that don't seam to be of much relevance, which I have not put here. Here are the paragraphs containing the bigger changes.

Under ""1. ELIGIBILITY"" some text has been rewritten and added.
&gt;You represent and warrant that you are not: (a) located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country to which the United States has embargoed goods or services, (b) identified as a ""Specially Designated National,” or (c) placed on the Commerce Department's Denied Persons List. You further represent and warrant that you will not use the Site if the laws of your country prohibit you from doing so in accordance with these Terms.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, you represent and warrant that you will not be using this site for any illegal activity, including but not limited to illegal gambling, money laundering, fraud, blackmail, extortion, ransoming data or the financing of terrorism, or other violent activities.
&gt;
&gt;Notwithstanding the foregoing, Poloniex may not make the Services, in whole or in part, available in every market, either in its sole discretion or due to legal or regulatory requirements, depending on the User’s location.

""2. REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT"" became ""2. ACCOUNT AND INITIAL FUNDING; THIRD PARTY TRANSFERS"" and these paragraphs were added.
&gt;You must provide Poloniex with a valid email address to create an Account. You agree to keep your email address on file with us updated. You may withdraw your consent to receive emails by sending a withdrawal notice to Poloniex, understanding that Poloniex may suspend or terminate your ability to use the Services. You understand and agree that if Poloniex sends you an electronic communication but you do not receive it because your email address on file is incorrect or out of date, or because our email is blocked by your service provider or intercepted by your spam filter, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic communications, Poloniex will be deemed to have provided the communication to you regardless.
&gt;
&gt;Poloniex does not allow Users to exchange Tokens for money; Users can only exchange Tokens for other Tokens. In order to fund your Account and begin trading, you will need to first procure Tokens. Once procured, you must send Tokens to the address provided by Poloniex and wait for the balance to appear in your Account. It is your responsibility to ensure you send Tokens to the correct address provided for that particular Token, else your funds may never be recovered. Poloniex makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time that may be required to complete transfer of your Tokens from a third party wallet or other source and have such Tokens become available in your Account.
&gt;
&gt;When you elect to transfer Tokens from your Account to a third party wallet or other location, it is always possible the party administering the new location may reject your transfer or that the transfer may fail due to technical or other issues affecting our platform. You agree that you shall not hold Poloniex liable for any damages arising from a rejected transfer.
Poloniex reserves the right to limit the number of Accounts that any User or such User’s affiliates can open or hold.

Under ""4. CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION OVER THE INTERNET"" there are these new paragraphs.

&gt;Trading Tokens can be extremely risky. Each particular Token has a unique feature set that makes it more or less likely to fluctuate in value. In addition, factors beyond Poloniex’s control may affect market liquidity for a particular Token, such as regulatory activity, market manipulation, or unexplainable price volatility. Blockchain networks may go offline as a result of bugs, hard forks, or a number of other unforeseeable reasons. Poloniex does not assume the risk of losses due to trading or due to factors beyond its control regarding the viability of specific blockchain networks. As a general matter, we advise Users with limited trading experience and low risk tolerance not to engage in active trading. Speculating on the value of Tokens is high risk and Users should never trade more than they can afford to lose.
&gt;
&gt;Understanding Tokens requires advanced technical knowledge. Tokens are often described in exceedingly technical language that requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate inherent risks. Listing of a Token on Poloniex does not indicate approval or disapproval of the underlying technology regarding any Token, and should not be used as a substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each Token. We give you no warranty as to the suitability of the Tokens traded under these Terms and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you.
&gt;
&gt;You accept the risk of trading Tokens. In entering into any transaction on the Platform, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of the transaction and the underlying Tokens. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction or any underlying Token.
&gt;
&gt;You are responsible for complying with applicable law. You agree that Poloniex is not responsible for determining whether or which laws may apply to your transactions, including tax law. You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of the Services.
&gt;
&gt;You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. Poloniex may experience sophisticated cyber attacks, unexpected surges in activity, or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions in the Service. You understand that the Service may experience operational issues that lead to delays on our platform. You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks. You agree not to hold Poloniex accountable for any related losses.

(...)

&gt;Poloniex is a regulated entity and must comply with applicable law. Applicable law, regulation, and executive orders may require Poloniex to, upon request by government agencies, freeze withdrawals or trading (or both), or provide information regarding your account. Further, our recordkeeping and customer verification procedures are subject to change at any time as required by law or industry practices. We must comply with the law and you accept any inconveniences to you or other consequences resulting from our compliance.
&gt;
&gt;Users accept all consequences of sending Tokens to an address off our platform. Token transactions may not be reversible. Once you send Tokens to an address, you accept the risk that you may lose access to your Tokens indefinitely. For example, an address may have been entered incorrectly and the true owner of the address may never be discovered, or an address may belong to an entity that will not return your Tokens, or an address belongs to an entity that may return your Tokens but first requires action on your part, such as verification of your identity.

Under ""6. MARGIN TRADING"" we now have this.

&gt;Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, if there is insufficient liquidity in the market or due to technical issues on our platform. Placing contingent orders, such as ""stop-loss"" or ""stop-limit"" orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders. The use of leverage can work against you as well as for you and can lead to large losses as well as gains.
&gt;
&gt;All Users understand that the technology underlying Tokens is subject to change at any time, and such changes may affect your assets stored on our platform. You claim full responsibility for monitoring such technological changes and understanding their consequences for your Tokens. Users conduct all trading, margin trading, lending, and/or borrowing on their own account and Poloniex does not take any responsibility for any loss or damage incurred as a result of your use of any Services or your failure to understand the risks involved in Token use generally or your use of our Services.

""7. LIMITED LICENSE"" became ""7. LIMITED LICENSE; FEES"" and has this new text.

&gt;In consideration for the use of the Services, you agree to pay to Poloniex the fees for completed trades, as set forth in our fee schedule, which Poloniex may revise or update in its sole discretion from time to time. You authorize Poloniex to deduct any applicable fees from your Account at the time you make a given transaction. Changes to the fee schedule are effective as of the date set forth in any revision and will apply prospectively from that date forward.
&gt;
&gt;Poloniex does not, as a general rule, participate in promotions without an official pronouncement, either on our Site or elsewhere. You promise to obtain prior written approval prior to releasing any statements, written media releases, public announcements and public disclosures, including promotional or marketing materials, relating to Poloniex.

The biggest change appears to be in ""16. ELECTRONIC TRADING TERMS"".

**This seams to be the relevant part for today's fork.**

&gt;Poloniex does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed and Tokens are created and transacted. In general, the underlying software for blockchain networks tends to be open source such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Poloniex is not responsible for operation of the underlying software and networks that support Tokens and that Poloniex makes no guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a “Forks”), and that such Forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the name of the Tokens you store in your Account. In the event of a Fork, you agree that Poloniex may temporarily suspend the Services (with or without advance notice to you) and that Poloniex may, in its sole discretion, (a) configure or reconfigure its systems or (b) decide not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked network entirely, provided, however, that you will have an opportunity to withdraw Tokens on at least one of still existant underlying networks. You acknowledge and agree that Poloniex assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of any underlying software protocols, whether Forked or not.
&gt;
&gt;Poloniex may delist a Token at any time in its sole discretion based on a number of factors, one of which may include changes in a given Token’s characteristics after Poloniex has listed the Token.
&gt;
&gt;A transaction on the Platform may fail for several reasons, including but not limited to change in seller prices, insufficient margin, or unanticipated technical difficulties. We make no representation or warrant that any transaction will be executed properly. Poloniex is under no circumstances liable for any loss or injury suffered by a failure of a transaction to complete properly or in a timely manner. Further, Poloniex is in no way responsible for notifying you of a transaction failure. The User has full responsibility to determine and inquire into the failure of any transaction the User initiates.
&gt;
&gt;In the event that you receive any data, information, or software through our Services other than that which you are entitled to receive pursuant to these Terms, you will immediately notify us and will not use, in any way whatsoever, such data, information, or software. If you request a withdrawal of Tokens and we cannot comply with it without closing some part of your open positions, we will not comply with the request until you have closed sufficient positions to allow you to make the withdrawal.
&gt;
&gt;Poloniex may refuse to execute a trade, impose trade amount limits or restrictions at any time in its sole discretion without notice. Specifically, Poloniex reserves the right to refuse to process, or the right to cancel or reverse, any transaction or disable a User’s deposit address on the Platform where Poloniex suspects the transaction involves money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of crime or if Poloniex suspects the transaction relates to a prohibited use as stated in our Terms, including transactions involving the opening of an Account and subsequent closure without any actual trading occurring. Poloniex provides deposit Accounts to enable trading using the Services and does not allow Users to use such Accounts as a web wallet or address changing service. We reserve the right to halt deposit activity at our sole discretion. While Poloniex may in its discretion reverse a trade, a User may not change, withdraw, or cancel its authorization to make a transaction, except with respect to partially filled orders.
&gt;
&gt;Poloniex may correct, reverse, or cancel any trade impacted by an error in processing your purchase or otherwise. Your remedy in the event of an error will be limited. You may seek to cancel your order or obtain a refund of any amounts charged to you, although we cannot guarantee such cancellations or refunds will always be possible.
&gt;
&gt;Poloniex provides its Users with a platform that allows their orders to be matched with the orders of other Users. Orders may be partially filled or may be filled by a number of orders, depending on the trading activity at the time an order is placed.
&gt;

btc,How bitcoin is mined? Simplest explanation.,"Here I will try to explain as simple as possible what the heck mining is:
This is simplified, of course, but the idea is following:

1. There is a mathematical function that takes any number and returns a 64-characters-long text. And that funciton is designed in such way that you can never predict what input gives what output.

2. Problem: find a number that if fed to our function will result in a text where first 18 characters are zeros. e.g. (00000000000000000094abdb2dca7ed8c828f5c5f9c5840e9accfe1e6ef69fe0)

3. You can try it here https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html

4. It might take some time. If you find it you earned 25 bitcoins.

5. GPUs do this trillions times a second.

Bitcoin,r/bitcoin recap - July 2017,"Hi Bitcoiners!


I’m back with the seventh monthly Bitcoin news recap. Last month's post got very little love, and I don't expect much more success with everyone focussing on August 1st, but here it is nonetheless. In my eyes definitely one of the most eventful months in Bitcoin's history, absolutely unreal how much happened:


* SegWit activation imminent
* Epic analysis of spam attacks &amp; a 10M-user LN network
* 2013 price buble &amp; Mt. Gox hack reveals
* BTC-e went down
* Bitcoin sign guy
* Steepest rises and crashes USD-wise


To name a few.


For those unfamiliar with the monthly recap, each day I pick out the most popular/relevant/interesting stories in r/bitcoin and save them. At the end of the month I release them in one batch, to give you a quick (but not necessarily the best) overview of what happened in bitcoin over the past month.

The amount was 200 ish, and now that's kicking me in the ass!

For a few years I worked at MBNA, a credit card company. First, doing telesales, then doing collections. I know the structure of card benefits and how much they can really help outside of just using them as a line of credit, but the searching I've done so far isn't yielding me many acceptable results.  

Two weeks ago my wife and I closed on our first home, but I've been doing more and more research into how to maintain my credit. I'm around a score of 760 on Transunion and Equifax, which should be good enough to get a good card.  

The intent is to simply use it for rewards -- whether it's cash back or the fringe benefits that come along with it (travel insurance, for instance). The problem is that all the cards I'm looking at have the beautiful 0% APR intro period, but then the rate jumps to around 12.99%-13.99%.  

Is this common?  

In my days of telesales and bill collecting, I routinely saw cards that had interest rates at 8.99%-10.99%. Are those days gone now?  

While my intent is to pay in full every month, I'd also like the peace of mind of knowing I have a good APR.  

So, PF, what tips would you suggest for someone shopping for a credit card to get all those fringe benefits and a decent APR? It's been so long since I paid attention to those things that I feel like I'm doing 10 years of catch-up in 10 minutes.  


EDIT: Don't worry about APR and pay in full is the consensus. But what about other benefits? Cash back is nice, but I want to take advantage of anything I have in my wallet. What are the best practices for that?",finance

We were paying $2500 a month, including taxes, pmi, homeowners insurance and mortgage principal.  PMI was $228.99 a month.  My new payment will be around $2271.

They also told me if I was interested, interest rates were favorable to refinance.  Currently I have a 30 year with 27 years left at 4.25% interest.  Their options are I can do a 20 year loan at 4% and a 15 year loan at 3.5%.  They calculated if I did a 15 year loan, interest saved would be $116,693 over the life of the loan.  The new payment would be $2800 total including the same as above.  

They also have a program where they said they have ""credits"" with their lenders, so refinancing would cost us nothing, all we have to do is sign the paperwork.  I am very interested in doing the 15 year mortgage an extra $300 I can easily afford at this point.

I was wondering if you believe this is a good idea?  Anyone with experience with this, is there any drawbacks to doing this?  I am 30 years old so instead of paying off my mortgage when I am 57, it will be paid off when I am 45.  Sounds almost too good to be true.  Any advice?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Opus seems to be the only legit ICO out here, they've only raised $0.5M so far with an actual working beta running on the blockchain. I think Opus has some real potential.","Just like any of you, I’m tired of seeing these scam ICOs everywhere. Most of these projects advertise “disruptive technology” without even a single line of code written, raising millions on empty promises. As a computer scientist, I actually find some of these “blockchain ideas” quite funny. Least to say, I was fed up. I had lost some some money myself in the past, and I was extremely skeptical of any new “revolutionary” ICO.

However, one project that seemed that seemed to have slipped under the radar caught my eye. And this was Opus https://opus-foundation.org/. I was not even aware about Opus until a friend told me about it in a discord channel. I did some in-depth research regarding their platform, played around on their public beta, read through their source code, and spoke to their development team on slack (Who are really nice people btw). And I really do believe they are a unique use-case for Ethereum, and can actually “disrupt” the 50-billion-dollar, relatively entrenched music industry. I read around and apparently almost 70% of the artist’s revenue go to intermediaries, and artists get nothing from existing streaming services. It’s not only sad but it’s bad for music as a whole.

This is something that can be solved with existing blockchain technology. Which is why I am so excited. In fact, Opus already has the core features of the platform in public Beta with more planned in the coming months. I have looked at their github page, which also has the open sourced code running their metamask public beta, and it all checks out. A pretty active development team.
https://github.com/Opus-foundation/contracts/graphs/contributors

Full disclosure, I have put in around 10 Eth into this project and I hope to see it succeed. I think Opus had some serious growth potential with not much media attention so far. (Their team seems to be mostly developers rather than marketers). The founders recently announced to lock up 95% of their tokens for one year to show dedication to long-term development. Their website looks amazing and the white paper is really detailed, with ACTUAL CODE and development, though there are a few small mistakes I can spot.

I think what really sets this Opus apart from other ICOs is that, and I quote from their Slack. “We don’t feel comfortable spending a lot our contributions on advertising”. Many ICOs nowadays spend millions on advertising to raise millions which are then squandered instead of used for development. Personally I think Opus’s marketing should be standard, but unfortunately we live in a money-centered world, and I do appreciate what they are doing. It’s just quite frustrating when you see other hyped projects raise millions with no project, no whitepaper, no code.

Their team of developers and engineers really do stand out in terms of creating a product that actually runs quite smoothly on Ethereum. Do check them out. I’m quite excited personally, as this could greatly improve the reputation and use cases of crypto if Opus succeeds",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,[Planning] I just graduated college and recieved my first pay check. Need advice on how to best pay off student loans ($50k+),"Hello! I just graduated from college and received my first paycheck with my signing bonus (~$14k). I want to put the signing bonus straight to student loan debt, and I wanted some advice on which loans to tackle first. Here they are:

A few questions - since I am still in my 6 month deferment period I have never made a payment and therefore have no idea what my monthly payment is. When I try to pay the loan, it takes me to a page to pay that just has my entire amount with all my loans combined.

My second question is about the principle amount. Obviously I see the principle amount online, but how will unburyme factor in all the interest I've accrued if I only include that amount?

So on the 22nd of July I paid my bill for the 22nd of August so that I would pay less interest (which I assume is how it works, but perhaps im not understanding correctly).

On June 22nd my balance was 11,088.35 I paid my July bill and paid $350 total towards the loan and only paid $55.16 in interest.  The remaining went towards the principal, bringing the total amount down to 10,800.90.

On July 22nd I paid my bill (another $350) for August but I was charged $84.78 in interest.  Why was I charged more interest even though I paid on the same day, and still basically an entire month early?  Shouldn't the amount go down, or be around the same as the last month?  Perhaps i'm not understanding correctly.",finance
personalfinance,When your credit score speaks more truth than intended...,"Credit Karma lists my scores as 'Very Poor' (TransUnion) and 'Poor' (Equifax). I feel very poor, thanks for reminding me how trapped I am under a crap credit score that has lenders running away from me as though I were chasing them with an axe!

My TransUnion score was 632 three months ago, but since applying to three apartments in May as well as a few failed credit/financing applications (hard inquiries), it now sits at 558. 

This low score is initially caused by a couple of things:

1. A 2,700 car loan (opened in 2009, closed w/$0 balance on 2012). I was late twice on payments in 2011.

2. Two separate federal Dept of education loans. Both were opened in 2006 &amp; 2007, closed (in collections/charge-off) in Feb 2017, and have balances listed of $4,180 and $4,789 and a 'highest balance' of $2,625 and 2,625 respectively. Neither have any late payments listed.

3. A Credit Card account (my first and only). Opened in 2011 w/$300 limit, closed in 2013 after settling a collections balance. The current payment status is still listed (despite settlement) as 'in Collections/Charge off'

I've decided this year I need to get out from under this increasingly heavy rock. I finally got approved for a credit card, because it seems that is the only way to actively increase my credit score. After 3 other failed application attempts with ""better"" credit cards (I first tried Amazon Prime Credit Card, then I tried my own credit union twice with a $300 and $200 limit respectively), I was approved for a C(r)apital One Platinum card with $300 limit @ 25% variable APR.

I will treat it like my debit card, only spending what I can afford and immediately paying off the balance before interest accrues. Any advice for my situation, redditors?

personalfinance,IRS and Self employment,"Hello everyone.

I'm simply lost. I have a million questions as a newly self employed person and I'm trying to create a road map to success for my federal taxes. I am working through a content mill writing website content like blog posts. I will make a trivial amount of money doing this, probably 1k or less. I am on medicaid for my back. I guess I'll just itemize these questions.

- Are self employment taxes different than other kinds? Do I have more than one kind I am responsible for?

- What will be the total percentage of all taxes I owe the IRS for 2017?

- What forms do I need?

- I understand there is a 2%ish medicare tax. Do I owe that if I'm on medicaid?

- Is there a tax forgiveness option for people who make small amounts of income when self employed?

personalfinance,Cash out some 401k vs finance?,"I need a dependable vehicle, right now I love my SUV but I don't trust it for a trip longer than an hour or so. I'm at the point wwhere I have decided it's time to get something a little newer and more dependable. I have 2k in savings (not including $1000 emergency fund). I have terrible credit, which I'm working on but I don't know how quickly I'll be able to change it around so IF I could get financed the interest rate would be absurd. 

I have a decent job 35-40k year, nothing crazy but it's a fortune 5 company with pretty awesome benefits. I have 401k, they match 75% (goes to 100% next year) up to 6% of my check. But total 401k account only has 9k in it. 

What I'm trying to figure out is if I should cash out my 401k and pay cash for a vehicle or finance something at a really high rate? Obviously if I cash out of that 9k I'll end up with 5k I can use, which will put me at spending 9-10k on a vehicle. But at least I would own it outright and I wouldn't have any payments which would make me so very happy. Or should I leave the 401k alone pay 2k down and just fiancé the rest at a higher interest rate IF I can get approved. For perspective I'm in the 500 range for FICO.

personalfinance,Will paying off credit card debt with a HELoC increase credit score?,"So this is a bit of a complicated question but I will do my best to summarize and keep it succinct. My wife and I are looking to take out a HELoC to perform some renovations on our home. Our goal is to sell our home and purchase a new one by next spring/early summer. We estimate that we could easily make $100k+ on the sale of our home and would pay off the HELoC immediately. We have already renovated half of our home (which is hole other story) but our realtor has advised us to renovate the remainder to maximize our asking price before we try to sell. We applied for a HELoC through a bank that has a current promotion which could be fortuitous to our situation. The bank is offering a 1.99% interest rate for 12 months. It also offers interest-only payments for those 12 months with a qualifying credit score of 720+. The minimum payment without the qualifying credit score would be 1% of the principal plus interest. They notified us today that we do not quite qualify for the interest-only payments as my credit score is 703 and my wife's is 716. We have an excellent payment history but do have quite a bit of credit card and renovation loan debt that is close to their respective max limits (~$30k). So we're thinking that it would be smart to take out the HELoC and use it to pay off that debt. In theory this would increase our credit score to 720+ and we could then refinance the HELoC and qualify for interest-only payments. In the event that we didn't see an increase in our credit score we would still save money by transferring our debt to the HELoC because of the lower interest rate. We are planning on spending $12k-$20k on the remainder of our renovations. So this combined with paying off $30k in debt would put ~$42k-$50k on the HELoC. As I mentioned earlier we estimate that we can easily make $100k+ on the sale of our home and we would pay off the HELoC immediately as to not go past the 12 months of 1.99%. Hopefully I haven't butchered this and it makes some sense.

So my question is, **how quickly do you think we would see an increase in our credit score from paying off the credit card and home renovation loan debt?** We would love to only have to make 1 month of principal plus interest payments and then be able to refinance the HELoC right away to qualify for the interest-only payments. I'm just not sure how fast or if we could even expect to see the increase in our credit score.

Also, if you see any concerns with our plan or think we would be making a terrible, terrible mistake please let me know. It seems like it makes sense to us but we have limited experience with these sorts of decisions.

personalfinance,"I'm always anxious about our finances, my girlfriend insists we're fine. Help?","I know we're in a better financial position than most people - at least, as of right now - but I'm terribly anxious about the future. Healthcare weighs big on my mind. We are both about 23, and both still covered by our parents' insurance, which happens to be the same because her dad and my mom are both federal employees with BCBS federal. Our parents don't make us pay our portion of health insurance (her parents might soon, as their finances are much tighter than my parents' finances are). 

I make $26,500 annually as a state of Florida employee. Biweekly take home is about $850, I put two exemptions on my W-4 as per the IRS work website. I have no student loans as between scholarships and my parents, I was fully covered. My car is paid off, also because my parents are quite wealthy and bought me my first car (which was totaled - my fault - read about it in my comments) and because of the deal my dad originally got on the car, the amount insurance gave me was more than what he paid for it. So it's a good car that shouldn't need any expensive fixes soon, 2017 Chevy Cruze. 

Reoccurring expenses for me are $470 rent, about $130 water/electricity (will decrease during the winter, it will be most expensive this time of year), $25 monthly internet, $270 for car insurance (it just doubled because of my accident - it might change soon as I moved from a very dangerous neighborhood to a very safe one and found out my auto insurance forgot to give me a discount but also forgot to take one away, so we'll see how that goes). We spend about $40/wk on food each. $9 hulu account. In a couple months I will be off my parents' phone plan and paying probably around $45/month.

I have 5k checking and 5k savings, but that is going down slowly as we're furnishing our new apartment basically from scratch. I have $1300 in a 401k from Starbucks, and no idea how much I have with the state. I may have to quit my state job before the 1 year mark, which means I lose all the state investment into my retirement fund since it's not vested yet. This makes me very nervous. My contributions have only been about $570 or so, with the state contributing $1400.

Her expenses are $470 rent, $130 water/electricity, $25 internet, $200 for car insurance and car payment to her parents (her driving record is good so they put her on their plan for the multi car discount, and she pays them her monthly car payment - I have no idea what the breakdown is and I don't think she does either), and $200 student loans. She only has about $5k student loans for just the last semester of college because our college requires more credits than either prepaid or her scholarships covered and Pell grants are a joke. She also spends about $40/wk on food (sometimes more - she has a habit of buying fast food more than I do, but we're working on eating healthier anyway so that should decrease once our living situation is in order). In a month or so she'll be off her parents' phone plan, she will probably pay around $30/month. I use a LOT more data than her. She has 2k chk and 5k savings. 

My big concern is healthcare. Right now, I have two monthly prescriptions and one doctor I have to see every two months - I pay $0 for birth control, $10/month for Adderall generic. My girlfriend also takes birth control, $0 monthly. I know the state insurance is really affordable as the state pays most of it - like less than $9/month for individual insurance, $30/month for the family for a pretty comparable plan to what I have now. But as you can see from my and my girlfriend's pay, and the fact that we are both trying to get a master's degree, the state of Florida as an employer does NOT pay enough. I was hoping not to work for the state anymore by the time I turned 26 and would be off my parents' insurance. I have NO idea what health insurance costs, and I have no idea how to navigate employer provided health insurance. Beyond that, I don't know how much I should be saving for retirement, or how to plan for health problems in your old age. 

I was hoping I could get an explanation on health insurance in the private market, and also get some feedback on how we're doing financially and how we can maximize our retirement health. She barely has any retirement at all. I know we're young but if now is when we can afford to save, how do we do that? Where do we put it?",finance

personalfinance,Is there such a thing as refinancing too often?,"I have a considerable amount of private student loans (22k) that I consolidated to a lower interest rate about two years ago. The loan is now at 22,139.46 at a fixed rate of 6.50% and will be paid off with minimum payments of 292 per month on 11/2025. 


Since I consolidated my credit score has increased over 100 points due to better management of my credit cards and time passing on hard inquiries/accounts aging. 
I realize that refinancing would hurt my score in the short term however I'm not applying for any cards, housing, etc. otherwise. 


I'm looking at potentially refinancing and see that I can get a lower payment per month on a new 10 year loan for fixed 5.45% interest. Variable are lower but I'm super hesitant to go anywhere near those as I don't want my interest rate to suddenly spike. 


I'm trying to free up money as much as possible to target my other debts and build up my emergency funds so any increase in money would funnel back into loans/debts.

personalfinance,Student loans - Can I defer in order to pay down the highest interest rate?,"I am trying to figure out the best approach to repaying my student loans. I have been out of school and paying $197 monthly for 2 years (which just is automatically distributed among my 3 loans), but am returning to school later this month (for grad school) so I believe I am eligible for deferment. I am able to continue paying about $200 per month, however am wondering if it makes any sense to defer and direct my payments to paying down the principle on the highest interest loan (avalanche method), while paying only the interest on the other two loans.

Here's the current loan information as of today:

Loan 1: 4,757.25 at 6.550% 
Loan 2: 4,565.48 at 5.160% 
Loan 3: 6,056.33 at 5.960%

All are unsubsidized and I pay through Navient. I will lose the 0.025% (I think, but I'm having a lot of trouble finding the amount on Navient's website) interest rate reduction due to Autopay.

My questions are - am I allowed to make payments while in deferment? Can I allocate these payments as I want? How would I calculate what to pay to each loan each month so as to pay off just the interest of Loans 2 &amp; 3 before it compounds? Can I calculate how much I would save using this method? Is this likely to be more headache than it's worth?

personalfinance,Just inherited $200k in trust money,"Hi, this is my first reddit post! I made a new account hoping to get some advice from the other users that frequently post here. I've been lurking /r/personalfinance, /r/financialindependence for the last year. I'll get right down to my status &amp; question. I hope this isn't tldr.

I am married age 30. My wife and I have been married for 5 years and will be having our first child at the end of this year. I am the sole income earner making $110k a year in a stable job profession with about 4%-6% income growth every year. I have a 30 year mortgage at 3.5% with 180k left on the loan and Zillow value is $505k. With my income alone I have been maxing out my 401k at work and my Roth IRA and my wife's Roth IRA every year for the last 5 years. I have also been maintaining about 5-10% of my assets in precious metals. I have been using leftover money in a taxable individual account with Wealthfront, investment in Prosper and savings for short term goals (just purchased a $20k used car, home improvements, etc.) Needless to say, my wife and I are very frugal with money and not big spenders. I use PersonalCapital.com to manage/view my net worth. My net assets (without the trust fund) are $731k, net liabilities are $182k (home mortgage) for a net worth of $550k. My long term goal is to retire before I am 60.

After we got married several years ago her parents made me (and her) aware of a trust fund that her grandfather set up years ago which allegedly made all of its money off penny stocks  worth about $200k. Her parents are ready to transfer the trust money to our name and we are just starting down the road to determine how to make it happen (logistics, tax implications, etc.). The trust broker has said that all we have to do is to liquidate the account and hold in cash and then a check can be sent. From what I can tell the trust is invested in 30% muni/intl bonds 10% cash and 70% domestic/intl equities and over the last year its only gained about 4% which is disappointing given the gains in the S&amp;P, DJIA &amp; NASDAQ over the last several months. It is invested in a total of 7 different funds with expense ratios of at least 0.5% to 1.3%. On top of that the trust account is managed by Valic and charges a 1% annual fee a year or about $2000/yr so the money is getting hammered with fees. As far as what my and my wife's ideas are for the money - I don't think I would use the money to pay off my mortgage since the interest rate is so low and I'm pretty sure the fund can easily manage at least 3.5% over the next 20 years. My wife wants to make sure that the fund can be used to pay for our children's college education. At this point I am assuming we will have 2-3 children (but you never know). So I think that there is plenty of money available given that there is still at least 18 years for the funds to grow. I am thinking about transferring the money to Vanguard, Fidelity or Wealthfront. From what I've read Vanguard and Fidelity have no annual fees and there are only commission fees associated with trades for taxable individual investment accounts ($4 to $7 a trade). Just like all of the other Roth and 401k accounts I manage myself, I will NOT be actively trading in this account whatsoever. Wealthfront charges a 0.25% annual fee but they robo-manage and use tax loss harvesting - not sure if those benefits are worth the 0.25% ($500/yr) fee. Ideally, I was thinking that I should open a Fidelity/Vanguard account and purchase premium class mutual funds or index funds and leave it alone. I am also thinking that I should change the investment allocations to 10%-20% bonds and 80-90% stocks given that we wont need the money until 18 years at the earliest. I would welcome any other thoughts anyone has to offer with my approach. Or any other advice on how to manage the money going forward. Thank You!",finance
personalfinance,student loan debt,"I've been working towards paying off my student loan debt and ran across this sub and figured it was as good of a place as any to get some advice/feedback on what I'm doing. As of today, I have ~38k in student loan debt across 12 loans that vary from $5k-$1.5k and 6.55-3.15% APR. I've read a lot on both snowball and avalanche methods of paying the debt down but I have been approaching it a bit different and I want to make sure I'm not inadvertently shooting myself in the foot. I have been paying at least $1200/mo extra towards my debt but I split it between the loans that accrue the most interest in that month, for instance, last month I had 3 loans to accrued ~28/mo in interest and I applied $400 to each of those loans. My plan was to continue this method until all of the loans have similar monthly interest charges then determine the best path from there. From the looks of it by the time I get the majority of my loans monthly interest payment about equal I should be able to pay them off within a couple months applying the bulk of the over payment to a single loan.

Is this the most cost effective(least interest charges) way of thinking about this or does it make more sense to just go with the avalanche method and pay down the highest interest rate loans in order of balance then work down the list? Paying off a single loan at a time.

I have worked up a couple spreadsheets but I can't figure out the math of my method to compare the interest savings over the other 2 methods but in my mind paying down on the loans that cost the most in interest each month makes the most sense but I have been wrong before.

Since I have a family with 3 kids, I was very careful about restoring the house so that it was safe for us to move back in. The insurance initially offered $19K, but almost a year later its taken over $200K to get everything back to normal. I decided to make lemonade out of lemons and write a book that would allow others to learn from my mistakes. It turns out this industry has some very good people but also predatory vendors that are out to make a dollar when families are in a vulnerable position. What I realized is that these insiders have the benefit of experience, while many homeowners who have experienced this are effectively ""rookies"" and can get easily pushed around for a lot of money. 

I would love the assistance of redditors who have experience in the industry or went through a similar experience to give me feedback on my ""First 24 Hours"" chapter.

I will make it into a printable pdf so that anyone who has gone through a fire can simply download it and print it out. I will be humble in taking any and all suggestions to making this accurate and helpful to the homeowners. 

**1. Make sure your loved ones are ok.** My philosophy is that anything with a soul needs to be addressed first: spouse, children, and pets. If the paramedics determine that someone needs medical attention, go with them to the hospital and have friends and family meet you there. Delegate the rest of the list to them while you focus on caring for and comforting your loved ones.

**2. Find family, friends, neighbors, or co-workers fast.** Look for anyone you can trust, whose interest in helping you out is not financially motivated. Get them on the phone and ask them to meet you as soon as possible. Keep them close, while having the vendors remain at arms’ length.

**3. Document everything you can for the insurance company.** Start by writing down the date and time of the fire, followed by a brief account of what happened. Then, you’ll need to document the extent of the damage: how badly burned is the house, what possessions are lost, singed, or otherwise damaged, etc. Ideally, you’ll want to write it all down, as well as taking photographs of everything. The vendors (cleaners or contractors) may offer to take care of documentation for you. Don’t trust them. Delegate it to someone you know and trust. If your property is safe to enter, then take as much as you can from a safe distance. If it is not safe to enter, then document what you can from the outside. 

**4. Call the insurance company immediately.** The sooner you report the incident and can get in touch with the person who will be handling your case, the better. Here is a list what you should talk to them about:  
a.	Get the name, phone number and email address of your claim rep. They may be helpful, or they may treat you like just another number, as we talked about earlier. If it’s the latter, don’t worry, they don’t need to be your friends -you have your family for that.  
b.	Ask them if you’re able to get an emergency advance (i.e. an immediate payment to you against any later payouts) to help you cover expenses. If money is tight, they may be able to get you a few thousand to deal with living day to day.  
c.	Have them e-mail copy of your policy. Hopefully they’ll do it, so that you can get it as quickly as possible. However, they may only be willing to send it by snail mail, or try to stall the process in other ways. If this is the case, at least have them explain the important information to you. For example, what’s the deductible? What are the limits on housing allowance? In short, what can you expect as you deal with them in the coming weeks and months?  
d.	Your mailing address. If your house is not livable, have them send all correspondence to a trusted friend/family member. Tell them it will get lost if they don’t do it. If there is a history of mail theft in your neighborhood, and you are not going to be there for an extended period, then that’s an even more compelling reason. Also have postal service forward your mail to a new address, or hold it for you. You don’t want an over-stuffed mailbox attracting vagrants.  
e.	One thing the insurance company may bring up is contractors, cleaners, and other vendors to do the necessary repair/cleanup work. Be extremely skeptical of any vendors recommended to you by your insurance company. This is the fox watching the henhouse. I will teach you how to deal with finding/choosing vendors in a later section.  

**5.	Secure your property.** If the property is safe to enter and if you have anything of value in the house that wasn’t damaged by the disaster, try to secure it yourself. Either take it with you, or make sure it’s not easily accessible to passersby. Another sad reality is that, depending on the neighborhood where you live, criminal elements also listen to police scanners. They’ll drive by your house, and if it looks abandoned, they may walk in and help themselves to whatever is salvageable. One option for protecting the things you’re unable to bring with you is to call a local security patrol service for nightly drive-bys. I was able to get someone for less than $50 a night. Unfortunately, insurance companies will likely not be willing to pay for this. The unscrupulous ones will laugh at you about it. However, if you can afford it, it’s a good investment.

**6.	Secure valuables.** Limit items to things that can fit into your car that cannot be replaced. Here is a quick checklist:  
a.	Digital cameras and any memory storage devices with family photos and other important files on them, including CDs, flash drives, SD cards, etc.   
b.	Family photos  
c.	Paperwork: Certificates, deeds, diplomas, passports  
d.	Cash, coins collectibles  
e.	Heirlooms and jewelry  
f.	Functioning, non-damaged electronics    
g.	Special art projects   

**7.	Notify the neighbors.** The neighbors may be able to look out for vagrants and call you if something funny is going on. I even had a neighbor park his car in front of my house to make it look like it was occupied. Get on NextDoor – a social network that connects you with the other people in your area. Post something to the effect of: “My house recently had a fire (or flood). Here is what I need. I will be reachable at this number if you can provide assistance.” Or, if you prefer, you can do it old school. Write your name and number on 10 or 12 strips of paper, then go around the neighborhood handing out the information. Tell them to get ahold of you if they see anything suspicious.

**8.	Pack an overnight bag –** If your house is safe to enter and items are not too damaged, pack a suitcase of items to take with you. If you have kids, they may want the comfort of a teddy bear, iPad etc. Pack that if possible. If not go to the nearest Wal-Mart / Target and get the following:  
a.	Underwear  
b.	Toothbrush  
c.	Shampoo / soap  
d.	Towels (one for each family member)  
e.	Sleeping bag (if you are not staying at a hotel)  
f.	Several large envelopes to store all receipts  
g.	A notebook to take notes, contact info, and other important information  
h.	Change of clothes, jacket shoes etc.  
i.	Replacement medication if you need  
You may be tempted to buy food as well. However, groceries are not easily reimbursed. In my experience, the insurance company will reimburse you for eating meals at a restaurant when you are displaced from your home, but they will fight you if you buy a dozen eggs to cook the family a comforting breakfast. More on this later.

**9.	Find a place to stay.** If your house will require extensive work to make it livable again, you may require accommodations long term. Deal with that later, though. For now, get a place to stay at least short term right away, and get your family settled there, so you at least know where you’ll be sleeping tonight. Make sure it is at the equivalent standard of living that you are accustomed to. For the next 24-48 hours, the insurance company can assist in finding a hotel for you. One option is to use Airbnb to find house similar to yours. Or you can use Expedia to find a hotel room that meets your needs. In either case, be sure to save the receipt. Don’t worry about saving money here; you will likely have the insurance company reimburse you. If you want, you can call the insurance rep in advance for pre-approval. 

**10. Get informed!** Get acquainted with the industry jargon before you start speaking with the vendors. Read through the glossary at the back of this book. Having command of these commonly used terms will give you a sense of confidence so you are not intimidated. 

**SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS**
1.	Don’t make any rash decisions. Trust no one except family and non-financially motivated friends. 
2.	The vendors who respond first are not necessarily the best vendors, just the fastest on site after listening to police scanners.
3.	Print out the First 24 Hours worksheet on page 35. That will be your bible.",finance

Compared to my previous job, this endeavor will be a great investment for me in life happiness but also financially.

personalfinance,Getting a mortgage and school loan at the same time?,"Hi PF,

Long-time lurker here as I love learning from this sub and first-off, I want to use this chance to say thanks to everyone here for the great advice and support they give to everyone. I'm hoping you can help give me some guidance as well!

I'm in a position with my SO where we potentially could be buying a home (a duplex) and my SO goes to business school within a 6-12 month period (if we are fortunate and all goes according to plan, which life seldom does). I am hoping you can help me determine the feasibility of this from a loan standpoint!

To keep the math simple:
- We live in a HCOL location, combined make 200k/year, each make the same amount of money
- If we found a duplex that we like, the ideal monthly mortgage + insurance + tax would be $4200/month. We would rent out one unit at $2k/month, and split the remaining $2.2k/month between ourselves as our own mortgage for our unit. Both of our names would be on the mortgage loan.
- If my SO gets into business school, he would like to go. Assuming we buy a duplex before-hand, he will need to take out a second loan to cover 100% of business school cost - assume that to be $110k for two years tuition. He will also also need that loan to cover his food/rent/travel, etc while he is in school (up to whatever I can't help him with). This means those loans will also have to cover his $1100/month part of the mortgage. Thus, his total second loan for business school will probably be closer to $165k. He would be the only name on this second loan for business school.
- Assume we would buy the duplex/sign on the mortgage loan 6-12 months before he would be accepted into school and apply for the business school loan.

Will it be possible for him to take out a $165k loan for business school just 6-12 months after taking out a large mortgage loan with me? Is this too risky to be possible (or would result in a super high interest rate) in the view of loan companies, despite the fact that he would also have me on the mortgage loan and he would only have to re-borrow $1100/month to cover his portion of the mortgage? Or would the loan companies see that he only has to cover $1100/month in mortgage and see a school loan differently from a mortgage loan and it wouldn't be an issue?

Any help, insight, and guidance is much appreciated! Thanks in advance PF :)

TL;DR: would like to get a mortgage loan and then a business school loan within the span of 6-12 months. Is this even possible or too risky from loan company's perspective?",finance
personalfinance,"Relocating from Europe to California. How do I best prepare, especially wrt. getting a car? And are companies that say they have special deals for expats actually a good deal","First of all; I apologize for the wall of text, this is new territory to me, so I don't know what info is most relevant. 

TL;DR: Moving to the US on L1 visa. No US credit history. Willing to spend maximum $8k upfront for a car. What are my best options? And are the companies that claim special deals for expats (if done before the move) legit and worth it?


**Background**

I'm relocating to the US (California) in October (on an L1), which includes a lot of financial decisions. I've spent I while estimating my future financial situation and my main issue at the moment is the car. And I'd also like to make sure understand how to get a good deal on one.


**The details**

**Financials:**
Salary the ballpark of $100k. I plan to have ~$10k in savings before the move (early career, and happy to spend a significant portion of it). The company will provide the move, a month of housing and rental car, as well as an extra months worth of salary to cover costs, which is another ~$5k. There's some potential for even more, but I wouldn't rely on it.
My current estimations of living cost (calculator online) and housing (SF bay area isn't cheap), leaves me at $1400-$1700 a month after expenses, not including a car other than petrol, depending on rent.

**Other details:**
I have no credit history in the US. I have however been using an Amex for the last two month, as I've heard it might help out. I've had a drivers license for 6 years, am over 25, but have never owned a vehicle or insurance.

**I need a car!**
I've been looking at some companies that cater specifically to people moving to the US without credit history. They offer both new and used vehicles with or without financing as well as leasing of new vehicles. They claim to give special deals when done before the move date as they then don't fall under the same regulation. They also claim to be able to give financing with interest rates matching what I would've gotten with a great credit rating. And of course you can't get the numbers from their websites. So far I have a pdf from one of them with new car lease quotes (lower end is in the range of $300-400/month and $800-$1400 downpayment). Another one of the similar companies set up a call with me next week.

Are these companies worthwhile? How do I know if the deals are good?

I'm willing to go up to a maximum of ~$8k upfront cost. The car itself is not hugely important to me.

**My questions:**

1. Are these companies worth it or should I wait until I get to the US and go to local dealerships?

2. Given my $8k upfront limit and salary information, what ways of buying a car should I be looking at? New/used/finance/lease?

3. In what price range?



**Final remarks**

I'm also happy to take other personal finance advice from people who've been in similar situations. Anything I should be aware of, or services / banks or similar worth checking out?

personalfinance,"24F, $80k / year salary. Pay student loans or put money in IRA?","Hi everyone!

This is about a friend of mine, not me.

She's a coworker of mine who just recently graduated from her masters program. She currently has several types of student loans, but all of them are of 3-7% interest rates. Her current salary is $80k per year, post tax. She also has about $20k in an ""emergency fund"" savings account. She is risk-adverse, and as a result, hesitant to invest in a retirement fund. 

She currently plans to pay off her student loans in the next 1-2 years. After that, she would like a new car, and probably begin saving to buy a house.

I am trying to convince her to begin depositing money into an IRA, and deposit the maximum amount every year. Moreover, I want her to move her emergency fund into an index annuity. She is weary that the index annuity is not safe as I am trying to convince her it is. Lastly, I would like her to set aside money in a three-fund portfolio, and pay slightly more than minimum balance on her student loans. My reasoning for that is that since several of her loans are below 5%, it would be better to invest the money than rush to pay off her student loans.

If you guys think I am right, what should I say to convince her? If you guys think I am wrong, please point out the flaws in my argument as well as a better recommendation.

Thank you guys for all your input!

 P.S., if you guys have a budgeting spreadsheet to help her organize her finances, that'll be greatly appreciated.",finance

**HERE IS A STORY REGARDING MY PERSONAL DEBT**

Here’s some background to me. Last summer I worked as a lifeguard 7 hours a day 5am-12pm 5 days a week for 3 months straight made roughly $4k with taxes deducted. I spent it here and there on food an my everyday needs of a High Schooler during the summer. By the end of the summer I had about $3800 left in my account and started school. During school I never touched the money except when I bought food with friends. January comes around and my dad ask to borrow money to help pay off my sisters school (she’s in college) my dad doesn’t work and has no money my mom works a 9-5 job and comes home and has to cook. I was quite confused as according to talking to my mom and dad we were ok financially. I ended up paying off my sister school that semester $2500. My dad “promised” me 10% interest on the money and he’d pay me back in 3 months. Obviously that hasn’t happened and Im still here with nothing from him. I told my mom about this and she was pissed she paid me back $500 once to pay back some of what my dad owes me and that was the last of it I heard. These past few weeks have been rough I was involved in an accident driving (no-one hurt, we may have a law suit in our hands, and our insurance didn’t go up) I was removed from it since I didn’t want to continue driving anymore so I bought an electric skateboard $900 I use it to transport me here and there and such. About 1 month ago I filed my w-2 form for the Summer of 2016 and got back $800. I went out and bought a PC for myself to use and then flipped it for $1000 then bought a $1100 pc and flipped it for $1400. I used that money I made to deduct from my dads “debt” he owes me since he isn’t doing anything about it and I feel like crap knowing he owes me so much money. Fast forward to this month and my sister is in need of a couch for what? to study in her room apparently (honestly another useless piece of crap we don’t need). Anyways my mom agrees to pay for half (which I don’t understand why) and then they end up asking me for the money since the credit card bill is due today so I ended up pulling $600 out of my account. (My parents have several maxed out credit cards and make minimum payments to my knowledge.) I believe their debt is like $50k+ most of it my dad because he signed up/invested a lot right before the financial crisis in ’08.

**THE FAMILY DEBT STARTS HERE**

I was wondering what I could do to help? My mom has a job that is pulling in like 100k+ a year with benefits for the whole family. I want to help them build a budget so we can start tackling the debt more and hopefully pay me back in a reasonable amount of time. We currently are paying off 2 cars pre owned and financed through a credit union with a 1% interest rate for 36 months so around $200 a month on both cars (total of $400) and then the house which we pay mortgage I believe like $500 a month? not sure.

personalfinance,"Minimal Student Debt, Federal Employment, Loan Forgiveness, and Me!","**Situation:** Just finished undergrad and have one year left to complete a masters degree (so, just the thesis remains). This will cost $7200, and will occur while I am abroad on a fellowship. After fellowship grants, the year is budgeted to overrun by roughly $5000. 

Lucky for me I have exactly $12500 in savings, which would cover these two expenses. However; I am unsure of whether or not I should return to the states with $0 in the bank.

I have just signed a contract for employment with the federal government as soon as I return ($71K per year), so I should have an income, but it seems unwise to slide into work without any reserves or cash on hand -- even though I could likely borrow a few thousand from family for getting settled with rent. Because of this, I'm looking at whether or not student loans for the $7200 would be worthwhile, and if I could count on federal employment to 'forgive' any of it.

**Questions:** How much cash on hand should I hope to have when setting out post grad? How easy is it to get [Student Loan Repayment](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/student-loan-repayment/) from the feds as an employee of DoD?

personalfinance,"I have been aggressively paying off student loans over $100,000. After 2 years, here is my progress and future plans.","Hi all - I hope I didn't screw up formatting

TL;DR - Here's a summary and burndown charts of the past 2 years http://imgur.com/a/qHFSP

Paid off $70k in loans in 2 years. I have $40k left.

I looked here for advice back in 2014 when graduated college.  I had over $100,000 total including both federal loans and private student loans ($110,624.88 as of right meow).  I wanted to show my progress and my future plans. 

Some important details - I landed an engineering job out of school after racking up a butt load of student loan debt.  I was paid $69k to start and I'm making 77k after 2 years. Career wise I am doing very well.  I am in a graduate program for an engineering degree. My company is paying for it, but I front the cost and get reimbursed.  It costs $4400 up front.  

I am able to live at home with a car my father bought for me.  I hope to get a few more years out of it. ($1500 present for bday.  Thanks dad).  My bills are as follows:

Car insurance - $935 / year (last year was $1440!!) (pay with tax return and put rest in savings)

Phone - $40/month 

Gym - $140/month - this is not a typo

Gas - $80/month - this is an overestimate

Student Loans - $2500/month

Total = $2760 

Bi Weekly Paycheck = $1900 * 2 = $3800/month

3800-2760 = 1040/month or $260 a week.

Should throw in that I get all the matching bonus from my 401k.  Currently sitting around $20k

I received a gift from relatives of $5000 after college graduation and I paid it all towards a private loan

Being able to spend such a ludicris amount of money a month has been a blessing. I pretend the money doesn't exist, and I am content with the amount I have left after every paycheck (about $650 every two weeks; $1250/bi weekly forloans).

Savings is slacking.  I try to have at least a minimum $3000 in my savings but right now it's at about $2500.  I have a $500 account that I consider an emergency fund but I know its low.
I really don't save any money from my paychecks, but I am able to put certain things into savings.  For example, I get 3 paychecks in one month twice a year.  I put that extra $1250 into my savings.  I also travel for work where I get paid a per diem that is typically way more than I use.  In 2016 I traveled 70 days @ ~$60 a day and this year I've traveled 34 days.  That comes out to an extra $6000. But again I blow that on traveling and so much food.  

The reason my savings doesn't stay so high is because my girlfriend and I like to travel.  With work travel, I get to acculmulate a lot of points.  This has been very successful for us.  (200k Marriott points, a bunch of different airlines, free car rentals).

I also go out for food waaaaaaaaay too much but I've been meal prepping on and off Sundays for the week.  Weekends I still may end up spending over $100 going out.

So that is my situation right now. I am content living without the money I pay towards loans, but I know in the future I can do things to feel more financially secure. I see where I'm slacking with my bad spending habits but shit I'm attributing it to being young.  I'm not frugal by any means and I buy stupid shit.  But I also feel like I can get away with it right now.  Moving out and buying a house is the next step.

Before I talk about that, here is some of the excel stuff I play with.  

http://imgur.com/a/qHFSP

The first image is my summary.  It shows how much I have paid and I have much I have left.  I have 8 months until I am done paying off my private student loans!!  

I've paid almost $70k in loans!  My method was snowball where I paid the minimum payment on every loan except the loan with the highest interest and highest total amount.  That loan I threw $2500-min(otherloans) at it. I honestly don't know how much I could've saved by refinancing but I'm not too worried about it.

The second picture is a burndown of my payments over time, however they are not entirely truthful (but really close!).  I did not start with $110k in debt, but it acculmulated over time.  Unfortunately, there is no data present for interest accrued and I haven't gotten around to writing something to do it. The graph's data includes interest but already accrued to the starting cost.

The third photo is a burndown of the private loans.  Less detailed.  Not sure why I uploaded them.

The plan moving forward is to pay off my private loans completely in 8-9 months.  Once I do that, I plan on paying $1000 a month towards my private loans (minimum is $321.07).  That means it will be a little over 2 years until my loans are completely gone.  I want to save $1500 a month for close to a year so I have maybe $15k to put towards a down payment on a home.  I  have heard that I can take a loan against my 401k as a First Time Home Buyer but I honestly have been a lazy shit and not googled the specifics of this.

With my girlfriend, we have a total household income of $120k (she's an engineer too, so this will eventually be much higher).  She will have about $30k in savings when we plan on looking for homes.  I understand there's a long time between being to look and closing a deal.  

That gives us a total of $45k cash and I'll have about $30k in my 401k (maybe less, idk. market and shit).

I have a solid credit score (750 last check).  I have two credit cards:  Marriott Rewards and Chase Shappire Preferred.

I look forward to buying my first home. Its a new challenge and playing with numbers is kind of fun. Based on rough estimates, we can ""afford"" $1550-$2200 a month (25%-36% of monthly income after taxes) for a mortgage payment.  With that split in half (or % of total income, idk yet but that's an important thing I'm not ignoring) and after student loans are gone, I'd be able to throw a lot into savings.

Questions:

I was wondering what kind of interest rates and numbers I can expect as a first time home buyer. GF has good credit as well and no outstanding debt (is that the same thing? idk)?  Are there any numbers I can estimate with that I can play with?  I've seen online calculators but I'm not sure how accurate their 3.7% interest rate is on a 30 year mortgage.

Also how important is 20% down payment?

Any details I should know about borrowing from 401k for down payment on first home?

How much $$ could I have saved if I consolidated my private loans?

More out there question: I feel a little worried about my spending habits.  I track everything with mint, but I despise looking at my spending history.  I see the numbers of my credit card bill and just pay it off.  Sometimes I dip into my savings to cover costs and I get into this thinking that ""oh next week I get paid and I'll spend less"" but I rarely do.  Does anyone else feel this way? I feel like I'm chasing paying off debt but I never catch the dragon. But I've also never missed a payment or anything.  

Also wanted to say thanks guys for all this very valuable information you provide. It's been a great resource.  I know I rambled a bit, probably should've organized this better but it's late. I'm tired. Oh well.

Any comments or feedback would be great.

litecoin,Litecoin Foundation Pledge Drive!,"Hey everyone!  About 2 months ago I posted [My Call To Arms: An Action Plan to Contact Businesses](https://redd.it/6esl9d) and it went pretty well.  We contacted over 50 businesses!  It was perfect timing too because it was right before LTC jumped to the $30's.


&amp;nbsp;


Anyways, I'm posting here to start another campaign.  I was talking with u/drcpperpot and he had a great idea to use MAST to get about 6000 redditors to donate about .1 LTC to the Litecoin Foundation which would be sent once the address hit 600LTC.  We thought this would be an awesome demonstration of a use case for MAST...but alas, MAST is still unavailable.  So instead, this is what I propose to my LTC community.


&amp;nbsp;

# The #'s

1. Litecoin Foundation’s total assets is about [$176,000]( https://litecoin-foundation.org/2017/07/financial-statements-2017-06/)  

2. There are 44,000 subscribers to this sub.  

3. If we each donated .2 LTC that would give the Litecoin Foundation over $500000.  But let's make the goal 999LTC to be a little more realistic.

4. This would nearly double their fund.

5. And we all know that well fed dev’s = a well developed LTC

# My Proposal

1. Comment below with your LTC pledge to the LTC Foundation.  Then update us with a screenshot of your transaction to the Litecoin Donation address to earn a pat on the shoulder from a member of the LTC community!  You can use imgur to host your pictures.

2. Ecurrencyhodler’s Special:  For the first 50 people to pledge and donate 1 LTC, I will send .02LTC back to you!  I need a screenshot of your transaction which includes your address and the foundation's address as well as for you to post your address so I can confirm and copy/paste it into my wallet.

3. Lastly, tweet it out to see if we can get others to join in on the #LTCPledge!

# My One Request to u/coblee

1. Charlie, if you're reading this.  We want to tell you that we love you, support you, and that your last couple of interviews were pretty good!  But take a couple grand from our donations and get some PR training so you can get even more comfortable in the hot seat!

personalfinance,How to pay off 720k in student loans.,"Made an account specifically for this. 

In four years of undergraduate, I managed to rack up 720,000 in student loans that I have to start paying back in 2 months. They were through a private loan company. I don't know how I'm going to be able to do it. My monthly payments are nearly 3k. 

Basically, I'm screwed. 

I make 36,000 a year from my regular job and then a few thousand more to that from a freelance side hustle. This is barely enough for me to survive as it is. I don't see any options for me short of just straight up killing myself at this point. I don't want to default because my dad was my cosigner and I couldn't do that to him. Is there anything I can do to lower my monthly payments or get it forgiven? I know forgiveness is a long shot but I'll try anything. Thanks 

EDIT: 8 30k loans, at 11.75 percent interest. with my interest rate they are roughly 90k that I have to pay back. I went to a private arts school for 4 years and paid housing all four years. 8 loans because I took them out per semester.

personalfinance,Refinance student loans for minimum monthly payment to save for cross country move,"Hello Personal Finance gurus,

I have a job opportunity coming up on the west coast that is going to pay me 20-30 dollars more per hour or more and simultaneously cost of living is so low I'm going to finally be able to afford to buy a house instead of rent. This is optimal as cost of living out here is more expensive and wages for what I do are lower considerably.

The catch is they're not offering me a relocation or sign on bonus to cushion the cost of moving my family of 3 from the suburbs of NYC to California. After checking with lots of moving options we've decided to downsize all of our things and rent a Uhaul trailer and lug it across country. Total cost is looking to be around 2,000 including gas, lodging, food etc. To get a POD or do a container ship is minimum 4,000 for the distance we are moving.

My credit rating is looking really good these days so I've been looking into refinancing my student loans. One of the options is to take out a variable loan for a 20 year term. This would cut my monthly payments by 75%. 

My question to you is, should I do this to save for the move/apply for a mortgage then with my considerably higher salary pay off my student loans early or is it a bad idea? The new job isn't that stern on when they want me to start, but they gave me a start date of January or May.

So, if my plan is to pay off my student loans early anyway, should I take out a variable interest rate max term student loan to decrease my monthly payments so I can save for this cross country move and put this small monthly payment down on my mortgage app when I am in the market to buy a home?",finance

QUESTION 1: have I missed something?

QUESTION 2: if I include weekly agency this works out £12, 060 annually. From what I understand I can only be taxed if I earn over £11,500. So.. would I be better off ensuring I stay under this threshold?

QUESTION 3: tied with Q2. Would I basically be taxed on my agency/apprenticeship income regardless and receive compensation AFTERWARDS? Because I really need to know if the above numbers are accurate representations.


QUESTION 3: what is a reasonable amount to save from the above as I basically have none?

Let's do some maths !

Like we see in this topic : https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/9165/how-much-money-is-wire-transferred-every-year-worldwide/9184
There are three principal money exchange technology in the world.
We can recap with the following chart the total volume of money circulating trought these techs by day and by year. (In trilion of dollar : 1,000,000,000,000$ represented by ""t"" symbol in the chart)
Precision : 1 year = 250 days

                DAY     YEAR
    SWIFT       5t      1250t
    FEDWIRE     3.6t    900t
    CHIPS       1.6t    400t
    --------------------------
    TOTAL       10.2t   2550t

Compare to XRP :
Approximatively 100 millions dollars by day 
so 0.0001 trillion dollars by day 
and 0.025 trillion dollars by year.

                DAY       YEAR
    SWIFT       5t        1250t
    FEDWIRE     3.6t      900t
    CHIPS       1.6t      400t
    XRP         0.0001t   0.025t
    --------------------------
    TOTAL       10.2t     2550t

There are a total of 100 billion XRP in total but only 38 billions (0.038t) in circulation.
If we take the actual price of a XRP (approximation) : 0.17$ for 1 XRP.
So the market cap : 0.17 * 0.038 = 0.00646 t

Imagine XRP take just 1% of the daily global market exchange volume, it would result of 0.102t per day (10.2t / 100)

Now take the XRP transaction by day and the market cap.
If 0.0001 transaction per day give 0.00646t market cap, 0.102t transaction per day give 6.59t of market cap.

Let's divide this new market cap by the total amout of XRP (0.038t)

6.59t / 0.038t = **173$**

**CONCLUSION : If XRP take only 1% of the daily global money exchange market, The value of 1 XRP will be 173$**

personalfinance,Should I consider refinancing my mortgage at a higher rate to get rid of PMI?,"Hi All,
 I bought my house in August 2015 for $390k. Not having 20%, I did 3.5% down not realizing that the FHA loan I was taking would carry PMI for the duration of the loan. I thought once I had more than 20% in equity in the house the PMI would drop off but apparently with my loan the only way to get rid of the PMI is to refinance. Luckily, I got an awesome rate at 3.25% fixed for 30 years.

My original loan amount was for $383k and I currently have less than $365k on the principal balance. My house is currently worth $450-475k. I pay $259 every month in PMI which kills me inside.

I am currently paying off student loans and thus not contributing anything extra at this time. My long term plans for this house is to rent it out once I am able to purchase a ""better"" house. My current monthly payment is $2,340 and I can easily rent this place for about $2,700. 

Is it worth looking to refinance the house right now to get rid of the PMI? I don't think I could get the same rate I have now, but would the higher rate be worth it? 

Edit: I'm not sure if this is possible but another idea is to take some equity I have out to pay off student loans + car loan and have only a single payment at a lower interest rate. Currently I have $13k at 6.21%, $21k at 5.84% and $12k at 4.24%. I'm currently snowballing the $13k at 6.21% and doing minimums on the other two to pay off the highest interest first.

My next goal is to use the snowball method to pay off our credit card, student loans, cars, and other debts until all we have left is the house loan. The method we are going to use is to start with smallest balance and build up from there. 

I am a very visual person and would like to build a spreadsheet showing our balances. Monthly payments interest rates and what we should pay over to start  and then as each debt is scheduled to be finished or closed move that payment to the next line and apply to next loan going forward. Only thing is for the life of me I cannot figure out the formulas for this in excel.  Anyone here have experience with this?",finance

Now to the point. My car is on its last legs. I've had it for around 4 years and I loved it. I have done several repairs on it and my mechanic told me that there's probably plenty more coming in the future. Anyways, it's not that important. I need another car.

I've found a used car I really like. I've found 3 actually, the lowest one being 5000$ and the highest one being 7000$. I still have yet to test drive the 5000$ one, I am going this saturday.

My bank is supposedly very good with auto loans (Navy federal Credit union), I've asked plenty of my friends and they can attest to it. I'm not against getting a loan through a dealer, but I am a little skeeved by the idea of car salesmen. I cannot trust them.

personalfinance,What are the implications of filing as an independent in college?,"Hello everyone! Long story short my mother wants to switch to medicare because her work health insurance is ridiculously expensive. I am 20 years old going on 21 next month, in college, living at her house, in Illinois. I take care of all the costs of college myself, there is not a single loan or document in her name. I do get federal aid and loans.

For the past years she has always claimed me as a dependent, and taken my college tax credits I believe. This year I got a nicely paying side job and I think I'll have made a little under 10k by the end of the fiscal year. In order for her to qualify for medicare she wants me to file independent.

I was hoping to get advice from this sub on how this would affect me financially. Is this something I should push against or is it beneficial? Is the healthcare stuff going to work out for me? (If I have to pay for school insurance I can't afford college tuition anymore, meaning I'd be taking on 5 extra k or so in private loans). Might it affect her negatively (making 40k a year before taxes)?

Is there anything illegal about this? Outside of housing I pretty much provide for myself.

Let me know if there's extra information needed.",finance
personalfinance,"In a purely financial sense, joining the military makes a ton of sense, right?","So a bit of background: I'm a 26-nearly-27-year-old former enlisted Marine (5 years active duty) about to start my master's degree in mechanical engineering. I'm also a Pathways Intern with the federal government, which means that I can, with a pretty high degree of confidence, expect to convert to a full-time employee at my agency at the GS-9 level at the end of my program in June, and rise to the GS-12 level in a year and a half after that. 

For reasons, I've also been looking at getting back into the military game, and in the course of my research I decided to compare pay and benefits to see if I would be as able to support my family in the armed forces as I would with my civil service career track. On the face of it, the base pay of a brand new O-1E would be quite the pay cut compared to a GS-12. However, after factoring in the housing allowance and/or free/cheap base housing  (I'm honestly not exactly sure how housing works, especially for officers. I lived in the barracks back in the day) the pay suddenly becomes very comparable, and that's before considering the tax-free nature of the housing allowance and any other allowances I may be recipient of. Add on to that the lack of having to pay for healthcare and the military starts to look pretty good. The disparity gets even bigger as I would climb the ranks.

And of course there's the DoD retirement schedule. You can retire with 50% pay after 20 years in. Compare that to FERS, which would take about 45-50 years to get the same deal (and at a likelier lower pay rate). The DoD doesn't have the 5% match for service members that the civil service does, but it seems that's overcome by the pay disparity and tax benefits. 

Obviously there are other things to consider, such as work-life balance, having to move kids around all the time, and my spouse's career interests (my spouse is an aspiring artist, so she works for herself; the hard part is breaking in, which can be hard to do when moving around all of the time, often to places without an established or emerging art scene). These are separate conversations to have, and are weighted just as much, if not more, than the money issue. But this is r/personalfinance, not r/worklife or r/kids, so I'm after the dollars and cents question here. 

Am I right in my estimation, or is there some big piece of the puzzle that I'm missing?

personalfinance,My debt payoff progress,"In January 2017, I decided to start using YNAB as my budget tool. I had 12 (yes, 12) open accounts. Mind you, I have never been to college, so I don't have any school debt. Yes, I was a moron. Yes, I was horrible at budgeting. Yes, this was incredibly stupid. No, I don't have anything to show for all of this debt.

I think all that matters is that I chose to do something about it. I kept paying the minimum payments for a very long time, and this didn't change anything. I can't change the past, but I can make my future better by becoming debt free. Already in 7 months I have seen major improvements in my life. My family doesn't live paycheck to paycheck anymore and we don't add to our credit card debt anymore.

We started with $19,877.72 in credit card debt, $6896.24 in car debt, and $1,374.71 in medical debt. Totaling $28,148.67.

As of July 31st, 2017, our total debt is down to $20,655.69.

I stole a spreadsheet outline from a post here (I don't know where, I never kept track. If someone recognizes the spreadsheet, I would be very happy to credit the redditor) and started to track every payments and debt that I had. I've linked the different spreadsheet tabs below.

My progress may seem slow to some, but this is faster than I have ever paid my debt before. I'm hoping that in 3 years I can be completely free of all my debt. I'm not looking for any advice right now, but I thought I would share my tracking tools with everyone.

P.S. I thought about consolidating my debts at first. I would have had a minimum payment of over $850 for 5 years (minus my medical debt). At the end of July, my minimum payments were at $670.81. I totally recommend doing it yourself if at all possible.",finance

personalfinance,[Debt] 26 years old. Swimming in credit card debt. Requesting advice on how to move forward.,"Hi All,

I have a lot of debt and it is giving me stress and anxiety. Just about all of it came from online gambling which I stopped many months ago. I sought professional help, my family has access to all of my financial accounts and they are helping me kill the habit. BUT what’s done is done. Hoping I can get some financial direction and some better peace of mind. 

I am 26 and I make $75k a year as a developer. My paychecks are barely under $4k a month after health insurance, 401K and all that.

My expenses probably hover around $2k a month. I basically keep ~$200 in my bank account at all times and as I get paid I throw it all at my credit cards.

&amp;nbsp;

Current debt:

Mastercard $19,000 – (3% interest rate until March 2018)

Chase Credit Card (Primary card) – $10,000 (20% Interest rate)

Chase Slate Credit Card - $2,500 (balance transfer 0% interest until May 2018)

 Bank of America Mastercard - $2,000 (balance transfer 0% interest until May 2018)

Student Loans - $2,500 (paid off principal. Lowest priority)

Total debt  - $36,000

&amp;nbsp;

I am doing the best I can to lower my expenses and increase the amount I am able to throw at these each month. This is still a lot of debt. My friend recommended I try to take out a credit card consolidation loan for my current card at $10K. Do I do that? Or do I hang tight and just continue paying off as much as I can each month and hope I can be out of debt by the time I am 29?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Does it ever make sense to put a larger (&gt; 20%) down payment on a house to reduce monthly payments and increase cash flow?,"Hey PF -

A house purchase will likely be happening for my soon-to-be spouse and I in the next ~2 years. Keeping as much of the nitty-gritty monetary details out of it as possible, I just wanted some of your thoughts/opinions on a strategy that my SO and I have discussed over the past few days. So let's get into it!

We've accumulated what I believe to be a relatively large amount of cash savings over the past 5 years while living well-below our means in preparation for a future home purchase. Houses that fit our long-term goals/dreams would likely result in a mortgage+property tax+insurance of ~40% of our take home pay if we put the standard 20% down (without reducing retirement contributions, etc. which we are maxing right now). I know that 40% of your take home pay on housing is quite (read:very) high. Some people do it, I'm sure, but numbers like that would likely make me feel house poor due to not having a ton of money left after making those monthly payments.

Now here's the strategy we've discussed: What if we put more like 40% down on the house in order to reduce mortgage payments and yield more cash flow on a month-to-month basis? Here are my thoughts:


Advantages:

* Less of a loan to pay off across the life of the loan

* Smaller monthly payments (hopefully more like 20-25% of take home pay on the mortgage) --&gt; increased cash flow on a monthly basis


Disadvantages: 

* Yes, the extra cash that we'd be putting toward the down payment could be invested and likely yield a much higher return in the market. Putting more down on the house would technically be a guaranteed return equal to the interest rate on the mortgage, though!

* More disadvantages...? Enlighten me.

Curious to hear your thoughts/opinions on a strategy like this. Theoretically, a solution would be to buy a less expensive house, put 20% down, invest the rest of our excess cash in the market, and have the affordable monthly payments that we are seeking. However, as I mentioned above, the house of our dreams/the house that fits best with our future goals costs more than that, and since we have the extra cash available to us for that big down payment, I see this as a potentially viable solution.

personalfinance,18% interest on a fully cash-secured loan??,"A friend of mine was trying to get a loan for somewhere around $20-$25,000. Since he doesn't have much credit history at all, his parents were willing to help him out by putting up the cash to fully secure the loan. The bank came back and said it would be an 18% interest rate because of his bad credit. He questioned why his credit factors matters at all since the loan in fully secured, but they said they still base the interest rate off of his credit. With a rate like that it's almost as if they aren't even considering the securitization at all. This was at a local credit union, but he said that they also spoke to another bank who gave a similar answer. 

For the life of me I cannot think of a reason for this at ALL other than possibly seeking higher profits, but even that explanation doesn't hold up to scrutiny. The bank would be taking ZERO risk, but they still demand 18% interest (possibly on top of the interest the frozen 20k is earning?). It seems the only ""role"" the bank would play would be handling the administrative overhead of payments and billing.

I mean, the only real advantage of going the secured loan route versus his parents just loaning him the money personally would be that the loan would help build his credit, which is exactly the reason they were even going down this route in the first place. Since a high interest rate would just encourage people to eschew the banks altogether, I can't see how it makes sense even from a greed angle. If the bank offered him 5% instead, they would still be able to make slightly less then 5% in risk free profit compared to the nothing that they'll be getting now..

It just feels like there's a huge piece to this puzzle that I'm missing. I can't even find a similar issue mentioned in search engine results, so I was wondering if anyone here had some insight into this. 

Some additional information if it adds any more insight:

* His parents have great credit and are also willing to cosign, which I don't even know what the purpose would be for.

* Early 30's with stable employment and over 4+ years with the same employer.

* Frequent renter, but I have no knowledge of him ever being evicted, or even missing a rent payment.

* No other outstanding debt

* His credit issues are due more to a lack of credit as opposed to a failure to pay, bankruptcy, default, etc. I think he may have had a single credit card (with a low limit) that he racked up some debt on. He probably missed some payments and possibly could have defaulted on some of it, but I'm not sure either way. This was also MANY years ago, I'd even estimate more than seven.

*  One other possibility is that he is receiving some misinformation (intentionally or otherwise) as I haven't been able to look at any of the documentation.",finance

Federal: Pension; unsure if I pay into pension, SS, TPS (401K for government) with 4-5% match

I guess I still just don't know about all of the benefits of either package at this point. For the federal package, I am unsure if I actually pay into the pension and if so, how much. Initially it seems like federal package health insurance upon retirement is cheaper.

If you work for the federal government I would love to hear what you think about your FERS package and same for UCD. I am not anywhere ready for retirement, but man, I would love to be prepared and not ever have to worry about money like my parents do.

If I am missing anything else pertinent, feel free to mention it!",finance
personalfinance,"Thinking about consolidating student loans, should I pay off high interest loans beforehand?","I have about $59K in debt from undergrad as well as my first year in law school. I'm about to have an additional $20K added on for my second year (starting this month!) totaling something around $80K in debt. My partner and I have about $15K in savings and  $20K in retirement funds (which we hope to draw upon once we're ready to take advantage of the first time home buyer benefits they provide of withdrawing without penalty). 

Our question is this: if my partner is in a position to pay about $10K of this debt down over the next year (due to their current earnings), should we focus on paying off the higher interest rate loans first (approximately 6.8%) and then work with the creditors to consolidate my loans? Would that result in an overall lower consolidated rate if the higher interest rate loans have been paid off by the time we consolidate? 

If not - are there any other recommendations you have for paying this debt down strategically aside from paying almost double their monthly payments? While in law school - interest still accrues but no payments are due. We'd like to get ahead and pay them down as much as possible before the actual payments begin again.",finance

personalfinance,"My husband has a good credit score, why do they keep asking for a co signer?","So basically, to be fair my husband is an immigrant so his credit is fairly new. My credit sucks. Around 600 and I have a bit of debt. I pay all my stuff on time, but I'm currently not working and debt to income ratio sucks when I work anyway. I never made enough.

I made sure my husbands credit looked good. His score shows up at 713. Which imho is good. That's Experian, Transunion it's even higher. His income isn't that great, but his debt to income ratio isn't terrible like mine was. The only debt he has is an auto loan and a credit card we pay off every month and never utilize over 30%. The auto loan is a 16% interest rate and it's killing us. We are literally getting charged more every month in interest. We wanted to refinance and they would have been able to lower the interest rate to 3.9% but we needed a co signer. Well that's not possible. :\ So now my question is, is it because he's only been here for a year that they're not trusting him to this car loan? Otherwise, I feel like we've done everything right... so I don't understand why we need a co signer. They're not like this with everyone, right? :\ I've managed to get refinanced in the past without a co signer in a far worse situation so I'm really confused why this is happening. :( I was hoping someone here who perhaps works in finance can give me more insight.",finance
personalfinance,Owning a pet doesn't have to be expensive,"This is mostly reaction to the post today about the  guy that surrendered his dog. In the discussions that followed I saw some outrageous claims about the cost of owning a pet. I think all these claims will scare people away from rescuing a pet from the pound. There are levels to pet ownership. So here is my rundown and before anyone says it, I was lucky to have 18 accident free years with my dog. I am just going to talk about my day to day and year to year expenses. 

Upfront... He was a mutt so adoption was only $70 and that covered all shots for the first year.

* Vet visit - $40/year

* Rabies shot - $40 every 3 years

* Flea medicine - $70 every 3 months

* Dog food -$40/mo (I fed him higher end stuff this can be done cheaper)  

* Treats - $90/year (Greenies, tiny size even though he was a large dog)

* I groomed all that massive fur, clipped his nails and brushed his teeth with baking soda so the costs were minimal.

* Toys came from Goodwill maybe $10/year

No dog walker and no doggie daycare. I did put him in a kennel when I used to travel a lot, but work paid for that. If they weren't gonna pay, I wasn't gonna accept the trip. 

My vet was cheap because I went to a vet in a lower middle class area. I did this after a new vet tried to force me into a ""senior wellness check"" after she learned the age of my dog, even though she had just remarked how healthy he was and undercut his age by 5 years. Vets in less affluent areas do a great job, love animals, but don't try to upsell their clients on unnecessary upgrades.  (I didn't have insurance because by the time I thought about it, he was too old to insure. I'll definitely get it with my next dog.)

I put him down at 18 years when I learned that paying for extra care would have gotten him only 2 - 3 more months of life. 

So there you go, less than $1000/year if you put time and effort into it. Pets are not expensive if you don't want them to be.",finance
personalfinance,Is my dream car worth buying?,"Hello! I’m in need of advice. I want to purchase my dream car, a Hyundai Genesis Coupe 3.8L. I currently own a 2008 Hyundai Sonata and will be making my first car payment soon. I took a loan out of $6000 to pay for the vehicle outright, which was purchased from a family member. Today I was getting an oil change and decided to test drive this Genesis Coupe which I loved. It’s a 2015 with 751 miles on it. Unfortunately, such low mileage gives the dealership a reason to whole it’s value. They’re currently selling it for about $30,000 but the KBB is $23,000. I make $600 a month after bills and expenses.

So effectively, I put in $110, to get $150 in my 401k.  Am I right in thinking that I'm getting free money from the government (both state and fed) for contributing to my 401k?  At least in the short term, before I start withdrawing when I'm 65 and I need to pay taxes again.",finance

personalfinance,Going back to school for 3 years - should I take out loans or use savings?,"Hi everyone,

This is my first reddit thread, so sorry if I make mistakes!

I am in my mid-twenties, married and live in one of the most expensive areas in the US (it ranks #1 on some lists). I have a bachelors and currently make a pretty darn decent salary (about $95k pre-tax) although my position has no benefits; my husband makes around $75k and has pretty good job security. We have no kids. For this reason, we have been able to save a pretty decent amount and to pay off a large portion of my school debts (I have about $35k in debt left, but all with low [but variable] interest rates - 5.5% being the highest). We live in an apartment and yes -- the cost of it totally blows. I have toyed with the idea of using our savings for a down payment, but since I am about to enter a time of less financial stability, we have decided against it. 

I am going back to school for a doctorate in January. It is a 3 year program and it is impossible to work for the last 2.5 years. I will likely only be able to do part-time work even in the first semester. After I graduate, my income potential will have increased dramatically, with starting salaries around $140-150k, so assuming I get through school with no major emergencies, we will be financially quite comfortable coming out, even with a substantial loan burden. In this area with just my husbands salary, we will be able to pay most of our expenses while I'm in school, but we won't cover my school costs and will need some for living expenses as well. (If you're wondering where my salary is currently going, we have been saving as much as possible and also paying off a substantial part of our debt. We also put some of it towards charitable contributions). 

We should have about $35k saved when I start school. My inclination is to save this as an emergency fund and to take out more loans (we have excellent credit so this shouldn't be a problem), but I could use it to pay school expenses for the first few years. (I am going to a state school so it is relatively affordable). I could also use it to pay off all my remaining debt, but that seems unwise to me.

If I save it for an emergency fund, is there a way I should invest it? I just have it in a savings account atm. 

Moving out of this area is not an option (unfortunately! haha). 

tldr: going back to school for 3 years; should I use my current $35k to pay for school costs, or should I keep it as an emergency fund and take on more debt? Also, if I use it as an emergency fund, how should I properly invest it? I currently have it in your average run-of-the-mill savings account with paltry interest.",finance

Once the deal is signed each individual is going get $10,000 after taxes. 

Something to note about my situation is that musicians generally don't make a monthly income (something I'm working on changing with commercial royalties) so we usually have to really stretch the bigger checks as long as we can.

As far as expenses they are extremely low at this moment in time, I currently have a great living situation staying in my managers house rent free. I make all of my own food and spend about $50 -$75 a week on groceries, subway tickets are about $20 a week. So the smallest amount I can live off of per month is $400 

So I have $1250 of 0% interest credit card debt that I've been slowly paying down, $2500 personal loan which is also 0% interest and an $11,000 federal student loan.

personalfinance,"Single dad starting over, but still drowning.","I'm currently going through a divorce, though I have full custody of my kids, ages 6 and 4.  Their mother is not involved and going in and out of jail with occasional work at carnivals.  No help from her in any sense since I took custody, and since I'm disabled,  as is my 6 yr old son, we only receive a fixed income and she is not required to help.  The people I was mutually helping with living arrangements and phone use have left us so I am trying to work out how to do bills and debt without their added income and what I should drop.

I bring in 972 a month and the rest of my disability was divided into 190 for each child.  my son is on SSI for 293 a month.  

I still have a car payment from when I was married and working on 2 incomes of 373.21 for a 2015 jeep patriot which is killing me, though I am unsure the best way to get rid of it since I still owe 16 grand on it and it is only worth 6 grand as a trade in.  The insurance luckily is only 80 a month.

I pay 150 for a phone bill that has my former house mates phone on it which they will still supposedly pay me 50 a month for.  I can't take it off my line without incurring a penalty I can not afford.  I already lowered it to 1g a month, their lowest costing plan.

I have 2 more months of a 275 a month power bill that was on a budget plan.  they stiffed me on the last few bills despite being the only ones at the residence for the majority of the time.  After this it appears my usage is only around 90 a month with an AC running in July.  

Propane gas for the stove is 150 every few months.  

Gas heat is covered by Heap, though I have pays about 100 of my own money for it last winter.

I have 100 a month I use to pay off a loan to consolidate my credit cards from when I was married.

I pay 150 for internet, cable, phone.  Nothing fancy, just the non premium channels and 60mbps internet.  

I pay 50 a month to a debt collection agency in Tennessee(back in NY now) for old hospital debts after being attacked by my ex wife before the separation.  

I currently pay 100 a month for a couch from rent a center that was purchased prior to this madness and I am cancelling and returning after this month is up.  

Our food is purchased with foodstamps, or wic.  it averages to about 350 a month, and our insurance is covered by medicaid or medicare.  And we use roughly 40 a month in gas riding into town only for doctors and food shopping.  

and finally I pay 700 for rent.  The property is owned by a family member and all payments go towards paying off the mortgage and then they are going to transfer it to my name if I can't get a home loan before to just buy it outright.  

my credit is around the 630 range and I want to try to get a home loan, but I don't think it would be possible, even for the 80 thousand remainder he is asking.  

If there are any ideas as to what I can do to improve my situation it would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"Defaulted on old student loans, considering going back to school. Please help.","Hello Reddit,

I feel like I am at the bottom of a neverending financial pit. To make a long story short, I am 28 years old and have been re-admitted to the college program I was in when I was 18 out of school. I'll save you the sad story, but for personal reasons entirely of my own doing, I was in an abusive relationship and needed to drop out of college during my first semester, second year, thus putting my loans into default when I couldn't pay them off at the rate they wanted after the grace period. After nearly 10 years of garnished wages and rehabilitation programs later, they're no longer garnishing my wages, but I do owe nearly 300/month on my loans. I make 13.00/hour (this is the most I have ever made since then) at a job I hate. I want to go back to school since I am in a good place now, co-own a house with my kind boyfriend who I've been with for over 4 years (only his name is on the deed but we split the mortgage/bills), and I need to get out of this job and get into something where I can make money. At least enough money to support the goal we have of someday having a child. He makes a decent wage, but I have about 30 dollars worth of disposable income after paying all bills. This is no exaggeration, which is where my issue comes into play.

I am not eligible for any more federal student loans or grants since I defaulted on the last loans and did not fulfill the grants by having to withdraw from school. The school I am going to - the only school to have readmitted me also, for the record - is going to put me into about 100k worth of student loan debt. I will need to get a private loan since the school did provide me with 24,000 in scholarship money but it will not be enough to cover the full cost (private school - I tried getting into multiple state schools and was rejected. I don't know why - I am now a non-traditional student and I had good grades in high school. I am assuming because my mess of a previous college transcript.) My parents are not willing to co-sign anything for me. When it went off their income (FAFSA), that was fine, but even in discussing the option with them I was immediately shut down and told they are unwilling to do so, no further discussion to be had. My sister also had financial issues back when she was in college and the entire thing left a bad taste in her mouth.

I guess the main question I have here is, is it worth it? Putting myself into that much MORE debt on top of what I already have? For what it's worth, it is a degree in one of the top science programs in the country, not just my state. I have no doubt I'll be able to find a good job paying at least 70k upon graduation, but I'm scared and I'm getting older and I do not know what to do at this point other than to ask for solid opinions. I would still need a co-signer since my credit never repaired from back then, and talking to my boyfriend about it is an option, but right now I just need some sound advice on where to go from here. I feel lost and like I will never get out of this. Please help.",finance

What options do I have other than just putting it into a brokerage account and putting it in index funds and bonds, just like my IRA and 401(k)? I've got pretty serious anxiety about tossing it in as a lump sum, and I'm also concerned about tax headaches.

We have means to make a down payment on a new place without using this money.  However, if I use the $125,000 as part of a down payment, our mortgage payments monthly would (perhaps obviously) be much lower.  I can get a mortgage rate of less than 4%.

personalfinance,Federal College Loan Advice,"Hey there r/personalfinance, I was hoping someone could give me some insight on what I should do this upcoming school year with my federal college loan. 

It was originally about $5000, but for this year it has been increased to $7500. I currently have gotten just enough money together to cover both of the next 2 semesters with the original loan. My parents help me with food and housing so I don't have to worry about that (thanks mom and dad).

However, now with this new loan amount, I could have some extra money left over that I could put towards saving up so I can cover one or possibly even both of the 2018-2019 semesters. I am uneasy about this decision though, because there is no guarantee I will make enough money by then, and I will be taking out an even bigger loan with a bigger interest rate than previous years. 

What insight do you have for this?",finance

financialindependence,22 - Want to pave the road to financial independence,"Hello everyone,

Here is some relevant information: 

- I'm a Canadian resident
- I make about 73K after taxes
- I'm lucky enough to work for a big insurance company which contributes $24k/yr toward my pension (their pension plan), so I don't have to.

Finances:

- I currently live with my parents.
- I currently owe 164k (at an interest rate of 2.69%) on a rental property which brings in $1,400/month ($892 mortgage+property tax, $166 home insurance, net profit before unexpected repairs/issues is about $350).
- 30k in savings (I plan to put $16.4k of this into my mortgage, as I'm allowed to put down 10% of my mortgage principal per year)
- My plan is to pay off the rental property within the next three years, my only expense is an average of $500/month for my credit card.

Planned future expenses:

- $2k/month for living expenses
- $200/month for internet + phone
- $1k/month for travel/other

Am I thinking too ahead? I honestly would just love to retire as early as possible, but I don't want to need to go back to work. What projections should I be looking at and are my future expense projections unrealistic? 

Side note: I love investing in real estate, I've been a landlord for two years now and honestly the income has been very passive, however, I do realise I may have just gotten lucky and my next purchase may not be as successful.",finance

I have a question about how to most efficiently tackle some credit card debt. I have two credit cards:  
#1 $9000 @ 20%  
#2 $3300 @ 22%  
  
I have over $1000 in an emergency fund. I use credit card #1 for most of my expenses, and was planning on using the extra money I'm making this summer to pay down the bigger debt more aggressively, but also just kind of throw money at both and get them both lower. My question is: should I be throwing all my weight at the higher interest rate balance? I use #1 because of the miles (I travel often) and I make more than enough to pay all my monthly expenditures plus the interest charged on that card. Should I be devoting whatever is left over to #2?

So, I bought a car two weeks ago (July 19) and thought all was going well. Then this evening I received a call and an email from the dealership stating that,

I looked over the contract and all the paperwork, there is no smudge or mistake. I replied asking for a copy of the mistake, as well as the ""new"" contract they want me to sign. 

I did put down a large downpayment (20%) on the car, as well as a trade in ($700). I'm pretty sure the trade-in wasn't worth what they gave me, but they accepted it.

This is my first time buying a car on my own. I'm worried that they're going to try and change the APR or something else. 

My first payment isn't due until September 2, but someone suggested that I should make the first payment as soon as possible, and then I'm locked in.

I emailed the dealership after-hours, so I won't hear back from them until tomorrow.

What are my options? 
Do I need to sign a new contract?
What will happen if I don't?

I feel like paying into the house is the safer/easier thing. I don't want to get into anything too risky, and I've never really invested in anything myself before, so it can't be anything too complicated.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin investigative/cop drama [Humor],"I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.

“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”

“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”

“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”

The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”

“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”

“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”

He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”

I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.

“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.

“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.

“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”

It didn’t seem like they did.

“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”

Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.

I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.

“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.

Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.

“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.

I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”

He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.

“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”

“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.

“Because I was afraid.”

“Afraid?”

“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”

I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.

“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”

He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Too old to finally be in the position to start paying student loans. Is it beneficial credit-wise to pay slowly?,"Well, I'm in my mid-30's and I've only just reached a point where I can re-start paying my loans, and actually get it done this time. I paid them religiously for years, and always above the minimum amount, so when I went on hiatus from paying 3 years ago, I owed ~$4,500 (giver take), and wasn't marked as being delinquent a single time, despite never paying. Seems I had paid my way so far in advance, that 3 years of non-payment never got me behind, and I was only stuck with paying the interest. 

So, that said, I scored a job recently and I'm now making around $4k/month, and I want to get this thing taken care of. Until a few months ago, my interest rates were stupidly low, like 1.6% (unfair to others, I know). But since my rates were not fixed, they hiked them up a few months ago to a staggering 3.28% (I don't actually know if that's bad, but it's double what I was paying).

So here's where I'm at:

I now owe $5,019. My personal expenses are rather low, so it wouldn't be too hard to throw $1,500/month at them and knock them out in a few months. On the other hand, my credit has never been stellar, and I understand that paying one's loans in a timely fashion helps that sorta thing. The question here is simple... Is it wise to get rid of this debt ASAP? Or suffer another one or two hundred bucks in interest over the next year and a half, and pay $300-$400 per month? Do I do the same good to my credit to just pay it off fast, or do I look better if I pay consistently for the next 12-16 months?

And while I'm at it, has not being delinquent (but not paying a dime) over the last 3 years impacted my credit in any way, good or bad?

personalfinance,Should I Really Have To Pay?,"Hello, I thought long and hard about whether this would be better suited for r/relationships or r/legaladvice but as I'm not too concerned with conserving a relationship anf I don't believe there's a legal issue at play, I'm curious what everyone's opinion on this situation is:

So on a day that I had to work, my wife asked one of her friend's if she could help her learn how to drive, as my wife had her learner's permit at this time. She was uninsured as she did not have a license but her friend checked her policy and she was covered as a ""permissive user"" in the state of CA and under her plan. 

Long story short, my wife started getting dizzy, so she asked to pull over. Her friend and her husband guided her to a liquor store parking lot. She was still a little awkward when she parked so she was told to back the car up a little. In her dizziness, she accidentally accelerated instead of reversing and ended up crashing into the wall of the liquor store. Thankfully, no one was hurt, the damage to the wall was mainly cosmetic, however, the car had some serious damage to the front. 

So at this point, my wife's friend was consoling her, telling her it was okay, and that they had the most expensive full coverage policy from AAA so it shouldn't be a problem. Her husband on the other hand, didn't seem too calm about it, but kept his silence that day. Afterwards, they let us know that they had a $500 deductible that they needed to pay before the insurance would fix the car. We told them that we would gladly pay it as soon as we had the money, as our financial situation has been a little tight lately. 

However, 2 weeks go by and we come to find out that they never got the car fixed and instead it was declared a total loss. From what my wife and her friend discussed, apparently the car was bought at a terrible high interest rate 3yrs before her friend and this guy got married. So at the time of the accident, the car loan was in the value of ~$8500, while the Kelly Blue Book value of the car was only ~$4500. So very recently, this guy messages me that, ""as we said we would pay him for the damages"", that he considers $3000 to be a fair value for the total loss. However, in the same message, he goes on to tell me that:

""We had payed for the car more than $13,000. and the cars value was $8000 when it was crashed. The insurance took the car and left us without a car because it was a total loss. The repair was going to be way more than what the car was worth so the insurance paid what was left to be paid on the car loan.""

This flies directly in the face of what his wife had told us which is that the car was worth $4500, which is highly believable as that particular model depreciated rapidly and they also racked up a lot of miles on the car. However, now he's telling us that it was worth $8000 and that the insurance instead just paid off what was left on the loan. Even if this were the case, what loss have we really put them through? If they had negative equity and the insurance just paid off the remainder of the car loan, that sounds like a net gain to me. I'm curious what people's opinions on that would be, as my wife and I have avoided asking any of our friends as a good number know them and I would rather not blow this issue up more than it needs to be.",finance
personalfinance,Should I sell my RSUs to pay off student loans or diversify into other investments?,"Throwaway because my other account could be used to identify me.

After years of being broke but continuously self-educating, I have become somewhat of an expert in my field and worked my way into a solid financial position with a strict budgeting. This January, I hit the jackpot and got a great job that gave me a ton of RSUs and a signing bonus (paid off the last bit of cc debt). I just looked at the value of my Etrade account and TBH, kind of shit myself. This is more money than I ever thought I could potentially have. I grew up in a different state in a one-bedroom house, went to shit public schools for primary+college, and now work with graduates of Harvard, Stanford, etc. Anyway, thanks to this thread and the principles I learned, I crawled my way out of continuous credit card debt since I was 19 with a high of -$12k.

Current:

* Saving $1,000 cash a month for an emergency fund. I currently have $3k saved up. Once I hit $10k, I will allot the $1,000/month into an investment portfolio or up my ROTH.

* 5% of each check goes to a ROTH

* 0 credit card debt and a credit score of 800+

* 28, not married, no kids, not looking to buy a house yet (COL and housing value aren't in the cards here), but I'm looking pop the question to the lady sometime next year.

* $25,000 in student loans at a blended 6.5% interest rate. Paying $350/month right now. I could refinance them and pay off the loans in 5 years at $450/month. I think the rate goes down to ~5% with that option.


I have ~6,700 total RSUs which amount to roughly $172,000 at the current stock price. I will be completely vested in 3 years from now. The company has been doing super well and the stock has almost doubled since January when I joined.


Here is my question...I will have ~1,600 vested shares this coming January and more throughout 2018. At the end of 2018, I would have about $74k available to sell ($ based on current stock price). I know that there will be taxes on that and I could easily lose half. However, that is still enough to pay off my student loans in full and put the rest into another portfolio.


Questions:


1. I know that putting all of my eggs in one basket is not a good financial strategy. Even with the company growing like it is, should I sell a portion of shares as they vest and diversify?
2. Since the rate of growth on the stock is currently MUCH higher than the 6.5% interest rate I'm paying on my student loans, is it better to just keep paying them or to sell enough stock and pay off my loans in full at the end of 2018? I could then put the $340/month directly into diversified investments.

I have about ~7,000 credit debt on various cards and what not. I recently applied for a debt consolidation/ personal loan for ~7,000 and got approval for it but haven't accepted it.

I think the title says it all. Last year I moved from VA to DC, then got two pay raises during the year. One for review, the other 6 months later for performance ( I think they thought I was going to leave). i noticed something was wrong when I didn't get my W2 in January, it took them almost thee months to get me an amended form and I always file immediately so I get my money before March. Had everything gone to plan I would have gotten back $8K for child income credit and a second dependent that wasn't working. Now I owe $5,000 to DC, $5,000 to the federal government and another $2k for not having medical care for me baby's mother. I wasn't able to afford her being on my insurance and dropped her last year, later I found out i couldn't afford her insurance because my employer wasn't paying me my full hours worked over 95 hours in a pay period for all of 2015 and half of 2016. so this is the second time the accounting department has screwed me over financially. even though I was technically paid the money I technically owe I don't feel I should have to brunt the responsibility of the tax obligation.",finance

personalfinance,How gaining control of my finances changed my whole life,"Hi r/personalfinance. I posted something similar to this a while back and accidentally deleted it before it got much traction. I really wanted to share my story with you guys because my life has changed so much in less than five years. I never imagined that I could be financially stable and enjoy the freedom that comes with it. I had such a mental disconnect when it came to budgeting and spending. If I can get my head out of my ass, anyone can. (I'm in the US for reference)

Four years ago, I was a 27 year old woman with a decent career. I had graduated college a couple of years early at 19 and immediately found a job in my field. I'd been working for 8 years, steadily receiving an annual pay increase every year since I started. 

When my computer broke and I needed a new one, I headed to the store with stars in my eyes. At the time, the laptop that I wanted cost around $900. I had nowhere near that amount in my savings account, but surely I'd be able to finance it. I remember very clearly standing in front of a clean-cut kid ten years my junior, against a background of sleek, glowing screens as he told me that my application for financing had been denied and he was sorry, but there was nothing else that could be done. I had to face reality. I was broke. 

Even making $50,000 a year and with no student debt, I had somehow gotten myself in financial dire straits. That year, I moved in with roommates to try to save money and even when I cut my rent in half, my situation did not improve what-so-ever. I had several very high interest (25%) credit cards totaling about $10k and I owed around $3k on my car which I was paying 14% interest on. I was living paycheck to paycheck, I had no money in the bank and my credit was abysmal. 

I began to think that some people just aren’t ""good with money” and that was it for me. Well really, to be honest, I just tried not to think about it at all. If I had money in the bank, I spent it. Instead of working to fix that situation, I worked harder at making money. I got a second job and put in more hours. I was working myself to the bone and I was burning out before turning 30. 

It was around that time that I met my future husband, J. He could see how tired I was with my job and encouraged me to quit and pursue something that I really wanted. I explained that, in my financial situation, there was no POSSIBLE way that I could afford to make any less money. He started to inquire about my finances and, of course, was surprised to see what a mess I was in. However, being someone who was financially savvy, he assured me that my debt was not insurmountable and vowed to start me on a path to financial stability. 

Now, a couple of years later, I work in a different field doing something that I really love. I make a little less money, but I work a lot less and I am happy to say that the stresses of my old life are a distant memory. Last year, I actually took a hiatus from work to travel abroad. Even on a reduced income, I have five figures in my bank account, a new car and a credit score well above 700. Getting control of my finances changed my life significantly because it allowed me the freedom to live how I want to without the constant pressure of working to pay my bills. 

I am certainly not rich, nor am I a financial guru, but I would like to share a couple of things that I have learned throughout the course of this journey. 

First, if you want to change, you can’t ignore your situation. I was the queen of ignoring. If I thought my bank account balance was getting low, I wouldn’t look at it. If I missed a credit card payment, I didn’t want to see the late fee. I would forget about it. I didn’t look at my credit report because I didn’t want to see all of that red. And in the beginning, when J was trying to set me straight, it was hard. There were a lot of fights because I refused to look the issue in the face. I’d do literally anything else before I would sit down and call my credit card company. Admitting that I had been stupid with my money and committing to actively change was very difficult for me, but obviously extremely necessary. 

Second, consolidate and stay organized. One reason things got so bad in the first place was that, in my early twenties, I couldn’t keep up with my credit cards. I couldn’t remember which ones I had paid or when the promotional rates expired and I had no method for keeping track of bills. Once I missed a payment and the interest shot up to 25%, I felt helpless and didn’t want to look at the statements anymore. The very first thing that J and I did was consolidate my debt so that it was easier to manage. We went to a local credit union and took out a consolidation loan using my car as collateral.  Credit Unions are a good place to start because they are small and locally owned. You can sit down face to face with someone and talk to them about your situation and I found that they were willing to help. They gave me a loan that paid off all of my credit card debt, so now I only had to pay them each month instead of making payments on four different cards. The interest rate was high, but for the first time, all of my debt was in one place. I set my payment to auto-pay and put it on the back burner. 

Third, pay attention to those offers in the mail. After I had consolidated my credit card debt and had been making regular payments for about 6-8 months, my credit score started to improve and I began receiving credit card offers in the mail. Eventually, I was getting offers for a 0% balance transfer. I picked a card with no annual fee, a low transfer fee and 0% interest for 12 months. (BTW, I couldn't pay off my credit union loan with a credit card. I needed a card that would give me cash that I could use to pay the credit union. This is a thing I didn't even know existed, so examine all of your options) By this time, I had a spreadsheet with all of my bill pay and credit card information so I made sure to make a note of when my promotional rate expired. I transferred all of my high-interest debt to a 0% credit card and then, a year later, just before that rate expired, I moved it to a new card at 0%, so that I had several years to pay of the balance without paying any interest. 

Finally, and for me, this was most important, pay attention to your spending. I used to HATE looking at my bank statement - mostly because I knew I would feel bad or guilty about the low (sometimes negative) balance. Once my situation became more stable and I started saving money, the opposite happened. I felt proud and I wanted to look at my account and see a growing savings. In turn, this made me more frugal and I started to become very aware of how much money I was really throwing away. 

Clothes were my weakness. My closet was overflowing with cheap “retail therapy” items. Now, rather than buy cheap clothes every time I go to the store, I allow myself to buy one luxury clothing item from a high end store a couple of times a year. I've changed a lot of my habits and reduced spending in almost every area that I can. We also live very frugally, in general. We set a budget every month and stick to it religiously. I could go on for another three pages just about budgeting but that will have to be a post for another day. Most of the furniture in our house was purchased second-hand and we rarely go out to eat or make large purchases, since we prefer to spend our money on travel. 

I never thought I'd be a financially stable person. I never imagined that I would enjoy budgeting or checking my bank account balance but once I discovered how much freedom I could have by making small, meaningful changes, I feel like the whole world has opened up to me. I hope I can inspire someone else to do what I dreaded for so long. It is possible to fix things even when you've lived with bad habits for a long time. 



Edit: Wow. Thank you for all of the awesome responses. It seems like so many people have been in this same spot and have good things to share. I wanted to post an update because a lot of people have asked the same questions about specifically what to do to cut spending. Maybe this sounds cheesy, but it's an honest answer. My entire approach to life has changed. Changing my spending habits has been a fight against my own values. Initially, it feels depressing to work hard and still drive a beat up car, wear the same clothes more frequently than you want or stay in six nights a week when your friends are going out. But when you restrict yourself, slowly, the things you find important start to change. You begin to discover that having stability is more fulfilling than having THINGS. When you can learn to find great joy in a free walk through the park,teaching yourself a new skill or how to cook a new dish from scratch, you start to feel that spending money on things is a distraction from many interesting facets of life. So my advice in that regard is this - look at your bank statement and HONESTLY examine every item that is not a bill payment. Last month on my statement, I only had four charges that were not bills and they were each less than ten dollars. Find free ways to spend your time that you find engaging and interesting and take time to truly examine and appreciate what life has to offer beyond consumption.",finance
personalfinance,What should I do with this money?,"So I've got about 38 TMUS stocks from my previous employment with T-Mobile because I was able to do a stock purchase plan. This was a part-time retail position (part-timers still receive full benefits and perks). I now currently work in an office at my first ""real"" job but money is still tight even tho I'm making a little more. I have to help support my family so a good chunk goes towards that. I also have school loans, cc debt, and a personal loan I used for a used car.

TMUS stocks at this very moment is worth $64 a share. Since I have 38 shares that's about $2,432. I have a cc that has a balance of $3,694. I had a promotion when this card was activated so I was able to get 15 months of 0 APR. I am currently not paying interest on that card, but there's about 7 months left of that. I have a personal loan that I used to get a used car (which for me was a great deal) and the balance on that is about $5,505. The loan was for $6,000, APR is 14.99%, and with a regular payment of about $208/month for 3 yr's, I would be paying $1,487 in interest. I want to try and pay that off sooner than 3 years to pay less interest. I've managed to put about $400 extra into it already. And then I've got school loans of about 16k but I'm leaving that as is for now since the interest rate is pretty low (4%). 

So my real question is... should I withdraw my stock money right to pay off some of that debt. Or should I wait the 7 months until I start getting charged interest on my cc, hope that the stocks go up in value, and then pay off the cc? 

I hardly have any real savings. I have about $200 in my actual savings account and then that stock money. I'd really like to pay off most of my debt so that I can have more room to save. Should I put my money towards debt before saving? Or save before paying the debt? And if I do pay towards my debt, should I just pay off my cc first or put it towards the personal loan? 

Any advice is much appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,"Okay PF, I don't think I could possibly be worse with my money and am ready to change but I don't know where/how to begin... (CAN)","I have been awful with money since I was a kid. At 31 years old I am finally admitting my problem and am ready to start being responsible. I NEED to be responsible. 

I grew up in a low-income household.  My parents didn't make a lot of money and anything that I desired, I had to find a way to get it myself. When I was 17 years old I got a part-time job in sales and somehow made $43K on 15 hours a week in my first year while still in high school.  I didn't even know I was making this kind of money until my mother did my taxes for me and got super pissed because I literally had no savings. I had spent almost all my money on food, beer, video games, and upgrades for my truck(which I still had a loan on).  

In my mid twenties I was a successful professional poker player and was earning as much as $100K a month during my peak and don't even know my average or how much I actually made.  I continued to spend my money on partying, travelling(not the good kind, mostly to party), food, clothing, cars, and other things that did nothing for my future.   

I have been working in business consulting for about 4 years now and have been making a decent income($100K+) but have continued my trend of not managing my money, at all.  I am a contracted consultant which means I am incorporated and the firm I work for pays my corporation through commissions only.  I do get residual comm so I have consistency year over year but my income varies every month.  One month I'll make $2K and the next I'll make $30K.  I am also responsible for paying my own taxes at the end of the year.  It is for this reason that I am most motivated to create a budget and stick to it.  After 4 years with this arrangement, I have yet to file my taxes and am getting stressed out because it's only a matter of time before it catches up to me and causes a lot of problems and stress. 

I currently have about $15K in cash.  I just converted about $10K in credit card debt to a line of credit since the interest rates are 7.75% instead of 19.99%.  I was planning to pay my credit card completely off as I normally do but thought I would try something different and create a budget and figure out a way to start a payment plan for my un-filed taxes.  I also opened a tax-free savings account so that I could start putting money away for my retirement. 

This is as far as I've made it so far and know that I need to create a budget and hire an accountant. I have requested the CRA to mail me my income statements that were submitted by my employers for the last 4 years so that I can get started on sorting out that huge mess. 

I have some questions and would love any advice you might think valuable that I didn't specifically ask for as I have really have no idea what I'm doing. 

* What is the most effective strategy for keeping a budget? Cell phone app? Old school pen and paper? Excel spreadsheet?
* Should I still pay off my credit debt or keep a bit of cash for emergency? I have no savings at this point. Everything I have is just in my chequing account.  

Any tips, advice or direction you guys can offer will be very appreciated.  Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Am I handling my debt situation correctly?,"Hello everyone! 
I'm a recent college graduate and just want to make sure I am doing the best in my situation. I am currently in $87,000 of student debt. $27,000 is federal at around 4% and the rest is private at a recently refinanced rate of 5.3%. I also owe about $7,000 on my car at 6.4%. I have an emergency fund of 4,000 and around 6,000 in my checking account. My starting salary is 54,000 so I bring home around $3,150 a month. Current expenses are around $2,350 which includes all of my minimum payments as well as gas, food, and money spent on dining out or hanging out with friends. 
So for my plan. I plan to pay off my car entirely in the next month or so because that is my highest interest rate. After that I will put any bit of spare money towards my private student loans which should be about double the minimum payment of $660. With this plan I will not be able to save much or invest much but I have an emergency fund so I should be ok there. In 1 year my employer 401k will put in 6% if I put in 5% so I plan on contributing to that after the first year but until then is it smart to pay off my car first in a lump sum? It current has a minimum payment of $175. After the car is out of the way I will attack my private loans as hard as possible until they are paid off like I said earlier. Is this a good plan?

personalfinance,Bank of Montreal sent me to collections unbeknownst to me for an amount that was definitely made in error. Any recourse? (CAN),"I had a Bank of Montreal Mastercard that I paid off mostly the full balance (leaving behind $3.43 as I guess interest had not shown up in my account until after I made the payment). I had moved banks so I had no intentions of using the card anymore and I never even checked again. 

In August of 2013 they charged me $45.00 for an ""interest rate fee"" on what appears to be a new card # that I never received as I had moved. Bringing my balance up to $48.43. There were then some other transactions (also including some odd credits to the account). Keep in mind I never even received this new card. 

So at the end of the day they closed my account as a ""bad debt write off"" for $41 and sent that record to at least Transunion (assuming Equifax as well) and resulted in my credit dropping to 697. 

This $45 interest rate fee on this mysterious new card was supposedly some program they have that allows you to lower the interest rate on the card for a set fee. The $3.43 that I probably legitimately owed was also transferred to this new card. So clearly, I would not pay $45 to have an interest rate lowered for a balance of $3.43. 

Now the problem is they don't seem to understand this and so far they have passed this back to collections with a memo basically saying ""customer believes this is bank error"", but I'm concerned they are just going to see the charges and consider them my fault.

I can challenge this through Transunion and Equifax, but has anyone ever had any luck with this? I just feel like this is clearly an error on their end, but I have very limited avenues to get this fixed.

My next step is to go into a local branch and sit down with a banking officer. But I'm not sure how much they will be able to do as the account is now closed.

Not sure what to do now. I don't want this charge to effect my credit, but I'm not sure what else I can do.

personalfinance,"20-Year-Old in college, Personal/Financial advice for my situation","Personal background: I (M,20) come from an extremely low income family (about 17k a year) – single parent household. My mom works as a hotel maid. Father is non-existent, in addition to extended family. I also have a troublesome 12-year-old sister who’s in middle school. I am a first-generation college student. This upcoming fall semester I am going to be a junior taking 15 credit hours. I am double majoring in Computer Network Security and Spanish language.

I did well in high school and got scholarships to go to a local four-year university. Along with scholarships, I also receive government financial aid through federal and state grants. The governments financial aid alone covers my school’s tuition. The rest is refunded to me. The first two years I didn’t get as much refunded. The past semester I earned a scholarship from my honors program so I will be getting quite a bit of money, and they also pay for my books. My total refund for the whole year should be about $8,900, they give me half of it per semester, so about $4,450 in September and February. 

My university is about a 40-minute drive at best from my mom’s home. I commuted all of my sophomore year and it was too much for me. It took too much time and gas money (most of it is on the interstate). This year I will be sharing a three-bedroom place with another two friends right near the university. Once divided, rent will be cheap - $210. If you add utilities, phone and other bills I help out with at home it adds $230 (I help out with the internet bill and YMCA household membership at home). I plan to start cooking since I really want to get in shape this year, so I would expect another $130 per month I am guessing, I honestly don’t know how much to expect for food. I estimate $40 for gas. So it totals out to be about $610 a month for living expenses. I have no debt and no credit cards (although I am thinking about getting one to build credit), but also no savings. I haven’t worked much this summer because I did a study abroad program for most of it. Luckily, all my expenses were paid with scholarships as well. The little I have worked will help me get my room furnished. I already have a decent car (Toyota Scion) I bought with the past refunds. 

I have mainly worked on campus the past years as a tutor at minimum wage. I know I shouldn’t solely depend on the refund to live, I could, but I need to start saving money. However, I want to enjoy college and appreciate it while I am here. I want to get in shape for once, hang out with friends, and enjoy it. I worked an 8 to 5 office job half the summer and, although it wasn’t terribly bad, I saw a glimpse of the real world. There isn’t much time during the day, maybe I am just so accustomed to school schedule. This job let me value the college life a bit more. Before this job, during the school year, all I thought about was wanting to graduate already so I could work, be financially stable and help my mom out. However, I have begun to rethink things. I still want to be in the position to help out my mom, but I have to do with what I have now.
If you divide the refund over the course of the school year you get this (September to June):
(This is not even taking into account a part-time I’d probably get during winter break). 

$8,900/10 months = ~ $890 a month
Monthly expenses = $610
Free money to spend/save per month = $280 

I usually go home during the weekends (Fridays-Sunday, no classes on Friday) just to see how things are going. My mother and sister don’t have the best relationship. My sister is very troublesome and my mom finds a hard time with disciplining her (name-calling, yelling, along with spanking aren’t the best ways to control somebody). My sister is entering the teenage years and I want to be there to help her transition. I also help with the discipline by talking things through with my sister. 

I am debating if I should stick with an on-campus job (IT helpdesk for students) making minimum wage throughout the week, or work Fridays and Saturdays back near home who knows where.

I can’t work too much on campus because I also have to fit in 6 hours of study lounge for a scholarship I received so I would only be able to work about 8-10 hours. That’d be about $280ish a month.

I am kind of leaning towards the IT helpdesk on campus just to get some sort of technology related experience on my resume since it’s my major. I also hope to get an internship next summer so having that experience should help.

personalfinance,401k loans...are they ever a good idea?,"Friend and I were discussing ways for her to pay off her $30,000 in credit card debt and she brought up the idea of taking a 401k loan to pay off a couple of the larger balances that have 24% interest rates.

investing,"Canadian Corporate Bonds Yield Curve - Aug 5, 2017","http://imgur.com/a/bbU5i

The data is a composite of 251 Corporate bond (Canadian $) issues that are currently active. A explanation of yield curves is below for those who want it. While the trend line doesn't show it, there is some clear flattening after the the 15 year mark but that might be a result of a lack of supply out that far rather than an actual belief in long term growth or inflation.


Briefly: (an edited version of learnbonds' page)

The yield curve is a graph which plots time (from shortest to longest maturity date) on the horizontal access, and yield on the vertical access.  It is used to show the relationship between yield and maturity.

The Yield Curve Types

The Normal Yield Curve

Normally the yield curve is upward sloping showing that, all else being equal, a bond with a longer maturity pays a higher yield than the same bond with a shorter maturity. Generally, individuals and institutions prefer to lend money for shorter periods of time, rather than longer periods of time. To compensate for the extra risks associated with lending money for longer periods of time, lenders generally demand a higher rate of interest.

The Steep Yield Curve

When investors are expecting interest rates to rise in the future, they are going to demand a higher rate of return for longer term bonds.

The Flat Yield Curve

The yield curve is flat when yields of all maturities are close to one another and inflation expectations have decreased. When the yield curve moves to flat, this signals a pending, or ongoing economic slowdown.

The Humped Yield Curve

Short and long term rates are close to each but lower than medium term rates. This generally happens when there is either an increase in demand, or decrease in supply of longer term bonds. 

The Inverted Yield Curve

Longer rates are lower than short term. This signals an oncoming economic slowdown, as investors anticipate less demand for money.",finance

personalfinance,Paying for Master's Degree,"Hi all,

First time poster here. I am a recent Bachelor's graduate with a degree in computer science. This coming year, I plan on pursuing a Master's degree (also in computer science) at the same school I did my undergrad. 

Now for the bad news...To make a long story short, my family's financial situation has changed since the end of last year, and now I am solely responsible for my tuition expenses for my Master's degree. The good news is that my parents will allow me to live at home and provide food and other living expenses. 

The school I plan on attending is in-state, but is still on the order of $13,000 a semester. My Master's program is only 1 year, so I am looking at a total cost of around $25,000-26,000 total. I was offered an unsubsidized government loan for $20,000 to help cover expenses. 

However, I am hesitant to take a large chunk of this money due to the interest it would accrue over the course of this year, and that it would add significantly to the $25,000 in federal loans I already have. 

On the bright side, I am finishing up a well-paid internship this summer that will bring the total of my bank accounts to around $27,000. I also applied to some GSI positions at my school that would give me at least a partial tuition waiver, but with the school year coming up, I am pessimistic about my chances of landing one. 

So that really brings me to a few options:

1. Take the full value of the loan and keep/invest the cash for when I need to move out of state for a full time job/use it to travel after I graduate.
2. Take part of the loan and pay the rest of the tuition bill in cash. The bigger piece of advice I would need in this route is how much of the loan I should take. I am currently leaning towards this option.
3. Pay off the tuition fully in cash. This would bring my total cash reserves down to around $1000, which I can't help but think is a bad idea in case of an emergency. 


Other info:

If the GSI position doesn't work out, I plan on getting some kind of job part time, ideally something programming related. If it makes a difference, I expect to make good money out of college probably on the order of around ~$100k, especially if I get a return offer from my current internship.


So, /r/personalfinance, what would you recommend? At a crossroads here as I can see the benefit of all three options. Thanks in advance for the advice!",finance

personalfinance,Question regarding rolling over ira to a different company.,"Hello personal finance long time lurker. I am a 25/m who just recently has become serious about my finances. My question is regarding rolling over a traditional Ira to a Roth IRA.

I worked for a company who had a 401k through principal I believe. When I left the company, the 401k was automatically rolled over into a traditional IRA with principal bank. It is a safe harbor traditional Ira. I recently gained access to the account, and have noticed that I am being charged an annual fee of $25 and the account is not growing at all, in fact it's loosing money just from the annual fees, with a interest paid to me of roughly 50 cents quarterly. It shows the interest rate being .10%. The accounts current balance is only $2063. I also am not seeing anything about how the money is being invested? However maybe I am just missing this.

I currently have a 401k through fidelity with my current employer and for convenience sake, I figured I would transfer my traditional Ira at principal bank, to a Roth IRA at fidelity.

My finances:
Net pay: 3k per month
Average monthly expenses: ~1500/month &lt;---plan on doing a more detailed report.
Zero debt
Checking: 4K
Saving: 15k --plan on contributing ~5k to index funds or max Ira contribute for 2017. leaving a 6 month emergency fund.
401k-2k-contributing 20%, 12% return YTD Fid freedom 2055
Traditional Ira- $2063

My questions:

1) when I tried to rollover my traditional Ira to a Roth at fidelity it appeared to not allow me to do this, and instead wanted me to roll it over to a traditional instead. From my understanding a Roth IRA will be more beneficial for me when I am older, as I expect to be in a higher tax bracket then.

2) is there different ira funds at fidelity to chose from depending on how aggressive you want to be? And if so do you have any suggestions? 

3) would it be better for max my ira contribution this year or put the $5000 in a index fund?

I am open to all advice as this is still a very new area to me. I know I still have a lot of research to do myself, but just looking for a bit of guidance. Thanks PF.",finance
personalfinance,How do my student loan payments get disbursed?,"I am sure there is information on this but I've been looking for several hours now and I can't seem to find an answer. So for example my wife's student loan looks something like this:

personalfinance,"Finishing school, entering job market - Looking for critiques/additional advice on my plan to pay off my loans","Allow me to quickly preface this post with a little bit more information on its purpose. I'm hoping to outline my plan of attack to ensure I am able to pay off my loans quickly, and set myself up for a (relatively) debt-free future. I'm looking for any insight on anything in my plan that I may be overlooking, or may be over/underestimating.

***Background:***

I'm about to turn 26, and I will be finishing my master's degree within the next month, and starting work in that same period. 

My only debt will be student loans, as I was tardy to the party on the credit card application, and by the time I had applied, my debt levels were too high for my income at the time, so I was summarily rejected.

That said, my loan debt is fairly substantial. It is currently about $70,000, and it is about evenly split between federal and private loans. First thing I plan to do upon finding employment is to have the loans consolidated with the Bank of North Dakota (I believe the only state with a central bank?) because they offer a fixed rate of 4.83%, with a .25% reduction if you sign up for auto-payments, leaving an actual rate of 4.52% if I choose fixed.

On a side note, they quote their variable rate as 2.75%-10% (2.5%-9.75% after the .25% reduction). When deciding between the two, and given that my plan is to pay aggressively, would it be wise to choose variable in that case? I know people tend to say no to variable rates, but if I am paying them off well before the end of the life of the loan, that should significantly reduce my exposure to the variability risk, no? Would love some advice on this point.

***Income:***

At present, I don't have a job or any offers, however I have applied for about 10 in the last week or so. That said, I believe I can reasonably project a range of possible incomes, and I am utilizing the lower bound on that range to set my budget (that way, if I end up higher in the range, the extra money is just icing on the cake, right?)

Unfortunately the job market in my area is a bit lackluster. I've fallen into the unfortunate position of being 'overqualified', but under-experienced for many of the positions due to my master's degree. I will outline the reason for staying in this area in the expenses category, but suffice it to say I need to remain here for at least the next year or so.

That said, there are a handful of jobs for which I believe I have a reasonable shot of obtaining. I believe my income will fall between $40,000-60,000 annually, so I will be using $40,000 for the income projection.

Having messed around with a few after-tax income calculators and other tables I believe that a $40,000 annual salary should net approximately **$2,600** before any contributions or health insurance costs are taken into account. Please feel free to offer any guidance on this if you believe I am mistaken.

***Expenses:***

As mentioned, I will be staying in my current city despite the lackluster job market to save money. I will be doing this by moving back in with my mother for the next year or two, as that will save me upwards of $600 per month. I do, however, only want to do this for a year or two, which is the main goal of paying this off as quickly as possible, so that I can feel more financial capable of moving out and not scraping by.

That said, I will now outline my anticipated monthly expenses.

**Rent/Utilities** - $0

**Credit Cards/Other Debt** - $0 (again, tardy2party on CC)

**Car Insurance** - $100 (my mother has graciously paid this for me for the last 2 or so years while in grad school, so I don't actually know the EXACT figure, but I believe it was between $100-150 back when I paid, and I've been advised it should be lower now that I am 25)

**Phone** - $70

**Gas** - $80

**Food** - $200 (will hopefully be lower in actuality, but would prefer to overestimate costs than underestimate)


**Total Expenses Before Loans** - ~$450-500 to allow for some variance

**Net Income Prior to Loan Expenses** - $2600-500= ~$2,100


*Plan of Attack*

My minimum payments (derived from their calculator) are:


**Fixed** - $402.31/month

**Variable** -$322.92/month - $636.09/month


Keeping in mind that the term of the consolidated loans is 25 months, rather than 120.

My plan, however, is to try to shovel about $1,500 per month at the loans for the next one year (minimum) to two years. If I can successfully hit $1,500 each month, it should cut my total balance in about half, not accounting for interest accrual. At this point, I believe my next best step would be to look at re-financing the loans, either with BND or another lender, to see if I can secure a lower monthly payment for the same (or lesser) term.

As for any remaining money, I am hoping to try to put about 1/3 of it into some kind of savings, whether it's a 401k, IRA, or something else along those lines. Once I'm comfortable with my situation, I may see about having a portion of my paycheck deposited into an account other than my personal bank account so that it's like I don't even have it.

One main question I have is whether or not I might be worrying too much about the debt. I know that if the expected rate of return on an investment exceeds the interest rate of my debt, that I'm theoretically better off investing than paying down that debt, and given that my interest rate could be as low as ~4.5%, it would seem that I may be better off doing that.

My main concern, though, is that the debt could end up preventing me from buying a house or securing some other type of loan I may need at some future point in time. Is this level of student loan debt something I should fret over and pay down ASAP, or am I maybe overreacting?

If you've made it this far, I thank you very much for reading and for providing any assistance, if you can. Also please feel free to let me know if you need clarification on anything, or if you need additional information to help.",finance

So, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

We are here to fix the financial system.

personalfinance,VA Mortgage Loan Estimation - Figuring out all fees,"Hello PF, I am trying to figure out all of the fees that come from getting a VA Mortgage Loan. Which fees are considered a part of closing costs and which aren't. I am trying to understand the right way to add on 3% closing costs, 1% maintenance, 1% loan origination, and VA funding (increases loan amount).

**How much savings would I need?**

* I have excellent credit, so I expect my mortgage interest rate to be around 2.75-3% on a 15 year loan from NFCU. I plan to take out maximum of $417,000 or a jumbo loan. The houses I am looking at are in $450,000 range. 

* I know VA has ""jumbo loans"" where you would have to put 25% downpayment on amounts exceeding $417,000. There is a VA funding fee that fluctuates based on the downpayment as well. 

* Is that downpayment percentage on the cost of the house or the loan amount? For example, if I take a $417,000 loan and use $33,000 of savings to purchase a $450,000 house, would the downpayment be considered zero by NFCU?
 
* There is also a loan origination fee of 1%. That fee is based on $417,000 or $450,000 above? I guess my main question is whether all my calculations should come from taking out a jumbo loan and putting downpayment on a loan or downpayment on the house itself. 

----

Here is my math for a ""jumbo"" loan:

* $450,000 loan
* $33,000 at 25% = $8250 downpayment, $13500 closing fees, $4500 maintenance = **$26250** savings needed at minimum
* $4500 origination fee,  VA funding fee is 2.15% for small downpayment - $9675. 
* Total loan amount is $464,175 - $8250 downpayment = **$455,925 principal**

----

If I increase my downpayment to 5%, VA funding fee goes to 1.5%. 

* $22,500+$13,500+$4500 = **$40,500** savings needed. 
* Total Loan amount would be $450,000 +$4500 origination fee + $6750 VA funding fee = $461,250 -  $22500 downpayment = **$438,750 principal**

----

I calculated my monthly payments  from examples above for the 15 year loan at 2.75% rate to be $3094 and $2977 respectively. Property taxes in the area are around $500 a month, Housing Insurance around $150. This should be affordable if my math is right, obviously paying $100 less a month for 15 years would be preferable.

----

How much savings do I actually need? Am I missing anything or $25,000-$40,000 should be enough?",finance

personalfinance,Private student loan payments eating half of my income. What can I do?,"Last year I graduated college with about 90k+ in student debt from paying private tuition and books and such. In order to cover the gap from federal loans I also had to take out private loans from Sallie Mae/Navient. In total I pay Sallie Mae/Navient about 900 dollars a month, and on my federal loans about 227 which I previously was able to get my payment lowered on. 

I'm able to afford to pay them fine right now but I'm 24 and still living with my parents but I want to move out soon. I would not be able to afford rent and other living expenses with these loans. 

Should I refinance them? I was told by Sallie Mae/Navient that they can't lower my payment. Is this true or should I push harder?",finance
personalfinance,"Want to refinance my mortgage. Online calculators say it is a bad idea, but I think they're wrong. What am I missing?","throwaway

As the title states, I am thinking about refinancing my mortgage, but the online calculators and my mortgage broker both don't think it makes sense. I think it does, and am hoping to get someone else to take a look and see if I'm missing something or not thinking about it correctly. 

I bought my house in June 2015, conventional 30 yr fixed mortgage, interest rate 3.875%. Put 10% down, so I have PMI and pay about $130/mo for PMI (this is key and a big reason I want to refinance). My monthly payment is $1850 (excl PMI, insurance, tax). I pay a little extra ($130), so all in with mortgage, extra payment and PMI, my monthly payment is about $2,100.

I got a great deal on my house (out of state owners, it showed terribly and needed a little TLC), and my original appraisal came in at almost $40k over the purchase price. Since then, my area has continued to appreciate substantially. Unfortunately, my mortgage company (Nationstar) only looks at original purchase price when calculating LTV, so my only option to remove PMI is to pay down about $30k on the house or wait 3 years and pay for an appraisal (about $5k all in). 

My thought was to refinance, which would remove PMI. I got a quote for 3.75% on a 30 year loan, with only about $500 net closing costs. The key point on why I think this would benefit me and the calculators do not, is that I don't plan to lower my payment at all. I would still pay $2100 a month, it would just essentially redirect the PMI payment to the principle. I think the calculators all assume that I would be lowering my payment, and thus the extra interest payments from extending the loan 2 years would cost more than the savings. 

By keeping the payments the same, by my calculations, I would pay off the loan 1 year earlier and save $20k over the life of the loan. If I was to sell within 3 years (for example), I don't actually save any cash, but the $5k I was paying to PMI goes to my principle instead. My view is that my breakeven is about 4 months of PMI savings to recover the $500 closing costs, and the interest rate goes down 0.125%. The tax savings are negligible because I am phased out of the PMI deduction.

So /r/personalfinance, what am I missing? Appreciate any help or other things to consider.",finance
personalfinance,Best time for extra student loan payment,"So, I have 4 student loans I'm paying off to good ol Navient. I have been trying to kill off the one with the highest balance (7100) and interest (6.550%) by making an extra payment out of my budget, usually around $50 unless I have a good month. 

However,according to the Navient guy I spoke to, federal law states that every time I make an extra payment, I *have* to pay off the interest *first*. Which is compounded daily. 

This means if I want to pay an extra $100, that payment first takes care of the ~$20 in interest, so only 80 hits the principle. 

My question has to do with timing. Is it mathematically in my favor to pay my extra as I've been doing where I just manually make the payment when I think about it or to do the day of my scheduled minimum payment? Or somewhere in between such that I'm hitting the low point on the interest?

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Bought a new 2016 model car in 2016, sick of the payment","So, like an idiot, I traded in my 2012 Sentra with $6000 left on the loan to get a 2016 Sentra. I probably have about $19000 left on the loan, with payments at $369 a month. It's a nice car, but I just don't want this expense anymore now that I'm planning on getting my own place. 

Are there any cost effective trades I can do, or should I just suck it up and keep the car? The interest rate is at 4.4% so that's not a problem.",finance
personalfinance,"Going back to college and I need some money. Should I take a loan, or look to my 401k?","I'm 33 years old, currently working a pretty shitty job and kicking myself in the ass for not finishing my degree. I just signed up for classes to get back into school, and I'll be finishing my associate's within 3 semesters and then transferring to a university to finish the degree. After I've been at my job for 1 year, they will reimburse a certain amount for my tuition. I just can't wait for that to happen, as I've only been here 3 months and I need to get off my ass and start school again.

I don't qualify for financial aid or federal loans, but I also don't have the income to actually afford to pay, even for the community college classes.

Should I take a small loan for these first two semesters, or should I take a withdraw from my 401k which I am already going to be rolling over into my new job's plan soon?",finance
personalfinance,Investing vs. Paying Off Student Loans,"Hello!

So I've seen similar questions before, and the previous answers were to start investing once you reached the loans at 4% or lower but -

I have around 150k student loans at various interest rates, the majority of the principal being at about 5-7%. With the MINIMUM payments right now, I have like 400 dollars sitting around. One of the highest interest loans I have only has a principal for about 17k, so I'd like to take that 400 and shove it into that first loan, to free up the money for other loans (Avalanche Style.)

My question is: at what point does it make more sense for me to be taking money and investing it into my 401k, assuming my employer matches 5%. 

I can give additional details if required!

stocks,"Complete Stock Market Thread for the trading week of August 7th, 2017 (Earnings, News &amp; more)","Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week of August 7th, 2017 here at r/stocks!

# **WEEK AHEAD: August's dog days will be anything but for Wall Street with big earnings, economic data ahead** - *[(CNBC.com)](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/31/for-once-the-all-important-jobs-report-just-isnt-that-important.html)*

*****

&gt; Retail and media company earnings, inflation data and Fed speakers will keep investors busy as markets head into the dog days of August.

*

&gt; What has been a solid earnings season will begin to wind down in the week ahead, but first Disney and News Corp report, as do retailers Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's and JCPenney. Recent IPOs Snap and Blue Apron, both disappointing market performers, report their results on Thursday.

*

&gt; Producer and consumer inflation is reported at the end of the week, but it is the consumer price index Friday that markets will be most focused on after the July jobs report showed another month of soft wage growth and other inflation measures continued to look weak.

*

&gt; Core CPI is expected to rise 0.2 percent after moving up just 0.1 percent for June. Markets remain skeptical the Fed will raise rates in Decemberbut it is widely expected to start the process of reducing its balance sheet when it meets in August. The lack of inflation continues to make markets skeptical the Fed will meet its forecast for another interest rate hike by year end.

*

&gt; Fed speakers are out in force, with the most important likely to be New York Fed President William Dudley. He will be speaking Thursday morning about wage inequality in his region. That will be important because Dudley could discuss the lack of wage acceleration and the Fed's view on whether low inflation appears to be transitory or a longer term problem.

*

&gt; Focus will also remain on Washington, even as Congress slows down for August recess. In September, Congress is expected to tackle the budget and debt ceiling, which some strategist worry will not go smoothly.

*

&gt; ""Now we're going into the earnings vacuum. What will take center stage will be discussion around the debt ceiling but I still think we have some time, and the obsession around the Republican agenda, tax reform, and if we have any movement on that,"" said Michael Arone, Chief Investment Strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""D.C., monetary policy will be the main drivers in the absence of earnings.""

*

&gt; Earnings season has helped send stocks to new highs this summer. So far, about 85 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, and earnings growth is so far about 12 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.

*

&gt; Arone said he is keeping an eye on tech stocks and Nasdaq, which has lagged the other indices this week.

*

&gt; ""I think it's a natural source for profit-taking, given the fact that stocks have done so well. If there are folks that are kind of concerned or beginning to reduce equity exposure, technology is a natural area to take some profits given the fact it's done so well. It is something to keep an eye on here,"" he said. ""In a world, where you have very low interest rates, very low inflation and good but not great growth you need to invest in that part of the market that has very strong topline growth and tech tends to be that sector.""

*

&gt; Arone said investors are confusing FANG—the acronym for Facebook,Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet with the broader tech sector, but they should look beyond those popular names.

*

&gt; In the past week, the Dow rose 1.2 percent, closing at its eighth straight record high Friday at 22,092. The S&amp;P 500 was barely higher, up just 0.2 percent at 2476, eight points below its all time high. The Nasdaqwas lower for the week, down 0.4 percent at 6,351. The VIX, CBOE's volatility index, meanwhile, fell more than 3 percent.

*

&gt; ""I expect we'll get bouts of volatility for the balance of the year,"" said Arone, noting he's been concerned about the lack of volatility and investor complacency. But he said it would make sense if volatility picks up in the typically choppy months of August and September.

*

&gt; ""I wouldn't be surprised if volatility picks up particularly as earnings season winds down,"" he said.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Is Dow Theory Sell Signal Still In Play?**

&gt; Lack of confirmation or synergy between the two oldest U.S. market benchmarks triggered a Dow Theory Sell Signal July 26. When the backbone of our economy that transports goods across the nation does not perform well it is an indication that there is underlying economic woe. It is not always right and like everything else it is subject to interpretation, but it does have a solid track record and is worth heeding here as our other indicators are pointing to a summer selloff around the corner.

&gt; In the 7 trading days since the July 26 Dow Theory Sell Signal when DJIA hit another new high and the Dow Transports failed to stay in sync and began its recent decline DJIA is up 1.5%, while DJTA is down 3.6%. That’s not a big move up for DJIA, but it is still up. Since this Dow Theory Sell Signal, DJTA has fallen rather sharply, down 6.1% from July 14 to August 1. All this weakness in the Transports has occurred while the Dow Industrials continues to log multiple new highs.

&gt; These Dow Theory Sell signals take some time to pan out, but the recent historysuggests that usual selloff and low following a Dow Theory sell signal may be on its way shortly. After experiencing a typically strong post-election July VIX is still low but turning higher. Sentiment is high and stocks are higher, so the time seems nigh for the August-September slide.

&gt; Sentiment as measured by the trusty Investors Intelligence Bullish and Bearish Advisors % continues to move evermore bullish to over 60% bulls and down to under 17% bears with an expanding spread between bulls and bears to near-peak levels of 43.7%. These are the levels associated with market corrections. At the same time volatility remains super low, but ticking up from historic lows under 9 intraday. If volatility begins to pick up and sentiment retreats look for the market to turn lower.

personalfinance,"$70k student debt, offered a ~40% raise a month after starting a different job (US)","**TLDR:** Just started working at my dream company, but immediately offered another job for a lot more money that would allow me to cut loan repayment time in half. Can I take the offer without blacklisting myself at my current company?


Hi PF, I have found myself in a very challenging, but fortunate, position. I will do my best to summarize below.

**LOANS:**
I have about $70k in student loans (~$35k private at 6.25% and ~$35k federal at 5.00%). Currently paying $1000/month on the private and $375/month on the federal. 

**CURRENT JOB:**
4 weeks ago I started a new job with a great company that I have been trying to work for since I graduated last summer. I am making $72k annually and have a ton of growth opportunities within this company since it is very large and encourages different career paths. Simply having this company on my resume will open up tons of opportunity down the line. 

**DILEMMA:**
I was just approached by a past colleague of mine with a job offer of $100k a year. He is building an engineering department from scratch at his new company and wants me to be his first hire there and help him along the way and eventually be the manager when they hire more help. The company itself is established and does $2bil+ in revenue a year, so I do not see a ton of risk from that perspective. 

I have no idea what to do. I have always wanted to work for the company that I just got a job with, but this new opportunity would give me the ability to pay off my loans in only a couple of years. Would I be crazy to turn down the ~40% raise I am being offered? Is it possible to quit the new job that I just started and not burn any bridges? Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Tiny house/Land purchase...should I?,"First, excuse the formatting. On my phone at work, and this has been on my mind for a while now.

In New Hampshire

What I'm considering: purchasing land in my home town (2.15 acres) that is marked for sale for 100k.
The land is already level and clear. Previously had a house on it.
On the land, I wanted to buy a tiny house, and move it there. I did alot of research over the past few years, and fell in love with a very specific model. The base model is about 72k, but with the bells and whistles I would like, it would be able 97k delivered. 

My current financial status:
I make 40k gross pay per year with my main job. This is not including holiday bonuses that are normal year to year. Job is secure.

I also work part time only when needed with another job, this brings in another 5k-6k per year.

I'm 22, and have 9k of student debt left at 3.66% interest. I live very frugally, and find saving 50%+ of my pay easily doable. Recently this extra money has gone towards student loans however, and I just cleared out any loan over 3.66%. 
Credit score is currently at 770.

Current expenses:
Rent is 650
Internet is 50
Phone is 30
I contribute 4% into my 401k that is matched each paycheck 
Groceries are about 200/mo 
Eating out and other random expenses are about 70 per month.
Gas is about $20 a month between my car and motorcycle.
The rest goes either towards my student loans, or saving.

If I purchase the house, I'll be able to put 20% down. I originally wanted to wait to put more down or buy it out right, however people have mentioned no need to wait if the interest rates are low enough.

Unsure what taxes, title fees, and other expenses may add up to. I am close with a septic inspector, and somebody who owns a landscaping company. I think they may help with the land.

Moving back to my home town would be a 5 minute drive to visit my siblings, parents, neice and nephew. I would also commute 40 minutes to work (right now is a 15 minute commute) so this would add on gas and more frequent oil change expenses.

Any opinions and input is appreciated. The location of the land is very appealing, and if I fully decide to go for it, I see no reason to not jump on it soon.

The house portion isn't an immediate rush, I could easily hold off another year to strengthen my savings first.

Thanks for your time reading! :)",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Debacle.,"There seems to be a lot of really smart people on this thread that are successful and know how to properly manage money. I have added up undergrad and graduate school loans with interest added in and the tally is 200 k. This number is astounding I know. I will have a doctorate in physical therapy but the reality is salary is most likely around 80 k a year. I am a young guy (25) wit no kids, mortgage, credit card debt, etc. drive a shitty Saturn that is paid off. My question is how do I manage this?  Do I refinance at a lower interest rate? Do I throw as much as I can every month at the loan? Or do I max out my 401 k instead and invest my money? Will I ever be able to  achieve FI?",finance
personalfinance,"Possible to obtain FHA mortgage loan while unemployed, with poor credit, but strong savings?","Hi all, 

Thank you all for your contributions in this sub. I don't post here but appreciate all the information you all provide. 

My situation is as follows:

Currently employed full-time in NYC, but looking to purchase a home in Florida. I would be a first time home buyer. My credit is poor (560 FICO at the moment, but i'm working on improving that), but have strong savings in the range of 100K. I have a bachelors degree, am bilingual, good resume &amp; references, and am confident I can secure a job reasonably down in Florida (looking into Orlando or Tampa area). Worst case scenario, I can temp until I get something steady. 

My question: Is it possible to get pre-approved for an FHA mortgage while i'm temporarily unemployed down there given my credit circumstances? The homes i'm interested in are around the 90-100k range, so i'm hoping it helps that I have the assets to cover the cost of the potential home. Also, if I could get pre-approved is there any chance that I could obtain a decent interest rate? I know i'm not going to get a good interest rate, but i'm hoping that given my healthy savings I would be considered for decent. 

Any help/advise/suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much. 


Edit: Not sure if this info is important, but I have two friends who are very interested in moving down with me &amp; sublet rooms in the would-be home.",finance
personalfinance,"Father passed away last month, now my family and I are struggling financially","I am 24 and just recently lost my father. This is by far the worst time in my life and on top of grieving I have to worry about money. I really shouldn't be at work yet, but I need to go back since I know my remaining family (mom and younger brother) need my help financially.

My dad was the main breadwinner in our household, bringing in $70k+. My mom works part time but still brings in $50k. I work full time and bring in $35k. My younger brother is chronically ill and cannot work. My father had very little life insurance (&lt;$20k). He has a pension and retirement as he worked the same job for 35 years, but my mom won't be able to collect any of that for at least 6 more years. Our combined bills and mortgage is about $2900, not including food and gas.

The main issue for me personally, is my student loan debt. There are 3 federal loans, a large one in my mom's name, a smaller one in my dad's name and the smallest in my name. My dad's loan will be discharged, so that frees up $260/month I've been paying. My loan is about $130/month. The loan in my mom's name is the biggest, at about $590/month. I've been paying all these loans diligently since 2015. 

We've gotten my mom's loan put on a 3 month deferment. We obviously need a longer deferment, like one year until we can figure something out. We've already done all the options to get the payment as low as possible. (The total loan is ~$80,000) Basically right now I have to choose between paying this loan, or losing our house. Not paying that $590 a month is the only way we have a chance of keeping our house. I don't know what to do, or how to handle any of this stuff. I'm overwhelmed.

**tl;dr** I have a huge student loan in my mom's name and have to choose between paying that, or our mortgage.

Thanks for any advice, and feel free to PM me to ask for more details.

**Edit** Thank you everyone for your advice, you've given me some good things to research! Of course my first plan of action is drawing up a budget and looking into getting my brother healthy and/or some type of benefits.",finance
personalfinance,Payoff PMI?,"Currently owe $78,000 (mortgage) on a house we purchased about 4-ish years ago. PMI is $1,300 a year. In Dec (2017) will qualify to have PMI removed *if* our *principal balance* is at $69,000. 

I've already reached out on how to get this removed years ago, which why I know the date that we *could* quality to have it removed it we had LVT down to price. Otherwise it will 'expire' in 12/2021. 

Would like to pay it down if we can instead of waiting, not sure how much we would need to pay down for it to be eliminated, which is why I'm trying to get more insight now since December is approaching. *Note: I'm a first time home owner here so I'm a little clueless so please be gentle.* Is there a way we can we just put money towards the principle?

personalfinance,Graduate Student Seeking Advice on Financial Priorities,"I want to preface this by saying that I've read the articles on the sidebar, and what I'm looking for here is any clarification as to how my financial situation effects that advice.

The graduate program I'm in pays $30,000 a year in stipend, and has great medical and decent dental coverage. I'm done with two years, and I'll be here another three or four, with my stipend only increasing very slightly over time. I'm paying $680 in rent, and I'm paying down student loans totaling around $18,000, having already paid more than $7,000 down. That's broken into three loans with fixed interest rates of 6.55, 4.41, and 3.61 percent. I'm intending to entirely pay off the 6.55% loan within a month. Should I prioritize paying off the 4.41% loan, or just make the minimum payments? Given the stability of my ""employment,"" how much should I actually have in emergency savings? And how should I invest whatever I'm left with?

personalfinance,Wondering if there's a better way to tackle my credit card debt.,"Hi all,

So right now I currently have $11,618 in credit card debt and an auto loan of $2,300 which was originally for $6,500. About a year ago I had around $14k in credit card debt and was making significantly less money than I am right now. My salary before was around 33k without health coverage. My salary now is 57k with full benefits.

I was following the method of paying off the highest interest cards in order to free up my cash flow. By putting myself on a budget and getting real about my finances I was able to put about $400-$500 towards my credit cards each month on top of making the minimum payments.

If I follow that course right now it will take me 27 months to be debt free. What prompted me to ask for advice was the fact that I'll be leaving my family's house and moving in with my girlfriend in September. The rent isn't bad, my half would only be $400 a month plus however much it costs to split TV, internet, electric and groceries. I think I can probably manage the extra costs but I wanted to know if it might be worth it to consolidate my credit card debt with a debt consolidation loan? I haven't checked around for what kind of interest rates I'd be able to get but if I can secure one that has a lower APR than my lowest credit card should I do it? Or should I stay the course and just kill off one credit card at a time and deal with the added costs of the minimum payments? Any advice you all could provide would be great.

Here's the balances and APR of each card I have. And also the auto loan.

* CC#1: $3,130.07 - APR: 15.90%
* CC#2: $3,253.50 - APR: 10.90%
* CC#3: $2,138.61 - APR: 22.24% &lt; Currently putting $500 payments towards this one. I'm considering transferring this over to another credit card which is offering me a 0% APR balance transfer promo for 18 months.
* CC#4: $3,097.94 - APR: Promotional 0%(it was a balance transfer) until Mar 2018.
* Auto Loan: $2,303.32 - APR: 12.25%",finance

personalfinance,Sanity Check on 5/5 ARM,"I know, I know, adjustable rate mortgage = evil. But hear me out and help me convince myself that this is a good idea. My wife and I are looking to buy. We make good money (170k household) but are in a high CoL area and haven't been able to scrape together a fat downpayment yet (have about 41-42k). I was pretty much resigned to the fact that we would have to pay PMI (looked at SoFi but don't quite have 10%), until one of our potential realtors suggested PenFed's 5/5 ARM. Here are the cliffnotes -

1) Sub-3 interest rate (she said 2.75 but I didn't see that on the website)

2) Max 2% increase every 5 years, max 5% lifetime

3) No PMI

4) 10k closing costs

Our company moves people around a lot so the chances that we'll move within 5 years are high (they pay relocation in this case). Fine for us since we'll probably start to outgrow a townhouse around then anyway.

The thing that blew me away was when I tried to figure out the equivalent ""interest rate"" from the PMI I would pay on a 30-yr fixed (conservatively assumed $250/mo). A monthly payment on a 3.875% 30-yr with PMI was equivalent to 5% with no PMI! So here's my thinking:

1) 10k closing costs means more money can go towards downpayment

2) No PMI PLUS low interest rate means monthly payments are cheaper than our current rent

3) If we pay what we were prepared to pay on the 30-yr (w/ PMI) on the 5/5 ARM, we can make some progress on the principal so that -

4) Even if we see the max rate hike and we're at 4.75 - 5 after 5 years, we've already put down a bigger downpayment and made extra payments so we won't feel it as much. If we went 30-yr with PMI we'd be effectively paying that rate anyway except (AFAIK) we can deduct the mortgage interest but probably not much of the PMI due to AGI phaseout AND it's a fixed amount and doesn't change with the principal.

The only cons I can think of are:

1) Prepayment penalty takes all the fun out of our extra payments (need to verify that they even have a penalty). However I believe this amount can be included in the interest deduction.

2) We get stuck in the house and can't/don't want to move and have to suffer through 2 or more rate hikes. This seems exceedingly unlikely based on our situation and we can always look into refinancing if that changes. Absolute worst case, we see 2 2% hikes and we're at 6.75 - 7%, but that's 10 years into the mortgage so the effect is less compared to the low intro rate.

I feel like I have to be missing something here. Anyone have experience with this? Horror stories? Did I do a brain fart?

personalfinance,Retirement contribution / tax bracket question,"Hi PF,

I'm trying to figure out the best retirement contribution strategy for myself and could use your input. Here's the breakdown:

* 28 years old, no debt (paid off $45k in student loans throughout my twenties, never again); $17k in traditional retirement accounts 

* Began 2017 at a gross income of $48k; as of August, I'm at $55k (25% federal tax bracket, 9.3% state)

* I contribute 14% of my income to a traditional 401k (at $55k, this equals $7920/year, with my employer contributing $2280/year)

What's my best move from here?

* Splitting the difference with my raise, let's say my gross income for 2017 will be $53k

* If I contribute $8k to my trad 401k and $5500 to an IRA (currently nonexistent) by the end of the year, this would bring my gross down to $39,500. Therefore, I *don't* think I can contribute enough to get myself down to the 15% tax bracket ($37,950 gross)

*Best case scenario*

* (a) if I *could* get myself into the 15% bracket – by dumping more into the 401k – would my retirement contributions and 2017 income to-date be retroactively taxed at 15% when I file taxes in April 2018? (And would this make it preferable to open a Roth IRA and Roth 401k ASAP?)

personalfinance,(CAN)Inherited more than I thought I would. What would you do in my situation?,"This is not your typical PF post, and this is a throwaway BTW, for reasons, and although I'm not specifically looking for financial advice as you'll see, anything specific is appreciated. I'm in the process of speaking with financial advisors and so far I'm not impressed. Although I'm not even sure this is the right sub for this I was curious what the nice folks here would say.
    So, to get into the story, and it might end up being long, my apologies. My father passed away rather unexpectedly four years ago, leaving me to take care of my mother with dementia, who passed almost a year ago. I am in the final stages of inheriting their estate and have recently seen what the numbers look like. When my father died everything passed to my mother, but my aunt, the executor of the estate, was able to ""gift"" me enough to buy a very nice condo ""$600K"" which is what my parents wanted. They offered to mortgage their house while they were still around for me to do this, but I turned them down. I ended up buying a house instead and took a small mortgage($230K). So I've had that place for about 3 years and have been carrying the mortgage and house costs myself as I am single, yet I have a decent paying job - ~$70K. As the pieces fell into place I've recently come into another $850K from their estate, with a little more to come. I suppose a little about me is in order. I'm 40 years old, currently single, have everything I could possibly want/need, if not I have the ability to buy it. The thing is, before this happened I lived in a junior one bedroom apartment and had no true wants or needs beyond my day to day experience. I kind of find myself paralyzed by what to do next. I could keep working and just let the investments grow, they are mostly in segregated mutual funds now, though I have a recent cheque for $250K sitting in my savings account, and use it for my retirement exclusively, or consider a myriad of other possibilities now available to me. I've had advisors tell me I should pay off the mortgage with the cash and keep the rest invested, invest more since interest rates are so low and I can make more, test I still have so many more questions. I have an irrational desire to just say fuck it, sell the house, and travel the world, start a business, or just retire and hope the investments make enough... I could keep going and going, but I'm curious, if this happened to you, good people of PF, what would you do?",finance

personalfinance,I'm sinking. Should I take $ out of my 401k?,"Hi all!  I (34f) got myself into a sinking ship about 3 years ago. I thought I could handle it and, well, here I am.  I let myself finance my wedding for $10k then 2 years later became self employed. My husband owns his own handyman business that I teamed up with. I thought everything was going to be okay and my husband and I would succeed!  There was a game plan!  Then the van broke down.  Then the jobs dried out for about 5 months. 

I owe $5k in 5 different credit cards, $6k truck loan, $5k in personal loan, $11k in a private loan.  All but the private loan are @ high interest rates. Monthly bills @ $3k/month and am behind about 2 months. 

We are expecting to collect $2-5k in the next 2 weeks and $4-13k 4-6 weeks after that. (Depending on contracts and scheduling.). Now, as a business owner, I can not rely on ANY of that $ until it is actually in my hand. 

I'm really considering cashing in my 401k to pay off all/some of the credit cards or pay down the truck or personal loan a bit.  I feel like that $5k will help me so much more right now than if I wait till I retire.  The $ is sitting in an account, I never ""invested"" it or whatever you do with a 401k, but it does grow by about $8 a year. Yes, eight. 

So, I know I've made bad financial choices.  I know people say to leave you 401k, but what is $5k going to get me in 35+ years when I hope to retire?  

I was debt free and credit score over 700 before that wedding and becoming self employed!  Uhg!  I want to cry every night!  It was so hard and took so long to get to that point.  Never again!",finance

personalfinance,Saving for a house. 8k left in student loans - 3.15% interest rate. What should I prioritize?,"long-time lurker! first time poster!

some background: 
I am currently saving for a house in a HCOL area - the downpayment will be at least $80,000, most likely more. Hoping to save enough in two years - i'm basically putting every extra penny i make into an Ally savings account @ 1.15% APY. I've only got about 8k in student loan debt left, two 4k loans at 3.15%.

I'm wondering if I should finish paying off my student loans completely by tapping into my house savings. Paying off the loans would set me back a few months on reaching my house down payment goal. They also are currently my oldest credit accounts, so paying them off would decrease my average age of credit and my credit score could be slightly lowered (not sure how much that affects credit score).

Because they are relatively low-interest loans, I'm leaning toward just continuing to make low monthly payments and putting more money away for the house. Am I on the right track here? is it more beneficial to just prioritize saving for the house instead of completely paying off my low-interest loans?",finance

personalfinance,[Life Insurance] The ins and outs of Indexed Universal Life,"EDIT: Added information about historical annual S&amp;P 500 returns and cap rates in universal life products.  
EDIT: Added questions you should ask a life insurance agent about IUL policies.

**My Story:**

So I was contacted by a couple of guys who work at an insurance company, one of them claiming to be a CFP who wanted to see if they could offer their services to me. Sure, why not? It's free. I have nothing to lose.

I went there and they started asking me about my financial situation. Then they started talking about permanent life insurance. That's when I knew I had been bamboozled. But, really, how bad could it be to learn about IUL (Indexed Universal Life) insurance? Since they clearly thought it was a good idea to invest, I thought it would be interesting to review IUL policies thoroughly. So, I did my research on permanent life insurance and their claims about it. Overall, I probably spent about 25-30 hours researching how these policies worked. Here I present my conclusions.

Please note I'm not a licensed insurance agent. I'm just some dude on the internet. Please correct me if I've written anything wrong.

*Also note that this post only talks about IUL. It does not cover other types of permanent life insurance policies (Whole Life, Variable Universal Life, etc.). If you want to learn more about those, I suggest doing your research on that.*

**For the uninitiated: What is indexed universal life insurance?**  
This insurance, like most permanent life insurance products, has many different moving components.

**CASH VALUE** - This is the value which grows inside the account. Every so often, depending on which asset your cash value is invested, your cash value will be credited a percentage based upon an index with a cap and floor. The floor is guaranteed to be higher than 0%. The max is usually somewhere around 11%. If the S&amp;P gains 5%, you get 5%. If it gains 20%, you get 11%. If it goes -50%, you get 0%. These are tax free gains.

**BASIS** - This is the amount of your own cash you have contributed to the policy after all fees are accounted for. Withdrawals from this do not have a taxable impact. Withdrawals from this can trigger a surrender fee (see below) during the early years of the contract.

**GAINS** - This is the amount of cash value that has been credited to your account. Withdrawals from this is a taxable event at your marginal tax rate.

**LIFE INSURANCE POLICY** - This is the policy inside of the account which must be paid for with your premiums. It uses ART (annual renewable term). This means every year your insurance rates inside the policy will increase because you are getting older.

**SURRENDER FEE** - For the first ten years of the policy, there is typically a surrender fee of 10% in the first year, decreasing by 100 basis points per year (so in year 10, there is no surrender fee).

**LOANS** - You can take out loans against your total cash value in your account. The loan you take out has an interest rate which is equal to the amount of credit your account receives that year plus a nominal amount (guaranteed to be equal to or less than 0.25-0.50%). Your loan, therefore, is practically free because you're borrowing from yourself at almost 0% interest rate. (this section is overly simplified - there are actually many different types of loans you can take out from permanent life insurance policies - this is just the gist).

**NO LAPSE GUARANTEE** - This is a policy rider. The rider says that if you do not pay your premium or loan interest, your cash value will cover the difference.

**VARIABLE PREMIUM** - You can pay a variable premium throughout the life of your policy. There is a floor (no lapse guarantee floor) which you cannot pay less than (well, you can, but you risk the policy collapsing). This is the minimum amount to keep the policy in force, at least until the policy can pay for itself. There is also a maximum premium you can pay into the policy. I won't cover it here, but just google for ""Modified Endowment Contract"" (or MEC) if you want to learn more.

Phew! That was a lot of stuff to understand. So, what does all of this mean?

**IN THEIR IDEAL, PERFECT WORLD:**  
Here's how things would work:

- You max out your premiums to build a huge cash value within the policy.
- You gain 10% per year in cash value within the policy
- When you want to retire, you begin withdrawing your basis.
- After your basis runs out, you begin taking loans against your policy gains, which will have a No Lapse Guarantee.
- Eventually, the policy will collapse because you'll have taken out too many loans against the policy and your remaining cash value can't cover the premiums plus loan interest. The cash value within your contract (which are now 100% gains) will pay off your loans. This evades the taxable event of withdrawing your gains.
- Voila, you get sweet tax free gains!

But all is not so rosy. Let's look at this claim and many other claims that these insurance agents made about this policy.

**Their claims:**  

- **""IUL is good because it allows you to stay far more aggressive in investments in your later years with no downside risk. With IUL, you can stay invested at S&amp;P returns after retirement when, usually, you'd only be risk tolerant enough for bonds.""**  

So, let's talk about fees within the IUL. According to the disclosure I received on costs they are:

- 5% of all premiums paid until age 100
- M&amp;E (mortality and expense) which lasts for the first 10 years of the contract. This is typically ~20% of premiums paid, vanishing at 200 basis points per year for 10 years (meaning at year 10 you pay nothing)
- Administration fees ($50/year)
- Cost of insurance
- Cost of any riders

Because of all of these expenses, this is why your cash value will *not* accumulate much during your first 10 years. In effect, you are paying 25-30% in fees your first year!

Plus, there is an additional fee you may not have noticed. Let's look at how stock market gains are applied to your account. When the stock market increases, you only get your gains - you do *not* receive a dividend. Usually, for the S&amp;P 500, you receive an annual 2% dividend which you do not get on this permanent life insurance contracts. That's an additional expense for you because you won't receive a dividend.

Therefore, I place the fees on your premiums to be about 30% in your first year. This slowly vanishes to about 5.5% after year 10.

The vast majority of people are not maxing out their retirement accounts. Would you rather pay 30% fees or 0.07% fees on the S&amp;P fund in an IRA/401k? I'd wager you'd rather take #2 than #1.

The final point here is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. Losing 30% to fees your first year is an absolute stock market gains killer.

But lets give this a fair shake. So far I've been talking about fees which happen in the first ten years of the policy. But their argument is that you can stay invested far more aggressively during your retirement years which happen at the end of the policy. So, let's see about this:

Let's look at [historical, annual S&amp;P returns](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html). If the returns are higher than the cap rate on the policy (usually 11%), you do *not* get those gains. All of those gains go to the insurance company. After analyzing the historical annual gains:

- 48/88 years saw gains higher than 11%
- 24/88 years saw gains less than 0%

This means you have a 54.5% chance of missing out on gains. How much gains do you miss out on, on average? By adding up all stock market gains during the years where it was greater than 11% and then dividing by the number of years (48), you get 26%. Therefore, on average during years when you hit your cap rate, you will lose on 1500 basis points of gains. Still sound like a good idea?

So, to refute their point, yes, you can stay in a more aggressive market, but at what cost?

- **""Eventually, IUL is good enough that, once funded, it will pay for itself and serve as an investment vehicle which is completely tax free gains.""**

This is absolutely true. However, look at the previous answer. Do you want to pay 30% fees upfront and lose out on stock market dividends? I don't.

- **""The life insurance in the policy gets cheaper with age, not more expensive. You can see in the cost summary that the cost is less than if you had taken out term life insurance. We do that because we prefer people to have permanent life insurance policies. One of the benefits, man!""**

This brings up something interesting. Let's talk about how they do insurance premiums.

Your cost of insurance within the policy is determined by your death benefit minus your cash value. So, if you have a $700k death benefit and $200k cash value within the policy, you only need to insure $500k. So your cost of insurance is for $500k for whatever age you are at that point. This is why the insurance gets cheaper even though you're getting older. You are essentially self-funding your death benefit through the permanent life insurance policy. In later years, your cash value will be barely behind the death benefit, so your cost of insurance will be extremely low. This is assuming, though, that you max out your premium payments. The vast majority of people do not.

- **""Buying term and investing the difference is only good for those that actually do it. However, according to our research, most spend the difference, not invest. Think of it like a house and forced savings. Doing this is like building equity in a house.""**

If you want forced savings, do an automated withdrawal from your bank account to your retirement account. You'd have to do that anyway with the life insurance premium. If you can do that with a premium, certainly you can do it to an IRA.

- **""This policy eliminates the risk of a bad market and offers asset protection. You can never lose money in the account.""**

OH YES YOU CAN - especially in the early years of the policy.

Remember all of the fees from before? Those have to be paid. In a bear market, you will receive a 0% credit rate on your cash value minus the fees (cost of insurance, administrative, and such). This means in bear markets you may have to increase the amount of premiums you pay to keep the policy from collapsing. So the worst case scenario is that you purchase this policy and an immediate bear market happens. This means you'll have to shoulder all of the fees in cash for the first few years which are the most expensive.

Also, let's consider that you didn't max out how much you put into the policy. This puts you in the precarious position that your life insurance premium will *increase* year over year in the case of a bear market, further delaying when the contract will be self funding.

Don't forget that the premiums are *expensive*. I was quoted $500/mo for a $375k policy! Are you sure you can shoulder an expensive life insurance contract during a bear market when you may lose your job or shirt?

Because of these problems, I assume that many permanent life insurance policies taken out in 2001-2007 collapsed or were surrendered due to fees which are heavily front loaded in such contracts. The insurance companies won here and the consumers lost.

BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE END OF THE POLICY. Your retirement years.

Let's look at how they want you to use this policy during your retirement years. You withdraw your basis first. This reduces your cash value which *increases* your cost of insurance within the policy. The cost of insurance should be self funding because of gains within the account. But if you don't get those gains, then you will end up losing money due to cost of insurance. This means in an extended bear market your policy could collapse and you don't have access to your cash value. It's gone. It was eaten up by cost of insurance within the policy.

Clearly this is a life insurance contract. It should not be used as an investment vehicle or as a way to provide liquidity during retirement years because there are risks here too.

But let's talk about if the policy collapsing is such a bad thing. To answer that, let me ask you this - do you need $100k, $375k, or even $750k in life insurance when you're 80 years old? What exactly are you protecting against? If you answer that question, then you can answer whether letting the policy collapse is a good or bad thing. I'd wager for most people, having that much life insurance at that age isn't worth it. You really only need enough money to cover death &amp; burial which is only $10-15k. For that amount, it's much easier to self fund or pay for a much cheaper insurance product if you can't.

- **""IUL is better than a taxable account because the taxable account gets bogged down by, well, taxes.""**

How about the 5% fee on all premiums, no 2% dividend, and administrative fees?

Try going to [this site](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost) and put in a 2% expense ratio. You will see that after 25 years you will lose out on almost half of your gains. In a taxable account, assuming you are a buy and hold investor, you will pay 15-20% as long term capital gains. Now, which costs more - 50% or 20%? You tell me.

**QUESTIONS TO ASK AN INSURANCE AGENT:**

So let's say someone offers you an IUL contract, which is the most popular form of permanent life insurance these days. Here are some of the questions I'd recommend asking them:

- What is the fee paid for premiums paid into the contract? Is it 5%? I want to see a cost summary of the policy. (my agent didn't want to show me, because he said the internal rate of return on the policy was more useful than seeing just the costs. Bullshit. He just doesn't want to show you how expensive it is).
- How much does the [M&amp;E](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortalityandexpenseriskcharge.asp) cost? When does it vanish?
- The S&amp;P pays out a 2% dividend which your policy does not cover. Isn't that, in effect, an additional 2% load on top of all premiums paid, which are also at a 5% load?
- You might be a CFP, but are you a fiduciary to me? (their answer will almost certainly be no - chances are you didn't sign a contract stating they were your fiduciary - they just want to sell you life insurance)
- In the last 88 years of stock market returns, 48 of them have had returns greater than 11%. These years have averaged 25% returns. So I will lose out on 1400 basis points of gains during these years?

**CONCLUSION:**

For the vast majority of people visiting this subreddit, permanent life insurance (and specifically, indexed universal life) is not a good option to buy. It's simply too expensive. Based on my experience and research, term life is far cheaper and I'd always go for that.

Anyway, thought I'd share my research and experience.",finance

ethereum,Why Koreans (Really) Love Ethereum,"This is a response to an [earlier thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6rw0b9/why_koreans_love_ethereum/) that was well received, but I felt was a bit reductionist. /u/airmc's [top comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6rw0b9/why_koreans_love_ethereum/dl87vov/) in particular irked me, not because it's inaccurate, but because it's the kind of snide comment that seems meaningful, even though it's mostly generalizations bordering on racist (possibly self-hating) stereotypes. This [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elaineramirez/2017/08/02/crazy-for-cryptocurrency-why-south-koreans-are-risking-it-all-on-ethereum/) by Forbes is similarly reductionist and lacking in meaningful analysis. Here is mine.

1) Compared to US households (roughly 2:1 financial assets over non-financial)+, Korean households are (1:3 non-financial over financial++) heavily invested in non-financial assets, particularly real estate. While this made sense in the past 30 years of volatile growth, current low-interest/growth situation calls for investment diversification. Particularly concerned with a population drop and real estate market crash a la Japan, investors have been looking for new assets for a while. 

2-1) Over 70% of households have less than 300k USD in total assets.++ The majority of their assets are tied up in real-estate (many are ""house-poor"": rich in real estate but poor in cash) and they are very risk averse. They prefer putting their financial assets into savings accounts at major banks despite low interest rates. The day traders are mostly from these households. 

2-2) Even among the 5% (over 1M USD in total assets), there is mistrust of mutual funds and stocks, particularly foreign funds and stocks. *This maybe due to experiences in 1997 (the Asian financial crisis) and 2008 (the global financial crisis) when large, supposedly too-big-to-fail stocks and professionally-risk-managed derivatives ruined many.* Regardless, the rich have been increasing the share of financial assets in their portfolios.++ Non-institutional Korean whales are mostly from these households.

3) Korea has one of the world's highest internet penetration, a history of electronics manufacturing, and relatively cheap electricity. KEPCO prices 6 to 10 cents per KWH for industrial (which mining crypto technically isn't...but the rules are easily bent) which is pretty low compared to the lowest US rates (8 cents in Idaho). Well-established supply chains of CPUs/GPUs, cheap electricity and internet, and an electronics-friendly labor force made crypto mining accessible and profitable. *IMO maybe this is why Korea is so heavy on ethereum over other crypto; it was more attractive to miners.*

**Combine these three facts: a risk-averse population with low faith in ""traditional"" financial assets, looking for new investments, and a (so far profitable, albeit volatile) market which has a low entry cost.**

This is why I think Korea is bullish on Ethereum.

This ended up being a long post, and I mean no disrespect to anyone, least of all /u/airmc or Elanie Ramirez. /u/airmc's description of how many Korean investors are frequent traders is dead on correct (they can't afford to hodl because they can't afford the risk). Korean hodlers are most likely miners who have vested interest (equipment) in seeing the price rise as well as long-term investors who are looking for high-performing financial assets. 

No market is completely rational, no market is completely irrational. 
Let's not reduce a people to a stereotype, thanks. (Yes, I love Starcraft, but would me explaining American interest in crypto with Football references have any value?)

personalfinance,Solo 401K - Business Structure,"Hi All, first time poster here. I have been searching around for awhile to see if anyone has done any comparison on the difference between whether you pay yourself through W2 or if you pass through the business profit to your personal return. I used 55k as the total gross income and came up with very similar Solo-K contributions and total taxes paid (assuming no write-offs, 33% federal tax and 6.37% State tax)

W2 INCOME:

    GROSS INCOME: $55,000.00

    EMPLOYER SIDE:
    *MAX PAYROLL: $41,284.45 
    *EMPLOYER TAXES: 
    *SOCIAL SECURITY $2,559.64 
    *MEDICARE $598.62 
    *SUI/SDI (.705% on first $33,500) $236.18
    *SOLO-K ER MATCH $10,321.11 

    EMPLOYEE SIDE:
    *GROSS PAYROLL $41,284.45 
    *SOCIAL SECURITY $(2,559.64) (TO BE REFUNDED ON RETURN)
    *MEDICARE $(598.62) 
    *SUI/SDI $(236.18) (TO BE REFUNDED ON RETURN)
    *SOLO-K CONTRIBUTION $(18,000.00)
    *FEDERAL $(7,683.87)
    *STATE OF NJ $(1,483.22)
    *NET PAYROLL $10,722.93 

    CASH AFTER TAXES (ADD BACK SS/SUI/SDI): $13,518.74

In this scenario I will have paid $13,160.15 in total taxes and will have contributed $28,321.11 to the solo-k.

PASS THROUGH:

    GROSS INCOME: $55,000.00 

    EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES (7.65%) $(4,207.50)
    MAX SOLO-K CONTRIBUTION BASIS $50,792.50 

    EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION $(18,000.00)
    SOLO-K ER MATCH (20% OF BASIS) $(10,158.50)

    NET TO PERSONAL TAX RETURN $22,634.00 
    *TAXES: 
    *FEDERAL $(7,469.22)
    *STATE OF NJ $(1,441.79)

     CASH AFTER TAXES $13,722.99 

In this scenario I will have paid $13,118.51 in taxes and contributed $28,158.50 to the solo-k. Presumably I will be saving some amount on the cost of running a payroll for just myself.

I guess the question here is: Am I looking at the full picture or am I missing something? Perhaps there are other write-off advantages between the two types of business structures? 

Any input is much appreciated!

personalfinance,"Need $4,000 Stopgap Until Next Paycheck. Options?","There is a lot of judgment to go around, but I just want to stick to the facts, please.  I realize this situation should have been avoided long ago and that I need to develop a long-term plan, but I'd like to focus on immediate practical solutions and options to avoid possible eviction.  

**FACTS:**

* I earn the sole household income (two adults) and have for the past three years.  
* I'm on a teacher's salary (~$65,000).  
* We live in Silicon Valley.  
* We began renting here (studio apartment, still ~$2,500/mo) when we had two incomes.  
* I had reason to believe we would return to to a dual-income household much earlier, so we did not move someplace cheaper before.  
* My paycheck literally *just* covers our expenses month-to-month (minus my student loans, which have been deferred).  
* We have three credit cards that have been maxed out.  
* I do not earn a paycheck during summer months (non-negotiable at my district).  I will be paid again at the end of September.  
* We have exhausted our savings in the past two summers and now have neither the money to pay rent/bills or move someplace cheaper.  
* I have been actively looking for a higher-paying job, but it seems no one in the area is interested in non-engineer skillsets at a higher rate of pay than I already make.  
* I do summer work, but the pay is hourly and insufficient to make up the needed difference.  
* We have cut down extraneous expenses to the bare basics (essentially only phone and internet).  
* No one we know has the budget to loan us ~$4,000 to keep us afloat these next two months.  

**OPTIONS?**

* Can I cash out my unused sick leave from work?  I have 150+ hours on my employee account.  
* Can I take a loan out from my bank (at a lower interest rate) to pay off one of the credit cards and use that card for rent/food until the end of September?  
* Is there a personal loan option that is not financial suicide?  
* Is there anything I can do *right now* to last until my real paycheck comes in at the end of September?  

I would also appreciate any long-term advice, but for now I'm just trying to make it through the next few weeks.",finance

personalfinance,2nd Credit Card for College Student,"I'm a college student who currently has a Discover It Chrome card, and I'm thinking about getting a second card (most likely a Visa or Mastercard, which is more widely accepted worldwide). I only have about one year of credit history and a very small income, but I've paid my bill in full every month, and being an authorized user of my parents' card helped me get my Transunion score to 750 and my Equifax score to 690. I have 7% utilization and no derogatory marks, but 4 hard inquiries and only 2 accounts with an average age of 3 years. I had a few questions about my credit, and also welcome any suggestions for my next credit card.

1. For most of the time I've had my Discover card, I've been paying back my purchases soon after I've made them, before the statement comes out. Essentially, I had usage activity on the card but paid it off early, so the statement balance was $0. Has this behavior hurt my credit score or prevented it from increasing? Is it better to pay the balance only after you receive the statement?

2. I tried applying for the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature card, and I got a letter from Chase asking me to provide proof of gross income (approximately $3000, from a part time on campus job). I need to submit either 2 pay stubs or my most recent W-2. However, I get my job income via direct deposit and do not receive pay stubs, and my income is under the federal limit so I have not filed a tax return. I also have significant stock market investments and money in a checking account, but that documentation is considered optional by Chase. Any advice on getting this card, is my credit history too limited or should I call Chase and explain my situation about not having the required documentation?

3. Are there any other credit cards you recommend I apply for? Or should I wait several months for my credit score to improve? I always pay my bill in full, so cash back rewards are most important to me. I spend the most money on groceries, dining, and Amazon, so cards that have higher rewards in those categories with no annual fee would be best. I was denied for the Capital One Quicksilver for having a limited credit history, but am considering applying for the Capital One Journey student card, which would be easier to get approved for. I know there are other cards with better rewards than the Journey card, but I'm not sure I'd be approved for them because of my limited credit history.",finance

personalfinance,How to strategize student loan repayment plan?,"So I'm currently enrolled in an executive graduate program, and I've taken out 2 loans with the following criteria:

Federal Unsubsidized Student Loan
$20,500 @ 5.31%

GradPLUS Direct Loan
$33,270 @ 7%

The first has been divided over three disbursements (Summer, Fall, and Spring) and the second has been divided over two disbursements (Fall and Spring). So far, the following has been disbursed:

Since I'm able to continue working at the moment (with a relatively low salary) I'm eligible for the following repayment plans and amounts:

Pay As You Earn
$35.92/month (With Consolidation: $35.92/month)

Revised Pay As You Earn
$35.92/month (With Consolidation: $35.92/month)

Income-Based Repayment
$53.88/month (With Consolidation: $53.88/month)

Income-Contingent Repayment
$118.53/month (With Consolidation: $118.53/month)

Standard Repayment
$202.28/month (With Consolidation: $154.90/month)

Graduated Repayment
$116.22/month (With Consolidation: $97.04/month)

Income Sensitive Repayment
$149.33/month (With Consolidation: $149.33/month)

Given that my salary will be increasing after I graduate, would it be strategically more advantageous to start one of these payment plans now? Would it be better to just pay as much as I can (whatever of my paycheck is left over after basic expenses) each month? Should I still be allocating a certain amount to savings while making smaller payments? Most repayment plans state that I would be paying monthly for 10, 15, or 20 years. Does this mean that I can stop paying at the end of the designated amount of years and any remaining balance will be forgiven?

Bitcoin,Is it now impossible for Coinbase to get hacked?,"So I've been thinking. Assuming Coinbase is telling the truth about 98+% of their coins being held in cold storage and taking 24 hours to remove (which we saw to be true before August 1st as hundreds rushed to pull out their btc and faced a wait time), it is pretty much impossible for them to be hacked by an outsider, correct?

It would require a physical breach in their location, which I am guessing is secret and heavily guarded so as to protect probably hundreds in millions in bitcoin.

And even if they were breached, they have **full** insurance coverage that 

&gt;""covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. The policy is provided by a syndicate of insurers through Lloyd’s of London""


But anytime someone mentions coinbase, someone **always** responds saying to *never* keep your coins on an exchange. 

Additonally, all FIAT in coinbase accounts is FDIC insured up to $250000 per account.


The way I see it, the only possible risk to coinbase accounts is if your account is compromised, and with 2FA, strict password requirements, and Coinbase's vault option, extremely, extremely difficult. 

Obviously keeping your currency in coinbase isn't as safe as keeping it in cold storage (where the vast majority of my coins are), but there is no real worry about theft of your coins.

There has also been incidents in the past (the ethereum flash crash on GDAX), and coinbase reimbursed the victims out of their own pockets, even though they had 0 obligation to do so. Basically it's not a morally sketchy company.

The only situation I could see is if the US government seized their servers, but Coinbase is a registered company with the SEC and fed, so that's off the books too.

TL;DR: Coinbase's security is pretty much as safe as can be.",cryptocurrency

ethereum,Loans for ENS names (live on testnet - Lendroid),"At Lendroid, we are building a network of self-regulating and evolving loan markets for digital assets. We see ENS names as a pivotal innovation in digital asset design. With the deed based ownership and time-locked refundable deposits, ENS domains make ideal collateral for digital asset loans.


So, over the past few months, we have built a [proof of concept dapp](https://lendroidproject.github.io/demo/) allowing users to lock up ENS domains as collateral in order to borrow Kovan test ETH.


* ENS demo - [demo](https://lendroidproject.github.io/demo/).
* Website - [lendroid.com](https://lendroid.com)
* Twitter - [@lendroidproject](https://twitter.com/lendroidproject)
* Slack - [slack invite](https://slack.lendroid.com) |  [slack](https://lendroid.slack.com) |  
* Step by step tutorial - [How to use the demo?](https://blog.lendroid.com/loans-for-ens-names-lendroid-testnet-demo-1b3d5f741358)


In the near future, we intend to cover assets priced by the market, such as ERC20 tokens. All suggestions and / or feedback are welcome, as we believe they would help tailor Lendroid according to the needs of our community. So comment below, or join us on our [slack](https://slack.lendroid.com) and let us interactively create a lending network together!

**What am I trying out?**

This demo (deployed on Kovan) is designed as a PoC to display what digital asset lending would look like.The first digital asset we have chosen to work with is ENS (Ethereum Name Service) names, with many more to come! For the purpose of this demo, we have a simplified version where you will be able to lock an ENS name and get an ETH loan in return. In this case, Lendroid acts as both the lender and the guarantor. To learn more about Lendroid visit: [lendroid.com - decentralized digital asset lending platform.](https://lendroid.com)

**Code**

The code for the corresponding smart contracts can found [here](https://github.com/lendroidproject/lendroid-ens-loan).

The code for the UI can be found [here](https://github.com/lendroidproject/lendroid-ens-loan-ui).

**FAQs**

**Why ENS names?**

We are in love with the design of ENS for the following reasons:

* ENS names are not fungible
* ENS names are backed by a refundable deposit
* The ownership of the names are easily transferable.

**How much ETH can I get for my name?**

Each ENS name has a deed with an ETH deposit backing it. The owner of the ENS name locked the ETH up while acquiring the name. Thus, the name can be considered to be at least as valuable as the deposit backing it. 
You can borrow up to 80% of the deposit backing the ENS name. For example: if there is a 1 ETH deposit backing the ENS name, you get 0.8 ETH.

**Do I pay an interest?**

We have fixed the interest rate at 0.1% per day on the testnet. 

**I have ENS names on the mainnet, not on the testnet, what do I do?**

No problem. As this is meant to be a PoC, we have deployed an identical copy of the ENS Registrar smart contract on Kovan, using which, we have registered a bunch of ENS names. When you visit our demo, you can request a name from our faucet.

**When does a loan expire?**

We have fixed a loan to expire 30 days since its start date.

**What happens if I do not repay a loan on time?**

If you fail to repay the loan on time, you lose the right to withdraw the collateral from the collateral manager. In the future, the collateral manager will automatically auction off the name to recover as much value as possible. 

**I don’t have an ENS name, can I still try the demo?**

Definitely! When you visit our demo, you can request a name from our faucet.

**When will this work on mainnet?**

We know how excited you are to try out the dApp on mainnet. We intend on letting the dApp stay on the testnet for few months, during which we will also announce a bug bounty campaign. We would submit our smart contracts for public audits, and as we become more confident about the security of the code we transition the dApp to mainnet.

**Next steps**

The demo is a one-sided market. This implies Lendroid functions as the market creator and the lender. Parameters like interest rate, collateral coverage, etc. in the demo were arbitrarily fixed. In the future, we wish to make them market driven. 
We are looking to create a three-sided marketplace with:

* Lenders - Looking to earn an interest on their cryptocurrency
* Borrowers - Looking to borrow against their digital asset
* Moderators - Looking to moderate the collateral coverage requirements, deciding to add / remove specific collateral etc.

You can learn more about our approach from our [whitepaper](https://lendroid.com/assets/whitepaper.pdf).",cryptocurrency

gaming,My eternal battle with Bûth Brennzange (Shadow of Mordor),"So after almost a year after buying I finally got behind the system and gameplay of Shadow of Mordor and started playing the game (before I would just die the whole time and strengthen my enemies). So i am making my way up Saurons Army and can proudly say, that I did not die a single time to any Orc Nemesis or Warchief.
HOWEVER this one prick came back and back and so my infamous archenemy story arose.

The first time I encountered Bûth Brennzange (idk what his name is in english) somewhere around Uduns Crossing I think. I was messing with this one Orc Nemesis and easily defeated him. But.. a second later another Nemesis came around and now I had to fight him too without taking a break and for the love of god he was a caller. So there he goes calling his Orc friends and apparantly I have really bad luck but my soon-to-be-arch-enemy showed up: Bûth. I had a lot of trouble trying to fight both the Nemesis and half an army of Orcs, so I decided to run away. I was able to shake off the first Nemesis. But no Bûth. He LITERALLY followed me ALL THE WAY through Uduns Crossing into the next territory and even though he didn't see me when I was climbing up a tower or some ruins he just decided to stay still down below with 30 Orcs next to him. From afar I could see him jump down ledges, climb up cliffs always being followed by his friends. So I fast travelled to the other side of the map and hoped he would be gone. He was. But guurl this is not the end of this story.

I picked a new target and made my way to him. Halfway through the fight after carefully taking out the stronger Orcs, there HE WAS AGAIN! Disrupting my fight with my new target he just stood there mocking me for running away and AGAIN. He called for reinforcements. I had to do something. I ran for it again. But this time I was expecting him to show up again. 
I was prepared. I took out all the shooters in the area, took control of any caragor around and then he challlenged me again. I was finally able to take him down. I was like YAS BITCH FINALLY. My eternal archenemy was gone.

But you expected it right. This is not the end.

So like 2h later into the game. Now I was busy with ratbag and getting him into the rank of a Warchief. OUT OF NOWHERE he challenges me in the middle of a Orc Horde and screams stuff like ""You thought you got me there right?!"" 
I noticed, that he had lost his ""helmet"". And then he comes at me. It seemed like he's gotten stronger. But that could also be my imagination. I was so fed up with him so I ran away once more and thought to myself, I will take care of him later.

As story progressed, I travelled to Nûrn. Now, happy that I wouldn't see that stupid Brennzange face ever again, I kept on playing. I was so into the game, getting my strong warchiefs together and messing the orc up with graugs and caragors.

After my crossing with my five warchiefs, I reached the fortress in which you would fight the tower. AND NOW GUESS WHO WAS GUARDING THE DAMNED FORTRESS.. YES BÛTH BRENNZANGE. He honestly wouldn't let me alone for the whole game, over 20h gameplay and until the last chapter kept on making fun of me in this stupid way. I laughed like a evil maniac, when he finally fell to the ground. Dead and hopefully never to return again.

I stopped palying after the main story so I don't know if he is still somewhere in Udun. But I don't really wanna find out.

One has an 11.38% interest rate, and I would like to refinance that. I'm having a bit of trouble understanding this though, so some help would be greatly appreciated. 


On my account, it says that this loan has a 'Loan Balance' of $37,629.71. The 'Payoff Balance' is $37,979. My minimum monthly payment is $471.09.

So my questions are... 

Is the Payoff Balance what I will be paying if I pay the minimum every month, not a dollar more or less? 


Is the 'Loan Balance' what I owe minus interest? Which amount do I divide by the monthly payment to find how many more payments I have left?

And finally, I was given [quotes for refinancing through Citizens Bank.](http://i.imgur.com/wmgxu04.jpg) Going off of the 'Total of Payments' column, does this mean whatever option I may choose, I'll be paying more than I would if I didn't refinance, in the long run?

I had little money so I did fha and now knowing what I Know now being in real estate I wish I went conventional. But what ever. My monthly is 1836. Taxes and insurance and pmi included. 3.75 interest rate 30 year term. 


A little background. I was in lots of debt before this year. I'm down to 11,845 from 45000 Jan 17.  I have that money on a 0% interest card for 15months. I'm paying 1,000 a month to kill it in a year. Maybe sooner if I get some more overtime or closings. My credit score is 730 right now. It may go up more we'll see. 
We just had our first kid and are looking into having our second by next summer, Irish twins. So I'll need more room soon. 

What I'm thinking about. Just pondering right now.  I would like to refi my house to a 15 year loan and get rid of pmi. But I also want to renovate my house and add a second level and do some cosmetic changes to the exterior. Is it worth refinancing and taking out equity to do the Reno or should I get a construction loan, Reno then refi. Should I wait 3-4 years and save enough money to maybe do the Reno then. With interests rates low I'd like to lock in soon. Idk. Let's hear it.",finance
personalfinance,Purchasing a Home - So. Cal - Question on Affordability,"My new wife and I are looking to buy a home in Southern California - both with no debt, $135k in savings, combined $135k household income, and 780+ credit scores, no kids, no car payments.  We have a pre-approval letter for up to $600k which was at our request.

Question being, initially we wanted to get a townhome in the mid 400's, which would allow us to still save a bit and be more comfortable, however have found a home that we really like in the area we were looking which is worth around 575k.  With a ~150 HOA, this would put our monthly payments around $3000 with most of our savings going to the downpayment.  

That puts us at ~27% of our pre-tax income, and 40% of our take home (after all deductions including 6% to 401k) going to our housing payment.

We don't have kids but plan to have 2 within the next 5 years.  Currently living rent free with a parent, allowing us to save.  

My concern is I am in southern California - and the market is just insanely hot right now.  We eventually will need to move out and if we rent a similar place the rent itself would at least be $2,500.  

My question is would we be stretching ourselves too much with the home, or should we perhaps wait until interest rates increase to drop home values a bit so we could at least put the 20% down and still have some leftover cash?",finance

personalfinance,Should I focus on paying off my student loans? Or work on putting money in my savings account?,"Hey, everyone. I am 20 years old and make about $41,000 a year. That comes down to about $2,800 a month after taxes.
 
After paying off my credit debt of $1000 (it took me a harsh lesson to realize that credit is not my money) I decided to focus on paying off my student loans.


Total Amount of Student Loans =$11,107.64

Group A, [Subsidized], has **$3,098.99 with an Interest Rate of 4.660%**

Group B, [Unsubsidized], has **$5,574.19 with an Interest Rate of 4.660%**

Group C, [Subsidized], has **$1,656.88 with an Interest Rate of 4.290%**

Group D, [Unsubsidized] has **$752.58 with an Interest Rate of 4.290%**


Initially, I was planning to put at least $800 a month into my student loans and try to pay it off by next year. My coworker tells me it's better to ask for forbearance on my loans and save up before paying it all off at once. 

Are there any better options for me other than these? Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,"[UK] Debt management advice - home owner, unsecured loan and credit cards.","Firstly, thanks for any input that anyone can offer.

Not sure where to start, I've never been great with money, I've been a recovering gambling addict for around 8 years, I had a very bad 3 - 5 year period where I racked up a hell of a lot of debt from gambling. I used to have a very good credit score, companies kept throwing credit at me, I used it to gamble. I had / have a huge problem, I've not gambled in 5 years and my credit score seems to be quite high now (I use clearscore and I have a free experian thing with my barclaycard).

I've recently had a change in circumstances at work, my company was bought out by a larger company and they have politely encouraged people to have a company car. I had a salary of £37k but I also used to have a car allowance which was profitable to me on a monthly basis, I used to get £5k per annum and 0.45p per mile on top (average 2k miles per month) but I had a relatively cheap and economical diesel car. I now have a salary of £40k per year, but the company car tax (BIK Tax) will come off that, plus my private monthly mileage, so my monthly income has been reduced by nearly £500.

I am currently reviewing my monthly outgoings with regards to gas, electric, mobile phone, internet, tv package etc. I'm trying to lower them as much as possible.

I'm posting here in the hope that someone will give me some pointers, I would like to manage my debt in the best possible way. I currently feel like I'm drowning on a month to month basis and my credit card balance is slowly getting larger instead of smaller.

My current debts and interest rates;
Unprotected loan - £30,880.11 - 11.9% APR - 4 years left at monthly payment of £722.38 per month.

I have the option to top up the loan, up to £3500 - 8.9% APR - would be 60 months at a monthly payment of £719.50 per month - would it be worth topping up the loan and paying off the credit card?

Mortgage balance is £107,788 - fixed at 2.49% until August 2018, variable rate is 3.74%

Credit card balance is £2,700 - 17.18% APR (18.6% compound)

I'm considering 'coasting' until next August and potentially taking out a secured loan against our property? Though I'm not sure we'll have the equity in the property. Our next door neighbour just sold their property for £140k, we paid £125k for ours, we also put down a 12% deposit but we have only lived there for 12 months.

Sorry for the format, any input would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks",finance
Forex,Thoughts on USDJPY and Metals,"This week is dollar Stronk.  Everyone is talking about increasing Dollar strength secondary to inflation.  There is a ""widening of the interest rate differential between U.S. Government Bonds and Japanese Government Bonds""; as well, there is an increasing demand for higher risk assets... which straight forward means that money will move *away* from metals and *away* from the Yen, both of which are seen as safe havens in tough times.   

Metals are correlated to the JPY (Japanese Yen), gold more than silver, but both tend to follow the currency quite nicely. Yen up = metals up, and Yen down = metals down, almost to a T. Gold follows this almost rigidly, it is spooky how gold will mirror JPY almost to a tick. Now, most FX traders look at USDJPY... which means that when USDJPY drops, that means Yen is going up, which means metals should climb. Hence, metals are inversely correlated to USDJPY.

Take a look at these two articles:

https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/usdjpy-fundamental-weekly-forecast-its-all-about-u-s-inflation-this-week-427595

Really solid discussion within of the fundamentals that show that a USDJPY long is likely a good choice for the week.  As well: USDJPY produced a doji on the W1 chart, a decent reversal signal when correlated with other data. *Higher time-frames produce stronger signals, and algos have more money and power than you ever will, trader..... and those AIs respect these levels very much.* Check it out: https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/usd-jpy-forecast-bullish-follow-through-likely-after-last-weeks-doji-201708070413

This to me screams both long USDJPY as well as short metals (in whatever capacity you choose).

personalfinance,Tax efficiency with Bond Index investments?,"I've been struggling with the concept of tax efficient placement and bonds (https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax-efficient_fund_placement#Tax_efficiency_of_bonds). Here's my current situation

**In brokerage:**

* $5,000 VBMFX (Total Bond Index Fund)
* various other funds

**In Roth:**

* $4,600 VBMFX (Total Bond Index Fund)
* $22,000 VTSAX (Total US Stock Market Index Fund)
* $6,000 VGSIX (REIT Fund)

Also, I live in a state with no state income tax.

In general, it seems like ""put bonds in Roth IRA"" is recommended and my understand for that is because any returns from bonds (dividends) are taxed at the full income rate (25%), as opposed to stocks where they can be held for the lower long term capital gains rate (15%).

However, currently bonds have very low returns because of low interest rates and the stock market has been growing and growing. I would assume that because of this, the amount the advantage of the 10% gap is decreased. **Perhaps it's even more beneficial to have stocks in tax advantage right now?**

I'm wondering, since my bonds are already split, if there is an even more tax-efficient way to break down my bond investments, or if I'm just over-complicating things. My entire line of thinking revolves around this assumption: *A Total Bond Market Index Fund [VBMFX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0084&amp;FundIntExt=INT) includes bonds that are tax exempt.* If that is true, could I split out the tax exempt bonds, for example [VWITX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0042#tab=2), put those in the Brokerage account and invest in non-tax exempt bonds within my Roth [VGSIX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=1943) and/or a Corporate Bond fund. My hope would be the result gives me similar coverage as a total bond index, but with better tax efficiency.",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on what to do with a life insurance policy payout,"Unfortunately my father recently passed away. He had a whole life insurance policy with my mom as the beneficiary, and I'm tasked with doing what's best for my mom. She's going to take my advice whatever it is.

When my father first bought the whole life policy, the contract stated that if the payout was kept as a savings account under the life insurance company that it would pay a guaranteed minimum 3.5% interest rate or the current rate, whichever was higher. It's a pretty old policy which is why the rate is so high relative to what you'd get now. The policy had a death benefit of $350k.

I'm leaning towards having her keep that money as the savings account rather than lump sum check to get this 3.5%. It's not much in the grand scheme of things esp with inflation but it's better than nothing I figure. And it's safe. Is this the right move? A couple more details:

She has no outstanding debts. House is paid off. She doesn't need the $350k for anything, really. She also has a couple annuities and another life insurance payout from a different company that will provide about $400k. We are taking lump some for those. She gets steady monthly income from rent that is plenty for living comfortably.

The only thing I really hesitate about is that my mom is already getting ~8% with money (about 500k) she has invested with a fund. I don't know more details than that. She could put more money into the fund with this life insurance but I hesitate to have her put all her cash eggs in one basket just to get more return.",finance

* [This is the total amount of aid I received.](http://i.imgur.com/X5SkNBd.png)
* The remaining cost is 18k.

* I have until the 11th to make any/all payments to the private school.
 
* I was denied 3 separate private student loans (Sallie Mae, Discover, and one through a local federal credit union.) On account of my parent's poor credit score.
* I applied Early Decision to this school, and did not apply to any others, because it was the only school I wanted to attend.

Thankfully, I worked hard in high school and I qualify for Say Yes to Education, if you're unfamiliar, this program covers your tuition in full to certain colleges. The school I was planning on attending was not one of them (Yes, I know, I'm an idiot.)

That being said, I have options. I can attend the local community college for virtually free aside from textbooks, since I would be commuting. I was going to school for Computer Engineering, but I think I could change my major to Computer Science or CIS with the community college. 

What I'd like some help on is deciding, is it worth it to put myself massively in debt at this private school, where my admission isn't guaranteed after the first year, or should I abandon my dream school to go to a local school? I think I could go to the local school in the spring, but I don't know if that would cause any issues given the fact that I applied ED to the private school.

I think the private school is off the table honestly. I just am lost in a sea of invoices, denied loans, and emotion. I don't know what to do honestly.

**EDIT:** I just got off the phone with the admission dept., and they gave me some options. My parents can apply for the Federal PLUS loan in order to pay for school, I can deffer my enrollment, or I can fully withdraw my enrollment with no penalty due to the circumstances.

personalfinance,Using loans to help pay for college housing,"I hope I haven't missed anything in the rules for posting this. 

I'm entering my third year of college and currently living in an apartment with roommates. My parents' financial situation is tight and they haven't helped contribute much to college, so I've been using private and federal loans to help pay. From what it looks like I'll end school with about $50k in private loans and $20k in federal loans, all at or under 7.3% interest rate currently. This is for a degree in computer science, where I am looking to get about $65k/year out of school. I'm not super worried about it, but I figured I'd ask for assistance.

My main question is on using loans to help pay for housing. I have a little more than $12k in savings from working in high school. My apartment costs $750/month, including optional parking which I need to get to work. My dad set me up with taking out extra money in loans to pay for my apartment, as he believes it's better to have money in savings prepared for an emergency than it is to spend it all now and end school with almost nothing. 

I have heard though that you should never take out loans for an apartment and that you need to live within your means. Living with my parents isn't an option because they moved further away from my school. Finding cheaper housing (down to ~$550) could be an option, but my current setup is extremely good for the price I'm paying and I would rather not want to worry about finding new roommates and accommodations, and it really wouldn't save that much.

* PayPal Credit - $808.79 - $3,500 limit, 19.99% APR

* Capital One - $8.75, $500 limit, 24.99% variable APR

* Ulta - $700, $1,210 limit (website is down, this is estimated), 26.74% APR

* Therapy debt - around $500 or so, but I try to pay the full cost of a session every time I go now so as to not raise it. This is not gathering interest, and we have an understanding that it will take a long while to fully pay down.

I'll also be accruing student loans in a year, but I'm not focusing on that just yet. Credit score is around 630.


Obviously, I'm going to pay off that Cap One bill first. I used it for something small because I was told to ""keep it active"" so it wouldn't be closed. For several months, I've been paying about $40 on each per month, with a little extra when I can.


**My questions:**

* What should I pay off first? I've heard mixed things, like to pay off the highest interest, or the smallest balance, etc. but I've been focusing mostly on paying down the highest balance, which is hard, because it's also the one I have to use most often (Chase).


* What is a feasible amount of time I can do this in? I'm not expecting a quick fix by any means.


* How much should I be paying?

personalfinance,[auto] Better to pay off car and be debt free or wait out the payments?,"Hello PF! I have a pretty challenging option at hand. I recently bought a car which totaled out to be 28k in auto loan debt. My payments are $458/month with a 72/month loan at 3.74% interest. (reason why I did it at 72 was a lot more wiggleroom if anything came up and interest wasn't much more different)

I am putting away +$600 more a month (sometimes more if I can) which brings the payments to $1058/month and at this rate I can have a paid off in around 2.5 years (Putting my bonuses/income taxmas towards it)

Now that's fine and dandy, and I have no issue making those payments as I have for the past several months and can live a comfortable lifestyle, but I am selling my house which will bring me around $15,000-$20,000 realistic extra money from the sale as I'm buying a new house. Now the question becomes should I put that extra money toward the car and pay it off ~a year and live debt free OR just make the payments due to the low interest rate and do something else with the money (bigger downpayment on the house, invest etc..)? 

The ultimate goal is to live a debt free life other than my mortgage and this is the last debt I have.

personalfinance,No brainer student loan refinance? Am I forgetting something?,"About 6 months ago I refinanced my $190,000 in student loans from a federal to a private company. Current interest rate for my consolidated private student loan is 3.75% (fixed) and the loan is amortized over 10 years.

I could choose 5, 10 or 15 yrs for the loan period; I assume I would keep the 10 year plan if I refinance.

The box that i must check states
""I elect not to have federal and state income taxes withheld from this distribution. I understand that I'm responsible for paying any taxes due, and that if my estimated tax payments are insufficient, I may incur penalties.""

then there is an option on how vanguard will send me my tax withholding notice. I don't fully understand what will happen once i go through with this. How do i pay the taxes? Do they come out of the ira? Do i have to write the government a check? I have about 17k in the account so im worried im going to end up immediately owing the government like 25% of that.

personalfinance,Advice for realizing my retirement dreams?,"Here's my background:

* Salary is ~130k/yr. My field is very stable, I'm able to replace this salary easily.
* I'm 32, single, no kids, with zero debt except a mortgage. No other loans, no CC balances.
* I just bought a home in and up and coming area outside of Seattle. I financed $340k, resulting in roughly $2100/mo for mortgage. This is a fixed 30 year.
* At least 50% of my net pay goes into savings. 
* Excellent credit, just shy of 800 score which meant low rates for PMI and interest.
* I have $60k in my 401k after 3 years, contributing 15% per pay period.
* I have another $50k sitting in my bank account for a general ""whatever fund"". My interest rate is pretty low here - .05%

I know this might sound vague, but my goal is to be financially sound enough to be able to retire within 15 years with at least 1.5M to my name. I'm at a crossroads as to how I can make the best use of my money at this point. I'm going to assume I will never have a pension or see a single cent of social security and am trying to be very conservative with my projections.",finance
personalfinance,Preparing for higher taxes?,"Throw away for obvious reasons...

So it looks like this question has been asked quite a few times, but I feel like my situation may be slightly different.

The facts:

* Last year I made $115k. I filed as ""married filing single""
* My wife made $108k and filed the same way
* We ended up paying roughly 39% of our $223k income in taxes. This includes federal taxes and programs as well as state income tax (Oregon)

This year we both received minimal raises. She'll be making around $111k while I'll be making closer to $140k. That would put us at the dreaded $250k house hold income range. When preparing for the massive tax burden what would PF suggest putting away? We both work for reputable companies and assume they're doing their part tax wise, however last year we received no tax refund and ended up having to pay an additional $890. All in we paid roughly $87k in taxes last year, and that seems incredibly high.

This scares me going into tax season for 2017 as our HHI will be in a higher bracket. How can I prepare for this? What amount should I prepare? Is there anything legally I can do to reduce our burden?

Any help is greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"If I have an extra 10k(+) in student loans, is there anything I can do with them to make money for the year that I'm in college?","I have ""extra loans"" to the tune of at least 10k.

investing,Has anyone invested a loan in the market?,"Same question as the title. 

I've been researching whether or not it's viable for students to take a loan and invest that money into the market to try and beat their interest rate by the end of their education. I'm researching it for a piece for a magazine, and so far my inquiries have turned up short; perhaps because of the legally dubious nature of the practice.  

Yes, I know the immediate reaction is ""No!"" But I'm still curious if someone has to manage to pull off the massive gamble; doesn't have to be a student loan. There are a few success stories like Chris Sacca, who—as far as I can tell—just happened to be investing at the right time, i.e. during the Dot-com boom, only to lose it. 

I'm curious if anyone has; if they were successful; would they advise someone else to do the same. 

Or, maybe you can just elaborate on why you think investing a loan in the market is a horribly stupid idea—or maybe you'll be the first to tell me it's not.",finance

personalfinance,"Question: Paying California taxes even though I'll be in NC most of the year, question about how to handle this?","So here is the situation. I've been in the process of moving from San Francisco to NC over the past few months. My lease (with my friend and cohabitant) ends at the end of September. It's rent controlled so I don't really mind paying for my share while I'm gone.

Why I'm in NC when I have a rent controlled SF apartment? Well, family. Mom's sick and I've been staying at my sisters house for a large part of the year. It just seems silly for me to keep both places if I'm going to be in NC so much. So tax issues.

Before I started work at this large company I was mainly a contractor, usually 1099 which maybe some C2C. This is my first time as a full time employee in a couple years, and last time I was a full time CA resident so it was easy. So when I was onboarding I had a couple things to fill out obviously.

Since my ID says SF, I put my SF address as Home 1, and then I put my NC address as Home 2 (Mailing). Then came out of the portion on the web portal for me to fill out my taxes. Federal is easy, then came state. It asked which state. Since I think it's quite possible I'll be in NC over half the year, I wanted that to be my primary tax state and I'd work the rest out with my accountant. So I filled out the NC tax information on my online portal, I thought case was closed. I filled out federal, and I filled out NC.

First paycheck comes and it's about 250 light. I checked it out and it's exactly the difference in a bi-weekly paycheck between California and NC taxes. Contact payroll and they tell me because  my work/home address are showing CA it's going to be CA and I'll have to work the rest out with my accountant. I don't see a ""work"" address section in my online portal, just two addresses for home and home2, with home2 set as my mailing right now.

Tl:dr: Losing about 500 a month for being taxed as a California even though I think I should be taxed as a North Carolinian right now. Not sure how to fix it.",finance
personalfinance,Are small private student loans right for me? Advise for best options.,"I'm in my junior year of college for my bachelors in CS, and up to this point I've been able to get by with 0 student loans by paying whats left in monthly payments but it's starting to become unbearable with $700+ in monthly payments, rent, and other bills. Due to reasons I cannot get any federal loans/help through FASFA. With this in mind the only options I have are private student loans to cover the amount that is not covered by other sources, which is about $3000-$4000 per semester. I was approved through Sallie Mae for $3200 at a fixed rate of 11%. Is this a viable option for each semester totaling in around $12,000-$15,000 after graduation? What are some other options or lenders I can look into?

personalfinance,Any ideas on how to keep credit card interest to a minimum while sorting out the fallout from a divorce?,"I'm currently in the middle of a protracted and messy divorce, and it looks like it's going to be a while yet before the finances are sorted out. One issue is that the credit cards that are in my name have been carrying a total of about $70,000 in debt for a few months now, and I don't know how much longer it's going to be before I can pay them off—or if I will even have to, as legally half of the debt belongs to my ex (I live in California, so credit card debt accumulated during the marriage, as well as any interest accrued on said debts, is a community liability). Luckily my income is high enough and my expenses are (generally) low enough that I actually am not very worried about paying off that much debt, and could probably do so in about a year if it were not for the substantial legal fees, which have been far and away my primary expense lately. 

Anyway, between my income and whatever the financial outcome of the divorce is, I'm not really concerned about my ability to pay this debt off—eventually. The problem is that I really have no idea how long that could take. It could be months or years before the dust settles, and in the interim I'd prefer to keep interest on the credit card debt to a minimum if possible.

I've looked into debt consolidation loans, but a lot of them seem to top out at between $20-30k, and the ones that go higher don't really offer any advantage in terms of interest rates (which are about 9%, 16%, and 20% on my three main credit cards). I've also looked at opening a new card and doing a balance transfer, but of course because I'm at nearly maxed out on credit card utilization, my credit score isn't really great right now (around 620 when I last checked), so it's hard to find a credit card with a zero or low-interest balance transfer rate and a credit limit high enough to make it worthwhile.

I'm aware that the sums of money I'm casually talking about here probably make this sound like ""rich people problems,"" but I'm honestly just sort of lost as to where to even begin attacking this. I don't really consider myself a financially irresponsible person, but this is all fairly new to me. During my marriage, my ex pretty much handled (and mismanaged) all of our finances. Hence, the divorce. Now that I'm taking responsibility for my own finances, it's actually much less scary than I thought it would be. But I've got to start somewhere, and this seems like the simplest thing I can do right now to get my finances under control. If the answer is just that I have to suck it up and continue paying interest on these credit cards until I pay it all down or the divorce settles, then oh well. But if anyone has any ideas on how I can at least start taming this beast, I would be much obliged.",finance
personalfinance,Fair terms for a (generous) parental loan to pay off student loans?,"I currently owe about 63k in student loans (see breakdown of interest rates and amounts here: http://i.imgur.com/8BquFC4.png) but really screwed up by not starting to pay immediately after college was over, causing my credit rating to drop to 595 (up from low 700's) so I can't refinance. I make about 60k/year working as a software developer. My mom has expressed some interest in bailing me out with a low interest mom loan. My question is, what would be fair interest rates for both parties for such a loan? She also would like some kind of legitimate response to ""what happens if you lose your job?"" and I don't have any good ideas about that.",finance

personalfinance,Daughter born: Want to start her off right,"Hi Everyone,

My wife and I recently had our first child. A beautiful little girl.


My parents couldn't help me with anything financially growing up, and I don't want that tradition to continue. I have opened up a bank account for her in which $100 is auto-deposited every month. I plan to continue this trend until she is 18--and then give her the money (or if she's demonstrably irresponsible, use it to quietly help her when she is in need).

Now without the paltry interest that banks pay, that will amount to $21,600. Right now it's in a simple savings account with TD Bank but I'd like to move it into something that will pay a much better interest rate (and quite possibly a compounding interest--if that's even possible). 

Can anyone recommend where I can place/invest this money for the next 18 years so that my daughter has a solid financial foundation from which to begin her adult years?",finance

personalfinance,Bitcoin long term capital gains tax questions (~1.2M USD),"Hello

Throwaway of course, I'm an early adopter of bitcoin and am thinking about cashing out some or all of them. I've read most of the wiki, nothing seems directly relevant unfortunately.

I've got about 300 bitcoin that I would be interested in selling, and I expect I might be able to get roughly 1.2 million gross from that.

I have a day job that pays 68k/year pretax, and I live in New Hampshire.

According to what I've read, I would only pay 15% tax on the long term capital gains from the bitcoin sales, but then do I have a higher tax bracket for my federal income tax for my day job stuff?

Looking for any/all feedback, investment suggestions for after I sell, tax advice, etc.

My plan so far is sell on an exchange, withdraw to bank account (probably have to talk to my bank first, so they don't freak out about a ton of money suddenly showing up), then invest in index funds, possibly a house, etc.

Thank you very much everyone!",finance
personalfinance,Private loans killing me - need second job help,"Hi everyone, I’m not here to complain and say boohoo me. Put simply, I have about $50k in private student loans with a great interest rate but nonetheless the monthly nut is killing me so it became clear I need a second job and I’m hoping for some suggestions. 

I have a great FT IT job and work flexible hours , typically 8-4 so I can work anytime before or after. Unfortunately Uber is out as I made a dumb decision to buy a Fiat 500 since it was cheap and economical and in doing so that limits me. I have an Amazon distribution center close to me but the pay is only about $11/hour which I will certainly do if necessary but I don’t as wondering if there were any suggestions you guys might have for second jobs. 

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Hope you all have a great day!",finance

personalfinance,"[M 31] about $70,000 in debt (Student Loans, Credit Cards, Auto Loan). Veteran, divorced and providing most of the care for my young child. I am finally facing my finances and I'm drowning. I need help and have no clue what to do.","Ok, so as I said, I'm 31, divorced, have a 4 year old son. I was an idiot when I was young and racked up a lot in student loans, and never finished school. I joined the navy, got a good sign on bonus, paid some down. Got married, had child, got out of the navy, got a job. Then the divorce, all of my expenses were contingent on 2 incomes, now its just mine and I am paying out more than I make.

Here's my breakdown:

* roughly 60K in Student loans, combination of Federal, private, and a parent plus in my fathers name. I pay about $650/month  
* Rent - $850/month  
* Car - $210/Month  
* Insurance - $150/Month  
* Credit Cards - 2 with a combined balance of around $3000, $200/month  
* Daycare - $200/month  
* Electricity - $100/month  
* Phone - $50/month  
* Gas/Groceries - estimating about $300/month  
* I don't eat out anymore, don't really do much trying to save any penny I can  

I take home around $2,400/month now

I know I need to start making serious changes, I just got my credit report, its not good, in the mid 500's. This is the first time I've actually addressed a lot of this, being that I have huge anxiety and just sort of shut down about it for a long time. I have no clue where to begin. I'm looking for better paying jobs, but for my area with my background most offers are for less than I currently make. There is no raise in sight here though. I lurk this sub frequently, and most solutions I see suggested seem so out of my reach and daunting that I just freak out and run away (I know, not healthy, I'm dumb) but I am starting to make this my priority NOW. My son deserves better, so do I.

Thanks for any feedback.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advice. I feel a lot less desperate after reading all of your advice. I actually just spoke with the admissions office for an online program in my field. I can Start September 1st, I can receive around $700/month in living expenses from the GI Bill. Its a start, it gets me money now, while bettering my earning potential, plus once I have the degree and payed down some debt I will be eligible for loan refinancing. I'm not after my ex for money because we agreed on joint custody and to not make the divorce messy, we both provide for our son, my main problem was just that we had a 2 income house that is now 1, shes not a deadbeat.

Again, thank you everyone, I love this community.",finance

personalfinance,Refinanced student loans interest rate is already climbing. Any suggestions?,"So last year I refinanced my student loans (approx 50k) all from 6.8% or 7.25% down to a variable interest rate to 4.92%. In a year they are already up to almost 5.75%. Is it possible to refinance again looking for a lower rate? Is this just the market that we are in or is there anything I can do to either request a lower rate?

 A friend of mine claims he told his loan company when they tried to charge him 7% that he wasn't paying on it until they dropped his rate to ~2.5% and after two months of not paying they did indeed drop his rate. I think its a bold strategy but at this rate I'm already paying over 1/3 of my payment in monthly interest. Its already getting out of hand. Is this something people have actually done to try and save on interest? 

I should include that my credit score is in the mid to high 700s and I make over 50k a year still living at home basically rent free.",finance

personalfinance,Best banks for traveling,"Hey all, 

Quick background, I'm 24, and recently moved from TN to southern GA for work, and my bank isn't down here (BoA). I'm looking for a new bank, and have done some research, but still need some help. I don't want a credit union because I do travel fairly often and don't want to keep switching banks every 2 to 3 years due to location issues.

I'm looking for a bank that can do several things for me.

1. ATM fee reimbursement/No ATM Fee
2.  Able to deposit cash easily.
3. Good interest rate for savings.
4. Deposit checks through mobile banking.
5. No transfer fees or maintenance fees (currently experiencing this with my savings account with them)

I don't know if I want to completely cancel my BoA account, as I haven't really had any bad experiences with them, or incurred any fees besides an overdraft protection fee, but I am open to the idea of it if it's worth doing (including moving all my auto pay bills to a new account). I have checks but rarely use them and am OK without them. However, I am interested in closing my savings account with them and transferring those into a new account.

It seems Ally is a great savings account, and my plan there is just to put money in to have some good passive growth. Schwab checking seems to be another good checking option, if it can cover my points above.

I do have a credit card with a balance with BoA, if I close my accounts, how does that affect the card? I've just been working on paying it off lately.

I'm trying to get more into planning my finances better, and figured this is a good step. 

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Getting an auto loan and investing cash vs paying cash for car?,"Lets say I'm buying a car for $30,000.  The interest rate I could get is 1.9% for 36 months.  I could also pay for this car in cash.

I hear a lot of folks saying that I would be better served to stick that cash in the market where it could earn 6 or 7%.  

My question is this:  People who finance cars because their money will work better for them in the market, what kind of fund do they put that money in that allows them to draw the monthly car payment value out of?  I thought anything that would get a decent return wasn't very liquid, and not easily accessible every month?",finance
personalfinance,Refi or no refi?,"We currently just did about 30k worth of work on our house using mostly a HELOC of 23k.  Our current interest rate is 3.75% +.5% PMI.  I have started the process to have our servicer get an appraisal ordered to hopefully get PMI removed.  Essentially the the PMI vs the interest on the 23k HELOC is about the same, the difference is the HELOC is paying for equity improvements vs PMI going nowhere.  We're looking at 60-90 days for the PMI removal process and it is not a slam dunk as the servicer requires the appraisal to come in at 75% LTV, I think we are there but again it all depends on the appraisers opinion not mine.  I could get a refi locked today at 3.875% with about $2500 in closing and get about 25k out and our monthly payment will be almost identical to where our current payment is.  This gets the HELOC freed up and rolled into a lower interest rate with the mortgage and allows us to avoid the interest only payments on the HELOC and just focus on the mortgage (where I'll have the bandwidth to pay 2-300 extra a month).  We plan on being in this house 5-6 more years (been in it one already).",finance
personalfinance,Downpayment &amp; Timing question,"My wife and I are 30, no kids, and we're from the Houston, TX area. We have almost no debt, household income $95K+, and due to a number of health issues and other unexpected expenses this year, have only about $3K in savings. Credit is moderate (633) and trending upwards. 

We currently lease a single-family unit, with the lease up November 1 and rent expected to increase from $1500 to $1700 if we re-sign. Our landlord is also currently trying to sell the property, so it's unclear if we will be able to re-sign or remain month-to-month come November 1.

Our desire is to purchase a home and not keep renting. It seems that in the Houston market, we could purchase a home and even with PMI, insurance, HOA fees, and property taxes still be about where our rent payments would be. To our minds, the extra costs of maintenance would be worth having a place of our own and the security that brings. For reference, we're looking in the $180K-$200K price range. With this in mind, we tried to save up cash for a downpayment but ended up spending it on other emergencies (proves the value of an emergency fund!). 

I do have a retirement account, but have no plans to raid that to pay for a downpayment. Additionally, I have a large bonus that should come at the end of October. Gift funds from family members are not an option.

After meeting with a couple mortgage bankers/brokers, we've determined that we are on track for having enough cash for an FHA loan by the beginning of October and we were conditionally pre-approved for $215K presuming we secured the remaining cash. That date leaves three weeks before our lease expires, which is a little too close for comfort. An alternative option would be to secure a loan to cover the amount of downpayment/closing costs we'd be short. Our mortgage banker stated he could do a mortgage for us with that kind of loan, but the credit score hit would mean we pay a higher interest rate on the mortgage.

General advice would be appreciated—even the advice to keep renting, which I think might be PF's general take on our kind of situation—but specific advice to these questions is desired:


* **Would a small (&lt; $5,000) loan to make up the downpayment costs be worth the extra interest payment to move on a home purchase sooner?**
* **Should we re-sign a lease addendum/extension now, with the current landlord, to cover us for those months until we have cash for downpayment?**
* **Are we crazy for thinking we should buy a house with less than 20% down?**


Thanks!",finance

Bitcoin,Confirmations are Slower than Ever,"I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about bitcoin as everyone here in this group so take that into consideration. I'm merely a bitcoin user, not a developer.

I assume that this is due to the blockchain size these days. I've been waiting for the day when Amazon adopts bitcoin, but now I'm realizing that unless something changes soon, nobody's going to adopt it. Nobody's going to want to wait an hour for their coffee purchase to be confirmed before they can drink it, so I don't see it being widely adopted. I tried buying one thing and then immediately buying something else, I had to wait for one confirmation before I could do that, it took an hour.

$150 combined credit card payments

$150 unknown expenses

Total Minimum Expected: $1250
Leaves $650 monthly. 

Breakdown of debts:

TJMAXX CC - $800, 28% apr, min pay $25

Walmart CC - $700, 18% apr, min pay $25

Carecredit CC - $1900, 24% apr, 6 month interest deferred, min pay $100

Student loans - $26k, rates from 2%-6.5% higher interest rates are for smaller unsubsidized loans, for the most part

Personal loan - $5200, 13% interest, 45 out 48 months left

Life problems racked up the non student debt, not happy about it, getting life on track, though.


Investments so far:

401a FICA alt plan - $265

401k walmart - $3150, expecting $350 added before I quit



I will be contributing a mandatory 7.5% of grad stipend to 401a FICA alt plan while in college. Won't have to pay social security tax. Definitely want to start retirement fund early.

My first goal is to establish an emergency fund of about $6000 and kill off CC debts and personal loan afterwards. Then start on additional retirement in a ROTH ira, assuming my stipend is counted as earned income.

Something I considered was cashing out my 401k, I should be having a small net gain after taxes and early withdrawal penalties. This money would go to killing off credit card debt, highest interest card and down from there. TJMAXX card is probably going to be executed. I'll sort of recoup my retirement losses in 2 years through 401a contributions. And I tend to not spend money unless I have to. The CC deby and personal loan were for unexpected costs of life. Shouldn't have that to worry about again for a while.

Other than that, any advice? Anything will be much appreciated!!",finance
personalfinance,Borrowing from 401k to pay off student loans... bad idea?,"Hi All, 

What do you all think about borrowing from your 401k to pay off a remaining student loan balance? I'm going back and forth in my mind on this topic and have read conflicting viewpoints. On one hand, it's taking returns that you have already locked in through 401k investments, putting that money towards paying off debt (financial and emotional burden) and paying yourself ""interest"" when you pay back the loan. I could see this playing out well if the student loan interest rate (i.e. 5%) ends up being higher than the rate of return you would have missed out(i.e. 4%) on by pulling your money from the market. 

Right now I see a strong upside to this strategy and a lack of a strong enough argument against doing so... Can anyone offer a different perspective?",finance
personalfinance,Need help regarding short term investment decision.,"In about 2-3 years, me and my wife plan to buy a house that we will live in for a long period of time ~18 years. However, we are not looking to do so until two years, as we would like to save up some money as a ""relief fund"" as well as money to remodel/furnish the house we move into.

Instead of just trying to stockpile money until that 2-3 year period is up, we are looking into short term investing. However, this is something we are not experienced in.

One idea we are toying with is buying a newly built house (house values for newly builts in our area near Atlanta, Georgia seem to be rising really quickly ~10% this past year) that is around $240k with a 15-year mortgage at around ~$200k and 4% interest. Instead of paying the approximate 1400 monthly, we would be paying about 2400 monthly for it. Looking at an Amortization schedule with those figures (i think i used 3.8% which was the optimal for the following), it seems like we would have a balance  ~150k, having paid ~14k in interest.

Even considering a 5% annual increase in value, the house we will have a house valued at ~264k that we owe ~150k on leaving our gain on the property to be about breaking even. Am I missing something important here, or is the housing market not reliable enough to expect the % increase to go up by much more? It just seems like we have very low interest rates right now in the area.",finance
personalfinance,The best credit card with 0% balance transfer and new purchases?,"Hi all... throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I've started my own business about a year ago and it was doing well, but now it's taking a huge decline which has forced me to look for a new job along with some other factors.

I have driven my current credit card up to $12k the past year and also ran into some bad luck with medical expenses, about $8000. My insurance company sucks and the hospital wants to charge a ridiculous rate. 

Should I move my credit card balance (or maybe a portion of it) and my hospital expenses to a new card with no interest rate for at least 18 months? This will give me proper time to find a job and pay off the cards, hopefully in 18 months.

personalfinance,Unique car situation with a 2014 Ford Focus Hatch,"I drive an automatic red 2014 Ford Focus hatchback. My car has 45,000 miles and is in good condition. I've had regular maintenance at my local Ford dealership and have brought my Focus in for all recalls. I've owned the car for 1.5 years. Before I owned it, it was a rental car.

The 2014 Ford Focus, along with a few years proceeding and following it, have a known transmission problem. The problem can be in a few different places, but for me it's been the clutch. I've had the clutch replaced twice since owning it. Both times under warranty and both times resulting in costs of around $2,000. Ford hasn't come up with a fix for the transmission issues and I don't expect them too. Ford has extended the warranty on some years to 7 years or 100k miles, but my car doesn't fall into this extension for the transmission warranty. So I have about 2 years or 15,000 miles left on my warranty for the transmission. I expect to hit the two years and not the 15,000 miles. 

I bought the car for $10k and owe $6.5k. My interest rate is 1.8%. The lender has a lien on the title. My saving are $14k. The KBB value is ~$9,000 in a private sale and ~$6,500 at a dealership. 

My question is what should I do with this car in light of the transmission likely needing replacement after the car is out of warranty? And likely needing regular replacement after the car is out of warranty? 

Right now my options, as I see them, are as follows:  
1. Sell the car in a private sale and use an escrow service to pay off the loan and transfer the title to the buyer. Then buy a new car.  
2. Sell the car at a dealership and buy a new car there too.  
3. Hold on to the car and pay for transmission work out of pocket after the warranty is over.  
4. Hold on to the car and purchase an extended warranty for $2k. 

I'm sure there are more options but those are the ones that I've considered. I would like to do option #1 asap because I feel like I'm wasting money on this car right now. #'s 2-4 are in order of what I'd like to do most to what I'd like to do least. 

tl;dr I have a car that has had around $4,000 in repairs done to the clutch, all under warranty. My warranty ends in 2 years. I can likely sell the car for the amount I owe on it. Assume the transmission will continue to need work, costing thousands of dollars a year after the warranty has expired. What would you do with this car?


If anyone has additional advice or opinions I'd love to hear them. If I've left out any pertinent information let me know and I'll provide it. 

Edit: if anyone finds this post in the future, after looking up 14M01, which is the document Ford put out explaining the extended warranty on some models I do not have the extended coverage on the transmission. My model year is 2014 but the build date falls outside of the range Ford said in 14M01. You can check your build date at etis.ford.com under the vehicle tab.",finance
personalfinance,"26 in CA, 45K in the bank, have a couple questions. Am I on the right track?","Hello,

I have a few questions about how I should be investing my savings. I've done some research of my own, but I'd like the opinions of others as well.

First, a little basic information about me. I'm 26, making $48k per year. I'm currently living in CA. I have no debts and my student loans have been paid off in full.

Over the past 8 years or so, I've been able to save about 45k, and it's currently doing nothing for me (savings account). I have allocated $10k as my emergency fund, which still leaves me with a large chunk that is wasting away.

I have recently opened a Roth IRA with Vanguard, and contributed $5500 to VFFVX (their 2055 target-date fund). 

Additionally, my company offers a 401k and Roth 401k through Fidelity, but there is no guaranteed match (discretionary) and the options are...not so good. Expense ratios are all above 1%. Despite this, I'm currently saving 25% of my paycheck (10% traditional and 15% into the Roth) all invested into the 2055 target date fund. What are your thoughts on this? Poor decision? Any advice in this area is appreciated. I have the details of the options below the body of this post.

Lastly,  I have debated upping my 401k contributions to the maximum (90%) and living off my savings as a way to get that money into a retirement account and maximize my funds. However, with the poor quality of my options, is this a bad way to go? Would it be better to use a taxable account instead?

Thanks for your time and assistance.

personalfinance,I got in a position where I had to pay off my family's debt...,"My family has always spent more than their income allowed them to and they locked themselves in a cycle of payday loans, which lasted over 5 years until today.

Worst part is, due to their poor credit score they weren't able to get the payday loan to begin with. I was 18 at the time and was unemployed. They thought it would be a way out of their financial struggles if they borrowed the money on my name and, of course, repay the debt accordingly.

I have warned them that if they keep spending more than they earn, eventually they will be beaten by the interest payments. How right was I.

Recently I've found out from my credit report that I have one or more accounts with a certain company closed due to default or repossession. It dated back in July. 

I am now unable to take any loans to consolidate my personal loan I've taken few years ago with somewhat high interest rate, so I'm stuck with it for now. There is a possibility that I won't be able to get any credit at all for the next 5 years while the default note stays on my credit file. Hopes of becoming a homeowner are slipping away.
My family have recently bought themselves a new car, which they could afford by borrowing money from me.

I don't want to compromise my family and report a fraud, where in most cases people should. I have had £1,500 worth on my account (after living a somewhat good life), most of which I've used to pay for the outstanding debt (which was passed on to a debt collector).

personalfinance,Trade my newer truck for a cheaper one?,"I have a small business that is four months old and doing rather well. Unfortunately, my income is almost on par with my bills and I'm not saving any money. A large chunk of my expenses is my 2015 Toyota Tacoma. I bought this truck when I had a corporate oil and gas job, and was making a lot more money. My payment is $540/mo. with a 2.5% interest rate.

I'm on a slash-and-burn mission on my bills and right now I think there are two options for me: refinance the Toyota and lower my payment a little, or trade it in on an older, higher mileage truck. I have to have a truck for my business.

If I refinance, I could lower my payment by about $80/mo, but end up paying more end the end due to higher APR for used loans. However, I keep a low-mileage, dependable truck.

If I sell it or trade it in, I could probably use the $1k or so in equity, and buy and older, higher-mileage truck that would place my payments at around  $375 - $400/mo. I then have to worry about maintenance and reliability issues. (I'm considering a 2012-2013 Ford F-150 with 80k - 100k miles.

**My current finances:**

I'm 22. I graduated December 2016 with a BA in English and was hired right after New Years as a customer service rep. making $17/hr with fulltime hours and benefits. It’s not my desired field, but I took the job right away because I wanted to have an income and insurance while I search for a job in publishing. I also work part-time on the weekends for $10/hr at a local gift shop, a side gig I’ve held onto since 2013. 

I have around 20K in federal student loans that I’ve been paying off at around ~$500-$700 a month, targeting the loans with the highest interest rates. I also borrowed around 4.5k from my parents during college to help with some expenses, been paying them back ~$500 every month, and will be paid off by the end of September.  

I don’t have many expenses at the moment—I live at home rent free, and my work pays for public transit. $250/month goes toward my insurance, HSA, and 401k. My spending fluctuates a lot, but I’ve never gone into credit card debt. 

I have around $2.5k in savings right now, which I add to every month, with the intention of putting even more into it every month after I pay off my parents.  

I have some stock I was given as a baby that is worth around 10k right now. It was intended to help me pay for a house or something big like that, so I haven't dipped into it at all. 

My credit is hovering at around 703 right now— I pay of my credit card in full every month, but all my accounts are still pretty young.

**What kind of change should I make?**

This is working right now, but I’m not happy with my life. I've been working on these longterm goals: 

* move out
* buy a car  
* get a job in my field 

Yesterday, I just got a job rejection for a editing position I interviewed and was ""a leading contender"" according to the letter, and it really left me depressed. While my job right now is fine, I really do want to be working in my field, and now feel like I should be doing something more to make this happen...

I've been looking at a Editing certificate program at the University of Chicago that I could take online, but would cost me around 6k. It would be perfect because I could take the courses while keeping my current job, and it would give me some great professional training that would make me a more competitive candidate for the jobs I actually want. 

My friend, who is always the voice of reason with me, countered that ""in terms of your immediate needs and day-to-day quality of life – I think you are going to want to move out of your mom’s house before you’re 25ish. And loans are a real thing that you want to keep paying . And your job options would be exponentially expanded if you were able to drive to the suburbs for work, which might negate the need for the certificate in the first place.""

I just feel like time is ticking and I want to get into an entry level publishing job as soon as I can, which I don't know if I can do with my current resume.

I just need some other perspectives here, I feel like I'm drowning a little trying to balance my priorities. I feel depressed that I am working a job outside of my desired field-- but I also feel depressed that I live with my mom, and I feel depressed that I have to have friends pick me up if I want to go out. I also would feel guilty if I were to started paying less on my loans. 

**TL;DR** I want a job in my desired field (publishing), but don't know if I should hold out, pay off debt, and achieve some goals like a place of my own/car, or go back to school and get a professional certificate in Editing for around 6k. I'm an anxious mess.",finance
financialindependence,Looking for feedback: Front Loading 401k/HSA. Are the taxes really the same?,"I would like to discuss something that I have come across as I was doing research on front loading my 401k as I am thinking of doing so next fiscal year.  The common arguments that I see for front loading are:  

1. Studies have been done where lump-sum at the beginning of the year beat DCA 66% of the time.  

2. The taxes are the same so it doesn't matter which way you invest.  

I am having trouble with the tax statement, and this may just go to my limited understanding of the US tax system.    I ran some numbers through paycheck city using an ""aggressive"" front loading strategy where all funds would be deposited into the 401k and HSA by the 10th paycheck.  

I used a bi-monthly pay period to help with some of my math.  So 10 pays or 5 months would have $1800 deposited to the 401k and $340 deposited to the HSA.  In this scenario I also included $40 per paycheck to be set aside as a health premium with the included tax break that provides.  This is set to be a Single filer in a state with no income tax and I did not take any federal allowances.

What came out surprised me a little.  In the table below you can see that there is some ""tax savings"" during the year, depending on income if I just DCA the contributions.  I assume that I will get those taxes back as a refund come tax time?  However, that money is then tied up with uncle sam until I can access it.

$120000 | $3,926.16 | $28,854.92 | $28,523.52 | $331.40

  Does it still make sense to front load 401k/HSA even if I am missing a bit of money during the year that could be earning interest?  I have not seen any studies showing the actual gain of lump-sum vs. DCA and in addition I have not seen any studies on what would happen if that ""lump-sum"" was put into the market over say the first 5 months or 3 months of the year versus DCA across the year.   Because what we are really talking when we talk about front loading is not true lump-sum investing (unless of course you make enough money to put away your entire 401k limit on your first paycheck) but a shortened DCA time-frame each year.  I would be interested if any one could point me to any long term market studies that have been done on the returns of front loading a 401k over a few months at the beginning of the year vs DCA across the entire year.

personalfinance,[investing] Why should I pay extra toward my 4.6% interest student loan if I can buy a 5% or higher bond with that same money?,"I hear so much about people going to extremes to pay off student loan debt and I can't help but wonder what the same amount of effort in bonds would do. Bonds specifically because of the relative safety of them makes them comparable to debts in my mind. If one can bite the bullet and throw an extra 1-2k into loans every month, why not throw it into bonds with higher interest rates and actually have a choice to use the money or re-invest it? I didn't study finance, but in my mind it makes more sense to just pay whatever your fixed rate is and turn your extra income into more income. This way you can use it for big purchases or even throw it into student loans later, knocking off more capital than it would have if you had put it into loans earlier.

personalfinance,Financing trailer to live in. Never financed before. Have some questions.,"I have been staying at a friends with no place to live. I have a acre of land where I can live in a trailer free of rent and bills (just have to help around property). 

I work part-time and go to university full-time. I have 3 semesters before my Bachelor's. I make about 280 a week from my regular job. I can also do a delivery job for emergency money as needed. 

My plan is to finish saving up $5,000 for a trailer. At first I was looking at pretty cheap trailers on craigslist but I really want to get something more reliable and not so cheap as I'll be living in it full-time. Looking at dealerships there are some nice ones at about 15,000 -20,000. 

Am I able to put the $5,000 down and finance the remaining 10,000/15,000 and have a pretty low monthly payment? (possibly around $300?). My credit score is 720. I could also have someone co-sign for me who has a credit score of 830, but I would prefer not to ask.

I've never financed something or bought something for so much money. What's a good interest rate that I should be able to qualify for? Am I able to pay more than my payment early on if I can afford it without any issues? Also just any general advice about buying a trailer is much appreciated. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,"Student Loan - paying small amt to ""stay ahead"" of interest?","So, I was just approved and disbursed a unsubsidized federal student loan for grad school. It's not much, compared to a lot of student loan debt, but it's still something. The interest rate is at 6% and that begins to accrue as soon as the loan is disbursed, not after I graduate.



So here's my question: Since my loan money is not my sole source of income (I have an assistantship that pays a meager salary so about 60% of my income will be coming from that and the remaining 40% will be funded through my loans), would it make sense for me to throw maybe $10 or $20 a month at my student loans while I'm in school so the interest does not start compounding and really add up? Or does paying small amounts on a loan with money that partially comes from that loan make no sense at all? 



I can't seem to come to an answer after thinking about it, so I thought I'd ask here. Thanks for any thoughts!",finance

personalfinance,[Planning] Adopting Three Older Children Post-Windfall,"Intro-

The Wife (30F) and I (33M) are strongly considering adopting thee older children as we look to expand our family. Specifically, we are looking at adopting three girls (Two 11 year old twins and a 10 year old sister with a moderate physical disability). I feel like up to this point in life we have handled our finances pretty well, but beyond the obvious emotional and relationship we are about to embark on I want to make sure I'm leveraging us as well as possible going forward.

Details-

* I am a director-level financial professional with a large manufacturing company. Earn $110k a year in salary, with the potential for 8-10% bonuses each year. I contribute enough to our 401(k) plan to get the full match from our company.
* The wife is a public health professional working for a non-profit. She earns $46k in a year in salary, and contributes to a directed-funds pension plan administered by our state.
* Currently have $170k in $401(k) savings in my name, about $10k in her name.
* Also have a $600k quasi-grant from selling my stake in my employer. Not going to get into specifics, but original ownership was set up to mirror it like a retirement vehicle based on shares from the company dependent on valuation. I can not touch this money at all for 23 more months while it sits in a holding account at Merrill-Lynch. It is 100% my money, this was just part of the agreement I made for disbursement. After the 23 months, I can move 20% of the money each year for the following five years, or I can leave it where it is. If I leave it where it is, I would have to wait at least five years after I leave the company to access the funds, or until I reached 65 years of age- whichever comes first. I can roll the 20% to 401k or similar vehicles each year, or choose to cash it out with a 10% penalty and standard income tax.
* As part of the buyout, I have $100k in retention bonuses to be distributed equally three time markers.
Furthermore, as part of the buyout there is a second grant option for when our new private equity owners sell us. Dependent on the price for which they sell the company in 2.5-4 years (this is flexible), I will be eligible for another $500k to $1M payout at this time. This will be distributed as normal income in the year earned, and not eligible to role to 401(k) beyond my normal election in that year. I'm unclear what else I can role it to at that point. This must be paid even if I am terminated for anything other than sexual harassment, theft, etc.
* Currently owe $190k on our mortgage. $30k in equity in the house. Synthetic loan product without PMI, but fixed rate of 4.275%. Had my down payment for my home stolen and blown by my father shortly before he committed suicide, so didn't have as much in it from the start as we wanted. We've been there 18 months. It is pretty modest, in a metro area, and we likely will be looking to move for the sake of schools districts &amp; avoiding paying for private schooling if the adoption goes through.
* Have a 2015 Toyota Camry Hybrid and a 2015 Toyota Rav4 between the wife and myself. We owe $24k on these combined, with both on 0% interest loans. No desire to pay extra on these since they are at 0%. We think we will be fine with these vehicles even with the three kids, but I could be wrong about that.
$9k in private student loans remaining. 4.125% interest rate.
* Churn for rewards with my credit card, so I use it for about everything and carry anywhere from $100-$2k on it. Month end balance is never more than $300, though. Always paid in full.
* $25k in cash reserves.
* Monthly overhead bills for the house are pretty low. Insurance and utilities combined is about $450 each month. Car insurance is about $200 a month between both vehicles. Have a $1M umbrella policy on the both of us that is wrapped into the insurance cost on the house previously stated.
* My credit score hovers around 820, my wife's around 770.
* $1M life insurance policy on myself, $250k on my wife.
* Pretty low cost of living area. I could substantially upgrade our home for something that is $310k pretty easily in the suburbs, $450k in the most expensive part of the inner metro.

As far as the adoption, I know how the process generally will go but I'm pretty fuzzy on the financials of it. Since we are adopting older children it works out to where we get reimbursed for most things at the time the adoption is finalized is what we have been told, basically. There would likely be a period where we were fostering until all parties felt totally comfortable with it, and that has some sort of benefits but I honestly have not wanted to look into those because I don't want to make adopting children a financial decision when I know we can support them on our own anyway.

Ultimately, I think the big moves with financial impact we are looking at is moving or biting the bullet on private schools. We might build to make sure all of our entryways and other parts of the house are to ADA suggestions. Moving to the suburbs would take us a bit further from my wife's family who is close and can help with kids, but it would only be a 15 minute difference. The schools in the district where we would likely go are very good, especially in comparison with the public school system for our current home.

I don't have a will or anything (dumb, I know), but my wife and I are going to immediately look at any sort of estate planning in the next week or so. Both of us have good insurance on separate plans right now, but would consolidate to one family one down the line. I think that is it for current state. I know there have to be gaps in my plan, and I really would appreciate any assistance from people who have been something similar. I feel like we live pretty modestly, and I just want to set my current and future family up the best I can. We've been very blessed in many areas of life, and I feel like I just need to update my financial infrastructure to reflect that. I will try to answer any questions as they come through. Thanks for any advice!

personalfinance,Cash out stocks for a better mortgage rate,"Throwaway account. 

I had an offer accepted on a house in a high cost of living area. The amount was for $580,000. A 20% down payment would be 116k. That would leave the remaining 464k for financing. That amount makes the loan ""high balance"" which results in an interest rate of 3.99% for a 30 year term .

On the other hand I have 40k available in stocks (and then some, I won't be dry after this) right now. I could cash them out and have the loan balance be 424k. This would result in an interest rate of 3.75% for a 30 year loan. Additionally we could do a 20 year and have the rate come down to 3.625%.

So the question is what makes the most sense? If I pull the money out, I lose some potential for growth (let's say about 7% per year on average), but I get a lower rate which will let me reinvest they money over time. My hunch says get the lower rate and the numbers on a first pass seem to agree. Beyond that will the 20 year make sense? It's not a big drop in the rate. All of these interest rates came from a lender I have been working with (using yesterday's rates). 

One last note, let's assume that the mortgage (plus taxes and insurance) will be affordable for all three possible loans (but not a 15 year).

Thanks in advance! 

Edit 1: looks like my hunch was wrong. I appreciate everyone's help here. I'll keep watching and responding for now. 

Edit 2: Maybe my hunch was okay. I did some math and it could just be that I suck at math. So what I care about is the final value (of investments and money spent on a mortgage) after 30 years. So let's start with the largest monthly payment available to me. That would be about 2486/month. I won't have any of that first 40k to see grow, but after the first 20 years is up I will have $2486/month to invest. I choose to invest it all for 10 years (not a whole lot of time for growth) and the investments grow an extra $84155 over those 10 years. I spent $596461 on the mortgage and can subtract the invested earnings to get $512306 spent.

Plan 2 is I burn the 40k but have a 30 year mortgage. I have $522/month to spare though for 30 years. That money will grow $232865. I will have spent 706900 on the mortgage so the same calculation as above gets me $474035 spent.

Plan 3 is I hold the 40k and let it grow. I will have a spare $273/month. That money will grow a huge $251482 (not counting the principal I put in). BUT my total mortgage will be $796512. The same subtraction I have been using will result in $545030 (more than the other two options).

Am I double counting something here somehow? It seems to make sense to dump the money now in favor of having more per month to invest and a lower interest rate. I think a different return on investment would flip my conclusion on its head...",finance
personalfinance,"Girlfriends student loans are way more than she can afford right now, trying to help, not sure where to start.","Hi friends, I've been browsing this sub for awhile and figured some of you here may be able to help.  As the title states, my girlfriend has a decent amount of student loan debt.  About $22,000 in Federal Loans, and about $15,000 more from Sallie Mae, which is spread out over 5 different loans.  She works for a non profit as a group home manager for women with mental disorders, and only makes about $900 every 2 weeks after taxes and paying into her HSA and such.  That field is grossly underpaid.  I was very fortunate to never have any student loans, so I'm unfamiliar with how to deal with these.

Sallie Mae is collecting $419/month for the 5 separate loans and currently accruing about $125 in interest every month.  Her FedLoan payment was sitting around $102/month but has suddenly jumped up to $400/month, which isn't possible for her to do right now on top of Sallie Mae.  It has been about a year since these loans entered repayment, so I'm wondering if maybe that has something to do with the sudden increase.

She has been working for non profit companies for about 3 years now since graduating, and that combined with the student loan debt is really wearing on her.  Her bank account has stayed at about the same point for the last 3 years and it makes her feel like she has absolutely nothing to show for herself, she is starting to have very serious anxiety over the whole situation, waking up early every morning or throughout the night and sometimes breaking down to me or at work.

personalfinance,"Early 30s, no idea where to start with investing our savings, need help!","Hi all. First time posting. The main reason I'm asking for help is I have no idea how to manage the money we've now saved and feel like it's being wasted by sitting in a savings account making no interest. I'm overwhelmed trying to figure out investing/money management.

A little about us: My husband and I are in our early 30s, currently have around 110k in a savings account. Bought our cars outright. Will probably have the house paid off in 4-5 years and have a very low interest rate (I believe 0.5%). No debt for either of us other than the house. Together we bring home a net of around 120k after taxes/health ins. Our total in retirement accounts is about 55k. 

We're looking to make some substantial life changes in the next 12-18 mo (buy an RV, rent out the house, do travel work assignments which may decrease our annual income a bit but has been a dream of ours for a while), so we want a bit of a savings cushion. That being said I think we still have plenty to invest and hopefully even more so in the future.

I'm clueless about index funds, bonds, stock market, etc. CDs seem to get almost no interest these days. 

I don't know where to go from here or how we can maximize our savings. Any thoughts are appreciated!",finance

We eat out quite a bit because we work late and are lazy when we get home.
Don't actually go through much gas because we live close to our jobs. 
We both have paid off cars 98 Jeep Cherokee 180,000miles and a 98 Buick century 60,000 miles.
Both get us to work every day but need a lot of attention. We try to do the things ourselves as we have the money. But I am in some serious need of some breaks right now.

We have one dog. But we are also fostering another dog right now. The only we are paying for is food because we feel bad feeding it the crappy food the animal shelter gave us. We desperately want another dog so ours has a friend (realllly bad anxiety) but we know we can't afford it. We have pet insurance because our little guy goes to the vet about once every month or two. It has saved us probably thousands.

We are both servers so our incomes vary quite a bit. I would have to estimate we are making about $3,500 a month between the two of us. Working 5 days a week. Sometimes a couple doubles. 

3 years ago boyfriend was a private contractor for a taxi service and we didn't understand how he taxes worked. Ended up owing a lot of money and I'm not entirely sure why we haven't filed since. I think it's a combination of being scared and lazy. 

Can't get out of gym membership until December. Can't get out of DirecTV until September and we owe a total of $300 to pay off phones with tmobile, then we could get out.

We stopped paying the credit cards years ago. Probably 3-4 years now. We had considered going bankrupt a while back. Even got a lawyer. But then, just never went through with it.  I've now settled with 3 of the 7 credit card companies I owe. Boyfriend still has 6 credit cards that he owes money. One of boyfriends companies has served him papers to go to court, but we did not go. 

We really have just been slackasses for years now and I want it to be different. I am 26. Boyfriend 30.

Upon reviewing funds I noticed extremely high ER's. Let me give you some examples:

There is an option for the American Century Heritage Fund Investor Class  (TWHIX)
With an ER of 2.00%.
Reviewing on morningstar, it appears this fund is listed with an ER of 1.00%.

The lowest ER fund offered is an SP 500 indes fund(JHVIT). Ok, lets check that one out...
This has an ER of 1.38%.

What, wut? Let's pretend I wanted to be in an SP500 index fund at Fidelity.
FUSEX, $2,500 minimum deposit........ER: 0.09%
FUSVX, $10,000 minimum deposit......ER: 0.035%

This is f*cking nuts.

Alright, so the company matches 4%. So I just enrolled for 4% and chose the lowest ER fund, the 500 index fund at 1.38%. So what do I do next? I know the conscription here is to take employer match, max IRA/ROTH, max 401k, THEN taxable accounts. At what threshold of undesirable investment options do I NOT max 401k and go straight to a taxable account. I have not run numbers, but I have to imagine post tax dollars stuffed into FUSVX @ 0.035% would beat pre tax dollars in something at 1.38%. Let alone other investment options that a taxable account affords one.

So what do I need to be taking into consideration here? Tax burden reduction factoring into ER? Post tax dollars being ~80% of pre-tax dollars and that beating ER? What else?

personalfinance,"Read the wiki: 50k inheritance, where to deposit/ is my plan ok?","Hey everyone, I (26) am receiving a 50k inheritance from a grandparent who lived in PA. I've always lived frugally but have never had any saving or extra money to invest in anything (I have a 1k cushion in my checking) so I have no idea where to begin. I talked to my uncle who is handling the estate and he just told me to go to a financial advisor, soooo I came here instead. I know that much at least. 

I've read the windfall wiki, and browsed a few related posts, but I haven't really seen a solid answer on where to first deposit the money before I sort out what to do with it. 

I already have the check, but I just don't where to specifically deposit it. I know that sounds silly, but for some reason I just don't feel positive about just sticking it directly into my bank. Is that crazy? I don't know if I should open a new account in a specific bank or fund or somewhere else like Simple? 

I also read that VA and the federal government doesn't collect inheritance tax, but PA has a 4.5% tax. Should I still set a little money aside for taxes above the 4.5% just in case? 

I've been burned by taxes before (still paying off what was 10k due to being 24 and not understanding that independent contractors need to save income for taxes) I plan on using some of this incoming money to pay off that IRS debt right away ~3k. 

**Plan:**

* Just under 3k repayment of IRS tax debt

* 3k credit card debt

* Maybe 3k for lasik because I'm nearly blind and it would over time save me thousands because my contacts are are $600 every 6 months. 

Question: I have 7 student loans, totaling just over 21k: 3 loans at 6.8% that total $10,503, two loans at 4.5% that total $4,228, one at 5.6% for $2,715 and one at $3.4% that is barely over 4K. 

I know this sub is all about cutting down debts right away but should I pay all of this off at once or just the three 6.8% and 5.4% loans and keep paying my usual $300/month to pay the remaining ones off faster (2 years ish)? This would leave me with several more thousand I could invest or put aside a little to treat myself to something small like clothes (my wardrobe is all about 5 years old) and/or a little vacation since I never buy myself anything.

If I pay everything off, Including the 4.5% for taxes, I'm left with just under 20k to invest. I'm still trying to figure out that plan, so any advice would be helpful. This got a lot longer than I meant so maybe I'll come back later for investing help, as I'm open to some high risk into cryptocurrency but also more reliable forms of investing like Vanguard.

personalfinance,Student loans - To refi or not to refi?,"So, I have about 26k remaining on my student loans. I graduated with my Bachelors in 2007. Went back to school and finished with an IS certificate in 2012. Got pregnant a week after finals and chose to refinance loans to get a super low payment for maternity leave. My payoff dates range from 2020 to 2023. Currently, my loans are being serviced by Navient. 

Basically, it is 10 different loans, each with a different interest rate (3 - 6.8%).I'm wondering if it makes sense to refinance them into one loan with a (hopefully) lower interest rate or if those companies are just a scam. 

Made some really dumb finance decisions (cc debt, etc.) between earning my bachelor's degree and going back to school. Trashed my credit score, the works (Yay recession!) 

Since then, we have paid off most of our debt. The only debt we have is one vehicle, our mortgage, and my student loans. I really want to be able to pay down my student loans faster to save on both interest and to free up monthly income for house renovations (new windows, kitchen, etc) without going into more debt. 

Currently, our joint income is about 100k. So we are in a good position to pay down more than the monthly payment. However, Navient is shady af regarding repayment and I'm not getting clear answers as to what my extra payments have been going towards. I added an extra $100 to a specific loan for last month's payment to be applied to that specific loans balance. Not only did that specific loan's balance not go down, it actually went up by $2.00. 

I'm wishing I had printouts for more than just the last two months but it looks like they are doing it again for this month's overpayment. So I'm definitely keeping track. 

What are my options? Should I refinance? This is really frustrating, thank you in advance for any help or advice!",finance
personalfinance,Credit Card Collections and Graduate Student Loans,"Last year I defaulted on my college credit card and now owe $1500 to a collections agency, with the maximum credit on that card as $1200. I am currently starting pharmacy school, and have student loans to cover tuition and living expenses. After subtracting for all living expenses and school costs, I will have approx. $1200 left over for food, paying off debt, etc. 

I need to apply for one additional loan, however, due to this delinquency, my credit score is garbage and I cannot get approved for any loans. As soon as my federal loans arrive, I will pay $500 off on the card. Next semester I will pay an additional $500. I know using student loans to help pay off credit card debt is not the best move, but it is my only option right now until I graduate and begin working as a pharmacist.

My question is, do I have to pay off the entire debt before I can get approved for loans? Or can I schedule a payment plan and become approved for loans after that? Or am I looking at this entirely wrong? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I just want to rid myself of this debt as fast as possible.",finance
personalfinance,Which should I pay off first? Consolidate or rehabilitate loans?,"My student loans are currently in default and with a collections agency.

Now I have 2 options: either rehabilitate or consolidate my loans. Rehabilitation - if I made 9 on time payments it would bring it out of collections and remove the history from my credit report which would make it jump in points. Or consolidate them all into one loan? I'm thinking of rehabilitating it because it would delete it from my history and I would see an increase in my credit.

But which should I pay off first? Also, since it's in collections am I able to negotiate to pay less of it instead of all of it? Since this is loans from the US Dept. of Education I don't know if that works - negotiating to pay lesser amount?

personalfinance,Question about variable interest rates on credit cards,"I've had the same credit card for nearly 20 years. It's been with Bank of America for the majority of that time (they purchased MBNA). So, from 1998(ish) until December 2015, I had the same interest rate. Since December 2015, the rate has increased about 0.25% every 9 months. For context, my rate was 9.99% and now it's up to 10.99%. 

About me: I have good credit, I don't have any late payments, I have been carrying a balance, which has been ongoing since 2014 (I was lazy and not focused, and I'm working on it now).

Is this normal? I understand that rates are variable. I'm only noticing my rates are up because I'm looking at my statements. They aren't notifying me of the changes. Is it something like: banks used to make money elsewhere, and as fees are cracked down in many places, they are now relying more on credit? 

Also, even with the increase, my APR is lower than what I see offered from other cards, are they just trying to bring some lower rates up to market value?",finance

personalfinance,Should I open a Roth IRA or keeping investing in low ER Vanguard 401k funds?,"32 (M) wants to kick his retirement up a notch.

&amp;nbsp;

Currently have 200k mortgage (recently purchased home w/ 20% down), 15k car loan (very low interest rate, like ~1%) and no other debt.

&amp;nbsp;

Currently have Safe Harbor 401k w/ Vanguard (100% match up to 3%, 50% match from 3% to 5%, 4% total match potential) that I invest 6% (so 10% total with the matching).

&amp;nbsp;

Only have about 60k in there now, looking at going from 6% deferred to 11% to make it an even 15% w/ matching, or stick 5% in a Roth IRA.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a fully funded 6-month emergency fund, and recently setup a couple of accounts that I will be transferring a small bit to each every month for home repairs and vehicle maintenance savings.

&amp;nbsp;

Once I get homesteaded and all the initial costs level out (new small furniture items, new fence, etc.), I should be about $1k +/-300 in the black every month, and looking for constructive places to put it.

&amp;nbsp;

Since my 401k is already setup with well performing low ER Vanguard funds, would this be the easier/better option, or would it be me advantageous to open a Roth IRA and put that 5% in there with the lower return but more flexibility?

personalfinance,Cash out assets or take a Graduate Loans?,"I'm currently in my second year of a 4-year dental program. I'm considering taking on both Unsubsidized Stafford loans (6% interest) to the max of $20,250 per semester and then a few thousand in Graduate Plus loans at 7% interest in order to pay tuition and living expenses. 

I also have a few thousand saved in a mutual fund that has been growing at ~13% on average for the past few years, some stock that was a gift from my grandparents at my birth that has grown to a few thousand, and a few EE series bonds that are at awful interest rates but haven't doubled yet.

I am wondering whether it would be more advantageous to cash out my assets in order to reduce the dollar figure of the loans that I am taking out, sit on some while selling off others, or to sit on all of them. 

Personally I am leaning towards selling the individual stocks while maintaining the mutual fund and bonds, but my dad feels it would be in my best interest to do the opposite and cash in the mutual fund and keep the stock as a safety net.

personalfinance,"Considering a debt consolidation option, would like some input.","Hey so I've been lurking on here for a while and just made an account to ask this.  Basically, I have some credit card debt and think I may have been offered a decent consolidation plan by Lending Club.  My current situation is as follows:

Chase Card - 3827.95 balance - 18.99% APR
Discover Card - 2421.24 balance - 23.99% APR
PNC Card - 3345.08 balance - 12.99% APR
Citi Card - 2106.72 balance - 26.24% APR

The total of my current minimum payments is about 313 dollars. Lending Club quoted me a 12,000 dollar, 14.08% interest, 3 year loan with a 410.66 monthly payment.  The average interest rate of the cards is 20.55%, so right away I know the interest rate is better.  
I made a budget on excel, and tracked all of my spending after the month of July and basically realized I was spending wayyy too much on things like going out, eating out, etc.  I could save a good bit by making some reasonable cutbacks, and I earn a decent salary, but with my car payments, student loans, etc I should really be more closely watching my spending.  I know the best way to go from browsing this subreddit is usually to pay the minimums on all but the highest interest rate card, and pay that off as quickly as possible, but I really think the lower interest rate could save me some money, and more than that having just 1 monthly payment would help me psychologically.  I could stand to even pay off the loan faster depending on how I budget, some expected salary increases, tax refunds, yearly bonus, etc.  I know the risk is that I would just use the cards again, but I racked up most of this debt in college and from some medical bills, but I have been pretty successful with not using one of the cards by just hiding it in my room and not taking it with me anywhere.  

I just wanted to get some opinions on this before I commit to anything however, so please let me know if you think this sounds like a good opportunity, and let me know if you need any other info as well.  I really appreciate any help/insight you have.  Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Just a little help with Credit Cards and understanding how approval works.,"I had two credit cards that I got both at the same time from Bank of America. One was a secured card (my first) and the other was not. The secured became unsecured after 1 year (I think) with a $39 annual fee. I utilized them to the best of my ability (8-10%) and after 2 years and 4 months I just asked them to please remove the $39 annual fee from the first card. They refused and said they could not do it. I have 100% on time payment and never have been charged interest as I pay my balance off every month.

I got a little fed up with them, after being a loyal BoA customer for over 10 years with them and sitting at a 746 TransUnion and a 764 Equifax, according to CreditKarma. I canceled that card and went into the BoA branch and sat with an employee and applied for another cash rewards card with no annual fee, who said there's no way I'd be denied, and just now got denied. 

I have zero debt and these were my only two lines of credit. I make around ~35k a year.

Did I overreact and screw up by cancelling the card on a whim, what should I do in the future?",finance

personalfinance,great lakes student loan question?,"hey guys, graduated last may and had around 46k+ student loan down to only 45k+ loan as of now and with my IBR plan ending soon, I'd like to ask few questions.

1. I applied for IBR 1 year ago (need to renew by october) with no income while having trouble finding job and my monthly required amount was $0 and was required to pay $5 for first month so I paid that. After a month or so, I started working part time making small money and have been paying off $172, which happened to be similar monthly payment required by extended graduate plan ($170). So how will the monthly payment change if I change to extended graduate plan? Although I'm looking for full time, as of right now, $172 monthly payment is just right amount for me as I'm paying for other stuff outside.

2. Should I stay in IBR? What's the negative aspect? Like I heard interest gets capitalized by leaving IBR? But since I've been paying off with $172 which end up being applied to interest and principal, the interests won't capitalize for me right?

3. So I set the extra payment option to standard allocation which says online ""Once scheduled monthly payment and all outstanding interest has been paid, excess will be applied to the loan with the highest interest rate, thus costing you less interest over time. "" For some reason, the extra payment was distributed starting with highest interest+ highest principal balance and to the next two with same interest rate but lower balance and so on. Why are they being distributed even though it said that it goes to the one with highest interest? Wouldn't it be better to allocate 100% of the extra to 1 specific loan with highest balance and interest and make it go to principal instead of interest? How would I do this?

4. Other than extra payment, when paying off the minimum monthly payment, is it possible to have the minimum payment go only to the one loan with highest interest rate?

personalfinance,22 - Need some financial advice in terms of real estate investing (CAN),"Hi guys,

(TL;DR: Want to pay down 10% per year on a mortgage which has an interest rate of 2.69%, is this a good idea?)

I currently live in Canada, I have owned my rental property for two, coming onto three years, and am very interested in continuing to invest in Real Estate.

I currently owe $165k on my mortgage at 2.69% 5 years closed (closed until 2020) every year I am allowed to put 10% of the current mortgage down, and have it go straight to the principle.

I am currently renting the home for $1400, and am in a position to put down $16.5k. I've been told this is not a smart idea as I could invest the money elsewhere, as throwing the money in now only guarantees me a 2.69% return on my investment.

I do plan on continuing to invest in real estate so the sooner I pay this house off (hopefully by 2020) the sooner I can get another. I also see a home as a personal bank account, I can always take a HELOC if I ever run into a sticky situation which comes with a much less interest rate in comparison to a line of credit/ credit cards.

personalfinance,"Received a call that I was going to be served ""legal documents"" about some bad debt. Is this some sort of scam or bad collection tactic?","Some backstory - I made the mistake of borrowing $800 from a predatory payday loan company with tremendous interest rates almost a year ago, fell behind on my payments, and ultimately stopped paying. This was through one of those stupid Native American companies who claims to be above the law when it comes to lending practices, since they are ""a sovereign nation"".

The company, SpotLoan, required me to sign ACH agreements that they would automatically pull money out of my account every 2 weeks. When I ran out of money, they kept running it and running it, and I racked up a bunch of overdraft fees and NSF fees. Ultimately, I closed my checking account, and have been trying to do without for a while.

I'm taking steps to correct my financial mistakes, get back to work, not bury my head in the sand any more, and generally be smarter about stuff. This is besides the point, however.

I received a call the other day from an undisclosed number - someone by the name of ""John Edgar"", who said he ""received a request in his office to place me on his schedule and serve me legal documents"" for today, August 9th. He did not say what company he worked for, where he was calling from, what it was in regards to, or anything. He just gave me a phone number and case number for his ""client"" to call before I got served if I wanted information.

I called the number, and spoke to a man, who claimed to be a collection officer, and said I had an outstanding balance of $1500, and hadn't made payments since December on it. He was very rude the whole time, and asked questions like ""What happened?"" or ""what, did you just forget about it or something?"" and told me they would be filing suit against me. He said a judge would probably end up issuing a judgement against me and garnishing my wages. I just said, ""Ok, I guess I'll see you in court,"" and hung up before he could respond. Again, he didn't tell me the name of his company or who he worked for.

I can't possibly imagine a business trying to sue someone over $1500 - it wouldn't even be worth it to do that. They would spend more on legal and filing fees. I also can't imagine someone giving a person notice who they are planning on serving. This man who said he was going to serve me, or course, never showed up.

I googled the number I had been given, and it didn't come back as belonging to any business at all.

I currently have $10,000 CAD exactly in student line of credit debt. This debt has a 3.95% interest rate and I'm not obligated to pay the principal until 24 months from now (although I'm planning on paying it back as soon as I can).

I also have a $9,000 car loan with 0% interest, so I'm assuming that paying this back monthly as I am is completely fine.

personalfinance,Some advice and guidance would be much appreciated. Dug myself in quite the hole...,"So to make things short and sweet I dug myself into quite a hole and am in 38k in debt with credit cards through the past 2 years... My wife lost her job and her mom who lives in Korea got sick and she had to fly over there to tend to her for 5 months while I was working a $14.00 hr job trying to pay for rent/car payments and bills. Before all that happened, we were doing pretty well with our payments and were only 2k in debt.

When she came back she was unable to find work and trying to keep up with bills and groceries we just relied on the card. What made it even worse was we returned to the lifestlye we were living in terms of going out on dates and buying things... I now better understand how irresponsible and negligent that was. I tried to get my wife to work, but from being so stressed out from her last job she said she wanted a break and didn't want to work. I failed at changing our spending habits and trying to find the right way to convince my wife to find work. Every time I brought it up our conversations would blow up into big arguments, largely on part of my temper.

Eventually we got to this point. Our financial rock bottom - a little under 38k in debt, spread over 5 cards. 

Were are now reaching the maximum limit on all our cards...

Card interest alone on all those cards are $500 and we are slowly drowning. I was wondering if I some of you wouldn't mind departing some of your wisdom on what we should do next and how to dig ourselves out.

We have talked and finally agreed on our better controlling our spending habits and how we need to reduce them. Furthermore, she is now seeing that it is necessary for her to work for us to get out of this together, at least right now(She wants to be a house wife, and I would prefer for her to do that in the future as well. Lastly, we need your help...

I made a small excel spread sheet with our bills vs living expenses+credit card debt (payments and interests) and basically we are living $1450 over what we currently earn, and that is excluding date night(We are probably going to have to kill that aspects of our lives for now...). We most likely are spending less than that, but I based all our earnings very conservatively, and overestimated our spending, in terms of just groceries. We won't be buying anything for a long time unless is necessary....

What should be our next step? I am going to try and call our credit card companies tomorrow and see if I can reduce the interest rate and see if they can work with us somehow. Beyond that I’m lost.

My wife was wondering if we could take out a big bank loan and just pay all the cards, that way we aren’t spending $500 alone on just interest rates, and just paying the interest on that loan. We’d slice up most of our cards after that…
I was wondering do those national debt relief things really help? Or should I just go bust and declare bankruptcy…. Which I really do not want to do. I’ma big believer in suffering the consequences of ones actions, no matter how difficult it may be. 

Any advice would be appreciates.

I've made a ton of mistakes. I wouldn't say I owe a ton of money, but it's rising probably just south of 40,000. I know I'll need to file bankruptcy. I recently had a car taken and had to get another. I couldn't get it on my own. I had to get a parent as the main signer and I'm the cosigner. 

My girlfriend and I had a baby in January. Things went south and I was kicked out 2 months later.  Previous to all this, I worked hard to rebuild credit and pay off debt, I went from a 540 credit score to 620 in a year. It's all wasted now. I also haven't filed taxes in 3 years and know that I owe the irs atleast 10000 or more. I've been so stressed and afraid but I know I need to get that filed with a cpa and work out a payment arrangement. 

Here's the deal. I make roughly 3100 to 4200 a month, depends on my monthly bonus which some months is 0 and others are 1250. The girlfriend and I are working on the relationship, we are working on things, but it's not in a great place, but we haven't gone to court, that's the nuclear option if we can't get things f iguered out. So I don't have court ordered child support.

My rent is 1100
I pay my girlfriend 1000 plus per month, this is higher than court ordered support would be, but I love her and my son and this enables her to be a stahm. I want her/us raising him not some stranger that would probably cost more anyway.

Cable and internet-130 (I need to cancel the cable and stick to internet only)

I've been horribly depressed, put on weight, eat out to much. In anticipation of filing bankruptcy, I've stopped paying all bills except for what's noted above. I know I need to file all prior taxes before I can file. I also have student loans at 10k, I know those can't be taken out in bankruptcy.

When I get a full bonus, things are okay, but when I don't. I struggle hard. I can't default on my cell phone stuff because I work for my cell phone provider and don't want to lose my job. My rent is super high, but it's the lowest I could find in my location. I've been driving for timeshare companies lately, but now my windshield is cracked, I have a nail in my tire and I need an oil change. Non which I can afford right now. I've sold most of my possessions.  I'm lost and don't know what to do. Thanks for any advice.",finance
personalfinance,"Have 2 credit cards debt, how should I go about paying them?","So I'm from Canada if that is important. My student loans dont give me enough to pay for my school and I get no money from my family. So I have to use my credit card to pay for my last 2 years of university out of my pocket. I worked at a part time during that time so the cost wasn't too much but it still added to my bill.. Now I have graduated but I have plans to go back to school as the government is giving better grants to low-income families now. But I want to get rid of my debt before I do any more of school as it exhausted me completely. 

I currently get paid around 700 per pay check (1400/month). I have other bills that equal to 500/month and I pay my student loan $50 (2.5K left). But I have 2 credit cards (Visa &amp; Mastercard), the visa I owe 1500 and the MasterCard I owe 5000. They both have the same interest rate, so which one would be better to pay off? Or should i pay my student loans off first? No matter What I plan to pay minimum for all. But if I had the opportunity which would be better to get rid of soon?

personalfinance,Need some advice on which one of my student loans to throw some money at,"Hey all. To most of you this is probably an idiotic question, but I'm finally trying to get my loans in order and need some help. I've been saving for a bit and will soon have $4-5000 to throw at my student loans (at $51,000). I always figured I would put it towards my highest interest loans first, since that makes the most sense to me, but discovered something while looking at past payments. One group of loans, with the lower interest rate at 3.8%, it seems I have ONLY been paying towards interest, nothing on principle (once again, I'm just now getting to a place to fully look at this stuff). My other group of loans, with the 6.8% interest, I have been paying towards the principle. So now I'm not sure whether I should put this extra money towards the lowest interest loan and get some principle knocked off, or if it is still a better bet to put it towards the higher one. Sorry for the long post. Any advice is appreciated.",finance
datascience,My search for examples of governments using data and data science to improve the lives of citizens,"Apologetic header: This being my first reddit post, I hope you will forgive any inadequacies. I have read the readmes and think that this is a valid question and the right place, but am happy to be corrected :-)

I include a brief description, with questions at the end:

A colleague is looking at the ways in which data science is being used to best effect (or not) within the UK government. Some brief googling and examination of journals and blogs has shown that there does not seem to be any systematic list or analysis of the public sector's use of data and data science - I think there should be.

My initial search through blogs turned up the fabulous example of the [rogue train on the circle line in Singapore](https://blog.data.gov.sg/how-we-caught-the-circle-line-rogue-train-with-data-79405c86ab6a ""Singapore Train""), but I feel the slapdash approach lacks discipline and will lead to missing out.

Using a helpful Python library called BeautifulSoup, containing the IANA list of top level domain names, I wrote a [script](https://github.com/ababyyou/webscrapers/blob/master/int_use_of_data_first_pass) to find all countries who have a data.gov.**xx** website. The queries timeout quickly to start with, and some more may appear of I do a second pass with a longer timeout.

So now I have a list of countries with an obvious open data website name. But there are many more, such as France, who use non-standard(to my mind) naming, and many are not in a language I can speak fluently. Also - providing open or machine-readable data does not mean that they are doing anything with it themselves.

I have found a great list on github of all the repositories that are tagged as [""government""](https://github.com/github/government.github.com/blob/gh-pages/_data/governments.yml ""Github government list""), which is quite cool - and also alerted me to the fact that many federated countries have separate data portals for each state. Even more have individual city portals, so I need to look at a lot more than national level for my examples.

Still, my search goes on, and I will be more than happy to share the results, or indeed the cool things I have found that others might wish to use. My questions for the community are:

1) Could I be doing this more intelligently? It seems that other than running different levels of scraper, the analysis will be pretty manual and labour intensive. Perhaps I'm missing a trick that you could share with me for comparing similar but non-standard examples?

2) Is anyone else out there doing this? And do you think its a useful topic to explore?

3) Would you like to be involved? Or do you have any examples from your country that I might miss that you think I should be aware of?

Many thanks :-D",technology

personalfinance,"Was this poor customer service (and worth switching banks over), or am I just being petty?","Due to moving around the country a lot, I have a credit card with Bank A and do my checking/savings with Bank B. 

On the morning of July 6th I tried to use my credit card and was declined. I immediately checked my account (I had been lax the past few days with checking it since I knew I was only around 10% usage) and found several strange, out of state charges. 

I called customer service and they confirmed that they'd placed a hold on my account because of the suspicious charges. All in all it was only $150 or so, but since they hadn't all cleared yet, I was told to wait until the next day to file a dispute. 

Since there is a branch within walking distance of me, on the next day (July 7th) I went in person to file a credit dispute and get things cleared up. The banker I spoke with was helpful and assured me that I would have a new credit card within 7-10 business days, which would have been July 18-21. She was very clear that it was 7-10 business days of my filing the dispute, not an amorphous 7-10 days of whenever someone in the corporate office got around to it.

I still don't have my credit card, and I'm getting pretty irritable about it. The first time I called I was told that the dispute paperwork was not actually filed until July 21st, and that I would ""definitely"" receive it within 7-10 business days of the 21st (August 1-4). 

On August 4th, near close of business, I called again, as it clearly would not be coming in the mail that day. I was assured that my card would be shipped express by FedEx and would arrive by Tuesday, August 8th. 

It is now August 10th, and I still do not have my credit card. I had been planning to buy plane tickets and reserve hotel rooms for my best friend's wedding, and while I of course was able to achieve those things by using my main account and having my boyfriend reserve the rooms on his card, I'm bothered by how much financial re-jiggering I had to do.

I don't know much about how banks work, though, so I wanted to ask if this sounds like SOP and I'm just being petty. I have had my cards compromised twice before, with Bank B, and I always got a new card within a few days, not within several weeks of whenever someone bothered to do the paperwork. 

Should I just chalk this up to an unfortunate situation, or is it worth getting a credit card with a different bank? I know that closing credit accounts can be bad for your credit score so I'm not sure if this is an overreaction.

Quick background on me. 26yo male student in Utah. Currently have a summer internship where I'm making more money than I ever have. I try to work when I can and live off savings during school so I can focus more on education.

This year I had a short internship from Feb to May. I made $12/h (20h/week) and I believed I claimed 1 or 2 exemptions. For my current internship that started mid-may and ends on 8/18, I've been increasing my exemptions each pay period in order to try to keep more money in my pocket to live off of for the next few months. I'm making $22/h here full-time for 15 weeks.

To be honest I started changing my exemptions without a real understanding of how it works, and if there's anything wrong with doing it. As a student who will not be working for the majority of the months this year, I expect my tax liability to be small come next year. That's the reasoning behind changing exemptions. As of 7/31 I've paid $707 in Federal taxes and $378 in state. At my current calculation I'll only make about $17000 this year between the two internships, and if I were to have 1 exemption all summer I believe I would have withheld far more than I would truly be liable for. I have enough money to where if I owe anything next year I'll be able to pay it, I'm just generally curious if I've done anything ""wrong"".

personalfinance,A love story that got me in debt. I need to figure out a way to pay this back or I will be kicked out of the country. A couple of options are on the table.,"Hey, reddit! This is my first post here. I've always browsed multiple subreddits but never participated in any discussion. I figured this would be a good opportunity to create an account and get started. Thanks in advance for any help.

I'll try to make a long story short.
Back in 2011, I came to the US as an exchange student. I am a citizen of Brazil. Not long after starting my academic year, I fell in love with an American citizen. We were two young men living the best year of our lives together. When it was time for me to return home, we decided not to split up and figure out a way for me to eventually return. After a long period of 14 months apart, I finally got my bachelor's degree in Brazil, applied to grad school in the US and was luckily accepted, however with no direct funding from the university. My only option was to apply for a scholarship provided by the Ministry of Education of Brazil, which eventually worked out.

Upon starting my graduate program in the US, I actively attempted to secure funds from my own university so I could, at some point, cancel the sponsorship I had from the Brazilian government. I was not very successful during the first year, but eventually ended up getting decent teaching/research assistantships that covered most of my living costs here. While having this sort of dual-income during academic semesters, I deposited in a savings account most of the money provided by the Brazilian scholarship.

At some point last year, my research group secured enough funds to sponsor me until the end of my program and graduation (exp. Spring 2018). Then, I decided to cancel the Brazilian scholarship and start the negotiation process to waive the home residency requirement that is part of my J-1 visa and an agreement that I signed with them. Yeah, I always knew that. The reasons I chose to submit myself to these requirements are topics for another discussion. After a long and bureaucratic process, the agency has finally sent me their terms and conditions to issue me a statement of no objection, which is absolutely necessary to waive the home residency requirement I'm subject to. They are requiring me to pay back every penny they invested in me or I will not be allowed to remain in the US. Honestly, I find that to be fair.

Therefore, I now find myself with a US$ 65,000 debt that added up over the years. All of the money that I have, right now, in a couple of savings accounts, add up to about US$ 32,000, or just under half of what I owe. There are a few options that I have identified:

(1) Finance the entire debt through the scholarship agency. They allow a pay-back term of up to 60 months and every monthly payment is corrected to the consumer price index. From what I understand, the only ""interest rate"" here is the inflation, which is variable and goes from 5 to 10% every year (with exceptions -- it depends on how the economy is doing).
(2) Give them a down payment with part of my savings and finance the balance through the scholarship agency. This is similar to the above and would result in lower payments over the years, or less payments of similar value.
(3) Get a loan from an American financial institution and pay back the Brazilian scholarship agency all at once, then worry about paying back the debts that I have now in the US. Not sure about this one -- I have no idea if I qualify to loans of large amounts here, and the interest rates seem not to be competitive with the Brazilian consumer prince index. Also, I would be near zeroing all of my savings.

In (1) and (2), they would issue the statement of no objection after the first monthly payment.
I would not like to return to Brazil with an advanced degree because the market is not favorable right now, the economy is bad, my fiance (yes, we are now engaged) does not master the language and his profession is not valued there. Unfortunately, Brazil is not an option for us as a couple. If we want to stay together, I have to pay back all that money. And yeah, this is what we want, and what I have decided to do.

However, I am unable to determined the best option. I regret not educating myself financially a little better. I want to make the best deal for myself and my fiance. So I ask reddit, what would you do?

I will be happy to provide any further information that may be of value to this discussion.
Thank you!",finance

CryptoCurrency,My 2 weeks long adventure as a crypto trader,"So, I've been following Bitcoin ever since it started out. Having originally bought 10 of them for € 0.20 each, and having sold them for € 80,- each afterwards was my first actual experience trading with them. Pretty good deal, to have earned about € 800 with an investment of € 2, and of course I watched Bitcoin grow over the years, even reaching € 3000 this week. Felt sour at times, bit still, I shouldn't be complaining since I originally made good profit.

For years I occasionally read about cryptocurrencies and got nose about other currencies that were entering the market. Never doing anything with it as I'm usually not much of a gambler in the first place, in spite of being intrigued by them. The crypto market is still very volatile as well. Way too risky.

Until 2 weeks ago, when I got nose of the bitcoin hard-fork. I figured it was *the* moment to step in again! I was certain that everybody was going to dump their alts for bitcoins in order to get that 'free' bitcoin cash. The charts didn't lie either, over the weeks all cryptos had been dropping so their prices were low. I stumbled upon the Litebit.eu exchange where I could buy various cryptos quickly with Euros. 

&gt; **My original investment**

Litebit lists about 50 coins on their website. Of which the majority altcoins that cost even less than a cent each. With their minimum purchasing threshold of € 15,-. I figured I'd spend that amount on those cheap coins (*shitcoins*), and/or round the amount up to a nice number, this is what I bought:

* ArtByte x 4000
* BitSend x 100
* Blackcoin x 75
* Breakout x 200
* Breakout-Stake x 80
* ClubCoin x 50
* Crown x 25
* DigiByte x 1000
* Dogecoin x 16000
* EmerCoin x 20
* Feathercoin x 350
* Gulden x 400
* Litecoin x 2
* MyriadCoin x 8500
* Navcoin x 75
* OkCash x 350
* ReddCoin x 15000
* Ripple x 100
* Stratis x 30
* Verge x 10000
* Vertcoin x 60
* Voxels x 300
* Waves x 100
	
With Stratis and Waves being my most expensive purchases at respectively € 127.97 and € 224.69. I looked around all of the coins' websites, subreddits, blogs, Twitter feeds and in some cases even Slack channels, and from that I determined I liked Stratis (being a C# developer and all) and Waves (very active community, lot of good news, developments and partnerships in a short time) the most. 

&gt; **Extra investments**

I quickly got hooked by keeping track of all the news sources I could find and watched everything unfold over a couple of days. The bitcoin hard-fork happened and jolly, was I spot-on in my predictions! Slowly I saw the altcoins becoming more valuable again because everyone was repurchasing. Luckily I bought various rounds of Waves again in that first week, right before and slightly after that bitcoin hard-fork was happening. Litebit's maximum purchasing threshold was € 500 a day for me, which (thankfully) limited me a bit in buying, but here's what I bought over a couple of days:
- Another 100 Waves for € 277.58
- Another 50 Waves for € 140.57
- Another 70 Waves for € 210.01
- Another 100 Waves for € 482.12 (see how their value was already increasing at this point?)

Early this week, I also made a wild gamble and purchased another 70 Stratis for € 492.87 on Litebit. In the meantime I also started using Bittrex, using it to purchase 180 Waves and another 100 Stratis, for respectively ~ € 450 and ~ € 400 (rounded numbers because I had to use bitcoin and trade).

At this point, my total investment was roughly € 3150.

&gt; **Uncertainty**

I caught myself having to check the stocks, charts, subreddits, Twitter feeds, Slack channels, and various websites all the goddamn time. It was quickly becoming an addiction. With one of the cryptos I invested in, especially Waves and Stratis, becoming more valuable came great joy and excitement. But of course, with value dropping, came great anxiety, uncertainty and sometimes a mini heart attack. For the record, I make quite good money as a software engineer / lead developer, but not nearly enough that my investment of € 3150 can be considered pocket money.

Especially the last few days have been nerve wrecking, with Stratis to be more specific. I spent quite a lot last Monday on those 70 Stratis (€ 492.87) because apparently, due to its first anniversary, a great announcement and a product update was on the way. I figured that'd pump its value just like what happened with Waves a few days prior. Except that it didn't. It had a short boost at first, only to gradually lower again and even getting to the point where I was losing the money I spent Monday. Reading around a bit made me even more insecure. There were a lot of people very enthusiastic and positive about Stratis, posting all kinds of predictive (and unreadable) charts, only for it to go down even lower.

&gt; **Profit**

Today was yet another day where I was constantly wasting time keeping a sharp eye on all stocks, channels and websites. It was driving me nuts at some point. Especially since Stratis was gradually becoming less valuable. Waves was sitting om a comfortable new *support* value as well, but after having spent a few days on the Slack channel and following various crypto-related news websites, I caught wind of some big conflict between a big ICO and the (community of the) Waves platform (the Money / Coeval thing, to be specific). 

So there was this conflict in the Waves platform that was reaching various news websites and started to make me worried about Waves' value, and there was a sudden peak in Stratis' value. That's the moment I realized I should sell, reap my profits and get a clear conscience. 

My ~ € 1650 investments in Waves had nearly doubled to ~ € 2700. In Stratis I invested ~ € 1150. I unfortunately sold my 100 Stratis stored on Litebit a bit too early (right when the value started increasing, afraid it'd go down immediately after again while it raised like crazy after that) for € 605.60 (making a small loss), thankfully I earned it back by selling the 100 I had on Bittrex for ~ € 750, making my Stratis profit total ~ € 1350, earning me a ~ € 200 profit. I also sold all the altcoins/shitcoins that I had on my Litebit wallet that became slightly profitable, earning me another ~ € 150. 

So, to sum it up, I originally spent ~ € 3150, and sold today for ~ € 4200, with my profit being ~ € 1050 in little less than 2 weeks, plus I still have the following altcoins/shitcoins still sitting in my Litebit wallet since they haven't been doing that great, and I'll just keep them there in the hopes that they'll someday actually become worth something:

* BitSend x 100
* Breakout x 200
* Breakout-Stake x 80
* ClubCoin x 50
* Crown x 25
* DigiByte x 1000
* Dogecoin x 16.000
* EmerCoin x 20
* Feathercoin x 350
* Gulden x 400
* MyriadCoin x 8.500
* OkCash x 350
* ReddCoin x 15
* Ripple x 100
* Verge x 10
* Voxels x 300

Total worth: ~ € 300 for now

&gt; **What I learned**

So let's cut to the most important part, the things I've learned. Which is the very reason I posted this in the first place, hoping other might learn from it.

* Trust your own instincts and do your own research! In the end, the majority of my predictions came true (you guys can check my post history, specifically in /r/cryptocurrency to verify), but I often fell for *shilling*. Mainly on Twitter, where many people were often crazily enthusiastic about a specific crypto, I sometimes fell for the trap and bought based purely on the advice of so called crypto experts which of course didn't come true at all. Don't fall for all their (often unreadable) charts and advise, trust your own gut feeling.

* Have patience. I caught myself checking charts, websites, Twitter timelines and other channels were more often than is healthy. It was eating away at my time and other things to do. Whenever the value of one of the cryptos I invested in dropped, I got nervous like hell. Same for when the price rose, I wondered if the value at that moment was still going to rise, or if that was it. I could've made much more profit with Stratis today (€ 150 - € 200 easily) if I would've just waited for 10 more minutes, for its value to stabilize a little bit rather than selling them as soon as I saw the price rise for a bit.

* Look if a crypto you're going to invest in is actually worth it or at least supports a cause you're willing to contribute to. This is what got me in both Stratis and Waves. Both have a solid roadmap, plans and future they're working towards. Both active communities, good partnerships and more cool plans on the horizon. I'm sure both Waves and Stratis would've become much more valuable if I just hodled for a while. But alas, I'm not that patient and I'd just be spending weeks, months or maybe even years looking at charts and news all the friggin' time.

* Nothing is what it seems. Look at Bitcoin; pretty much nobody was able to predict how that hard-fork would've went and what it'd do to both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash's value. In less than 3 weeks time, Bitcoin's value went from € 1700 to + € 3000. It's easy to quickly win a lot of money, but even easier to lose a lot of money.

* Exchanges are evil. The way most exchanges handled the hard-for was ludicrous. Some went on lockdown for days. I developed a hatred specifically for Litebit over the course of the last 2 weeks as well. As much as I loved the ease of use and how quickly I could buy cryptos with Euros, there were many, many times where it was coincidentally under 'maintenance' right at a crucial moment. Like when Waves or Stratis dropped so much that I wanted to buy right away, but I couldn't. I've been spending all day refreshing their website, but there have easily been well over a dozen of occasions where I wasn't able to buy or sell anything because it was on lockdown due to maintenance. Very suspicious. To make things worse, earlier this week all customers, including myself, received an e-mail about how they had been hacked. I had almost half of my crypto assets in wallets elsewhere, but that was still a nerve-wrecking moment. Don't keep your cryptos on online wallets and exchanges! They're all bound to get hacked at some point.

* Realize that even if you're stepping in now, you're still stepping in early. The crypto market is still young and for now, it's just people with a technical background that are participating. In time even 'mainstream' folks will learn about it, the wallets and technology will be easier to use, banks in various countries will start using negative interest rates for savings accounts causing people to look for alternatives, and so on. I know it's hypocritical of me to say since I already quit after 2 weeks, but hodl those cryptos unless something happens and you feel you have to sell them and/or they're about to become worthless.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I rent a house or buy? $70k salary zero down payment.,"I just got a job after graduation college. My job is paying me close to $70k a year. I have 6 weeks of training for my job where I can probably save up about $5k. Over course of training I plan on finding a place to live. 

I have been trying to find out if I should rent or buy a house. Most of the housing in the area I'm looking at is around $1500 to rent which I would split with a roommate. To buy a house in the area it would cost between $150k and $175k. From what real estate sites have shown a 30 year mortgage at that price would cost between $1000 and $1200 after taxes and insurance(depending on the interest rate). 

I was wondering if it would be a better decision to rent or buy. I'd probably have close to nothing for a down payment since I'd have to save my money from training to live on. If I bought a house I'd rent out one of the rooms to my friend I planned on living with. 

I live in Michigan and my credit score is in the 700s if that helps at all. 

All tips are welcome with buying a house even if it isn't the right decision now I may be buying a house in the future.",finance
personalfinance,I could really use some advice on my finances and how to change where I'm at.,"Single income, two person house. He isn't currently working due to mental illness. We're working on getting him back into a job.

My main concerns are selling my car and getting a cheaper apartment. When we moved into our current apartment, we were making about 5k combined a month. We are currently down to 2800$ a month.

There are 5 months left on the lease, they won't let us transfer to a cheaper one bedroom apartment because we've paid rent late the past two months.

I currently owe 14,300$ on my car and it's KBB value is around 9k if I sell to a dealer, 11k if I sell personal. I did buy a warranty like an idiot, I am in the process of having that cancelled. Hopefully that will take 2k off the financed price.

Below are my current reocuring expenses. This is the full list, including items that I know I need to cut out.

Rent: 1200 (2 Bedroom - Roommate not really an option. I work from home, this is my office.)

My Car: 300

My Insurance: 200 (I had an accident last year, total loss of my car)

I haven't included food because it's all over the place. We've got a TON better about going out to eat, it's not something we do often. I've also just stopped drinking, so we're going to be saving money by not buying a shit ton of beer... 

My primary issues are:

Selling my car - How do I do this? I'm financed with WFDS.

Cheaper apartment - It costs 1 months rent to break lease, plus our credit is in the toilet, can't afford security deposit, etc. on new place.

Also not included are my student loans, which I haven't even looked at or paid. They've been out of deferment for 2 months now I think.

personalfinance,70k + in student loans and trying to get my life on track,"I'm 26 and I finally feel like I'm in a spot to get my life going the right way. The problem is I seriously screwed up my college years. All the way through school I had no problem with learning. Lazily sped trough all my classes and ended up with a 4.0 at the end. Well my lazy tendencies carried through to college and I didn't really think through my decisions well. I went to an out of state college and with the small amount of grants they gave me for school I ended up having to take roughly 20k per year in loans. So with me being lazy I actually wasn't finished at the end of 5 years (they estimate Electrical Engineering will take you 5 years at OSU). Long story short the bank would not lend me anymore money and I was not able to finish school.

So I came back home and moved in with my parents. Almost 4 years later I now have a job as a Programmer at a fruit company and I live with my 3 dogs and my girlfriend. I've paid off about 13k of my principle, but I still have a lot to go. **Edit :** My current income before taxes is 55k

^^^^^.

Here are what my loans look like currently (they are all at a 15 year repayment term)

* $19,444.63 @ 6.74%V
* $20,169.79 @ 6.74%V
* $14,446.65 @ 7.24%V
* $14,840.20 @ 9.44%F 
* $ 1,378.40  @ 9.44%F

Currently I'm working on the small loan, putting extra money into that account to try and get it paid off.  I also have student loans through the government that are in forbearance as I can't come up with the minimum payment they want per month.

^^^^^.

Along with these debts I also have two credit cards.

* Care Credit : $500 limit, I don't keep a balance on this one unless needed for veterinarian expenses
* Amazon Rewards Card through Chase : $1000 limit, I charge a lot to this card. All Amazon purchases and restaurants/gas. I get back 5% on Amazon purchases and 2% back on Restaurants/gas. I pay off the balance in full every billing cycle, minus a few cases where it has taken me a couple pay periods to catch back up.

^^^^^.

I know I'm gonne be in the area for a while because my company has offered to help me finish school and I'm assuming the case is that they want me to continue working for them. So I really want to buy a home. It's really hard for me to save money when all my money is going to rent/student loans. Most the houses that are around the size that my rental have a mortgage rate of about 600-800. Currently I pay 1200 split between my girlfriend and I. 

To help acheive this I wanted to refinance my student loans. They said I'm on a 15 year repayment plan, but they usually do a 20 year for the amount that I have out. This should help me lower my payment and save more towards my down payment on a house. The problem is my refinance has been declined even using the same cosigner as the one currently cosigning my loans... My credit sucks (last I checked around 630), Im assuming it's due to my federal student loans, as I make my payments on time on my credit cards and my private student loans.

^^^^^.

**tl;dr :**  I have a ton of student loan debt, and I can't seem to pay more than the minimum on it. I think getting a house would help me save a couple hundred extra per month that can go towards paying off my debt and make me feel better not paying a landlord and actually building equity even if it's only a small amount. 

^^^^^.

personalfinance,Student Inheritance and financial aid,"My daughter is starting her sophomore year at an expensive school. We are middle-class in a Northeast state, meaning we have too much income for federal or state aid, but not enough to just write full tuition checks. She's able to attend due to 50% covered by scholarships and grants from the school. 

I just found out that she is inheriting about  $40K from a friend who just died. My question is related to the best way to handle this money so as to minimize the impact on our EFC. As I understand it, student assets are counted more heavily in the FAFSA than parental assets. Can she just give us the money as soon as she gets it? We'd put it in her 529 or otherwise hold it and use it to help cover the costs that aid doesn't. 

We're already paying about $30K/year for this school and I'm worried that with this money the aid calculus will change. If it changes too much we could be in trouble. We're really trying to avoid loans, and the aid is all coming from the school. 

Related tax question: As an inheritance the money is not taxable to her, I know that. If she hands it over to us, is it treated as a gift? Or is there some other way to avoid complications, like asking the paying bank to make the check out to both of us? (Daughter will be 100% on board with whatever we do, or we won't do it, don't worry.)

personalfinance,(US) Have a decent nest egg and considering paying down student loans? Is this wise?,"My husband (29m) and I (28f) have a 50K nest egg that we've been sitting on for about two years like a bunch of clueless dumb dumbs. We're both very secure at our current positions and can continue to save diligently so we've been contemplating putting 40K of the savings towards my husbands 85K loan, and then refinancing the remainder of the loan to get a lower interest rate.

Our loans total 129,990.20. Here's the breakdown.

My loan (federal)

Husbands Loan
Private	$85,875.90	7.93% 

TOTAL: 85,875.90 / monthly payment 987.00 / est payoff 10 years.

Our combined yearly income is 110K. No kids. No other debt. Used cars. We rent, pay utilities, eat, and have health insurance through our companies. After monthly expenses (including current loan payments) we have around 1000.00 additional we can pay towards the loans. 

We'd be keeping an emergency fund of 10K and adding to it here and there when excess money comes in (husband does contract work on the side.)

Is there a downside here I'm not seeing or is this a good plan? More than anything I just want to be debt free...but I want to go about it in the most logical and safest way possible.

personalfinance,Critique my new car buying strategy! (X-Post from /r/askcarsales,"My fiance and I are considering this deal towards a 2017 Nissan Leaf S:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-09/bmw-nissan-dangle-20-000-incentives-to-spur-san-diego-ev-sales

The MSRP of 2017 Leaf S in this area range around $34,000.

We are selling a 2001 Honda CRV that has a trade in ~$1000-$1500 or private party sale of ~$2500.

These are the discounts that are listed in the article available to me on the purchase of a 2017 Leaf:

$10,000 off instant rebate (for being a SDG&amp;E customer)

$2500-$4500 CA state rebate (income dependant)

$7500 Federal tax rebate

So here is my math:

~$31,000 Leaf price (after haggling price plus taxes and fees) - $10,000 instant SDG&amp;E customer rebate = $21,000

60 month financing = $377/month ($21,000 at 3% over 60 months)


$7500 (fed. tax rebate) + $2500 (state rebate) = $10,000 / $377 (monthly payment) = 26.53 months



So... by my super rough calculations, we can drive this car for a minimum of 26 months completely covered by the $10,000 (minimum) that will be collected from the state/federal rebates. At that point, we will have approximately $11,000 remaining to pay off on the loan. I know that electric cars lose a lot of value, but I think we'd be able to recoup all of that $11,000 if we sold the car then. So, we'd have a brand new car that we can drive completely ""free"" for over 2 years. And that's not even considering the potential gas $ savings, the money from trading in / selling the CRV, and the potential that we got more than $2500 in the CA rebate deal. 

Is there anything that I'm completely overlooking or missing?

Should we trade in the CRV and pay less in taxes up front (on the Leaf sale) or sell it to a private party (more effort) for ~$2500? If we should trade it in, how much should we expect to get for it?

Even though there is an ""instant rebate"" of $10,000 off the MSRP, do I still have leverage to negotiate an even lower price than the ~$24,000? (I'm assuming that the dealership gets compensated for the $10,000)

I currently owe about 6,000$ on my credit card which has an interest rate of 10.5%.

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, SHA-256, and the NSA","Bitcoin looks to be a great new digital currency that the whole world may someday use. However there are some odd things about bitcoin that deserve more exposure. 

First, Bitcoin was officially released by an unknown person who used a Japanese pseduonym, 5 days before Obama was elected. This person does not exist. 

Secondly, bitcoin mining is designed to solve hashes in the SHA-256 algorithm. SHA-256 is a 256-bit version of an algorithm that is used to encrypt messages sent over the internet. 


The NSA invented SHA-256. 

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2

As people's computers mine bitcoins, they are discovering solutions to SHA-256 hashes, which then get stored in to the blockchain, which is a digital record and repository of all activity within bitcoin to date. 


Each block is like one SHA-256 puzzle, that the computers try to solve. The only way to solve it is to guess the right answer randomly out of billions or trillions of choices. There is no algorithm or method to find the right solution other than guessing and then doing the computation to see if you were correct or not, due to how the algorithm is constructed (which is exactly what makes it good for security). So when computers mine for bitcoins, they are guessing solutions to that particular block's SHA-256 puzzle. When a solution is found, 50 bitcoins (now, 25, and soon to be 12.5 as dictated by the algorithm) are rewarded to the miner who found the solution. So it's a lottery of sorts. This is why people pool together to form mining pools, where the winnings are shared proportionally among everyone, weighted by their total number of attempted solutions. That helps take the luck out of it so everyone can get more reliable income. 

Anyway, these solutions are so hard to find that even with all the computers across the world mining for bitcoins, it still takes 10 minutes to solve just one single puzzle. 


This is why it's so secure. 

If you want to hack a system that uses SHA-256 (which is a very encryption common system to use, alongside SHA-128 which is even weaker) then hacking it difficult because you have to guess over and over to solve this large prime number problem. However, if you have a _list_ of all the prime numbers and their solutions (including many really huge numbers that haven't been computed except for this list) then that is a speedup to cracking a particular system using SHA-256, because you don't have to run all those calculations, you can simply look them up. In the blockchain. 

So there is a potential the blockchain is an open distributed-computing SHA-256 solution repository, which enables hackers who know how to use it (like the NSA). 

With all this in mind, it's easier to see why countries are starting to accept bitcoin as a legal currency. Japan officially recognized it as currency just recently:

We know Japan is often a testing ground for US monetary policy (QE and Abenomics, for example) so this is likely to be the direction of the future, which makes it a good investment because this implies it's backed by the western central banks, which means it will probably prosper in the long term. Which is why we see so many rich people investing in it.

I think cryptocurrencies are great, but I think people need to be mindful of what is going on behind the scenes, and to ensure there are competing cryptocurrencies rather than a singular bitcoin monopoly that dominates the market. However it's good that one cryptocurrecy grow to prominence to establish the infrastructure of using them. 

I do think there is government backing because of the relationship of bitcoin to the NSA's SHA-256 algorithm. However over the next few decades, I think that algorithm will become less and less relevant as cryptography becomes more advanced, and thus bitcoin will lose government support because it will no longer be useful to the NSA. However there will likely be replacement cryptocurrencies by that time. 

So it seems like a short-term western global currency, but in the long term will likely have to be replaced as SHA-256 loses its relevancy, as computers become more powerful.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin, SHA-256, and the NSA","Bitcoin looks to be a great new digital currency that the whole world may someday use. However there are some odd things about bitcoin that deserve more exposure. 

First, Bitcoin was officially released by an unknown person who used a Japanese pseduonym, 5 days before Obama was elected. This person does not exist. 

Secondly, bitcoin mining is designed to solve hashes in the SHA-256 algorithm. SHA-256 is a 256-bit version of an algorithm that is used to encrypt messages sent over the internet.

personalfinance,Options for buying a used car,"I'm a college graduate looking to buy a used car for about $10,000. The used car dealer ran my credit and said I could get a 9% interest rate with no cosigner. My parents offered to just lend me the money  somewhere between 0 and 1% interest. I also could just buy the car outright but it would entirely exhaust my savings outright. I have a pretty decent credit score already but it's just from one credit card, so it's a ""weak"" 750+or-.

personalfinance,"How to get the most out of my scholarship, need help putting them towards my student loans.","I am a college student, about to graduate this fall. I have about $68,000 in student loan debt. About $17,000 of that is government loans and the rest is private loans. My full student loan breakdown is [here](http://imgur.com/a/TAl4l) . 

I have received a $10,000 scholarship from the company have interned for for the past two years. As well as a government pell grant for about $4,500. My school is rewarding these funds to me as ""living expenses"" as I have fully paid for my tuition. So I can put this money where ever I would like. I am still in the grace period and will not be due for payments until February. 

My questions are, what should I pay first to save the most on interest in the long term. Is it smarter to pay off all the interest on my two private loans? Or should I pay to just the highest interest rate one? Or is it better to pay off almost all of my stafford loans to get that out of the way? Bonus question, will I owe taxes on the scholarship or is it looked at the same as student loans?

I am not sure what my income will be like after graduation, but right now my day rate is typically $400/d (freelance). My total bills are about $450 a month, no other debt but also no savings. So I only have to work at least 5 days a month to live comfortably. I plan on working a lot more, but it's tough out there. I don't think I will be able to consolidate my private loans with a 1099 job, I'm not really sure how that works and the bank has no helpful answers. So I expect to have to pay the almost $1,000 monthly payments for a long time. Which brings me to another option I was considering, which is saving the $4,500 from the pell grant as an emergency fund to help pay monthly payments if I can't pay it on time. Would that be stupid?

There is so much information out there it is completely overwhelming. These are all the things I can't find answers to, so any help at all is very appreciated.",finance

I'd like a recommendation. I could either continue paying down my student loan debt (~35k left, 11k at 6.5%, 20k at 5.5%, remainder sub 4%) using the avalanche method, or switch to maxing out my ESPP which has a 15% discount and no holding period at max 1k/biweekly pay period which is a biannual ESPP plan. The way I see it is I have a guaranteed minimum 10% return (will save 5%, or 33% of gains for taxes) which outweighs the interest rate on the loans. Thoughts?",finance

btc,Bitcoin is no longer a viable p2p currency.,"I been a user of bitcoin since 2011 Thats right two years before the feds got liberty reserve. I remember buying bitcoin at $1 a piece. But for some reason i don't remember all the drama, Its pretty obvious that bitcoin in spirit is DEAD!! Centralization has happened whether its the miners or the core devs. The average user doesn't have a say. Only the people with power and money do. Does that sound peer to peer to you? We need to know when to let go. Bitcoin played its role, It paved the way for way better technology some of which currently exists today. Its not hard to believe that so many of you got blinded by the greed. Bitcoin is too far gone.... too many special interests in it... (dont get me wrong still good investment but thats not why it was created) I suggest we all do some research and a find a p2p coin that better protects the sentiments of Satoshi Nakamoto. Because bitcoin is no longer in control of the people.  You cannot sit there and deny the fact that developers and miners have WAYYY too much power. They might not be the same 1%ers we are use too but they are 1%ers and they are just as bad!  (wasn't the original debate about the scaling issue about what size to make the blocks? i dont understand how that turned into not increasing the block size at all. Increasing the block size was always satoshi's plan from the start.)

I initially just set a small percentage into my ESPP to try it since I hadn't ever had the option before.  Based on this other post and trying to get my finances in better, more adult shape (I'm 29, wife is 26), I was going to increase that contribution.  My plan details are: 15% discount off the lower of beginning or ending quarterly price, contributing up to 25% of compensation, which I understand to be a pretty solid offering from my employer.

In order to change that amount, I had to open the relevant plan documents.  One of them says:
&gt; In addition, because of Federal tax requirements, you must notify the Company, in writing, if you sell or dispose of shares within two years of your Entry Date during the Offering Period when you acquired the shares.

So, this is not a requirement that I hold the shares for 2 years, but I am supposed to inform them if I sell.  Can you see any negatives to taking advantage of this as a result of having to inform them in writing?  Are these their tax implications they are concerned about?  If so, would they take it out on me?  Anyone had a company object to this?  The person who manages our ESPP just took over that job function after the experienced person left, so I'm not sure who it is or if they'll have the answers I'd need.  Obviously, I'll need to figure that out, but I'd like to know what to expect.

Running the numbers for my ESPP, with a 15% discount and 25% contribution max, this could be equivalent to a 4.4% raise (I assumed a steady stock price to make things easy).  That seems seriously worth doing, but I don't want to annoy my employer to do it.  Plus, it'll be a rough budget adjustment having less in my regular pay check.  I hope to reduce my spending by most of the difference to help me build my emergency fund and then Roth IRA.  I am already contributing up the match amount into my 401k.  


**Edit:**  Also, since this is 25% of my income, is there any reason I shouldn't do that much?  My understanding is most programs are limited to 10%.  My understanding is the only risk is that the stock price goes down between quarter end and when the quiet period ends, which tends to be roughly a month later in my case.  If the price just tanked that could be a lot, but any less than -15%, I'm only losing my potential gains and any interest I could have earned by having the money sooner.  Our stock has not been very volatile - one industry wide reset of 7% or so in the last 5 years.",finance
personalfinance,Pay off my $47k Student Loan?,"Hey Reddit!

Just turned 30yrs old and somehow my career really took of this year. I've gone from making $22k/year, to now a projected $100k/year. This is all great, except I thought I would be a low income artist forever and be able to stay on the Income Based Repayment program for my student loans, which I have been on since I graduated 7 years ago with a 6.5% interest rate. ~~IF I were to stay on this program consecutively without making more than $88k/year, my loans and interest would have been forgiven after 20 years - it's bittersweet.~~ Just found out there is actually no income cap on the REPAY program (which there is on the IBR), which means my loans/interest will be forgiven in 2030. 

Since I have been making more money, I have been saving and could potentially pay off my student loans soon. What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing this? I've been doing my research, but I'm finding it hard to come up with a final decision. In a perfect world I would negotiate my loans, but I'm reading that this isn't possible with loans from the government. 

Would love to hear some opinions, professional or personal. Thank you! 

Here's the breakdown:
- Beginning Principal:	$33,435.00
- Current Principal: $47,056.92
- Interest Rate:	6.550%
- Current savings: $30k 
- No other debt
- Not interested in buying a home anytime soon
- I have a newer car with no interest

More info I just got - there is no cap on the REPAY program, but here is a glance at what my payments would be: $50k - $266/month, $100k - $682.58/month. Which would mean I may pay off my student loans in ~6 years anyway based on the repayment plan - so I wound't be able to take advantage of the loan forgiveness, but I would still be on the plan if my income drops.",finance

For the rest of us who live in reality there is little doubt that the latest Fed-fueled credit bubble will eventually burst in epic fashion and once again lay waste to the personal balance sheets of millions of Americans.  And while the timing of market collapses can never be predicted, UBS strategist Matthew Mish says there is one thing that is certain about the next credit unwind, it will be unlike anything we've seen before.

To summarize, Mish notes that unlike previous credit expansion cycles, this current one has been dominated not by traditional banks but rather by non-bank lending entities and government backed loans, especially in riskier subprime residential, auto and student loans.  Moreover, unlike traditional lenders, Government debt tends to be much slower to react to things like rising delinquency rates...you know, because it's just taxpayer money so who cares.",finance

I've been paying 40% of my income to student loans since I first got a job and am current across all my loans - I've rounded numbers up slightly for privacy/ease of understanding.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is a basic breakdown of the loans I owe:

&amp;nbsp;

Navient loan: $18K @ 6.3%/8% (three loans consolidated into one)

Monthly Payment: $500

This sucker is decreasing beautifully and I am on target to wrap it up in about three years.

&amp;nbsp;

Discover loan: $5K @ 4%

Monthly Payment: $90

Super tiny loan that I'll keep paying the minimum on to keep my credit score high.

&amp;nbsp;

Mohela loan: $60K @ 7% (several loans consolidated into one)

Monthly payment: $450 (but I've been paying an extra $100 since Feb., so $550 total)

&amp;nbsp;

This one is a bane of my existence. I started paying more towards it (starting in Feb. of this year) in frustration as I've paid nearly $37K towards this loan only to make about $6K in progress because of the interest rate. I'm starting to see a little head way...sort of. Regardless of when I pay it, I don't consistently dent my principal in the same way (Sometimes about $250 in principal, last month it was only $80). Mohela also appears to hide the 'Pay towards your principal' functionality (overpaying goes towards future payments) so I'm fairly certain I have to call a rep. and specifically ask *each time* if I want my payment to go towards principal instead of next month's payment. Admittedly, I haven't been doing this since I tend to pay my student loans online the moment my paycheck hits my account - so all of my payments so far have gone towards future payments. I didn't mind this initially since it was nice to have a buffer of a month just in case shit hits the fan for me financially. Currently, I only have to pay about $275 by the end of Sept. but I want to keep the ball rolling and am trying to figure out what to pay this month (stick with $550? Towards principal? Or...?)

&amp;nbsp;

Just to give you a quick sense of where the rest of my money goes, I live in NYC and get fairly clobbered by taxes, pre-tax I set aside 12% into a 401K and $255 a month of NYC commuter benefits, my rent is $1K a month and utilities are about $75 a month (split with my roommates). When all is said and done, I have about $200-300 left over from each biweekly paycheck. No car, kids or house so my life is fairly simple and I can handle living on less as long as my bills are covered.

I used up my emergency fund for damage deposit on my new rental with friends which has lowered my rent.

All tips and advice welcome, thank you all very much in advance, I need all the help I can get. If there is any info needed I am more than happy to fill in and explain things.

Edit1: My main hobby is gaming and I don't need to spend money on that, also if anyone has info on how I get more info on my different loans and their interest rates that would be greatly appreciated.

Edit2: I called Scotiabank, my remaining loan amount is $49,000 at 3.49%.",finance
personalfinance,Need tips to manage my saving accounts,"Hey, I am a 18 years old student that has a part time job since almost a year. I wanted to put money in saving accounts so if there is an emergency I can use this amount of money, and also because I dont want money to be a struggle later in life. I wanna be rich (its a joke plz)

So i have a TFSA (Tax free saving account) in which I can only put a certain amount of money each year, this year was 5,5k$. So that is what I did. But the interest rate is 0,65%, so I opened a High interest saving account to be able to save more money. the thing is, the interest rate is the same, so I havent put money in it.

I am now wondering How can I get the best out of the 2 accounts?

Since I cant put any more money in the TFSA until january, I thought about putting an amount of money into the other saving account each week or months, then put it in my TFSA in january, and start again.

What do you guys think? If you have any other suggestions feel free to tell me, I really want to save as much money as I can.",finance

investing,Can sinking fund protection result in buyback of bonds below purchase price?,"Many of the bonds I've been looking at have ""sinking fund protection."" From my research, it seems that this is money the bond issuer sets aside to purchase back a set amount of bonds each year. This buyback occurs at market price or par, whichever is lower.

Let's assume that I purchase a bond at par, but interest rates rise, and the market value of the bond falls below par. Can the company force me to participate in the buyback at market price? If so, I would lose money since market price is below my purchase price.",finance

personalfinance,Buying a new house vs renting an apartment (Student loans),"Hi everyone,

I'm looking into buying my own place or renting an apartment right now, but I'm not sure which route is better to pursue. I'm currently living with my parents and I graduated in 2015 with my Master's in Computer Engineering, so I do have some college debt ($44,050.75 left).

I have a great job that I love. I make $89,000 plus stocks and bonuses, and I get to work from home 1-3 days a week (although I usually go into the office all 5 days a week). I also have money leftover from an internship I did and research lab stipends.

I have about $53,000 in my bank account currently, so I was saving up in case I wanted to buy a house and needed a downpayment. Got room for that.

Current expenses:

 - Gas ($150/mo)
 - Medication ($60/mo)
 - Car payment ($344/mo)
 - Student loan payment ($832/mo)

Car payment should be done in &lt;1 year. Student loan should be done in &lt;4.5 years @ this rate, but I can refinance both if necessary.

I'm not sure if it would be wise to buy a place when I have these monthly expenses. What do you think? If I shouldn't buy a place right away, what do you think about killing those student loans? I used to have a separate $38,000 loan on top of the $44,000 one, but I paid that $38,000 one all off at once about a year ago. (So I guess I would have had almost $90k in the bank right now if I didn't pay it off, but I want to pay off my loans quickly and part of it was like 7% interest anyway, so I don't regret doing that.)

BTW, interest rate is 5.5% for my student loans left (yikes!), so that's something important you guys probably need to know.",finance

personalfinance,Private student loan - advice needed,"Hi. Some background info - I'm an international student getting my undergraduate degree in the US. I had a sponsor coming into this, but no longer do. I am now entering my second year of college without enough funds to finish.

I met with my banker today to discuss loan options. Because I am an international student, I am ineligible for federal loans, grants, or aid. My only option is to take out a private student loan.
He started me on the approval process for a Collegiate Loan (Wells Fargo). I need about $30,000 total. I can only take out loans for one school year at a time. I have asked for $6,000 to cover one semester this year (my spring semester that starts in January). My interest rate options are as follows: fixed rate at 11.9%, or variable rate at 9.74% (cap is 18%).

I can pay back close to $600 each month as soon as I take out the loan. That is how much I make a month. (International students can only work 20 hours a week, and it must be on campus).

My banker told me this wasn't the worst situation, especially if I can keep my payment amounts up that high. I will be needing to do this for my third and fourth year, taking out $12,000 for each.

Considering how high my interest rate options are, is this a feasible course for me to take? I don't really have other options to fund my education, but I also don't want to end up neck-deep in debt. Which interest rate option is less shitty? If I can keep up paying $600 monthly for the next two and a half years (starting January 2018), how much debt will I have left when I graduate in May of 2020?

Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,34 y/o teacher...Am I missing out on tons of interest?,"Hi! I'm 34, married, 1 kid so far (7 months old). I make $84k as a teacher (yes, I'm very lucky) and husband is about the same but may make more depending on commission. Our only debt is about $193k mortgage @ 4.375% and the remainder of my student loan debt $13k ($4k @ 3.75% the remaining @ 1.625%).
We have roughly $50k in savings. $30k is earning 1.15% interest, the other $20k is making...I don't even know like 0.5%. We've kept that $20k in our td bank account as the immediate access emergency fund and that's also the threshold needed for perks like ATM fee reimbursements and free bank checks, etc. 
My husband contributes to a 401k, and as a teacher, I contribute to a 403b but only $2600/year. I also pay into a pension fund. I only pay $100/month into a Roth IRA.
Here are my questions:
1) In what order do I pay things off? I'm tempted to just pay the student loans and be done with them, then throw more at the mortgage and some into my kid's college fund (currently nonexistent).
2) I'm sure I'm missing out on interest with my weak ass interest rates. I'm scared of investing. I just got the app Stash and have about $500 in there. Doing ok. Better than the bank. But I'm scared to put THOUSANDS in. Should I quit being a baby?
3) should I be putting even more into the Roth IRA and 403b? I have the pension though too so my thinking is that $ might be better used elsewhere right now? Or am I way off??

I'd imagine asking for a 30% pay increase won't go over too well. Does that seem like a generally bad idea?

personalfinance,student loan refinancing advice for a financially unsavvy 25 year old looking to pay off debt ASAP,"Hi Reddit, I am 11 months into student loan repayments and just discovered SoFi after hearing that some of my colleagues use it. I applied and I just wanted to see if anyone has any advice as to whether or not I should accept. My current monthly payment is $2000 to federal loans and $75 to health professions loan (as it has the 3rd lowest interest rate). My goal out of refinancing would be paying off my loans faster, and if it lowers the amount of interest that's an added bonus.

SoFi offered me $106,668.02 at an interest rate of 5% for a 5 year term. The monthly payment they suggested was $2,012 or something like that. I would sign up for autopay and get the additional 0.25% off, which would take some off of my monthly payment as well. So it wouldn't change much in regards to my current monthly payment, but hopefully I would pay off debt faster?

My current federal loan amounts and rates are as follows:
$65,334.42 at 6.21%
$19,799.51 at 5.41%
$3,212.09 at 4.5%
$9,244.05 at 3.4%
My health professions loan is right under $7000 at 5% rate.

Are there any cons anyone can see to accepting this SoFi loan? I just want to make sure this isn't a waste of time. I'm just not sure how much of a difference it will make since some of my loans have lower interest rates than I'm being offered.

personalfinance,Using some of the Navy Federal's Career Kick-Off Loan and/or USAA's Career Starter Loan for stock investment?,"A friend who is going into the NUPOC program (currently a senior engineering student at a university) asked for help regarding the question.

Their situation is that they don't have any debts, over $10K credit line in total from churning credit cards (no credit card debt), maxed out IRA for 2015-2017, set max of 60% salary contribution to Roth TSP, over $40K in a taxable stock investment account, and plan on using a third/fourth-hand 2009 or 2011 Toyota Camry until their first 6-year commissioned contract is done (car's age would be about 13-16 years old at that point).

He is thinking about using some of the one or two loans for stock investment, and put the rest in a rainy day fund (such as when the car has a repair cost that exceeds market value).

The USAA's starter loan has a 3% APR and the Navy Federal has a 1.25% APR. I am tempted to advise him to hold off on the USAA's loan unless if the market is recovering from a downturn in order to buy depressed S&amp;P500 index funds, but I wanted to seek second opinion to avoid misleading him.

TLDR: Investing with a margin that has a 1.25% APR, and a 3% APR if you needed more money for the investing

personalfinance,More financial sense to pay off low interest mortgage early or put proposed additional mortgage payments in investment acct?,"Here's mine and my wife's household stats:

- $85k gross annual income
- One vehicle paid off, another to be paid off by end of year
- Student loan to be paid off by end of year
- No CC debt
- Recently refinanced $159k mortgage at 2.75% on a 15-year note, pmt is $1,306/mo.  We also have a mortgage credit certificate on the loan, which gives us 30% of the annual interest as a tax credit, so the effective interest rate is closer to 1.9%.
- Emergency savings is g2g
- Both of us are maxing our employer match for retirement

With the car and student loans being paid off by the end of the year, we are looking at another $700-$800/mo to either put toward the principle on the mortgage, or we could invest it in something else.  I will also able to save ~$5-10k/year, according to my budget, which I am considering using as lump sum payments on the mortgage so that I don't have a ton of cash accumulating in low interest savings.

Our overall goal in 6-8 years is to have the mortgage paid off and to have ~$60k to put down on an investment property at the beach.  Is the risk of putting the proposed extra $700-$800/mo plus $5k-$10k/year into an investment account going to be offset by the potential gains as compared to putting that money against a 1.9% interest mortgage?

personalfinance,"I found out that a coworker in the same position, with the same education, experience, workload, etc. is making almost twice what I make. (Cross post r/relationship_advice)","Tl;dr: Already knowing I was underpaid, and waiting for the opportunity to discuss a pay raise with my boss, I found out that a coworker in the same position with the same credentials is making almost twice what I make.   

Story: I began working at a research facility last April as an administrative assistant making $11/hr. I was promoted to a position as a clinical research assistant in August of 2016 at $14/hr, with promise that in a year I would have the opportunity to move up into a research coordinator position, and receive a raise. Meanwhile, I received my bachelors degree in December 2016.   

Fast forward to one year later. I have been given all of the responsibilities of not one, but two coordinators, as we are very understaffed. I am working overtime each week to tackle my work. I have yet to receive a raise. At my quarterly review two months ago, I was told that corporate was not approving any raises at this time, and that maybe after August or so (our highest revenue season) I can expect a pay raise. Still no title change to coordinator, despite having the work of a coordinator, and being referred to as one in all company communication.   

So, yesterday my coworker confused in me that she makes $24/hr. She was hired 6 months after I was, and, like me, had relevant experience, but no coordinator experience. We both have bachelors degrees. We work the same position with the same job duties. I make $14/hr.   

So, I guess the advice I am looking for is how to approach my boss about this outrageous difference in pay, and why I am not being fairly compensated. My boss is VERY big on not disclosing pay with fellow employees, and I understand this completely. However, I did not ask my coworker how much she makes, she simply told me. And now I cannot un-know.   

I have never had to discuss wages with my employer, and this may not even be the best subreddit to ask for help on this in, but I will take all of the advice I can get.",finance

# **WEEK AHEAD: US, North Korea tensions could hit market during big week of retail earnings** - *[(CNBC.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/11/us-north-korea-tensions-could-hit-market-during-big-week-of-retail-earnings.html)*

*****

&gt; Retail and media company earnings, inflation data and Fed speakers will keep investors busy as markets head into the dog days of August.
******
&gt; Tensions between the U.S. and North Korea could cause more volatility in the week ahead.
&gt; Wal-Mart and Home Depot are among chain stores reporting earnings in the last busy week of earnings season.
&gt; Monthly retail sales data, housing starts and industrial production are among the economic releases expected, and the Fed also releases the minutes of its last meeting.
******
&gt; Stocks could be entering a longer period of volatility, with concerns about North Korea's nuclear threat accelerating some selling pressure that analysts had been expecting to see anyway.
******
&gt; It's late August, but the week ahead has a number of important market drivers, including Tuesday's monthly retail sales report and Wednesday's release of minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting. Wal-Mart and Home Depot, two of the better performers in retail, both report earnings, as do a number of smaller chain stores.
******
&gt; Of course, the unpredictable and at times unnerving war of words between President Donald Trump and North Korea could continue to hang over markets, which acted desensitized to it on Friday after a sharp sell-off Thursday.
******
&gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 had their second worst weekly losses of the year, with the S&amp;P 500 down 1.4 percent at 2,441. The Dow fell 1.1 percent to 21,858. The Nasdaq, which had shown early signs of a selloff, ended the week down 1.5 percent at 6,256.
******
&gt; Treasurys benefited from a flight-to-safety trade, with the 10-year yield dipping to 2.18 percent, its lowest level since June. Yields move opposite prices. Gold was also bid up as a safe haven, rising more than 2.5 percent for the week.
******
&gt; ""The market's going to continue to react in the short term to any further signs of escalation or de-escalation of the geopolitical risk,"" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch equity strategist Dan Suzuki. ""Every expert and anybody who has looked at the history of these geopolitical events, they are almost always a buying opportunity.""
******
&gt; Geopolitical tensions are not the only thing analysts are looking for as a trigger for a selloff in a market that has not had a major pullback in 18 months. The catalysts could be any number of things but one overriding concern is the expectation that global central banks will tighten up policy in the coming months. That could spook a market that has risen for eight years in a world of super low interest rates.
******
&gt; ""We could have a number of periods of pullbacks,"" said Kate Moore, BlackRock chief equity strategist. Moore said it's most likely any sell offs in the late summer and fall would be fairly shallow and probably short-lived. She said the market is showing greater dispersion and has become better for stock pickers.
******
&gt; ""In general, I think equity returns in the second half of the year will be solid,"" she said. But Moore said she's watching for central bank risk and expects in the next couple of weeks that there could be signs that the European Central Bank will step back further from its asset purchase program.
******
&gt; ECB President Mario Draghi speaks at the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium taking place starting August 24. Moore said Draghi may signal that changes are coming, which the central bank could then elaborate on at its September meeting.
******
&gt; The Fed symposium will also be an opportunity for Fed officials to clarify their own plans to shrink their balance sheet, as well as discuss their views on inflation and interest rate hikes. The lack of inflation, in a fifth disappointing monthly CPI report Friday, has made the market even more skeptical the Fed will be able to raise interest rates a third time this year. The Fed, however, is expected to make an announcement after its September meeting that it will soon begin to wind down bond purchases and reduce its balance sheet.
******
&gt; ""What's more a concern to us are things that relate to profits and the economic cycle. That's where we're still focused,"" Suzuki said. BofA has been expecting a correction, and sees the S&amp;P 500 at 2450 at year end, slightly higher than current levels. ""The thing that probably matters most is what's going to happen with market sentiment. We're at the point of the cycle where fundamentals and valuations take a back seat to sentiment and technicals.""
******
&gt; Both Moore and Suzuki pointed to a highly unusual phenomena this earnings period. Companies that beat earnings were not rewarded much, and those that missed, were clobbered with out-sized losses. Normally, the stocks of companies that beat rise a few percent. Those that miss decline a few percent.
******
&gt; Suzuki said that could be indicative of a late cycle bull market. ""The last time you saw this happen was during the tech bubble in 2000,"" he said.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: August-September Weakness Could be a Positive for the Market**

&gt; Over the last 30 years (1987 to 2016) August and September combined have been the worst two consecutive months of the year for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. August ranks dead last while September has been second worst. This one-two combo has resulted in average losses of 0.2% by NASDAQ to 1.8% by DJIA. S&amp;P 500 average decline has been 1.3%. As recently as 2015 the period was hit with a sizable pullback. In many years, this weakness proved to have been a great buying opportunity. 

&gt; In the following table, August-September performance by DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ has been ranked from strongest to weakest with subsequent fourth performance. In years when August and September combined for a net loss, fourth quarter average performance more than doubled for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 while the frequency of fourth quarter gains also improved. Of the 14 down August-September periods suffered by S&amp;P 500, just one subsequent fourth quarter was also down, 2008.

Well-chosen defensive positions in healthcare, utilities and bonds have ensured the portfolios have not fallen significantly behind the major indexes during their grind modestly higher the past few months while still being well-aligned to survive any potentially weakness lurking ahead. Our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal will confirm when it is safe to be more aggressive sometime after October 1, well ahead of any fourth quarter or yearend rally.

# **Best and Worst Performing S&amp;P 500 Stocks on Earnings**

&gt; While the average stock that has reported earnings this season has gone down 0.82% on its earnings reaction day, there have of course been some big winners. There are 27 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have gained 5% or more on their earnings reaction days so far this season (which began on July 10th). These 27 stocks are listed in the table below.

&gt; As shown, Michael Kors (KORS) tops the list with a one-day gain of 21.54% that it saw on August 8th after earnings. Perrigo (PRGO) ranks 2nd with a gain of 15.78%, followed by Illumina (ILMN), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), and Netflix (NFLX). Other notables on the list of earnings season winners include Boeing (BA), Verizon (VZ), Caterpillar (CAT), and AT&amp;T (T).

&gt; One more thing — while these stocks saw huge gains on their earnings reaction days, they’ve on average declined by 2.28% since then. This means there hasn’t been much upside follow-through for the stocks that initially reacted the most positively to earnings.

&gt; While there have been 27 S&amp;P 500 stocks that have gained 5% or more on their earnings reaction days this season, there have been a lot more than have fallen 5% or more. Sixty-two in fact.

&gt; Below is a list of this season’s biggest losers in the S&amp;P 500. Seagate Tech (STX) ranks at the top with a one-day drop of 16.5%, followed by Akamai (AKAM), Viacom (VIAB), and Interpublic (IPG). Other notables on the list of earnings season losers include Macy’s (M), Starbucks (SBUX), Under Armour (UAA), and Johnson Controls (JCI).

&gt; Above we pointed out that the biggest earnings season winners have seen no upside follow-through after their initial jumps. The biggest losers also haven’t seen any kind of bounce since their big drops. On average, the stocks below have fallen another 3.13% since the close on their earnings reaction days.

# **Stocks Selling Off Post Earnings**

&gt; Nearly 2,500 companies have reported earnings since the current earnings season began, and the average stock that has reported has actually fallen 0.82% on its earnings reaction day. Notably as well is that stocks that have reported have continued to fall even after their initial earnings reaction day.

&gt; Below is a chart detailing this trend. As shown, companies that have beaten earnings estimates have averaged a small gain of 0.81% on their earnings reaction days this season. Companies that have missed EPS estimates have gotten hit hard, however, with a one-day drop of 3.61%.

&gt; Once the initial earnings reaction day passes, investors have been hitting the “Sell” button, regardless of whether the company beat or missed. While stocks that have beaten EPS have averaged a small gain on their earnings reaction days, they’re down an average of 2.63% since then. That’s actually worse than the average decline of 2.02% that stocks that have missed EPS estimates have seen since their earnings reaction days.

&gt; There’s been lots of commentary about this being the strongest earnings season in years in terms of actual earnings growth. But based on how stock prices have been reacting to their earnings reports, it looks like that strength was fully priced in well in advance of the start of the third quarter.

personalfinance,Need help getting out of debt,"Hey, I posted this yesterday and was recommended to post here for more traffic/help

Hello,
When I was young I had the world planned out. I was 21, with my 20 year old fiancee and we just bought a house. My credit score was about 750, hers above 720. We went right to work and skipped the college stuff, and had a very good, realistic budget. It set money aside for stuff breaking, what to put into savings, overestimated costs of groceries and gas etc. Well that was over 2 years ago, and now we are financially screwed. We made poor investments, and ultimately said ""yes"" to too many things. All of our credit card payments are almost always late, as is the mortgage. We have a newborn son and missed some time from work to help get him going, and the medical bills took a toll. Overall we are about ~50k in debt counting in some good(ish) tangible stuff (her wedding ring, our central heating/cooling unit, new appliances for our house, new flooring). I really just don't know where to start. I know a lot of people say ""start small"" or ""pay anything, it helps"" but when I go to pay a 300 dollar bill online for the central heating unit, it needs minimum 300, it won't accept $299, or $199. Same for the mortgage and almost everything I can think of. I was thinking about getting a home equity loan (I think thats what its called), where I give up 50k in my house to a bank, in exchange for a loan with an interest rate and something I can manage. The only benefit to my situation (that I can see) is that my house is a newer house, with a lot of potential. There are 2 houses (for sale) less than a half a mile from me with the same exact design as mine (built by the same builder). Theres are therefore pretty similar with the exception of a finished basement, or updated countertops, or having a fireplace. Although my yard is definitely better. Those other 2 houses are listed at about 300k. I got my house for 125k. Would I even be approved for a loan/line of credit using my house as collateral? I know the mistakes I did to get here, I just can't seem to get out.
Thanks!
(throw away account obviously)

Debt is roughly:
Credit Card #1 10,900
Credit Card #2 5000
Credit Card #3 3000
Credit Card #4 3000
(medical bill) - 2000
(central heating unit) 8000

personalfinance,Helping parents - talk me out of this (NL),"Hi r/PF,

My parents are in a bad financial location. Not necessarily due to bad habits, but due to bad luck basically. I'm in a much better place financially and have come up with a plan to help them and make me a little investment profit.  

They are paying back a loan of ~50k EUR @7-ish % interest. It costs them 750 EUR / month which is killing their cashflow and money related goals in life.  

My financial situation makes it possible to pay of the loan for them. However, I want to make this an investment as well as help (because I know just giving away 50k would be stupid).  

The structure I'm thinking of will be: me borrowing 40k at 4.2% amortized over 10 years, putting down 10k cash. This will be the equivalent of investing in real estate with 20% down.  
With this 50k I buy a 25% stake in their home. My best guess is it's valued at 220k at the moment, so at 25% I will be getting a 10% discount on that.  
They will pay me a fixed 2-3% interest rate per year, with no principle due. This helps their cashflow problem going from 750 to ~100-125 EUR per month. The principle will only be due when they decide to sell their home, where I'll receive 25% of the value (since I bought that 25% stake).  

Is this a really stupid idea Reddit, or a way to 1) help the parents and 2) make some interest? Please tell me why this is a really good or stupid plan.",finance

personalfinance,Create a larger safety net or start paying down debts sooner?,"I live in a relatively rural area and I have about 1 month's pay as a safety net ($1400). I also have about $8000 in debt between student loans (two semesters) and personal finances. The student loans are currently accruing interest, but I won't be required to start paying until December. I can save upwards of 50% of my income if I chose to do so. All interest rates in question are no higher than 6.25%.

My question is basically the title: would it be wise to make my safety net larger now and keep doing minimums on the bills, or should I begin to pay down these debts?

(Need advice on how to not ruin my credit.),"So... long story short I have been with Verizon for a while now and everything was fine until I decided to switch to Sprint last year for the ""Cut your bill in half thing"". Well turns out Sprint's service was terrible where I lived so I switched back to Verizon within 24 hours. This was in late July of last year.

Important Part 1: The lady at the Verizon store took my Silver S7 Edge back when I ported my number over to Sprint. When I came back the next day and ported my number back in she gave me a Black S7 Edge. Other than the color identical phones. I honestly did not think anything of it and she helped me to port all of my contacts and data back onto the Verizon phone. All is well but my bill went up and stupidly I did not think to check it. Dumb I know.

So around April of this year I go into Target to do some grocery shopping and I see the new S8 Plus and decide to upgrade. This is when I get told by the Verizon rep my phone is not upgrade eligible which is odd because I have had the phone for a long time. Still trusting Verizon I pay him $132 and some change to get it to the 50% mark to make it upgrade able. Great right? Well no my phone is still saying it is not upgrade-able at Target and the new Rep tells me to go to a Corporate store because it takes time to show up on 3rd party retailers. This is when I discover the odd part of my bill. Pulling up my billed revealed 2 separate device payments... I only have 1 line and 1 phone.

Important Part 2: Come to find out I have been paying for 2 separate devices, a Silver S7 Edge and a Black S7 Edge since my return to Verizon last year. I discovered this when I called Verizon back asking about the 2 separate device payments. Still April 2017. So keep in mind I was paying a additional device payment since July or August of 2016. They tell me there was a mistake in Verizon's billing department and that some people were not getting charged for the S7 Edges in some part of the country but that when I switched to Sprint and came back and got a new phone that the device payment was ""fixed"" and charged accordingly. Ok companies make mistakes I understand right? Well I tell the lady on the phone that I understand this and just would like to have the Silver S7 Edge removed from my bill and that I would upgrade the Black S7 Edge to the S8. According to her that is not a problem but I should wait until I see the credit on my bill before upgrading. So she submits a form for a Forced Buyout. 

May 2017: https://imgur.com/a/Uluj4 

I get this wonderful bill of $581.38. The Force Buyout... charged me. The warehouse saying they never received a Silver S7 Edge denied it. So of course I call Verizon I am not paying a $581 bill. I speak with another lady who is very nice and we decide to contact the store I returned the phone to to see if they know what happened to it. Well the person who took my phone in is on vacation. Come to find out authorized retailers ARE NOT supposed to take back devices only Corporate stores can. So I get asked many times what happened and why I turned my phone in etc. This is the first time I find out there is a huge difference in a Corporate store and a Authorized Retailer. This was not some mall kiosk I returned my phone to in 2016. It is a store that says in giant letters on the front Verizon Wireless. They only sold Verizon and everyone had the Verizon red shirt khaki pants uniform on.. so please forgive me for thinking they were an actual Verizon store.

Still May 2017: I follow up later that month in a series of calls to figure out why my bill is still reflecting this device and come to find out the Buyout was denied again and that this next person would fix it. Awesome! 

June 2017: More calls more excuses and I am REALLY starting to get fed up. I hang up on the last rep I spoke to and was determined to be done with Verizon. Well on my way to the store a new Verizon rep calls me back and asks what happened because he was informed from his co-worker the ""call did not end well"". He seemed to be very understanding and actually credited me $100 for the Target gift card promotion I missed out on for the delay in getting this removed from my bill. Very nice guy. 

July 2017: My bill is now larger than ever. Of course I call back again and this time insist on speaking to someone from management because the Rep just kept giving me the run around about why I owed over $700 in a single billing cycle. I inform her I am not paying a single penny until this is resolved and long story short get a manager on the line. So finally I get a lady on the line who identifies herself as a manager and wants em to start from step one and tell her everything... so I do. Also I ask that if that silver phone is floating out there would Verizon not be able to tell if it had ever been turned back on? She puts me on hold to see and informs the phone had never been turned back on since I turned it in back in 2016. Also I ask why on earth Verizon would give me a second phone on 1 line? Am I suppose to have 2 phones and 1 number? Does the computer not ask the rep ""Why on earth are you issuing a second phone to the same number?"" My number has never changed with Verizon. Well I am now informed that the silver phone is tied to the ""Account Level"" and the black phone is tied to the actual line. But she assures me once again it will be fixed and she will personally see to it and make sure the credit is issued. Finally I think this is resolved!!! I even pay her all of the past due amount to bring my line current. Keep in mind I have now paid $132 in April to make my phone upgrade eligible in addition to the bill that was due at the time. That money seems to have been sucked into the void which is Verizon's billing department. Stupidly thinking this was fixed I bought the Samsung S3 watch. To top it off the Verizon store I turned my phone into... line disconnected and they seem to be permanently closed.


August 12th 2017: $1005.10 due today or account suspension.

https://imgur.com/a/Uluj4

Of course I call back and ask the lady to please walk me through how on earth I have over a $1000 bill for a dam cell phone. She informs me with some kind of mental gymnastics that the credit for the Silver phone got applied to the S3 watch only leaving me with a $12 credit towards the past due balance. So I ask her to please walk me through how even if I had not paid a single bill since April how it got toe over $1000. Never got a straight answer on that one or she did not understand it either I have no idea. I finally hung up because getting angry at a customer service rep is not going to get me anywhere. 


I have paid Verizon $1151.88 since Jan 1st of 2017. They say I owe them $1005.10. Bringing my total due in 2017 as of August to $2156.93. For a total of $269.61 a month? I cannot make sense of this to save my life and have no idea where else to turn. Am I just stuck with the balance Verizon says that I owe them? I have paid them an average of $143.98 a month in the last 8 months and they say I owe them another $1005! 

I am really sorry if this is the wrong sub and if it is please point me in the direction of a place that could help me with this.

personalfinance,GAP insurance on a brand new $30k car with no money down. Good idea?,"So I read some of the previous post on GAP insurance and although very informative none of them really applied to my exact situation. I purchased a 2017 toyota 86 with no money down at an interest rate of .9%. The salesperson was very easy going and didnt pressure me at all.

When I got to the finance manager he didnt really ask me if I wanted gap insurance as if it was optional, all he did was bring out this sheet with different levels of extended warranty (I believe there was 5 tiers total). He talked to me about all the tiers and said that even the lowest one included gap insurance so thats the one I chose. After choosing the cheapest option he attempted to pressure me into the most expensive option which included gap insurance and an extended warranty on all the electronics. It took me a while of going back and forth with him to get him to cease pressuring me and we went on with the rest of the paperwork.

My question is this: is the GAP insurance a good idea in my particular situation? It cost a total of $829 over the life of the loan. I never purchased a brand new car before and even though I think the gap insurance is a good idea from what I read on PF the sales tactics that the finance manager used kind of concerned me.",finance
personalfinance,"Last month I went on vacation and spent more than I can pay back, should I pay off one card and do a balance transfer, or just part of both cards?","I have one card credit with capitol one that has a balance of -$472, interest rate of say, 20%?

The capitol one card payment is due on the 16th. and The credit union card is due on the 28th.  The balance transfer APR is 4.9% on my credit union card, and there is no fee to do this.

personalfinance,Are all credit cards as difficult to apply for as Chase?,"Hi PF,

I'm pretty frustrated with Chase Bank at the moment and am not sure if I want to even apply for a credit card again. For some background here's everything I've gone through so far.

I applied online for a credit card from Chase and the waiting game began. About a week after I applied, I got a letter in the mail at my parent's house (I still use their address as my permanent/billing address since I graduated college just over a year ago and plan on moving again soon). The letter said that they were unable to verify both my birth date and my address, for some reason they put my mailing address as the address on the application, and that they needed me to fax in a couple of documents for verification. The list of acceptable documents included the following, driver's license, passport, utility/phone bill, birth certificate, government issued ID, etc.

So I scanned my driver's license and my CCW permit and faxed them in. I got another letter from them about a week later saying that they were unable to read the information on the cards that I sent and that I needed to mail them in hard copies of the information. I then scanned my birth certificate and my drivers license, in super high quality and color, and mailed them in; both documents were 100% legible. 

Yesterday I decided to call them instead of waiting on the snail mail to tell me if it was legible or not. After calling them I was informed that the birth certificate was legible but that since it said VOID all over it that it was not acceptable, it's supposed to say void on it when scanned, that's the point and most legal paper documents will have a security feature like that. I ended up faxing them a copy of my vehicle registration that had my address on it along with a 100% scaled color copy of my driver's license and a 200% scaled color copy of my drivers license. I called them again to verify that they had received the documents and they told me that they hadn't received them yet but that I could go to a branch and have them scan the documents in person, he also informed me that the address on the application was my mailing address and not my billing address.

The closest branch to me is 15 miles away but they are opening 3 branches in my city over the next year. I went to the branch this morning when they opened and had them scan in a utility bill that would verify my address, and my drivers license which would verify my birth date. The man that scanned them in said that I should call about 4 hours after it was scanned and verify that they had received the documents. I called them about an hour ago and low and behold they had received the 4th set of documents that I had sent in. BUT, the birth date on the drivers license is still illegible.

I'm absolutely fed up with the incompetence of Chase bank, they've been running me in circles for two weeks now and I'm not doing it anymore. I've been super polite with them every time I deal with someone and haven't been given anything in return, except for difficulty. I guess this post is primarily a vent but I also want to know if all credit cards are this difficult to apply for and deal with? Chase bank will never get a penny of my money and I will tell anyone that asks, that they need to avoid Chase, no point in giving people money that can't even figure out how to read a document.",finance

personalfinance,BK or Debt? Prioritizing?,"I'm 25, I have a good job, I make a decent amount, but I'm still drowning under a lot of bad decisions earlier in my 20s. There might be some emotional links to it - listening to parents thinking things were a good idea, etc, and I've been struggling for a while. Expenses have kept piling up and I'm not sure. My wife already went through a bankruptcy when she was 21 and I'm wondering if that's the way to go for me as well. Except... I want to buy a house, we've been tired of moving every year or so. Anyways.

Income: I make 75k/year + service contract (6k) + side jobs, so around 95k total. She makes 40k/year, month to month, we net 2k and 4.5k respectively; $6.5k per month.

Debts: I have two cars, appx $600 and $700 (BMW, Audi). These are our only modes of transport here in Vegas. She has no credit card debt, but also a horrible credit (Bankruptcy). I have... debt:



10k - BA Cash - 14%; $500 per month

8k - Lending Club (dental) - 0% if I keep up with payoff schedule, otherwise 25%; $500 per month.

5k - Amex - 18.99%; $100 per month

5k - CareCredit (her dental visit) - 0% if I keep up with payoff schedule, otherwise 20%; $250 per month

3k - Chase Freedom - 20%; $200 per month

1k - Barclaycard - 22%; $100 per month

1k - Citi Cash - 20%; $100 per month

2k - Paypal - 0% if I keep up with payoff schedule, otherwise 20%; $250 per month

Bills?

Rent - $1300

Power - $240

Water - $30

Gas - $40

Sewer - $20 ($60 every 3 months)

Trash - $20 ($50 every 3 months)

Car Insurance - $300 (3600 annually)

Renter's Insurance - $120

Internet - $100 (my work covers 40%)

Cellphone - $200 (again, my work covers 40%)

Monthly spending: We spend about $250-$300 a month on groceries, and eat out once a week, around $200 per month. We have a gym membership - $100 between the two of us. 

We don't do much. Unfortunately, things keep happening, just last month I paid for repair on the BMW ($1500) as its out of warranty. That burned through our rainy day fund. The Audi has another year, extended was baked into the purchase price. Another bad thing? Work doesn't pay for travel, I have to book it and submit it for reimbursement after the fact. We don't get a per-diem or anything like that.

I feel buried. We're attacking debt by highest interest rate, keeping up with the 0%, but I kinda want to give up. I don't feel like I've been making ANY progress and I'm living paycheck to paycheck until we can get ourselves free of this. I haven't taken vacation in the last 3 years, cashing out vacation hours for extra pay at the end of the year and I'm starting to get burnt out.

But hey, at least we're afloat?

personalfinance,"Feeling really jerked around by my employer and I am at a loss for what to do. Possible labor law conflicts, raise issues etc.","So I started working for a go-karting facility in Colorado with a similar name to my username back in May of 2016. It originally was meant to be a summer job, they started me at $9/hr while the minimum wage was $8.31. I took a leave of absence while I was up at school, found a different job, realized that one sucked and then went back to the go kart place since they paid more than minimum wage and worked there every other weekend until school was over, then moved my hours up to work every weekend since then.

Colorado passed a law raising the minimum wage up to $9.30 back in November. Everyone who worked there at the time went up to $9.30 on January 1st, but quietly the starting wage for both cashiers and track people went up to $9.50. That's right, some new guy would be making more than someone who had been working there for months.  Eventually through the course of me working there, the entire track staff turned over until it was the track supervisor (who had been there since it opened), me, and one other guy who was hired a few weeks after me who are the most senior members on the track. All employees receive an annual review on the anniversary of their start date. A PM track supervisor position has been open for awhile and would probably have been offered to me if I wasn't literally just about to graduate from college so instead it was offered to another guy. Track supervisors start at around $10.50.

Keep in mind, that review (including his review as well as a bunch of the cashiers) was done back in May. We have yet to hear anything back about any sort of raise whatsoever. It is not necessarily management at my facility's fault either, raises are approved by the regional manager (this place is a chain with over 35 centers in the US). Even my current manager had his review in February and still hasn't heard anything back from upper middle management. 

To top it all off, recently we had a special ""karting academy"" that took place well before we opened. I was scheduled to close the night before and didn't leave until 1 am and was then asked to open for the event at 7:30 am. I was told by one of the guys that this is against a federal labor law that states a service type employee cannot be scheduled for two shifts where the break inbetween the shifts is less than 8 hours but I haven't been able to find anything about this particular law (I haven't had a lot of time to look for it since I'm pretty busy). Anyways, I feel like I'm being pushed around a little even though I've worked here for a long time. The management at my facility is honestly pretty chill, its all upper management who has their heads up their asses. Luckily we will be getting a new regional manager soon and he will be visiting our center by the end of the month. I plan to have a seriously talk with him about how unappreciated me and a bunch of the staff feel. Most of the track staff at the moment are looking to leave as soon as they can anyways.

Is there anything I can say to kick these people in gear? I've been told by my manager we can ask for a retro payment of our approved raise for the time period between the review and when it goes into effect but that it is unlikely to happen. I don't really know how to go about talking to him about all these issues. Do I hold it over his head? I know lower employees never really have a lot of success pushing back against management, especially minimum wage slaves like us. All this nonsense has nearly burned me out on this job and I know for a fact the first question a lot of you will ask is, why not just leave? To be honest, I like the people I work with for the most part, my managers are the most chill people ever and overall, this job is not really all that difficult. Yeah, I should probably think about looking for a job in my field but I'm in a little bit of a limbo at the moment and won't be able to really start looking for a new change in employment for at least a few more months while I finish remaining school stuff (one more class and an internship).

TL;DR: Employer I've worked for a year and a half has not given me a raise, even though minimum wage went above what their previous starting wage was. I've been scheduled for shifts where I only have 6 hours in-between when I am supposed to be there. Upper middle management is changing soon and I am unsure how to go about asking for my rightful raise, whether I can hold the shift issues over their head, etc.",finance

I am on PAYE so I only pay $646 towards my loans a month, while they are accruing $896 in interest per month. 

&amp;nbsp;

Should we continue to tackle highest interest rates first and allow my loans to grow until it's their turn? Would you pay extra on my loans to keep them from growing, and in turn not be able to put as much on highest interest rate debt? Would you refinance any of the federal loans for a lower rate and lose federal protections? Would you transfer credit card balances to a new credit card with 0% interest for X months? We have excellent credit and secure jobs so all of these are possible moves, I just need help figuring out what would be best.

personalfinance,Is it better to pay off my student loans with the highest interest rate before I refinance?,"so I'm looking to refinance my student loans in the near future. I checked out SoFi and the options they gave me were not particularly favorable even though my credit is good and I have a decently paying job. So I tried Earnest, will see what they say.

My real question is the following: next week I will be getting paid a bonus from my work and I plan to pay off a few thousand at once. My servicer now allows me to choose which loan to pay if I choose, so I could pay off a few that have a very high interest rate in full. Is it better to do this before I refinance or should I wait? I already sent in my application with the balance in full so I'd probably have to resubmit it but would that potentially be more beneficial? I don't see how it could be but wanted to double check

personalfinance,Refinance mortgage from fixed into 5/1 ARM?,"Hi PF,

We bought a home two years ago with an extremely low down payment (just graduated from school with few liquid assets); $200,000 30-yr fixed 4% interest rate.  We got good jobs and knew we would be in the area for at least 5 years.  We have ~$10,000 equity in it now, i.e. not much.

Now, two years in, we have saved up a decent amount in our savings account and could afford costs to refinance.  We know that we will definitely sell this house in 3 years, maybe 4 max as we'll be growing our family.  Additionally, in one year, my wife will be having a substantial income increase - i.e. a six-figure salary.  Student loan debt is not very high, and we have no other big debts.  We live very very much within our means and have very good credit scores.

Is it reasonable to refinance into a something like a 5/1 ARM?  I assume this would lower our interest rate substantially, we'd build equity faster, and we'd sell before 5 years negating the risk of the adjustable rates.  There are a lot of articles on refinancing from ARM to fixed, but not so much the other way around.  What about a 15yr fixed, or even just making extra payments on our current mortgage?

Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan pay back - did I make a big mistake?,"Hi all -

I have been aggressively paying back student loans the past two years @ $2500/month. I started at over $100k and I currently have 

$13,500 left of private loans

$24,500 of federal.

My method for paying back has been paying the minimum on all loans, and paying $2500-SUM(MIN of ALL LOANS) on the loan with the highest interest rate.  Now I thought this was the most efficient way to pay off my loans the quickest while paying the least interest.  Playing with some numbers, it seems as though I was wrong.

I am currently paying 2178.93/month to private loans and $321.07/month to federal loans.  When my private loans are finished, I am switching to paying $1000/month on my federal loans.  I will be done with private loans March 2018, and about 24 months after that my federal will be gone.

So current plan is all loans gone March 2020.

If I were to switch my payment to $1500/month at my private loans and $1000/month on my federal, my private loans will be finished in 10 months or June 2018 and my federal will be finished about 26 months from now, or October 2019.  

That's a difference of 6 months.  

If I were to pay $2500/month towards federal loans, I would be completely done with loans 9 months from March 2018, or January 2019. So maybe I was correct in my original repayment method.  I did not consider that I would be changing my repayment from $2500/month to $1000/month after private loans were gone.

Did I mess up?  What could I have done knowing I was going to pay $1000/month on my federal loans eventually? Is there a way to figure out the optimal repay method knowing I want to switch to $1000/month for federal loans? The reason for not continuing to pay $2500/month is to start a savings account @ $1500/month.",finance
personalfinance,1 year update: Resident Physician to Attending Physician,"Hello Everyone, I figured I would do an update from my post from [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4m1ln3/resident_physician_with_400k_medschoolgrad_school).  Although this post will come across as humblebrag, please note this is not my intention! It’s simply therapeutic for me to share with you all, and hopefully help others if they are in the same boat.  

**THE DEBT**

This is kind of embarrassing, but in my initial post, my original debt amount was far higher than I reported.  It was actually 440K federal+ 26K private.  My apologies. I ended up paying off my 26k private loan much sooner than expected. The reason being is that as a variable rate loan, the interest rate doubled from 1.8% to a little over 3.6%.  I decided that it would provide me with a piece of mind to just pay it off completely. The remaining debt is still consolidated, under the PAYE repayment program with average interest rate of 6.8%. Just to reiterate, I am also still enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program as being in residency qualifies (3 years down, 7 more years to go). Although my organization is not a 501c3, it still qualifies since it is a nonprofit and provides public health services. I am still worried that this program will not last, but there remains the likelihood that current enrollees will be grandfathered in if it goes away. I believe October will be the first time any such loans will be forgiven under this program, so we'll see what happens. Again, I have no credit card debt, and pay off everything at the end of the month.

**PERSONAL STUFF AND EXPENSES**

Still not married and have no children.  My paid off car now has 120k miles, and is still running great (although the brakes, rotors, and tire change expenses hurt a little).  I have since discovered the benefits of ""luxury"" outlets, and decided to splurge by buying 4 high-end shirts for $100 :).  I think I spent a grand total of $300 in clothing in the past year. Another shoutout to /r/frugalmalefashion! 2 major trips planned in the next few months, one to the west coast and another to Hawaii. However, airline tickets were free since I had points accumulated through my Southwest and Chase rewards credit cards (see /r/churning for more details).

I reduced expenses:

* I bought my own modem and router which have already paid for themselves, saving me an additional $7/mo in rental fees. My total monthly Internet bill is $30 total for 50/10, and was supposed to go up by $10 this year. I ended up calling my ISP and the representative was more than willing to keep me at the same rate. No cable.  
* I did a little bit of research and decided to go prepaid for my cell phone plan, and went from $75 for unlimited talk, text, and 3GB of data to $55 for the same except with 10GB of data. I have the exact same reception, but with more data and saving $20 a month (no brainer, right??).  
* My apartment building and workplace have free coffee, so that saves me another $20-30 a month.
* I recently paid for a Costco membership, and started to buy meat, toiletries, and other necessities in bulk. I’m still debating if this makes sense financially since I am single.  

**THE JOB**

~~Slight~~ salary bump after my hospital went from RVU based model system to comp based model.  For the layman, this means I am basically salaried and no longer have to worry about meeting milestones to earn my pay. 

**THE BENEFITS/INVESTMENTS**

* 403(b): fully maxed out
* Non-governmental 457: fully maxed out. I understand the risks, but I am willing to take a gamble that my hospital system is stable and not going to go bankrupt anytime soon.  
* 401(a): employer contributed. I won't qualify until next year due to some odd rule that I need to work 1000 hrs per year before I am qualified.  Since I started late, I didn't qualify for a contribution this year    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* Emergency fund: fully funded and spread out between 6 separate Ally No Penalty CDs.  The reason I spread them out is because if I ever need to liquidate one of them, I can just close out each one as needed. 
* Taxable brokerage accounts: Since my tax-sheltered accounts have been maxed out, I opened up brokerage accounts with Schwab and Vanguard. I like the option of having 2 competing companies, as both offer products at great rates. I may also open one with Fidelity as well.  


**THE PLAN FOR THIS COMING YEAR**

1.	Continue with PSLF payments. I want to see what happens after October before deciding to continue with it, or re-financing at a lower rate with a private lender.  
2.	Max out 403b, 457, and backdoor Roth IRA at beginning of 2018. Contribute remaining to taxable brokerage accounts with a goal to save a minimum of 35% of my gross salary annually. 
3.	Start a custodian Roth IRA for my nephew and niece, with the promise that I would match 50% of their contributions once their earned income hits 5500. Unfortunately, through no fault of my parents, financial education was lacking for my family…I want to make sure the next generation doesn’t make the same mistakes we made. 
4.	Avoid lifestyle creep. Unfortunately, having friends in the same field means having friends who have started to splurge on cars and trips.  The pressure is always there: “Dude you can buy a nicer car now”, “Why rent, you can definitely buy a really nice house?!”, “Lets go to dinner every Friday!”.  I’m slowly trying to change them to see my point of view, but it’s difficult to change their opinions sometime. Ah well, I’ll keep trying.

personalfinance,Finalized Chapter 7 bankruptcy end of 2015. Have two credit cards I use to rebuild my credit. Thinking about closing one of them. Thoughts?,"So back in 2015, after almost 2 years of unemployment and 6 of my credit cards at their max (medical bills separated between them) and no way to even pay the minimum, I filed for a chapter 7 bankruptcy. I got an entry level job a few months later and I’m in a better place now. 

Luckily the federal credit union bank I had a checking account with for over 6 years was willing to approve me for a $500 credit card to help rebuilt my credit. It’s a regular card, not a secured. Very low interest, like 12%. A year later they increased the limit to $2000 because I had made payments on time and been with my company for a while.

The job I work for has their own federal credit union and their credit cards have great rewards/benefits. I saw them to get a secured card for $500 and they said after a year of paying on time and working a steady job, they’d turn it into a regular credit card and release my secured deposit. Well, after a year of doing just that.. they denied me for a transition to a regular card and my $500 is still on hold. And the rep told me that whoever told me they could transition me to a regular card gave me wrong information.

Since my bankruptcy, my credit card with the $2000 is technically my first credit card, followed by my $500 work credit union secured card. I don’t even work with that company anymore though and I really want to keep it. I’m thinking of calling them and telling them to close that card and release my deposit.

Would this be a good idea? I know it’ll show as a negative point on my post-bankruptcy record but I figure I’ll just keep my other credit card for the next 8 years, just increasing the limit (but not more than 30% of it and only using knowing I have the cash to pay for whatever I’m putting on it). I’ll rebuild my credit that way.

personalfinance,Due to delays in paperwork I will not be receiving financial aid for this passed summer semester. What are my options? [18M],"Background: I am a recent high school graduate attending a state university, I completed my summer semester classes but my fasfa required extra documentation for verification, as I was randomly selected as such. It required some ordered paperwork from the IRS, which did not reach the school in time for the federal deadline and so the school told me recently that I am out of options, this would be less of an issue if the school was also not attempting to charge me out-of-state fees for my tuition.

My wife and I have a combined total of $56k in student loans. Some parent plus and some fedloans.

personalfinance,Worth it to refinance my mortgage?,"I bought my house 2 years ago for $225,000 with a 30 year mortgage at 4.125% with 5% down. The market here has been quite good, at the time I bought it zillow said my house was worth $225k and now zillow says $256k. I know this is not exactly accurate but is a rough idea of value going up. 

I currently owe $205k. I'm paying PMI of $80 a month currently. If the house is now worth $256k I'm *right* on the threshold of 80% LTV depending on where an appraisal came in. On top of that I took credits when I bought the place to cut down on closing costs so my interest rate was a bit higher and refinancing could cut that down. My credit score is like 810 so I should qualify for top tier rates. 

So is it worth it? What I'm contemplating is refinancing down to 20 year mortgage. That should put me at 3.5 - 3.75% interest rates. Depending on where an appraisal comes in I should be able to get rid of the PMI payment too, chipping in a little cash as needed. But there are closing costs and fees too, and I have no idea how to shop around for the best rate (when I bought the house, I basically just went to my credit union and had them do everything). 

So I'm wonder if this seems like it's worth doing, how much it might cost to refinance, and how I would go about finding a good lender with good rates, any advice welcome!",finance

I'm 20, going into my 4th year of undergraduate study, will probably go an extra year, and receive minimum wage.

personalfinance,"About to finish residency training, could use some advice on debt and saving","Hi all, 

First time poster motivated by an earlier post by a new attending physician just out of training. I will be finishing fellowship training and starting a full-time attending position in less than one year and feel that it's better late than never to start wrapping my head around my financial situation and how best to move forward with the debt I've accrued during training. Though I'm not sure of what the salary and specific benefits will be, my former training program was highly interested in hiring me back to the point where they wanted me to commit before fellowship (I didn't but know that hospitals in the area have a similar salary structure). In which case, I will be using the salary and benefits from that hospital.

Me: 
Just married, no children. Living in a major coastal city with high cost of living. Wife makes a very good living and easily makes over six figures with salary. I am fortunate enough that a lot of living costs (rent, bills, food) are defrayed by her earnings, but am aware of debt to the point where I will not spend frivolously. For the sake of this post, I wanted to just limit it to paying off the debt. 

Debt: Approx 260k federal (all medical school, essentially all of which are at 6.8% interest rate and a tiny amount at 3.28%) and 83k private (66k at 4.58% and 17k at 3.78%). I have been on IBR for the federal loans since late 2012 (approx $520 per month) and have been paying the private loan monthly ($620). A large amount of interest had accrued early and so I've paid essentially as much interest (15k) as I have principal (16k). I obviously don't make enough money to do anything other than pay off a small chunk of interest that accrues on my federal loans each month. I have 0 credit card debt and pay off my bill every month.

Job: Will be approx 275k base based off of my friends who had started at a similar position at the same hospital. 

Benefits: I know the current investment options are a 401a, 403b and 457. 

PSFL: I've made the mistake of not applying for PSFL during my training for my federal loans and am wondering if applying now would allow me to apply the 5+ years of monthly payment to apply to the 10 year period until forgiveness for working at a non-profit institution. 

Any advice would be more than welcome. Not the most financially literate person (sadly) but now's a better time than never to start getting a handle on all of this.",finance

personalfinance,We took on an enormous amount of medical debt after life changing accident. Now we're trying to rebound/rebuild.,"TLDR because this turned out insanely long: My fiancé is suddenly disabled. We went from no debt to almost $20,000 in credit card really quickly. Need to not be in that much debt anymore.

About a year ago my fiancé was helping a friend and fell off a ladder which left him partially paralyzed. We used all our savings and a lot of our credit keeping things afloat. We've looked into our legal options and we got a small settlement from friend's homeowners insurance but not a lot. We have finally stopped the bleeding (so to speak) but we need a plan for digging ourselves out of debt. I work for a small, local funeral home as a funeral director. I love my job very much and it is very fulfilling, but my company and the industry in general isn't doing well and, as such, I don't make very much money. This was plenty before, but it isn't cutting it now. I am aggressively looking for another higher paying job. My fiancé was working as a chef in a restaurant so he most likely won't be able to return to work anytime soon. We aren't opposed to moving, but we bought a house 2 years ago and I think selling would not be he best financial choice for us. Plus we really really really really love our house. It was supposed to be our forever home. He was recently approved for disability. He lives with a lot of pain and that prevents him from doing pretty much anything. He has really good doctors and was recently approved for Medicare so we hope that he continues to heal enough to go back to work. He is in therapy and there are resources in our city that will help him train or prepare for a new quadriplegic-friendly job when he is well enough. He had really good health insurance when he had his accident, so we were only responsible for about $20,000 of medical bills, out of well over $1mil (my estimate based of the bills and those benefit summary things the insurance company sends after each appointment). 


Income:
I make $11 an hour plus commission and usually work approximately 45 hours per week. My commission fluctuates wildly between $50-$1000 per month, so I've tried to make our budget with as little commission as possible. The last 3 years I averaged about $28,000 per year, approximately $1,500 per month take home is what I can usually count on per month.


My fiancé makes $1,150 in disability payments and does some odd jobs when he feels up to it. We can count on approximately $400 a month from his odd jobs. He can only make up to $600 a month to stay on disability and Medicare.


Debt:

$9,900 remaining in a personal loan from Lending Club. This is all medical bills and some expenses we put on credit cards to survive. The monthly payment is $365.00 for about 25 more months.

$3,500 credit card balance at 19% interest. The minimum payment is $100. We had no credit card debt before the accident, so this is all medical bills and other related expenses.

$2800 at 0% interest (for 18 more months). The minimum payment is $80 per month. 

$25,000 car loan at 0% interest. Minimum is $260 per month. Underwater most like or just barely breaking even if I'm lucky. Fiancé owns his truck outright and it's worth about $2,000. 

$9,000 student loan. My parents took this loan out for my schooling. I'm not sure of the interest, but I am responsible for $50 a month per an agreement with my parents. I could drop this payment if I had to as my parents pay the minimum plus a little bit but I would like to continue paying if possible.a

I owe $4,000 to my parents because times got kinda desperate there for a while. They could care less if I ever pay them back but I would like to. They have been great to us during our hard time and I just feel like we owe them at least that.

Other expenses:

Mortgage: $630 per month (includes home insurance and property taxes). Interest rate is 3.3%. We have 28 years left of a 30 year FHA mortgage. Very little upkeep.

Car+Life Insurance: $160 per month. His life insurance is $30 a month (former smoker). Mine is only $12 a month. My line of work has made me extremely overly cautious about insurance. I've seen a lot of really tragic shit. I shopped around a lot for car insurances rates and this is about as good as it will get for us without going to one of those sketchy places. He has liability only and I have the full coverage.
 
Water/electric/trash: Approximately $180 per month. We are on level billing, so it doesn't fluctuate more than a couple bucks a month. Our house was gutted and completely renovated before we bought it, so all the appliances, windows, a/c blah blah blah are about 3 years old and energy star rated. We recently took advantage of a free energy efficiency program our electric company offered so we have already seen a savings of about $30 a month from just that. 

Internet: Averaging about $75 a month due to data caps (fuck you Suddenlink). They are our only option for internet unless we did hotspots or something like that. We live in a rural are where cell reception is not the best so I don't know if anything else if feasible.

DirectTV: $85 per month. 10 months left under contract. We could drop it after 10 months if we had to, but it is my fiancés only source of entertainment because he is home alone almost all the time.

2 Cell phones and an iPad: $180 per month. Under contract until January. We own our devices outright so we plan on looking for cheaper options at the beginning of the year. I've done a little price shopping and I think we can cut it down to about $100 a month at that time. I've looked into the service providers that will buy you out of their contract but they have an extremely limited presence in our rural area.

HBOGo: $15 a month. We are TV fanatics. We are currently experimenting with a firestick + kodi app to see if we can drop this.

Gas: We average about $100 a month. 

Food/Cleaning Supplies/Toiletries/OTC medicines and medical supplies: Averaging about $600 a month. Because of my fiancé's disability, we spend spend more on cleaning supplies and medical supplies than most. I'd say about $250 of the $600 is stuff relating to his medical issues. None of it is covered by insurance.

Prescription and dr. visit co-pays: $500 per month. He takes A LOT of medicine. 

Dog food/preventative meds/annual checkups $70 per month. 2 dogs, 3 &amp; 7 years old. Low maintenance puppers.

We spend maybe $100 on clothes/entertainment and that's estimating generously.


We've looked into food-stamps, but I don't qualify for anything and he qualified for like $12 a month. He is doing too good health-wise to qualify for any in-home assistance, so that takes up the majority of my free time. No friends or family nearby. Like I said earlier, we are not opposed to moving but I'm thinking it would probably be cheaper to not move since we just bought our house. We have been able to save about $100. We have about $1,000 worth of stuff around the house we could sell and not miss. I have maybe $1,000 in a 401k.

This turned out to be way longer than I originally intended but writing everything was kind of cathartic. Until I can find a higher paying job, I need some ideas to make money during my free time. I'm not really good at anything and especially not anything profitable.  

We also need some help navigating any financial assistance programs that may be available that we don't know about. At this point we'll take what we can get.

I guess the biggest thing I need help with is adjusting to our new life. We had just about gotten ourselves set up to live a pretty comfortable life before it all fell apart. Pre-accident, we lived a cheap but active life. We grew a lot of food in our garden which also served as the bulk of our entertainment. Hiking and kayaking were our other hobbies and they were basically free. We are kind of stir crazy and out of ideas for low cost, low activity hobbies other than TV. We have no idea how to grocery shop and meal plan so we could use help there. We used to plan our meals based on the scraps the fiancé brought home from work. 

We are in our late 20's and live in Arkansas if that helps. Thank you.

The question: one of our credit cards has offered us 0% APR for a year with a balance transfer. This is also the card with the lower APR. We could  transfer the balance from the other card (higher interest rate) and have the 0% APR until my wife gets back to work and we have income coming to pay the card down. 
Neither of us have done a balance transfer in the past. Is it worth it? Am I missing something in the fine print? It feels to good to be true. Does it hurt your credit score?",finance

Men walk past an electronic board showing market indices outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan, March 2, 2016.Thomas Peter

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks bounced on Monday after three losing sessions, tracking a firmer Wall Street, while the dollar was weighed down by tensions on the Korean peninsula and weak U.S. inflation data which dampened prospects of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike later this year.

Overall reaction was subdued to Monday's Chinese data which were generally weaker than forecast, and reinforced views that the world's second-largest economy is starting to lose a bit of steam as lending costs rise and the property market cools.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was up 0.7 percent. The index had fallen for three straight days previously, losing a combined 3 percent, on escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea.

Australian stocks rose 0.5 percent and South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 climbed 0.4 percent.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng .HSI was up 0.8 percent and Shanghai .SSEC added 0.2 percent.

China's factory output in July grew 6.4 percent from a year earlier, short of the 7.2 percent forecast, while fixed-asset investment expanded 8.3 percent in the first seven months against expectations for growth of 8.6 percent.

Geopolitical risks were expected to remain a key theme for the global markets in the near term, as North Korea celebrates Liberation Day on Tuesday to mark the end of Japanese rule.

Investors also braced for tensions ahead of Aug. 21, when an annual joint U.S.-South Korean military exercise is due to begin.

""Due to caution towards a further escalation in tensions over North Korea, U.S. yields and equities are expected to decline and the yen is likely keep appreciating this week,"" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.

Japan's Nikkei .N225 bucked the trend and fell 1 percent as a stronger yen overshadowed much better-than-expected second quarter economic growth.

The three major U.S. stocks indexes snapped three days of losses and ended higher on Friday, as investors bet on slower U.S. rate hikes following weaker-than-expected consumer price data. But gains were muted by increasingly aggressive exchanges between Washington and Pyongyang. [.N]

U.S. Treasury yields, which already declined on the North Korean concerns, fell further on Friday on the soft U.S. consumer prices data. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR touched 2.182 percent on Friday, its lowest since late June, before pulling back a little to 2.204 percent on Monday.

Friday's data showed the U.S. consumer price index edged up just 0.1 percent last month after it was unchanged in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.2 percent in July.

The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was flat at 93.076 .DXY after it slipped about 0.4 percent on Friday.

The greenback traded slightly higher at 109.370 yen JPY= after slipping to 108.720 on Friday, its weakest since April 20.

The yen tends to gain in times of geopolitical tension on expectations that Japanese investors will repatriate assets.

It also showed little reaction to second-quarter gross domestic product data which revealed that the economy expanded for a sixth straight quarter led by private consumption and capital expenditure.

While growth was faster than expected, it is not expected to nudge the Bank of Japan into dismantling its massive stimulus program any time soon, as inflation remains stubbornly weak.

The euro was 0.1 percent higher at $1.1824 EUR=.

Crude oil prices edged down after rising slightly on Friday on lower U.S. crude stocks, instability in major producer Nigeria and strong global demand growth. [O/R]

U.S. crude CLc1 was down 2 cents at $48.80 a barrel and Brent LCOc1 was 7 cents lower at $52.03 a barrel.

Gold hovered near a two-month high, benefiting from the U.S.-North Korean tensions and Friday's weak U.S. inflation data. The dollar's recent weakness was also seen to be helping gold.

Spot gold XAU= was a shade lower at $1,287.51 an ounce after reaching $1,291.86 on Friday, its highest level since June 7.

Other precious metals such as silver XAG= and platinum XPT= were also buoyant.

personalfinance,1st position heloc for mortgage,"Hey personal finance.

I reciently became aware of a strategy to pay off your mortgage much faster then normally would be possible if your able to stick to the strategy.

The idea goes, you refinance your home into a HELOC.  You then put ALL of your money you earn into that account.  You use the heloc like a credit card to pay your bills.  If you do all these things, the amount of interest you pay will be much less and you will build equity much faster. 

Supposedly you can take a 30 year mortgage and pay it off in 7-10 years without changing your lifestyle.

Does anyone have any knowledge if this is true?  I feel like I would have no trouble to stick to the strategy.

A bit of background.  My house I bought it 12 years ago for $535k.  So far I have managed to pay it down to $427k.  I'm guessing if it were to be apprased it would come in at 650k - 700k (maybe more I have put a lot of work into it) I'm in a 30 year loan modification loan that goes up 1% interest rate per year until it hits 5%.  Currently, i'm at 4%.  

I own a business and am currently drawing about 150k a year out of the business.  

Am I making sense and has anyone heard of this before?  edit- found a block that kind of describes the strategy. http://natalimorris.com/blog/2016/01/06/save-thousands-with-heloc/

investing,"What monetary policy instruments would be available to central banks in the event of another crash, and how effective could they be?","Was talking to my mother the other day about how central banks would deal with another crisis. She thinks they've already played all their trump cards and are basically out of ammo at this point.

I feel like this probably isn't true but I don't really know why. On the face of it, rates can't go much lower, and they've already done a lot of QE that they are struggling to unwind. 

from the BoE:

&gt; at the zero lower bound there is no clear distinction between monetary and fiscal policy. But it is still important to ensure that central banks do not take on to their balance sheets risks to the taxpayer that are properly matters that should be decided by elected politicians. To ensure price stability in the long run it is
vital to maintain the operational independence of a central bank. Any decisions that put taxpayers’ money at risk must be made by finance ministries, and central banks must protect their balance sheets by imposing appropriate haircuts on collateral, and avoiding the purchase of risky private-sector assets

Fiscal policy is another thing obviously but I think the governments of a lot of developed nations are not ideally placed to make effective and decisive calls on fiscal policy at the moment.

Can someone who knows a bit more about macroeconomics explain what's in the central banks' playbooks to deal with another recession or crisis if one does come? Are they (relatively speaking) well prepared for these events or not?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Critical updates you need to know about in crypto,"Say you are a busy person and you only have time to check up on what is happening in crypto once a week, once a month, or maybe even less times (and even if you can do it daily and don't monitor everything it is easy to miss stuff), but you at least want to be in the loop if something critical has happened that needs your attention. My hope is that this section will be that with the help of us all, and that people will post things here that are very important to know about so if you would go to one place to keep yourself updated on what has happened that is very important to know, this would be the place. 

For example I have seen 4 such critical things over the last months:


- The first was the potential fork on august 1 and that you needed to prepare for it and potentially move your BTC to a wallet you controlled to be safe depending on what would happen.

- The second one was the Bitcoin Cash split. It would have been important to know that Bitcoin Cash would be airdropped to Bitcoin holders so that you at least knew about it and could prepare or take advantage of this situation to get your Bitcoin Cash.

- The third one is the wallet migration for the IOTA wallet. I was totally unaware and just by accident surfed into the IOTA reddit section to find out you need to migrate over your seed to a new released wallet.

- The forth was that Antshares changed their name to NEO, and that you now can/should download their new NEO wallet and import your Antshares into it.


These sort of critical updates that are important to know is what this section is for (of course all might apply or not apply to you specifically if you don't hold a particular coin the update is affecting), and it would be great if people could post things here like this. I am sure I have missed many updates, maybe there have been other wallets etc that needs to be upgraded or migrated for other coins in the past months, or maybe there is a coin that is discontinued and you need to convert it on their site to another coin etc etc.

Please post such thing here now and in the future that you think would be important for other people to know!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Worth it to take a 401k loan to pay off credit card debt?,"I'm 37 and honestly never been very responsible with money. I've come to realize that my situation needs to change. My wife and I spent the last two years working on our finances and have recently been able to buy our first house after too many years of throwing money away on rent. We've worked hard to get where we are and now we are trying to get the majority of our debt paid off.

I only have about $4k in my 401k(divorce, poor decisions, etc.). I also have about $1300 in credit card debt that I'd like to pay off. The interest rate is much better on the 401k loan (About 23% vs 5%) and all that interest would go back to myself but I'm not sure how much of a hit I would take in lost market gains.

I'm not really able to pay much more than the minimum payment on the cards and I'm a little tired of seeing almost half of that payment get charged back in interest every month.

In addition to the weekly pre-tax payment for the 401k loan I would also dedicate what I'm paying on the cards each month back to it to pay it off sooner. I'm not too worried about frivolously charging them back up because I've had them near maxed out so long I don't even think about having them. They've already been tossed in a drawer with the intent of having them for emergencies in the event that we can ever get them paid off.

So is this a good idea or should I keep plugging away as I have been?",finance

""Thanks for your interest in renting my house, I am looking for a tenant to rent my single family home, I relocated to Connecticut after having a surgery to live with my family and help me raise my kids. I listed the house for sale with a Realtor but I realized that the real estate market here is rebounding tremendously and keeping my property rather than selling it would be likely very rewarding to me.

It will also worked out well for the landlord and Tenant not to go through a Realtor  because it saves a property manager fee, this will make the rent more cheaper and affordable Plus a management company does not give any personal attention to the home.  I am just another number in their management files.

PLEASE NOTE: You can only driveby the house as I don't have anyone to show the inside of the house, I will send both inside and outside pictures with the address and application to you if you are still interested.

Pets are allowed

I did drive by the house and get out and look at the property. It is indeed empty and there was a realtor sign in the front yard. The email I just got today is where I'm starting to doubt things a little more, but again, I really want this to be real because I don't know how I'm going to afford most of the other listings I've found.

personalfinance,Housing down payments 101,"So you want to buy a house, eh?  Here's some information that can help with that pesky [down payment](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/down-payment-1.aspx): how much do you need, and where should you get it?  This is for US audiences. and assumes you are buying a personal residence.  Note that this is intended as an overview, and doesn't cover every possible option or alternative available, especially locally to you or specific to your situation.  This writeup assumes  you are qualified for a loan in other ways, such as credit history.

**The basics.**  Lenders want you to have your own money at risk in a house purchase, thus the down payment, which forms your initial equity.    20% of the price is a popular target; this gives the lender a cushion in the event they need to foreclose, since you will take the first 20% of the loss in foreclosure.  

Most [conventional](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/conventional-fha-va-mortgage.aspx) (i.e. non-government-backed) mortgages will require [Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-private-mortgage-insurance-en-122/) if you don't put 20% down; usually you need at least 5%, though.  That's not the end of the world, but it's an added cost to you, so we'll look at that shortly.  Note that there are some conventional mortgages with reduced / eliminated PMI, but they are limited to certain lenders or situations.  Most people won't have those options.   Since 2/3 of mortgages  are conventional, we'll spend more time discussing how down payments and PMI work for these type of loans.  

Alternatively,  the government guarantees other mortgage products, including FHA, VA and USDA loans, that have [reduced down payment requirements](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/4-mortgages-that-require-little-money-down-1.aspx); the government assumes some of the risk, allowing a reduced down payment, and gets you to pay the rest of it in various ways.   You have to be a veteran for a  VA loan, and only certain ruralish locations are eligible for [USDA loans](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/mortgages/usda-loan/) (and the best deals are for people with low income), but if those work for you, those are good options with 0% (!) down payment.   [FHA loans](https://www.fha.com/fha_article?id=210) are more of a mixed blessing because you end up paying  their version of PMI, called [MIP](https://themortgagereports.com/7570/fha-mip-cancel); down payments on FHA mortgages start at 3.5%.  

**How much should you put down?**  That's easy, right? 20%?  Well, maybe not.    The [average down payment](http://realtormag.realtor.org/daily-news/2017/02/15/big-down-payment-myth ) in 2016 was 11% across all types of mortgages, so plenty of conventional mortgages are written with less than 20% down.  You just pay extra through PMI for the privilege of the bank taking on more risk.  

You have three main ways of [paying PMI](http://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/options-paying-private-mortgage-insurance/): 

- As an added fee to your monthly payment, usually about .5% to 1% of the house price / year, paid monthly, but it varies based on down payment and credit score;

- As a higher interest rate (perhaps .25% more) for the life of your loan, so-called lender-paid PMI (but you really pay it anyway);

- As a one-time [lump sum](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/what-is-single-payment-mortgage-insurance).  You pay something like 3% of the house price up front in lieu of monthly surcharges.  Unlike a down payment, this doesn't go towards your equity.

So, you have options.  The monthly surcharge PMI can be [eliminated](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/removing-private-mortgage-insurance.aspx) once you pay down the principal of your loan to below 80% of your original purchase price.  That could take a while if you make minimum payments with a small down payment, but if your income grows, you could be in a position to eliminate PMI within a few years.  While paying down a mortgage isn't always the best use of money, paying enough to eliminate PMI is typically more rewarding and worth the effort.  

(Some mortgages also allow you to eliminate PMI if your house appreciates enough to make your equity 20%+, but that's not universal and will require you to do some work and pay some fees.)

The exact amount you put down depends on your specific situation; try for 20% if you can do it, since it will give you better financing options.   You will also pay less monthly with a larger down payment.  You probably won't get a better interest rate with a bigger down payment &gt; 20%, so that's not something to plan for.  

**Where should you get the money?**  The down payment should be your money, so, ideally, you want to save up for this over time.   A typical nationwide house price might be $250,000, so 20% down would be $50,000; if you saved $1000/month, you could do that in about four years.   (And, yes, in many places houses cost much, much more.  Adjust accordingly.)   But, that's a lot of savings, and that's a long time.  So, what else can you do?

**Gifts** from relatives are a very popular option, actually.  Lenders are used to these and like them.  There is typically no gift tax if your parents  give you $20,000 or even $50,000 as a down payment.  Problem solved, for those lucky enough to have this as an option.  Note that loans from relatives are not the same and not nearly as cool.  You will usually need to document that money from relatives is a gift and not a stealth loan.  If your relatives sell you their house for less than market value, this is also treated a down payment gift, a so-called [gift of equity](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/for-wiki-how-to-give-equity-as-a-gift.aspx).

**Special programs** exist in certain places to give homebuyers, especially first-time buyers for some definition of first-time, some assistance with their down payment.  (Sometimes ""first-time"" just means ""didn't own a house recently."") You might not know about the [Good Neighbor Next Door](https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/reo/goodn/gnndabot) program that helps municipal employees in certain cities get a big discount on their homes.   That's an example of program you probably don't qualify for, but there could be something local to you that you do qualify for, e.g. in [Ohio](http://myohiohome.org/firsttimehomebuyer.aspx) or [Austin, TX](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/down-payment-assistance) or various other places.  Look around at what's available in your state, and in cities near you.  Sometimes these are low-cost loans; other times they are grants, especially for low-income households.   Not everybody has these, though.  Many people don't have any good options here.  

**Retirement accounts**  This is an option, but not an ideal one.  Most people retire one day, so that's a higher priority than buying a house.  If you are convinced you want to do this, your best options are either a [401k loan](https://themortgagereports.com/18789/should-you-borrow-from-your-401k-to-purchase-a-home-gina-pogol),  or a distribution from an IRA.   Roth contributions are the best way to do this not-so-good idea.  You can also tap IRA gains up to $10,000 without penalty once in a lifetime, but you may owe taxes on the money.

**Another loan**  You can borrow part of your downpayment with a so-called [piggyback loan](https://mymortgageinsider.com/80-10-10-piggyback-mortgage/).  You still come up with part of the money yourself, but then borrow enough additional in a second mortgage to eliminate PMI.  You then have two loans to pay back.  It's an option, but not usually your best option.

**Where to save for your down payment?**  Many people coming to this forum want to ""put their money to work"", and especially for a house down payment.  But, sadly, your money is not very ambitious, and won't work very hard for you in typical down-payment-size amounts and timetables.   If you are saving for a house purchase within five years, you don't want to put your money at risk of a 20% stock market correction that will inevitably occur just before you need the money.   Your contributions will dominate any interest or earnings over a short timetable, so just use something that pays interest without principal risk.  (Unless you really do want to risk your down payment.  Most people don't.)

So there is some basic information about down payments.   If you have specific questions, let me know and I will try to answer them and update this.  See also closing costs here: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6tu91h/buyers_closing_costs_101/",finance

investing,How would you hedge against a recession in the current environment?,"So full disclosure, this is **NOT** a discussion on timing the market, or predicting when a crash might occur. Nobody is good at predicting a crash, and time in the market generally beats out time out of the market waiting for a correction. 

However, from the perspective of portfolio allocation, this is a worthwhile discussion. Traditionally, being 30-50% in bonds in a bull market can save you a lot of headaches when a major recession occurs, and will provide you the ability to sell off your bonds as they reach high prices during the height of a recession to purchase equities for very cheap.

I'm not an expert, but I've seen a decent amount of writing that the bond market is somewhat over-valued. I currently own a portion of long-term bonds, but I'm not entirely sure how useful these would be in the **current** environment if a correction would occur. Given the low central bank interest rates we currently see, the traditional policy of lowering interest rates to stimulate economic growth during a recession probably will not be quite as strong as it has in the past. So with that in mind, are government bonds still a strong hedge in your portfolio if a recession were to occur?

Would gold be a better commodity to place into your portfolio right now? Are there any other safe haven assets that are not liabilities to own in the current environment (such as a short position) that would likely perform well during a recession?",finance

personalfinance,Help with which direction to go with debt vs savings,"I posted this in FI and thought I might get some helpful answers here as well. 
Been trying to read as much as possible. I'm way behind in savings because I've been trying to live like the joneses. I currently make $120k/year. 35 YO with a family of 4. Have 3 outstanding debts. 70k on personal debt. 200k student loan. 200k mortgage. My plan is to pay off the 70k in 2 years.

Then my question becomes which to tackle next. The student loan is a PSFL that at my current payment I will pay off 100k at the end of 10 years. Basically wiping away the other 100k of that debt.

Should I work on paying the mortgage off first and let the student loan ride for ten years or work on paying off the entire 200k?

Interest rate is 4.25% on SL and 3.95 on mortgage.

Annual expenses- Who knows.like I said live like the Joneses. Want to get it down to as low as possible. Trying to read up as much as possible to figure out a good number.

401k- 65k. Currently at 6% (I know, needs to be more)with company matching half mine up to 7%.
Personal Loan is 0% interest thankfully.(Used to pay off upside down house).

Don't have HSA. Looking at switching my regular ins to HSA when enrollment comes.

Home value is 275k

personalfinance,Credit inquiry for a mortgage pulled a WAY lower score than I was expecting... Is this normal?,"I just went in to see a loan officer for my upcoming mortgage and my jaw hit the floor when he pulled my credit. I've been monitoring my credit pretty regularly with Credit Karma and Experian, which led me to think my credit score was around 699. When the bank did the pull, my median score was about 30 points lower than I thought it would be, causing me to get hit with an interest rate that was much higher than I expected.

Everything else they asked me about was good as far as income, business ownership, no outstanding debt, no defaults, etc. And there's nothing negative on my credit report, it's just fairly young.

Because even half a percent can make a difference of thousands of dollars on a mortgage, I'd like to know a) Is there anything I can do about getting a better rate? And b) if not, is refinancing an option once I build a more reliable credit history?",finance
personalfinance,Should I try to pay off student loans quickly even if I can refinance?,"I have about 150k in federal loans with interest ranging from 5.5 to 6.5%.

I just realized that I am able to refinance my loans to a ~3% variable rate, 5 year plan. Even if I proceed with my original plan of dumping the majority of a year's salary into the refinanced loans (no penalty for early repayment), I would be saving several thousand dollars by refinancing.

However, my question now is since the new interest rate is 3% which is no longer ""moderate interest"" according to the flow chart, would I be crazy for sticking to my original plan? Should I now backtrack and try to max out my 403b and retirement savings, and go ahead and take the full 5 years to pay back my loans?",finance
personalfinance,Consolidating Debt (Advice),"Hello, I have some credit card debt and a remaining balance on a personal loan. What are the best options for my scenario to consolidate these into a better rate or plan to pay off? I have a mortgage at as well, but I am concerned about the CC and Loan. Thanks in advance.  


My Debt:
$24,000 on a credit card at 14.24% (minimum payment $510 monthly) Try to pay at least $600.
$6,500 remaining on a personal installment loan through my bank at 6.5% (minimum payment $284 monthly) I used this to buy a motorcycle a few years ago.
(My monthly mortgage is $2,250 (includes tax,impounds, HOA) at 3.5% interest rate)  


So I would need about $30,000 to get out of these two ongoing expenses. I feel like even though I am paying slightly more than the minimums I just cannot get ahead.  


My income is$4,000 per month after taxes.  


A few options I was thinking of are:  


1. 5 year loan against 401k. The rate would be 3.75%. I would take out $30,000 out of a current 401k balance of $120k. These payments would be taken out biweekly of my paycheck after taxes, and would be a payment of $250. So, $500 per month.


2. Take out a fixed second on my home. I have $300,000 in equity.  


3. Refinance at what would be higher interest rate and extend my mortgage to a new 30 y fixed. That would extend the new loan about 6 years as I have been paying on it since 2011.  


I know I need to go through the whole budgeting thing as so many advise on here. I plan to do that. However, in the meantime are the options I listed any good for my purposes of getting out of high rate debt service I am continuing to pay every month? Any advice would be great and why an option may be better for this scenario or maybe something I have not thought of.

personalfinance,Paying off loans or cashing out a retirement account?,"Hey r/personalfinance, my question is about paying off student loans vs retirement savings.  I am 29 and make 56k/yr.  I have approximately 35k in loans at varying interest rates, none over 5%.  I do have one set of loans that has a 200/mo payment and this is my highest interest rate loan.  My goal is to get rid of this 200/mo payment (3600 remaining) so I can free that amount up apply that towards other loans.  Car is paid off and I carry no credit card debt so the student loans are my focus.

The dilemma comes in that I have a retirement account from an old job that has about $3000 in it.  Should I roll this $3000 over into a Roth IRA or other account OR should I just cash this out and use it to pay towards this loan?  I realize there will be taxes on this money if I take it out and I won't get the full $3000.  This money is just sitting there and not invested in anything so I need to get it out of its current state and apply it somewhere.

personalfinance,Can someone explain NACA to me? I am looking to buy a house and it seems to good to be true.,"My wife and I are looking to buy a house in about a year and I just heard about a program called NACA.

personalfinance,How best to adjust 401k vs mortgage,"So, I'll start with a brief overview of my current situation. I'm almost 30, bought a home a couple years back, but below the 20% wonderful PMI avoiding threshold. Currently I'm paying an extra 25% on my monthly mortgage payment directly to the principal balance to help increase my equity above the 20% marker so that I can stop wasting extra money each month.  

Currently I'm contributing 15% to my 401k which puts me about $4k away from maxing out my IRS limits of $18k. I figure to hit that mark it would take me roughly contributing another 4%.  

Here's where I'd like some thoughts...so my loan interest rate against the home is 4%, it'll take me roughly another 2.5 years at the rate I'm going to remove the PMI, but am I doing myself more damage trying to remove that monthly nuisance when I should focus on bumping up my 401k instead? My 401k at the end of this year should be around 1x my current salary. I believe they say as a measure you should try to aim for 2x by the time you're 35? So, should I instead invest more into my 401k and not pay off my home as aggressively?   

I also should have student loans paid in roughly a year which should free a bit of money considering I've been paying extra against them for quite a while now, so if both are significantly important, I should be able to adjust things in the near future to compensate any fall out of making an adjustment now as well.",finance
personalfinance,"Bigger house down payment, or pay off student loans?","My wife currently has about $20k in student loans that we have left to pay off, and as we're wanting to start a family soon, we have begun looking at houses (very early stages). Upon hearing this, my parents said that they have $25k set aside to help us out, so now I'm trying to figure out which is the better option.

Option 1: use most/all of that money towards a downpayment on a house, continue paying student loans off normally

Option 2: pay off student loans completely (6.8% interest) and have much less to put towards a home.

Obviously a mortgage will have a lower interest rate, but I haven't figured out if having the additional months of PMI from having less equity would offset any interest that I would save.

Is there any rule of thumb in these types of scenarios?

EDIT: Went ahead and crunched the numbers myself. Looks like over the life of the student loans I'll end up paying $3,521 in additional interest (making minimum payments). Using .5% as a PMI rate, I'd end up paying an additional $3,643 in extra months of PMI, so there's no clearcut winning option here.",finance

Hello r/personalfinance,

I just started my first post-college career job and should have about $2900/month coming in (after taxes) and $1700/month going out (before discretionary spending). 

I owe right at $50,000 on my student loans with an average interest rate of about 5.5%. I want to start paying them off, but do not want to short-change myself with regard to investing. 

My employer will contribute about $4500/year to a 403(b) on my behalf (university benefits for the win) without my having to contribute anything to get it. However, I would still like to start funding a roth and I don't think it wise to wait 10 years to start it (length of time it should take to pay my loan off). 

I am not sure what the best allocation would be here. Throw 100% of extra money at the loans, make minimums on the loans and throw most of it at the roth, or a middle ground(seems most wise). Theoretically, in the long run, my investment in the roth will earn me more than the 5.5% interest I am paying on my loans but that doesn't really consider risk very well and I don't really like owing money. I don't owe on anything other than my education. 

The wiki seems to suggest any loans with an interest rate over 4% should be paid before starting a roth, I just can't imagine putting off a roth so long though.

As mentioned in the title I will be graduating with 30k loans in April 2018, and my repayment period starts November 2018. I've recently moved back in with my parents to mitigate costs and now have minimal living expenses if any. I have about 1.5k in the bank right now. I know having an emergency fund etc. is a vital, but right now I want to focus on my loans since I don't have living expenses hanging over my head. I'm comfortable with staying with them until my debt is cleared.

So far I've figured that I could pay off my loans before the repayment period even starts if I start putting aside 2k a month until next November 2018 (15 months from now). During this 15 month period I could put the remainder of my income (2k) into my TFSA and/or Wealthsimple investment account, and contribute the remaining 1k to helping with my family's expenses.

* In this case, what type of account should I use to hold my savings for my student loans? I currently have a Wealthsimple TFSA and a regular Everyday Savings account with tangerine. Is the TFSA even worth it if I have a 2.4% interest rate with tangerine for 6 months?

* Should I be contributing to my TFSA/investments and student loans savings concurrently, or should I focus on one at a time? Will a year really make a difference in the interest I lose out on if I focus all my money to saving for my student loans?

* Does nitpicking with these interest rates really make a difference if I'll only be saving for a year at most? 

* Lastly, after paying off my student loans, should I start looking to max out my TFSA before putting money into my Wealthsimple portfolio?",finance

I attempted to explain this absolutely ridiculous situation I was in to my mom when the guard then came into the room, took the phone and then hung up on my mom. His excuse was ""you were getting agitated and angry so you don't get to talk anymore"". Anyways, long story short I FINALLY convinced them I was not crazy and was then let go on the condition that I stay with my mom for 24 hours and go to one counseling session at my university. My mom, realizing how ridiculous this whole thing was, just dropped me off back at my house and I went about the rest of my life blown away by this crazy experience. Keep in mind I never gave them any form of payment, never signed any forms, or showed them I had any health insurance (I did by the way).

Eventually I got a bill from the hospital for something like $2000, it was so long ago I can't remember what the original amount was. We then sent this bill off to a law practice that was contracted with my mom's employer that specializes in medical billing to dispute it. Part of this ""service"" I guess is that any sort of attempts to collect from me or my mom are meant to be through the law office and not us. The last time I remember getting a call about this bill was the day The Force Awakens came out, so quite awhile ago (they called me during the movie, bastards.) Eventually the bill went into collections, the office was notified, and then...nothing. I haven't heard anything since. This incident happened in 2015 I believe.

The office has not told us anything about the progress they've made towards getting rid of this bill or having it removed from my name in collections. They are well aware that it is there, we've been asked to forward any documentation to them regarding the bill. 

Does anyone have any experience with law offices like this and hospital billing in general? I realize my case is a bit different because of the circumstances surrounding it but seeing that collections notice every time I look at credit karma is annoying and I wish there was something, anything I can do to expedite the process of getting this collection taken care of; without having to pay it.",finance
personalfinance,"Last semester, take excess federal financial aid loans?","I currently have a mix of federal loans, most are subsidized at around 4-5%, but some are unsubsidized and one of them is at nearly 8% with ~$7k balance. 

So this semester I was offered ~$8k subsidized at 4.2%, probably due to this being my first year being independent. I owe about $3800 in tuition and fees etc. 

I was thinking of taking the full $8k and paying the excess $4200 on that high interest rate loan once it hits my bank account. 

Does this seem like a logical idea?",finance
personalfinance,0% balance transfer and apr interest rate credit card questions.,I've got good credit and don't ever carry a balance on my credit cards but I'm looking at quite the big bill coming up.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on selling my automobile.,"I have 2007 Chevrolet Silverado that I have gotten a lot of good use from, but am looking to sell now, as I can get by just fine without it in my current living situation.

The truck has 117,561 miles on it, with 72,260 miles when it was purchased. I've kept it in good shape with a well treated interior and exterior and regular maintenance.

All said and done, I purchased the truck for a little over 15k in October of 2014. I now owe 5,300 on it with monthly payments of 350 and an interest rate of 4.44 percent.

This is the first vehicle I have leased, and I'm pretty inexperienced in buying and selling. Thus I'm not even sure how I would go about selling the vehicle while still owing money on it. I'm also wondering if and how my credit will be affected.

To sum it all up, I would like to sell it ASAP, but I'm not sure if its even possible, or the best choice. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",finance
stocks,Thoughts on bond bubble overdue to burst.,"I'm just looking for some more information on how to prepare for this sort of event ( and of course if you can profit off of it). I recently read an article about Alan Greenspan's thoughts on this. Essentially the Fed increases long term interest rates across the board and manufacturing slowly drops. According to Greenspan, it will be ""A stagflation not seen since the 1970s"". Any information is appreciated. Yes, I'm green to all of this.",finance
btc,Solved: Electrum and Electron-cash on the same machine ( linux:Debian),"After reading about (and encountering) the travails     
 of installing Electron-Cash on the same computer as Electrum,    
 I found a way to get both to work without colliding.    
 
* if you have _installed_ electron Cash, remove it:     

&gt; sudo pip uninstall Eexitlectron-Cash     

then,      

* get pythons virtualenv       
&gt; sudo pip install virtualenv    

* cd into wherever you unpacked Electron-Cash-2.9.2.tar.gz example:  
&gt; cd /home/&lt;user&gt;/progging/Electron-Cash-2.9.2    

(Rename the bloody thing  - lose the space in the name,    
 Electron-Cash-2.9.2 or Electron-Cash-2.9.2 **but FFS not ""Electron Cash-2.9.2""**        

* create an env directory inside it        

&gt; virtualenv --system-site-packages env     

(virtualenv is a python thingy that creates and populates a subdirectory named 'env'.    
--system-site-packages adds the python-qt4 stuff and other necessities into the env)       

* then activate the 'env' you just created:        
&gt; source env/bin/activate    

* now you can 'install' electron-cash (remember where you are)       
&gt; python setup.py install     

note - this uses an internet connection briefly    
( if this is a cold wallet you may     
 need to consider how to do this in isolation if you already have electrum committed.    
If any doubt whatsoever just do all of this (electrum etc. from bare metal for security)       

* then, deactivate the env (setup has just created Electron-Cash inside a virtual env)     

&gt; deactivate     

(surprise - deactivate is an alias that activate creates when you run it)     

* finished    
(note - any menu entries labelled Electron-Cash need to be tweaked as follows:    
You can now run your Electron-Cash like this from any terminal or create a launcher.    

&gt; /home/&lt;user&gt;/progging/Electron-Cash-2.9.2/env/bin/electron-cash     

this invokes the python inside the virtualenv to run electron-cash    
 without mangling electrums libs and whatnot.     

This is just a rough hack,    
I am sure gentoo or arch or fedora environments may need tweaking but I am out of time.    
I suspect windows can probably use the same trick but I don't do windows    
The devs will probably release something that handles this better soon I hope.    
Good luck - from here you are on your own    
(P.S. - doing this after having Electrum,    
 Electron still copies wallets,   
but it does this non-destructively: it still ends up in ~/electron-cash    
and not affecting ~/.electrum )",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,I need some advice with purchasing a new home.,"Ok to start this off I'm a 27 year old male looking into purchasing a new home. I moved out of my parents house when I was 18 years old, I rented a few places until I was able to purchase my first house at the age of 25. There were short cuts made in the purchase because I bought the house from my sister, so there was no agent and we went directly through the bank. (So I'm still very new to this). 

I bought my house for 73,000 dollars at the end of the year in 2014, i made a 5% down payment and have a 30 fixed rate at 7.3% interest rate. I pay 650 dollars a month for a payment and when I can make an extra payment at least two to three times a year.  As of right now I have 50 some thousand left to pay on the house. 

The last two years I have made lots of updates to the house, nothing to major yet. But it's been a lot of visual upgrades, and electrical that make it stand out more, so this last month I wanted to see what my house was worth, now do to the upgrades that I have made and got a total house assessment worth of 110 thousand.

So now with the new equity I have in the house, I want to use that towards new siding on the house and a few remodels so I can make my house worth go up more. 

Last thing is my income. I pay roughly 1,700 dollars on bills, food, and gas. I make around 3,000 a month so that leaves me with 1,300 personal money. Which all goes to the house. I want to move into the state I work in so I don't have to pay state tax and it would even save me a lot of money on vehicle taxes a year. Also the houses I'm looking into are in the 250,000 dollar range. 

So here are my questions,

1. Since the new assessment of 110 thousand can I use some of that equity to make more upgrades to my home? Would it even be a good idea to do dip into that equity to do so?

2. With the equity I now have, and all the new upgrades, can I use it as a down payment towards a new house? And if so how would I even go about that with the buying and selling of my house?

3. Should I keep saving as much as I can to make these upgrades so I don't have to take away equity for a down payment?

So that's it. I know my spelling and sentencing is gonna be horrible but I do what I can. I've just never had anyone to help guide me with these things so any help with sending me in the right direction will be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,When to Exercise Stock Options?,"Hello! I have a few questions about exercising stock options. This topic seems to be wrought with information. A lot of information I've found makes it seem like stock options are rarely lucrative.

Some background on me: I am an engineer. I've been out of college for 2 years, and my wife is attending medical school. We both have loans. I have one loan remaining, with a relatively low interest rate. It will be paid off in 2 years time. My wife is just getting started with her medical school loans, so I anticipate we'll be in the red for the foreseeable future. I take home about $75k / year after taxes.

I was one of the first 5 employees at my company. We're not a big success yet, but have grown to about 15 employees now and show no signs of slowing down. As part of my signing, I was granted 15000 options at $0.32/share.

Since that share price was was established, my company (according to my CEO) has raised money at 4x its initial valuation. Also by his account however, ""unless we have some liquidation event, at which point you’ll either get cash for your shares or you can sell them on the public market. We can work towards some liquidation event by adding value to the company, or if we decide never to sell or go public we can start paying dividends or increasing salaries or so on to make the ownership financially significant.""

What am I looking at here? I'm considering changing companies at some point soon (my options are ~50% vested at the moment). Is this the kind of question I should be seeking a financial adviser about?",finance

personalfinance,(Buyer's) closing costs 101,"Buying a house incurs [closing costs](http://www.moving.com/tips/home-purchasing-closing-costs/), meaning costs that don't build equity, above and beyond your down payment.  Some are fixed fees, others depend on the loan value or house price.   While these vary by state, locality, lender and mortgage type, we can make general statements about US closing costs; these might be 2-5% of the purchase price.   The buyer usually pays most of these, but sometimes not; more about that later.  

**Example closing costs**   
Here's a general example of closing costs in no particular location.  See [here](http://www.naic.org/documents/committees_c_cst_wg_reducing_closing_costs.pdf) for explanations of what these costs are.  Fees are due at closing except as noted.  (Please do **not** comment to tell us  your specific costs are different than these examples; that's to be expected.) 

**Costs associated with house / financing**  

Description | Cost range | Notes
:--|:-:|:--    
Appraisal / application fee | ~$400 | Paid up front
Home inspection | ~$300+ | Paid up front; optional but critical
Loan Origination fee | ~$700 to 1% of loan | Varies by lender
Processing fees | varies | Aggregate of small fees
Mortgage insurance/""funding fee"" | 0-2% of loan | Mandatory for VA, FHA, USDA loans
Discount points to reduce interest rate | 0-2% of loan | Optional

**Costs associated with the sale transaction**  

Description | Cost range | Notes
:--|:-:|:--    
Title service / recording fees | ~$1000-2000 | Can shop around on these
Lender's title insurance | ~$400+ | Mandatory; owner's policy optional
Transfer taxes | ~0.1% to 1+% of price | Vary considerably by location, can be big or small
Attorney/etc fees | $0-500 | Required in some states

**Prepaid future charges due at closing**  

Description | Cost range | Notes
:--|:-:|:--    
Prepaid interest | ~0.5% of mortgage | Covers first month's interest
Homeowner's insurance | ~$1000 | First year's cost
Property taxes | ~0.3-1.0+% of price | Initial escrow
HOA fees | varies | if you have them

That was probably confusing; it's a confusing topic.  To highlight key takeaways:

- Many of these are  fees  for mandatory services.  You can choose who provides them in some cases.

- Some fees such as taxes and recording fees are set by law.  They may also stipulate whether they are paid by buyer,  seller, or both.

- Some of the big upfront fees like discount points or mortgage insurance costs are based on choices you make.

- You would eventually pay prepaid costs anyway so that's not extra cost to you; you just pay them at closing.

- Buyers don't pay broker fees in the vast majority of cases; those come from the seller's proceeds.  

Here's a [calculator](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/closing-costs) you can use to get a more detailed breakdown for a specific scenario.  

**Managing these costs**   What can you do to [minimize these costs](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/how-to-reduce-closing-costs)?  Let's first start with how to reduce the costs, and then see about how to get someone else to pay for them.  

You can shop around for many of these services, especially mortgage services.   Get estimates of origination fees and other charges to help you decide which of several lenders has the best overall cost package.  Negotiate reductions and credits by getting mortgage companies to compete for your business.  You can also shop around for title services,  you will save some time if you get your realtor or lender to help you first identify the companies that usually have the best rates.  

You can make choices to reduce your up-front costs as well.  For example, you may be offered the option to purchase discount points to reduce your mortgage rate.   That would increase your up-front costs.  In most cases, this is better for the lender than for you, but it depends on your specific situation.   You can also avoid escrow / prepayment if you put down 20% and get the lender to agree to this in advance.  In this case, you manage your own property tax and insurance payment.  

**Seller-paid (or lender-paid) closing costs** 

Getting someone else to [pay the closing costs](http://usmortgagecalculator.org/what-are-sellers-concessions-and-why-do-they-matter-when-buying-a-home/) seems ideal for many  cash-challenged buyers.  Many buyers want to  avoid ""throwing money away"", which is one way to describe closing costs. This can be easier said than done, however.

In seller's market, sellers have little motivation to help with closing costs via  concessions, so you won't get much help there.  In a buyer's market, you can write your offer to request that sellers provide a a fixed amount or percentage of the sale price back to you to help pay for closing costs.   Since that reduces seller proceeds, they may insist on higher sell price to compensate for this, and the house would have to appraise at this higher sale price.  

There are other variations on this theme where you roll some  closing costs into [amount financed](http://blog.credit.com/2013/11/how-to-finance-your-mortgage-closing-costs-71197/) with the lender's assistance; this can also be done for FHA mortgage insurance fees and VA funding fees.   Rules for what is allowable are determined by lender regulations and government mortgage rules. 
 These tactics can let you buy a house for minimal up-front cash, but they reduce your equity and increase your payments, too.

So, the hope is this gives you an idea what to expect.  I've purchased a number of houses in various states at circa $300K prices, and I've typically paid something like $6000-8000 or so closing costs, without using discount points or seller concessions, but including prepaid escrow.  

Hope this helps!  Big credit to /u/bhfroh who provided  excellent input to this.   Questions welcomed.",finance

investing,About time someone did - Chinese regulators will crack down on Herbalife and Nu Skin marketing practices,"Shares of Herbalife Ltd., Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. and USANA Health Sciences Inc. tumbled on Monday over concerns that Chinese regulators will crack down on the companies’ marketing practices.

The rout followed a statement posted on China’s State Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce website announcing a three-month campaign to police pyramid schemes. Though the agency didn’t name the companies, Herbalife and other so-called multilevel-marketing businesses have faced allegations that they use a pyramid sales model. Herbalife settled a case with the Federal Trade Commission last year that reined in its practices in the U.S.

Banking,Can I still open another Checking account?,"In July I cashed these 2 checks and got $200 for each check. A friend referred me to the guy and the guy said the checks were real but he couldn't cash them. I cashed them through my Bank of America checking account and the checks totaled to about $2000. 
About 2 weeks later, I get a notification that my account is overdrawn. I go on my online banking app and see -2075!!! I immediately called the guy who gave me the checks and asked him what was going on and he immediately hangs up. I was scammed. I call Bank of America and ask them what's going on. They say the checks are still pending but they will have more I formation tomorrow.
I call Bank of America and end up speaking to a representative. I tell the rep my whole situation and they tell me to get my account balance to 0.00 by September 10th. At this point I already had a full time job but had to pick up another part time gig at Sears. 
So I started returning things and making deposits to my account to get my balance where it needs to be when out of nowhere, the exact amount of money that the checks are worth is deposited to my account. I don't know where it came from but I was definitely happy. The next night, I go check my online banking to see if my balance is the same and it says my account is locked. I make a few websearches and I see that I could basically be in a federal prison for what has occurred, because banks don't close accounts without notification unless the account is linked to fraud. 
I ask my manager for some advice (she's had a few run ins with the law) and she said since I'm a minor and it's a 1st offense it'll probably be 6 months probation. I use my break to drive to the nearest police station but I talk to a rep for Bank of America in the Disclosure department. I tell her my situation and she says the account is being closed because it was involved with fraudulent activity but since the money was mysteriously paid back itz not going to affect me and I can open up another account with them. 
My question is, is everything really ok? And could I open another account with a different bank such as Chase? I'm familiar with Chexsystems and I don't want to try opening a checking account with Chase only to be denied. The lady said the money was paid back but I thought that BoA did that before they closed my account but apparently not. I don't want to open another checking account with BoA so could I open another account with a different institution?",finance

personalfinance,Refinance/Consolidate before Grad School [x-post from /r/StudentLoans],"Asking for a friend (no really):

**Situation**

* Currently working, planning to attend PharmD school in Fall 2018
* Already helped them create a rough budget, $200 in savings/month available
* Have to take 6 credits before PharmD school, $200 in savings will go towards paying for that in Dec, then rest will save for PharmD
* All fed loans

**Questions**

* Would any type of consolidation be helpful? I have recommended against this because of the 6.55% rates
* Would refinancing be helpful? I have recommended that this may only be helpful for the high interest rates.
* Is there a calculator for figuring out how to pay interest only? Current payments are making the loans grow, and I believe they should focus on keeping the loans stagnant and wait on any aggressive repayment plans AFTER grad school (but also they shouldn't let the loans grow out of control)
* Any advice I might pass along etc
* Normally I would suggest the avalanche method, however with their situation they do not want to focus on repayment and rather want to save as much as they can for PharmD

financialindependence,$100k the boring way,"**Summary**

Reached $100k net worth from a starting point less than -$100k in about 4 years mostly through consistent saving. Net worth chart with annotations included below. All salary numbers are gross.

**Background**

My wife and I are both 28 and live in the Pacific Northwest. We met when we were 24 and I estimate at the time that we had a combined net worth of close to -$120k, though we didn’t combine finances until after our engagement in 2014.

I was lucky to graduate from college in 2011 with no debt and an engineering degree. A scholarship paid half of my tuition, my parents paid the other half, and I paid for everything else with savings and working during the summers. I had a job lined up after graduation but decided to go to grad school instead, taking on $21k of student loan debt over the next 2 years while getting my Master’s. My wife paid her own way through private undergrad and public graduate school, which left her with over $100k in student loans after 7 years of schooling by the time it was all said and done.

**The Process**

2013: We both lived in the Midwest. I graduated with my Master’s and started on full time at the company I interned at while in grad school as an Engineer I. My starting offer was $63k and I negotiated it up to $67k based on comps for recent grads with my degree that my school published. My rent was $650/mo. I’ve always been a saver but wasn’t deep into the FIRE mindset at the time, so I started contributing 6% to the 401k to get the 3% company match and set to work paying down my loans. Wife (girlfriend) was a full time student in year 1 of her grad program and worked as a barista to pay the bills. We moved in together at the end of this year and paid $1400/mo in rent.

2014: I studied for and passed the FE exam (should have done this in undergrad) which was one factor in helping me earn a promotion to Engineer II at work and a salary of $73k. Wife was in year 2 of her program, still a barista, and we got engaged in the fall. This is when we first combined finances. Once I got the overall picture of our financial situation I started doing lots of FIRE-related reading and found MMM and this sub. The MMM post “Your debt is an emergency” really stood out to me, so from there we began aggressively paying down my wife’s student loans, some of which had interest rates as high as 6.8%! I started gradually increasing my 401k contribution and opened a Roth IRA.

Also at this time, I decided to begin passively monitoring jobs in the PNW. We knew we would like to move there eventually to be closer to family, but had no timetable. Everything happened kind of fast. By the end of November I had applied, interviewed, and gotten hired for a job that was a good fit for my skills. The starting offer was $74k and I negotiated it up to $82k. I was really happy with how the whole thing ended up working out, but the downside was that they weren’t willing to wait on my desired start date so I moved home without my wife (fiancee) which really sucked. 

2015: I started my new job and got a 5% raise after the 6 month probationary period to $86k. My wife (fiancee) finished her degree, moved to the PNW, and started her career in the public school system at $54k. We found a townhouse to rent at $1100/mo from a family friend. We got married and paid down over $40k of student loans this year.

2016: I got a 5% raise to $90k at my 1 year anniversary. We began saving for a new car, a house, maxed an HSA, maxed my Roth, opened a second Roth, and maxed a 457. The wife got a raise to $57k, and became nationally certified in her profession. I spent a few months studying my ass off for the PE exam and passed in the fall. This year we discovered my wife was eligible for a different loan forgiveness than PSLF that only required 5 years of work, so we ran the numbers and dialed back our loan payments significantly to hopefully take advantage of that in 2020. We paid off about $16k in loans this year and instead focused on maxing the previously mentioned 457 and HSA.

2017: I was promoted to Engineer III in the spring, and along with a COLA raise/market adjustment, now make $99k. Up to now I feel like my salary has progressed quickly, but it will likely be much slower from this point forward unless I change companies. My wife makes $67k after including the new yearly bonus for being certified. We both pay into our separate pension plans at work and are also each maxing a 457/401k. Not currently adding to the Roth accounts anymore, but we’re aggressively saving up for a house down payment. We dropped the HSA for this year since we are having a baby in the fall!

**Chart**

[Here is that whole story summed up in one diagonal line](http://imgur.com/a/ex2VQ). I marked the inflection points as best I could.

1. 7/2/15 began tracking net worth.
2. 12/21/15 added the e-fund to Personal Capital tracking to get a better picture of our net worth.
3. 3/29/16 crossed $0! We are worthless!
4. 9/8/16 added $5k to make the e-fund value more accurate, got $5k inheritance :(
5. 11/21/16 received the remaining $10k of the same inheritance. The big dip right before this was Personal Capital messing up our accounts for a couple days.
6. 5/24/17 crossed $100k net worth!
7. 8/9/17 bought a car

**Current Finances**

* $41k saved towards a down payment, $15k e-fund, $7k in an HSA.
* $104k of investments, mostly lazy index 3-fund portfolio.
* -$59k of student loans remaining, to be paid off by 2020.
* Budget is set for our savings rate to be 50% but we average about 60%. This will come down due to baby costs but I expect us to be in the 40-50% range still.
* Our FIRE goal right now is $1.5M.

**The End**

Overall, I’m not sure there’s anything super unique about our journey to this point, but I wouldn’t feel comfortable sharing this with people in my personal life. We worked hard, invested in good educations leading to good careers, and saved religiously. It’s simple but it wasn’t easy - I definitely dove in head first to the FIRE concept and for a while it was a source of stress for me, always trying to increase that savings rate. In my natural tendency to engineer things, I had turned my life into an optimization problem.

It eventually occurred to me that I was stressed about saving money so that I wouldn’t have to stress about money and since then I’ve relaxed considerably. /u/MrLlamaSC‘s stickied post really resonated with me and I try my best to live by my dad’s favorite quote, “Everything in moderation, including moderation.” I’m sure there were many ways we could have done things differently or better, but I’m happy with where we’re at.

As for what’s next, we are in full baby prep mode now, so it’s nice that our savings are basically on autopilot and we can focus on our family. A house would be the next big thing on our radar, so we will save for that, but we aren’t in any particular rush. I will continue to track these things because I like numbers and we’ll just keep plugging away until the next $100k milestone. Thanks for reading!",finance
Bitcoin,ShowerThought: The astronomical return on Bitcoin is just pressure from decades of an artificially lowered savings rate concentrated in a single market.,"The demand for saved resources (real usable resources) has a price.  One that is absolutely critical to having a balanced and sustainable economy.  That price manifests as the interest rate and natural price deflation.  Together they determine the price of both saving and lending capital.  In other words, the cost of utilizing resources today versus in the future.  Keep in mind, you can't build a house with a *promise* to cut down trees.  You *must* save actual resources in order to build a house.  Without having the resources already, the new paper money is merely chasing the market.  It's the equivalent of saying we can build the house today and cut down the trees tomorrow.  A new loan without savings to back it just causes inflation. Period.  

Yet, thanks to central banks around the world, the price is forced *far* below the real price of borrowing resources by the ability to create credit out of thin air in our fractional reserve system.  The result of which is the widespread inflation of available currency that siphons a percentage of every dollar/Euro/etc of saved capital on the planet.

The nature of prices is such that the larger the imbalance, the more severe the correction.  The scope and degree to which every central bank has manipulated the interest rate is staggering.  And they have sustained *decades* with every major currency, *including the world reserve currency,* at far below the actual market price.

And the most insane thing Is how universal the manipulation has been.  There is barely any escape from this market manipulation.  Even the gold and silver paper markets are highly manipulated with vastly more volume traded than is actually available.  

All this culminates in a price that has been so out of balance for such a prolonged period of time that **the very culture and politics vilifies saving resources for the future as if such a thing is bad for the economy.** Think about how insane and so obviously backwards that is!  But entire generations have grown up thinking that loaning money into existence works just fine.  As a consequence, the average 20-40 year old has barely a month of savings.  Because why fuck would you save money when it buys more the faster you spend it *and* you can still spend tomorrow's money for *zero down* and *zero percent financing for 12 months?*

Technology has finally caught up however.  Today, Bitcoin is essentially *the only market that allows the price on saved capital to adjust freely and thus, find equilibrium.*  Because of that, and as the technology spreads it's reach, the massive credit price imbalance results in a savings ""interest rate"" of 100s of percent in the form of deflation.   The percentage return is just highly exaggerated by the vast imbalance, the lack of alternative paths for the correction, and also the small size and still few financial highways into the cryptocurrency market.

A final consideration as well.  If this is the case, then it means the market is paying so much for saved capital specifically because it's the actual market price. Meaning **what the market wants us to do is hodl.** Because we are going to have to weather a *massive* financial storm when the correction comes and we will need tons of saved capital to recover.  So save every dollar you can in bitcoin, the world desperately needs us to defer our consumption so we can get out of this 50 year debt crisis.

TL;DR
When the market price is manipulated it results in an imbalance.  With decades of the interest rate forced below market levels, the crypto market stands as the only avenue for a free market price on savings rates. Like a crack in the bottom of the ocean, the staggering ROI of Bitcoin is merely the price needed to relieve the pressure, break through long believed economic fallacies, and restore financial common sense to the world.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Should I take a loan from my 401k to pay off my Credit Card debt?,"I've tried following a lot of the advice in here and found it really helpful in paying off my smaller debts and now I'm at a point where I have the lowest interest rate on anything outstanding with the exception of my Credit Card.   
It has a balance of 10K with an APR of 17.99%, monthly minimums of approximately $250 and I send on $300 a month. My line of thinking was that I can take out a loan from my 401k for 40 months at a rate of 6.25% and I pay myself the interest.   
The downside is that the 10K isn't in the market during that time so the best I can hope for it to earn 6.25% on that portion of my 401k, while the rest fluctuates with the market.   
I know that during those 40 months paying the same $300 a month towards the credit card isn't likely to pay off more than 50% because of the higher interest rate but I wasn't sure if there is some major downside I'm missing when considering the 401k loan.",finance

gaming,Anyone else sick and tired of the waiting game?,"Some games just take too long to come out, of course we all know that some games need the dev time, but sometimes it comes down to the devs simply just not making the game. The Elder Scrolls VI is a long way off, it'll probably be out by the mid 2020s at this stage. BGS are focusing on other games, which is the reason why, but decades between game entries is a bit much. Half-Life 3 is another infamous example, (I havent played any of the games so I dont share the fans' pain I'm afraid lol). Kotor 3 is another. Seriously the last single player Star Wars RPG we've had was Kotor 2 which came out in 2004. Almost 13 years. 13. YEARS. AGO. It's 2017 and theres no sign of a new Star Wars RPG, besides a couple of rumors which are quickly denied. I have to say every game I play kind of feels like filler in the wait for games like TES VI or a Star Wars RPG. Losing interest in gaming at this stage to be honest. Anyone else fed up with the waiting game?",technology
personalfinance,Here to make sure my wife and I are on the right track (student loans/debt/retirement),"As a long-time lurker on PF, I've received a lot of valuable information from this community and recently doubled down on my wife's student loan debt.

Our emergency fund is at $3,043.04, it was over $5,000, but we decided to pull some money from it to throw at our debt.  One month, we put around $12,000 toward the student loan debt because of tax returns and extra money in checking/saving accounts.

Our checking account is at $7,032.45.

I have a roth TSP that's at $11,800 but can no longer contribute as I'm not longer in the military.

My work has a 401k plan in which they contribute $4.27/hour worked, which equates to about $683/month.  I don't contribute any extra money toward it at this time, because we have relatively high interest rates on our loans.  I have about $3,000 in this account.

My wife has over $5,000 in her retirement account, and they match up to 6% (which is the amount she is opting for at this time).

Finally, we have an Index fund at $11,883.28 that's set up for high risk that we eventually intend on using for a downpayment on a home in 3-4 years.

We are both 27 years old, and have opted for the avalanche method as far as student loan repayment is concerned.  All additional money is generally thrown right back at the student loans.  We are taking our honeymoon this October in which airfare and room and board are taken care of, but we're saving a little extra money so that we can splurge a big without being completely broke on our trip.  That's why our checking account is at $7,032 right now.  As soon as our vacation is over, we plan on funneling the extra money toward the debt.

Given the numbers, is there anything that you guys see that could be done better?  Should we be contributing more toward retirement right now?  Any advice is greatly appreciated!  

Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,"Getting married in a month, fiance is at least $4,000 upside down in her car. What should I do?","Hey guys,

To make a long story short, my fiance's dad 'helped' her buy a car right before she turned 18, and put us in a pretty tough situation. It's a '13 Ford Focus with going on 60,000 miles on it, and her payoff is currently around $12,000.

They financed $13,800 just over a year ago. FOR 78 MONTHS.

Now, it's a great car and I'd love to just pay it down and run it forever, but there's one problem; we're currently on it's 3rd clutch pack. Ford had a problem in the '11-'16 model powershift transmissions that caused it to lose clutches all the time. We're going to be covered under her extended warranty until 100,000 miles; but after that, there's no way I'm putting a clutch in this thing every year.

Now, apparently there's a class-action lawsuit going on where Ford is offering settlements to take the cars back or give trade credit for a new one. We just have no idea when that's going to be. 

So, all in all...what should we do? Stick it out until we find out what's going on? Eat the loss and get her a different car? We could definitely refinance the vehicle once we get married to lower the interest rate (currently 11.75%!) but that doesn't solve our issue with the negative equity.

politics,"I am Katie Fahey, Founder of Voters Not Politicians, a grassroots organization dedicated to ending gerrymandering in Michigan, AMA","Hi Reddit,
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  

Here is our [proof and a link to our twitter feed](https://twitter.com/NotPoliticians/status/897477669599813635) where we would be excited to see you follow us.  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


At the start of last November, [I was a 27-years old with no professional political experience](http://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/katie_fahey) and was doing my best to balance my job in the recycling field, grad school, and leading a local improv comedy troupe. After the election, out of extreme frustration with the political climate in the US, I made the following post to my Facebook friends:  

&gt;*I'd like to take on gerrymandering in Michigan, if you're interested in doing this as well, please let me know :)*

That quickly snowballed into a campaign with thousands of dedicated members who are committed to amending Michigan’s State Constitution by way of a ballot referendum.  

I am here with our Lead Field Strategist [Joe Spaulding](http://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/joe)(u/votersnotpoliticians), who sat next to me in a class at [this college](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9rymEWJX38) years ago. We are here to tell you our story and answer any questions you may have about gerrymandering or our grassroots campaign. We have a strong and growing network of supporters and volunteers and are constantly finding new ways to create the tools we need to get to a **win in November 2018**. The power of the internet has helped our campaign be innovative, resourceful, and efficient, and I see it as one of our largest strengths.  

Our policy language was crafted with [feedback from thousands of Michiganders that we gathered on a 33 day sprint across our state](http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/07/17/group-submits-michigan-ballot-proposal-end-gerrymandering/485228001/), as well through working with groups who have been immursed in the issue of redistricting all over the country for years. Our policy brings fairness to the redistricting process and gives a voice to voters when it comes to drawing district maps. It takes transparency so seriously, everything used to draw the final maps would be made public down to the variables programed into map drawing software.     

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are just about ready to launch the petition circulating phase of our campaign, and right now are facing all of the traditional challenges, but without any of the resources [astroturfed](http://freebeacon.com/issues/seiu-funnels-cash-astroturf-fight-15-movement/) or [party-backed initiatives](http://fcir.org/2015/04/03/in-sunshine-state-big-energy-blocks-solar-power/) get to enjoy. Although we are committed to being nonpartisan, the incumbent party in control of our state government views us as a threat, and we have already experienced [roadblocks from state agencies](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/17/gerrymandering-michigan-voters-politicians-petitions/103782256/) on processes that have been little more than formalities for petitions in the past. We will need every advantage we can get to get to the **315,654 signatures in the 180 day window** the state allows in order to get on the ballot, but we are a campaign of incredibly passionate citizens who are sick of waiting for someone else to change the system.  

In 2 financial quarters, we have recieved [13 times more individual donations](http://mcfn.org/node/6541/three-ballot-campaigns-have-already-collected-more-than-800k-in-resources) than any other ballot initiative in our state, with an average donation hovering around $60. Campaigns to ban prevailing wage and to make being a State Senator a part-time job have [7 times our funding coming from very few anonymous donors](http://mcfn.org/node/6526/groups-that-dont-disclose-their-donors-helping-fund-ballot-proposal-campaigns). We expect the campaign opposing us to be financed in the same way to the same degree with a great deal coming from the expected SuperPACs as well as the [DeVos Family](http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/12/how_much_each_devos_family_mem.html), as Michigan is their home state (Joe's dad used to sell pizzas to the factory owned by Betsy DeVos and Erik Prince's dad which employed 20% of the town).  

Looking back now, I am amazed at how we have come so far. We are all so thrilled to see [how much support this issue has across the country](https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21725305-he-compares-politicians-gerrymandered-districts-overweight-people-who-should-go). 

Thank you for having us, and we can’t wait to talk about taking a stand against partisanship and political manipulation of the building blocks of our democracy! 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will start answering questions at 1 P.M.

**Ask us anything!**  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit:** Here are a pair of good resources for a quick rundown on the problems with the current system: First, [a three minute video](https://youtu.be/aKUl4ceH5q4) Voters Not Politicians made to explain the problem to Michiganders (sorry Ohio!), and here is [John Oliver showing what our town hall presentations would look like if they had swearing and professional joke writers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-4dIImaodQ).   

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Easy to understand breakdowns of our policy and our approach to the campaign are [found in our blog](http://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/blog).   

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally,  [have a look at our website](http://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/) if you want to learn more about the specifics of our policy, make a contribution, or sign up for updates or to volunteer. If you’re in Michigan, we can train you to collect signatures, and if you are outside, we will need help calling voters and getting them to the polls.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you all so much for taking the time to be here and talk with us about the campaign we have been living and breathing since last November. We wish we could have responded to all of your amazing questions and look forward to keeping you all posted on our progress while we continue fighting to restore fairness and transparency to the most important aspects of our democracy.

personalfinance,When/How often should I refi my mortgage?,"My wife and I purchased a house for $155k back in 2008. Shortly thereafter she lost her job, so our finances were pretty touch and go for a few years. On the advice of her acquaintence in finance, we refied a few years later. As happens, our mortgage bounced around a couple of owners until Nationstar took it over in 2011.

We're in a more stable place financially now. I've been getting letters, phone calls, and e-mails for a few years now from Nationstar telling me I can refinance. I didn't take them too seriously - after all, these guys got sued for calling their customers to much pushing for refi. But as my daughter's about to graduate out of expensive daycare I'm looking at ways to lower our debts going forward, I'm wondering if it's worth working into. My wife always says, ""Isn't it bad to refi to often?"" and my answer thus far has been, ""Iunno.""

Right now I have $133k in principal with a 4.75% interest rate. I have a 744 FICO score. The property's gained value since we bought it - Zillow says $204,029, for whatever that's worth.

Since we've paid down so many years thus far, I don't want a 30 year mortgage, do I? We also plan to move in 10 years or so. And we are still paying FHA mortgage insurance on it - can I drop that yet?

Any advice is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Sanity check needed please for large short-term investment option,"My husband and I just sold our house. We're currently renting and plan on buying in the next two years once we figure out where we want to live. We have about 240k to find a home for until then. Taxes on the profit will not be an issue since it's less than 500k (married filing jointly) and we lived in the home for the almost 6 years we owned it. We are DINK with Bay Area tech salaries working remotely in a low COL area, have no debt, ample emergency funds, max out our tax-advantaged investments already, etc.

Since the purchasing timeline could be as soon as 3-4 months, we don't want to lock the money even in a 6 months CD, so I've been looking at a couple options that are low risk with an eye to minimizing loss. All calculations are based against an annual interest rate of 2% just to have some sort of number to work with.

* Regular savings account - currently 0.15% interest at USAA for amounts over 10k. Annual loss of 1.85%.
* High yield savings account - currently 1.15% interest at Ally Bank for all amounts. Annual loss of 0.85%.
* USAA money market fund (USAXX) - YTD 0.19% return with an expense ratio of 0.62%. Annual loss of 2.43%.
* Vanguard money market fund (VMMXX) - YTD 0.57% with an expense ratio of 0.16%. Annual loss of 1.59%.

So my two questions are:

* Did I get my math right and a high yield savings is our best option or did I brainfart as I ran the numbers pre-coffee?
* Are there any other short-term, low risk investment options that would better suit our situation?

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,I need help refinancing my student loan in the unique position I am,"Hi.

personalfinance,"Grad student here. Can pay for 1st semester out of pocket, but I need to take out more than allowed for 2nd semester. Financial aid gurus needed!","Hi, like the title says I'm a grad student and was awarded the federal unsubsidized graduate loan through fasfa for $20,500 for the academic year.  The academic year covers the fall, winter, and summer semester.  I can pay for the fall semester out of pocket, including tuition and living expenses (yay!!), and will need to take out the federal loan for the winter and summer semester.

The problem I'm running into is that you can only take out a max of $10,250 for the semester - according to who I spoke with at financial aid.  Is this true though?!  They want me to take out the loan for $5,000 in the fall then the remaining $10,000 in the winter.  It seems detrimental to take out a loan in the fall, which starts accumulating interest, when I don't even need it!  Why am I being restricted on how I can use my award?

Ideally I would like to just take the money out as I need it and roll it over to another semester or give it back if I don't use it (within the same academic year). 

If anyone can help me to navigate the world of financial aid I would really appreciate it!

P.S.  I also have to fill out a summer aid request form ""because summer is different"" to receive any of the  award during the summer semester, I don't mind filling out the paperwork, but it just seems fishy and wanted to ask about that too...If i'm awarded $20,500 for the academic year, then why the extra work??",finance

personalfinance,Is my student loan debt collector scamming me?,"Hi, I'm prepared for the onslaught of judgement and negative comments. But I majored in something stupid in college, was unable to pay off my student loans, and they went into default. I owe 29,000 to Sallie Mae. By this time, Navient had taken over the loans.


After college, I realized how useless my degree was and decided to become a paramedic. I've worked overtime obsessively and have saved as much as I can over the year. Part of the reason I also missed payments is because I used my savings for paramedic school and living expenses in school instead of paying off the debt.


I feel like paramedic school was a good investment. I paid 10,000 for school, and now I make 67,000 a year. So last month I went through every piece of mail, organized my accounts, figured out what I owed to whom. The student loan debt is making me a nervous wreck.


Since the private loans have a high interest rate, I wanted to get rid of them first. One loan was for 4,000, so I call to pay 1500 toward that. When I called the Navient representative, she said my balance had been forwarded to a collection agency, and she directly transfered me there. The representative there, a guy, said that he was offering me a deal that is good until the end of August (August 29).


The deal is that if I pay $5,500, that would settle the entire 29,000 debt. I literally (not figuratively) laughed at him, saying that was impossible. The guy said that ""a lot of Americans"" are in the same situation as me and ""have no way to pay their debt unless they settle."" He took my information and said he would email the details over.


I'm not going to make any payments until I see this in writing, and talk with my brother who is in finance. 


My questions is, this has to be a scam right? Is this possible?",finance
investing,"What does this sub think of investing in solar? More specifically, directly in solar projects/funds not so much in company stocks.","So, as the majority of the community is well aware solar energy is a huge and fast-growing industry. However, the stock performance of publicly traded solar energy companies hasn't been as successful as one could have hoped. My question is what are this community's thoughts on investment in solar via alternative means then stocks? Investing directly in solar projects is quite a large market but typically not catered towards the individual investor and is primarily driven by either very large finance entities, or companies directly involved in the solar space (developers, EPC companies, etc.). 

If the option to invest directly in solar was available (either as an individual with sufficient capital, or by pooling capital via small fund similar to some real estate development funds) would you be interested? What sore of returns would you be expecting? What are the biggest risk factors that might turn you away? A large part of solar investment is the federal ITC (30% federal income tax credit), would you be interested in capturing a portion of the direct tax benefit or would you be more interested in the cash on cash returns? 

Full disclosure: I'm in the solar industry and shamelessly asking for research purposes. My company doesn't offer these types of investments, but if there is investor interest I might take a closer look. I have been playing around with some models that can separate the tax benefits to one larger institutional investor and allow the cash benefits go to another entity - which could be comprised of an investor-owned llc and wanted to get thoughts/feedback from the community.

Bitcoin,PSA: Bitcoin won't save you from the next economic meltdown,"Some people have analyzed the [lack of correlation](http://coincorrelation.com/) between the traditional and cryptocurrency markets and concluded that [Bitcoin can hedge you](https://www.signalplot.com/what-is-bitcoins-correlation-with-other-financial-assets/) from an economic meltdown.   I don’t agree with this.  There is no reason to think that short-term market fluctuations should be related to the Bitcoin price, but long term, I expect a strong correlation between traditional and crypto markets.   

One of the biggest drivers of the Bitcoin price are low worldwide interest rates, leading individual investors to bet on Bitcoin.   This works as long as people have money to spare.  During a recession,  people will be scrambling to get money to keep their businesses, homes, and cars afloat.  Because crypto markets are still a tiny share of the total economy, they will be quickly drained of most of their value.   Only a minority of the value of Bitcoin is regularly traded, so it would not take much to crash the price to a fraction of its value.",cryptocurrency

investing,Bond CEF's vs BND,"Why would somebody invest in something like BND yielding 2.4% versus a bond CEF like PDI which is yielding 9%.  I ask this because comparing the 5 year performance of both results in PDI winning by a large margin.  Not including reinvested dividends, PDI is up 9% over 5 years and BND is down 3% over 5 years.  When you include reinvested dividends, you are looking at a greater than 10% total return per year for PDI.  

In this current interest rate environment with low inflation, I look for rates to be lower for longer and top out at 3% by 2020.  With no signs of inflation and GDP growing at a 2-3% rate per year, there is no need for the Fed to hike rates quickly.  This should give a good tailwind to bond CEF's for at least the next few years.

the bond market is one market where alpha can be generated by good managers who know what they are doing and PDI is exemplified by that.  Anybody who recommends being in a bond index fund like BND is doing a disservice to that person...  IMHO of course.",finance

Problem is, I've been slowly distancing myself from her as she's not someone I want in the immediate forefront of my life. As far as my mom can remember, my grandmother has always lied about anything and everything to the point that I can't trust any family history I hear from her, which saddens me.

Recently I had dinner with my sibling which my grandparents were at. Afterwards, talk of my financial college situation arose (not brought up by me). My grandparents offered to co-sign.

It would be nice to have a lower interest rate (it's good for my future). But I don't want to be tethered to an Emily Gilmore situation, which I unfortunately feel this might turn into. It gives my grandmother an obvious reason to talk to me for the next ten years.

Anyone have any advice or been in a similar situation? Thanks!

Edit: additional info--- My mom can't cosign because she herself is going back to school. I refuse to ask my sibling, as they are having a baby really soon and are also paying off their loans. I am not close enough to any of my other family members to feel comfortable having them co-sign. As you might infer, I feel uncomfortable having my grandparents co-sign.",finance
personalfinance,"How much home can I afford, what rates can I expect.","I currently live in southwest Ontario and am potentially looking to buy a home in the next year or so. I am basically wondering how much of a monthly payment people in my situation are comfortably living on.

As far as savings I currently have 34k in my account and another 32k in stocks.

I have a very secure union job, over the past 3 years my incomes have been 77k (first year, started end of january as an apprentice). 95k and 110k. Realistically my income will level off at 90k without overtime over the next few years as I get a more desirable position with more time to live life. 

For expenses i have:
 160/mo for insurance.
52 cellphone
80 internet
850 rent (includes all utilities)
300 food
150 gas

No credit card debt, and I bought a new truck in February 2015 for 43k all in and paid it off in may of 2016, so i shouldn't have any big vehicle repairs or needs for a while.

According to creditkarma.ca my credit score is 802.

My questions are what kind of interest rate should I expect for southwest ontario based on this and do you think a 400k home would be doable. The areas I am looking at typically have either hundred + year old homes that are cheaper or new construction homes in the high 300's to 600 range.

personalfinance,Graduate School Debt,"Hey guys!

So my boyfriend and I are in graduate school. 

I'm starting CRNA school in spring 2019 and can expect an annual salary around 150k beginning Spring 2022. My program costs 60k, I can get 70k in Federal loans. I have about 13.5k in debt from undergrad, but 12k of that loan is sitting in a savings account right now (emergency funds). Plus, I'll probably have an additional 30k in savings by the time I start graduate school in 2019. I do have a 17k loan on a car currently.

He's in his last year of dental school and then he plans on completing a combined prosthodontic/periodontic 5yr residency. By the time he graduates in spring 2023, he'll have 500k in school debt, but he's taking his dad's practice and will be able to realistically pay it back.

We want to get married before I start school in 2019. So add in the debt of a ring/wedding/etc. I was mentally prepping myself to use some of the 30k savings for the wedding. Idk what he's thinking ring loanwise.

Starting post marriage, we're expecting around 4k/mo living expenses (48k/yr) including car payments etc. Between his stipend and other incomes, he's taking home about 40k/yr in residency. I won't be working while in school.

We both can take out extra graduate plus loans to cover other expenses if needed. Also concerned about emergency funds...

I was thinking that I could aim to create a savings for a down payment on a house while working during his last year of school.

I am a 21 year old student in college with a part time job at school. I needed a car for an internship this summer and I got a used car.

investing,Investing with Your Heart,"Some individuals believe that return on investment shouldn’t be the only criterion for how they invest their money. For them, the social impact of investing is just as important—perhaps, more important.

The history of socially responsible investing stretches at least as far back as the mid-18th century, but its more modern form began taking shape in the 1960s, amidst the fight for civil rights and the emerging anti-Vietnam protests.

More than $8.7 trillion is managed under sustainable and responsible investing principles.¹ This includes mutual funds, endowments, and even venture-capital funds.

Amounts in mutual funds are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk. Shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Mutual funds are sold only by prospectus. Please consider the charges, risks, expenses, and investment objectives carefully before investing. A prospectus containing this and other information about the investment company can be obtained from your financial professional. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.

What Is “Socially Responsible Investing?”

The definition of socially responsible investing has evolved. And it may be referred to by different names, such as “sustainable and responsible investing” or “values-based investing.”

Whatever term is used, the investment discipline is usually characterized by a set of principles that govern how investments are selected. One widely used framework includes environmental, social, and corporate governance criteria (ESG).

What’s ESG?

ESG criteria of good corporate governance, positive environmental impact, and responsible community involvement are a guide for making investment selections, akin to other investment-related criteria, such as price/earnings ratio or revenue growth.

The underlying belief is that good corporate practices may lead to better long-term corporate performance.

Investor experience with socially responsible investing will vary. As with any mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, socially responsible investments are subject to fluctuation in value and market risk. Shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Individuals should also recognize that each investment approach may operate under a different set of principles, so you should be careful that your selection mirrors your personal values and beliefs.

personalfinance,Just need some general guidance,"Hey guys, the quick and dirty about me is I’ve just turned 24 and i’m single. I have a stable job (Federal Employee) that i’ve been in a few years and I gross about 68K. After taxes, health insurance, my 5% TSP contribution and it’s additional 5% matching, as well as some income from a roommate I usually take home $3500 a month.

 Two months a year I get a 3rd paycheck in the month due to bi-weekly checks so an extra $1500’ish. On top of that when I am in class my GI bill pays out about $1300 a month extra which is tax free but I don’t really count that as it deposits straight to my savings account and at most it will pay out 8-9 months a year due to the timing of quarters. Some quarters i’m not in class so it’s hard to predict how much I will take in from it a calendar year. It’s also only good for I believe 36 months in total. 

Now for my current financials. I have no credit card debt or student loans. My only debt is a house I bought 2 1/2 years ago and I currently owe $150K on the remaining 27 1/2 years of loan at 3.5% fixed rate. The entire escrow is about $950 a month. I also have a vehicle that I bought new a year ago and I owe $25K on it with interest rate at 2.49% on a 6 year loan. The car note is about $460 a month. 

Not including my TSP retirement accounts I have about 53K in “liquid” savings. I have been contemplating just paying my vehicle off since I have the funds now and I like the idea of not paying so much monthly and just funneling the payment amount back into savings. I realize my interest rate is fairly low so some of you may say invest the liquid savings and make more than 2.49% on it but I really don’t know how to start. I am not worried about building credit from the car loan as I have been working on mine since I was 18 and currently hover around 780. I think it would actually raise my score higher as it’s the youngest account/lowering debt to income ratio. I just need some advice on how best to make my money work for me and not do something completely stupid.

Bitcoin,Segwit2x --&gt; discussion and opinions,"Hello everyone. I'm kind of new here on Reddit and my English is not so good at all so I'll begin with an apology for that, hehe. First of all let me introduce myself with my bitcoin experience. I made two big mistakes in the past. The first one was to sell and not believe anymore in bitcoin early in 2014. A couple of months ago I invested a lot of my savings again in bitcoin, BUT, using BTC-E. And yes, you guess it, it was my second big mistake because the feds seized it. Maybe I'll get my funds back but I expect the worst so I won't get dissapointed. 

After that I was really done with crypto. I literally bought the Ledger Nano S to put my funds from BTC-E on the hardware wallet, but it was too late. The Ledger came literally a couple of days later than the closure of the exchange site. Ouch. After a while I thought a lot and said to myself that every ingestment and corporation have downfalls etc etc. So I decided to invest again in bitcoin. The reason why is that I think we are still in the early phases of the ride like many of you say. So I decided to dollar cost average weekly and this time send it right no my ledger!! Hehe. I want to buy a small ampunt weekly and hold a bigger investment on the sideline in case we will see a big correction. 

Big correction. Yes. So this is the question from me. No body knows when the 'big correction' will happen and how big it will be. Maybe we will not see below $3000 of $3500 anymore, who knows. But we saw $1830 with the segwit and hard fork discussion not so long ago. So I think that we can see this big correction in november with segwit2x. This is why I post this article. To discuss about segwit2x and how it will effect bitcoin's price. Let's say it will correct again big time. If the price goes till november to $7000 and will 'crash' to $5000 then we still can say that the $4100 price from now is better then the next big crash/correction. 

So that's my story and my input for you guys opinions and fror a nice discussion. Thanks for reading and I hope I didn't write like a noob, lol. Have a nice day!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Paying off $10,500 in credit card debt.","Hey PF…

I'm getting fed up with paying my credit card bills every month and seeing how much of it goes to interest. In all honesty, I've been completely careless with my credit cards due to my parents needing help and my little knowledge of credit and credit cards. I need help planning on how to tackle this giant debt. 


Currently I have 4 credit cards that add up to ~$10,500:

• Amex @ 21.9%
• Wells Fargo (credit card) @ 16.15%
• Wells Fargo (line of credit) @ 20.4%
• Navy Federal (credit card) @ 18.0%

I have only been making the minimum payments because I couldn't afford anything more. I've recently got a new job that may allow me to pay a little more but as you can see, a chunk of my payments go to interest. My credit isn't bad at all and I have not been denied a loan or credit card ever but I know that doesn't mean I never will be denied. My plan is to apply for a higher limit credit card (if approved) that has 0% interest for X months and 0% interest for balance transfers for X months. I'm currently looking at one card that is 0% for 15 months which equals at about $700 per month but I can possibly do $800 a month to cut it down quicker. 

I have not tried to call and negotiate my interest rate with any of my cards either. 

I guess my question is, is this the best way to tackle this debt?

Edit: added some more details. Please feel free to message me for any other info!

Edit 2: here's my income and spending:

• income - $70,000
• car note - $420 (financed. $15,800 payoff)

personalfinance,Avalanche method vs paying off highest monthly cost,"Hi guys!

I'm curious if when paying off debt, is it better to pay off loans that cost you more in interest per month or loans that have higher interest rates.


For example:

I have a $10,000 loan at 8%.
I have a $2,000 loan at 24%


The $2k loan costs $40/ month
The $10k loan costs ~$67/ month


Wouldn't it be better to be making more payments to the $10k loan until it reaches an equal or lower monthly cost than the $2k loan?

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,29yo seeking to start an aggressive debt paydown campaign. Looking for advice on where to start.,"I'm a 29 year old IT guy who makes about 52k a year, before the feds are done raping my paycheck. I also do IT work on the side and that brings a little extra money in. I have the following outstanding debts:

#1: Visa credit card, limit $7500, balance $4700, variable APR 10.99%
#2: First line of credit, limit $4000, balance $3200, APR 7.25%
#3: Student loan, $6000 balance, 6.8% APR. 
#4: PayPal Credit, $1600 balance, 19.99% APR. 

On debt #1, I pay at least $200 a month on this. I usually try to do $250. It seems I pay about $45 on interest a month. 

On debt #2, I pay $85 per month, approx interest charges around $18-20 a month.

On debt #3, I try to pay $200 at least on this a month as well. Minimum is 150 I believe. I'm not certain but I think I pay around $15 per month on interest here (could not find good numbers in my statements)

On debt #4, i realize this one needs to go first. I have $1000 in cash that I am going to put on this when I get to the bank next.

So, all in, it seems my debt is costing me at least $80 a month in interest. I'm not too sure what my minimums are because I always pay more than the minimums when I can. I've been reading a lot on this sub, and wondering if a balance transfer to a different credit card for a promo might make sense? It also seems that I should keep my student loan right where it is, because I'm unlikely to get a better rate elsewhere there. Am I on the right track?

Because of these stupid life choices I am currently 6,300 in loan/cc debt.

personalfinance,Need advice on car purchasing,"Hello /r/pf,

After about a month of efforts, I'm about ready to give up on trying to purchase a new car altogether. I'll try to provide as much info as possible to seek advice. I'm a 25 y/o single male, relatively low income, but in a low cost of living area (Florida). Gross pay is 28k/yr, I take home around 2k/mo. My expenses are low because I live with a roommate, split between us rent and utilities are about $450/mo. Add other monthly expenses and I'm at around $800/mo. The rest is disposable or able to be invested.

Anyways, about 2 years ago my air conditioning in my old POS 1996 Honda Civic went out. In South Florida this is brutal. Summers are 90-95F+ and 90% humidity, winters are lucky to see 60F. I've daily driven it for 7 years and it has been mostly reliable, but I feel like any repair costs are eclipsing the value of the car at this point.

For the past year I've cut back on my previous shitty spending habits, and have been managing to save decent chunks of money every month. At the moment I have $9k cash, my shitty Civic, and a motorcycle that I can sell for about $3k at current market prices. I thought about selling the bike for more liquid assets, but I also wanted to keep it in case something happens to my Civic, I still have a way to commute to work. I was planning on selling it as soon as I make the new car purchase. I thought I could put $4-5k down on a car, still have a bit of money left for emergencies, and have more reasonable monthly car payments.

Here comes the real issue. For the majority of my young life, I haven't been building credit. I only started doing this last year when I made the decision to start saving money and spending more wisely. I only have one credit card open in my name. My credit score currently is at 730. But I have no prior loan history, and supposedly not enough lines of credit open. I also do not have literally anyone who is willing or able to co-sign on a loan for me. I had a friend insist that my credit score alone was good enough to secure an okay interest rate (not low like the 2-3% most people get, but not 15%+ insanity either; realistically maybe 6-8%?). When I attempted to make a purchase at a dealership, the lowest interest rate I was offered was 12%. I was a bit taken back by this, but the dealership insisted that I probably won't find much better elsewhere. I ended up walking out because I'm stupid, but not 12% stupid.

So I did things backwards, I ended up going to the banks after the dealership couldn't offer me what I was realistically expecting to get. I should've done this in the first place, but I was so eager with the purchase that I was ready to sign my life away to the dealer's profits. Anyways I've been to my own bank, and two local credit unions trying to get approved for auto loans. After trying to jump through hoops for the three places I went to providing documents they requested, I got turned down by all three. All of them stating that my lack of credit history and co-signer is the main issue. My credit score was decent enough to get low interest rates (3-4%) but underwriters are unwilling to approve it.

At this point I'm exhausted. I'm tired of talking to the banks, tired of being rejected, tired of hearing the same stories. I am an entitled toddler throwing a temper tantrum. I put some time and effort saving up money and attempting to build credit, but it is not enough to get what I want. I've been driving a shitbox for 7 years and I really wanted to step into something nice. Everyone I've talked to is just like ""dude just buy a used car with cash"" or ""dude it is just a car"". I know that's generally the advice of /r/pf as well, but I don't feel like I would be happy or satisfied with any of the used car options in my cash price range at the moment. I enjoy(ed) driving and riding my motorcycle, and I don't want that experience to become mundane and boring. Even if I purchase a late model low mileage car, it would still need to be financed.

Do I continue to save money and open more credit cards, and drive my Civic until the engine falls out or I have a heat stroke? Do I say fuck it all and take a bad interest rate and refinance down the road? I feel like I'm ready to make a purchase, but other people encourage me to just hold on a bit longer.",finance

personalfinance,"Best course of action for fiancée's and my student loans (~$110k), is this plan viable or stupid?","Hi PF - first of all thank you to all the folks who give advice on here, I lurk and sap your wisdom.

Here's my situation: I owe my parents approx. $22k, down from $40k for my undergrad degree. I cash flow'd my graduate degree, and that's all my debt (no car payment, credit cards, etc.). Fiancée has approximately $82k in Federal student loans with a weighted interest rate of ~6.37% (they qualify for PSLF, and she works full time for a nonprofit). My gross income is approximately $83kpy, she makes $35k, and is on the PAYE plan (currently paying around $137/month minimums on all loans). We plan to marry in about 13 months' time. We do not intend to pay anything on the other's debt until after we're married.

There are two approaches I have considered to this situation. The first is to pay off all the debt aggressively once we're married. Emotionally, this is what I want to do. If we suspended retirement investing and devoted the majority of our non-living income to her loans (which will be around $88k by then), we could probably pay them off in 16-20 months. Then we'd pay my folks back the remainder, which would take an additional 8-10 months, so 30 months total max, costing us around $110k with very low living standards.

Second approach is to file married/separately (remaining ""single"" for tax purposes is not something we want to do). This would prevent PAYE from accounting for my income. In this case, we've talked about maxing out her 401k contributions to drive down her adjusted gross income (hope I used that term correctly), which would effectively make her PAYE minimum payment $0. She'd be eligible for a PSLF application 8 years into our marriage, but instead of paying ~$12-15k toward the loan, she'd have over $120-140k in retirement savings, and we could apply to have the loan forgiven. Additionally, we'd still pay off my parents' loan aggressively in about 8-10 months once we're married. Assuming that's all viable, the primary risk would be that the rules for PAYE would change to include my income despite separate filing, without grandfathering in existing borrowers; also the government could change PSLF for existing borrowers, however unlikely. The other concern is I wouldn't be allowed to contribute to my Roth IRA anymore, but my understanding is that employing a backdoor Roth is a viable option in that case. Obviously once we start having kids (estimated 2-3 years into the marriage) we'd also forfeit those benefits for 5-or-so years, in addition to other joint benefits we'd miss. Is this plan stupid/crazy, or does it actually sound viable? Intellectually, this is what I would like to do. It's what she wants to do as well and it's our current plan. But if there are large flaws with it, she will be onboard with not going this route. I want the government out of my life as fast as possible but if we can truly do this and we aren't doing anything illegal, it seems stupid not to.

Lastly - are both of these approaches missing the mark, i.e. is there something I'm missing with some third, better strategy? I've done a fair amount of research but I'm not an expert.

TLDR; should we aggressively pay off ~$110k in student loan debt in about 3 years, or take advantage of government programs and tax loopholes to build retirement and avoid paying 80% of our debt, if that is possible.",finance

personalfinance,"140k in debt, just hired out of college, need help allocating salary!","Hey everyone, I would gladly appreciate any advice in my current situation, as well as any professional websites/offices that I could consult in order to find the best path to plan my future! 
I'm fresh out of college and just moved to the Bay Area so here's the basics:

-140k debt(all federal) from going to an out of state university. I know this is pretty high but oh well 

+75k base salary + 10% bonus working at an engineering firm and job security is good (biweekly pay is 2k after taxes)

+15k one time relocation bonus sitting in my bank account + another 2k from previous savings

-850/mo rent for my own room including utilities 

-80/mo car insurance, car is paid off 

All other insurances taken care of for benefits. 

Other expenses are pretty miniscule and I can keep eating expenses to less than 200/mo 

So here are my questions, my company offers stock purchases at 15% discount up to 15% of my base. They match 50% of the first 6% to my 401k.  

Should I be throwing all my extra money into the loans before putting anything into the benefits such as 401k or stocks? 

Do I have other options?

 How much a month should I be expecting to pay off my loans and how long would it take?

What is the best course of action for my 17k in savings? 

  I know this will be a tough process but I wanna be as prepared as I can and as early as possible. I haven't started loan payments yet but I know some of the interest has been paid during my undergrad by parents.

personalfinance,Would it make sense/is it possible to trade down?,"About 2 years ago I made the mistake of getting into a 7 year loan for a car. Now that I am trying to trim the fat off some of my expenses I notice my car note is still a glaring 350 and in comparison to other bills now it seems ridiculous. I have a great interest rate and 3 years left on warranty. I owe about 20k still, I did some playing around and I could get a car around 13k with some equity flipped from my trade I would only have to finance a max of 10k.

 Is this possible? Will a dealer sell me a used car for cheaper than my trade? My car trade in value is at 24k for ""fair"" condition. And it's still in very good shape.

The other question is... does it make sense? Is this a bad move and I am somehow overlooking it?

I recently moved and had my home on the market.  I had approximately 80,000 in equity in the home.  I had a buyer and they backed out due to chinese drywall concerns.  I was stunned, got a qualified inspector out to confirm and found out today, yes I have Chinese drywall.  

I've consulted with a number of attorney's via phone today in terms of lawsuit possibilities.  I am waiting on call backs from attorney's to speak about bankruptcy law etc.  But I figured you guys could potentially give some insight.  

In terms of a lawsuit, I am hoping that when my inspector goes back into the house he can find additional manufacturers of the chinese drywall.  The one that was found I have been told there is no action we can pursue against them.  So if I don't have any additional manufacturers, I've essentially been told there is no litigation I could realistically pursue against anyone.   

The finances of it.  Home is worth about $270,000.  I owe 194,000.  I have some debt that I was planning on paying off with the sale of the house.  Approximately $40,000 in student loans (graduate, higher interest rate).  Approximately $20,000 in credit card debt that was used in part to get the house ready to sell (haha, that was fucking smart right?).   And then I had taken out a small loan against my own 401k when I purchased the house, but that isn't pressing.  I think it's about 7k left on it.  

Those debts are between my wife and myself.  And both of our names are on the house.  

My initial instinct was to declare bankruptcy, let the house go and not pay any of the credit cards.  But I'm not positive that is the smartest financial decision?  Do I short sell the house and deal with the debt myself?  Do I continue trying to pay everything?  I won't be able to do that for long.  I don't think renting the house is a realistic option.  And the cost to fix the problem in the house is... for a barebones fix, probably $100,000.  


So... I feel pretty fucked, lol.  Anyone have any insight/ideas?  I really have no clue how to proceed from here.  It's not everyday you go from looking at properties you are planning on buying and building a house on, to considering how to declare bankruptcy.",finance

devops,Is DevOps Right for Me?,"So, to give a little background; I've been working as a 'DevOps Engineer' for 2 years now as an official role and have a CompSci degree. I previously worked using very simple ec2 AWS management and some scripting but now I actually spend my full time doing infrastructure as code and all the bits around that (puppet, hieradata, docker, networking, instance provisioning, monitoring, automation, jenkins and so forth).

The point I've now hit is where I am questioning if this is the career for me. I've spent about 14 months of the 2 or so years working in one team that are building a front end product, using a beefed up highly customised CMS system. And now work on backend API systems consisting of microservices using persistent and nonpersistent databases.

I recently as part of my current role had a large project to migrate to a newer database using much more robust authentication, backup/restore provisioning and a few other improvements too. 

The problem being from the above was that I found myself very unmotivated (I could even go as a far as to say apathetic towards my job at times) when I didn't know what certain things did or how to approach a problem, I ended up treading water as a result and not making much progress for periods of time with my bosses really expecting me to self direct my work more.

It feels like my co-workers who are 10/20 years my senior just know exactly what to do and have the motivation to learn things when they don't know what to do. Whilst I am pursuing online courses to bridge the gaps in my knowledge I just don't feel much of a reason to learn more currently and am wondering if many of you have felt in a similar position, or if this is just a subtle hint that it might be in my better interests to pursue other career options whilst I am in the early stages of my career. 

It may also be worth noting I am a somewhat extroverted individual and get my energy from communicating with others, which I realise in this type of career is more typically suited to those who prefer to be more introverted. I have considered a complete career change to something like the medical profession where you still have to use your brain but there is also a social aspect, however thought before I throw in the towel it would be worth leaning on the experience of others first.",technology

personalfinance,I just got denied a credit card by my bank (Regions). What is the best way for me to build credit on a small grad school income?,"Hey all. My divorced parents are each a financial nightmare and cosigning with either of them was not an option. In high school, my paycheck to paycheck with 30k of cc debit mom told me to NEVER get a credit card and I listened. I never got a credit card in college. I always lived under shoddy leases in my college town where my name was never on the electric bill and we split rent among many people and I drive a used car I bought outright from an insurance payout when my old hand-me-down car was stolen and totaled. I worked 2-3 jobs at a time and took out student loans (~25k total at public university after scholarships and pell grants.) Basically, I avoided any form of credit. I thought this was all smart at the time. 


This past winter, I got into graduate school for speech-pathology. Admissions is very competitive so I was shocked to gain entry. Similar to pharmacy, med, PT, or OT school, funding is far and few as merely getting in is hard enough. So I realized I needed to get a line of credit when I moved to this new city and got an apartment. 

I met with a representative at the local branch of my bank, Regions. Because my parents have garbage credit and I don't trust them, they couldn't cosign on a credit card. I also had no regular payments apart from, say, netflix. So at the instruction of my rep, I took out a small loan through Regions into a separate savings account to build some credit. I was told that after 6 months when I paid this $250 loan off (0% APR of course) I would qualify for their baseline card. Cool.



So I graduated college and then miraculously secured funding for my degree! Half off tuition and a $350/mo stipend for just 10 hours a week of work. This degree is clinic-based, so I have clinic from 7 am - 5 pm and then class  from 5:30 - 8:30 every day. We are not allowed to have other jobs. 



This is important because I met with a Regions rep in my new city after moving in. I did all the necessary paperwork and she said she would call me when the underwriters looked at my profile. My credit score was 650 solely due to a lack of credit but she told me I would be fine.



Well, today she calls me and lets me know I have been denied a credit card. 



My yearly income (with pre-grad school jobs and half a year of GA work) will be less than 6k this year, when it has been closer to 12k in the past. I will be taking out federal loans only to cover my half of tuition and rent. Cost of living is so low that for me after utilities and splitting rent with my fiance, I only pay $350 a month. 



So my monthly income will be $350, my rent is $350, and I have about 2k in savings. However, at Regions the minimum rent input is $400, and I was denied on grounds that my monthly costs exceed my earnings. Any loans I take out cannot be counted. 



I feel stupid and started crying when she told me. I should have gotten a card a lot sooner. My plan for my card was to put my day to day expenses (groceries, gas, therapy materials, etc.) on the card and pay it off with my stipend in full each month. Also, I know I will occasionally be told to make small purchases through my GA that will be reimbursed by the department. Obviously a credit card would be preferable for that. 



I've shopped around and Discover Student and Capital One seem like ""decent"" options, but have worse APR after a year than the card I was going to get at regions. I was also always weary of these cards as I received applications/ads for them in the mail all the time which seems strange.  So does anyone have any suggestions here? I won't have any income at all for 2 years, but girl from past graduating classes at say they are making on average 45-50k in their clinical fellow year and then 55k+ after getting board certified. There is a huge demand for this field in the area I live in, so I know that hopefully I will be able to get a real credit card after that. 



But what do I do in them meantime?

My expenses which cannot be put on a credit card are as follows:

$1635 deposit for house rental plus pet deposit

$1000 first months rent


Other expenses which will go on credit card and be reimbused probably within 2 months from the Army:

$1200 moving truck

$400 gas NC to TX (estimate high)

$400 hotels 3 days along the road


Debts:

$11000 Wife student loans, varying from 4.5-7% APR

$25000 My student loans. I have prior service and know I will stick it out 10 years for loan forgiveness. Nothing above like 4.5% APR

$2700 Car loan at 3% will be paid off 6/2018

$3700 Truck loan at 2.5% will be paid off 8/2018

$7000 Credit card debt 0% until 8/2018

$3000 Credit card debt 0% until 8/2018


I am thinking of paying off my wife's student loans entirely in one lump payoff. Her interest rates are higher than the Career Starter Loan rate. I am also wanting to handle the rental expenses so that I can write a check. Other than that I am not sure what I should do. These will put me at about $14000 on my Career Starter Loan.


Should I take out more and pay off the cars so that I have that burden lifted and can opt for cheaper insurance? The $3700 loan is for a SUV so I could sell that outright and buy a used Prius with the cash from doing so, but I have to finish the loan first. 


Should I take out the full $25000, pay off my Wife's student loans, set aside the rental house expenses, then put the rest in an index fund? My math is telling me my loan is 3% and an index will average about 7%, so it seems like a decent idea.

My biggest question is do I take the whole $25000 or just what I need for the relocation and I'm assuming the student loans because fffff those interest rates.

They're a big disruptor in a very old, and very dug in industry and it shows. It may matter long term who they are but I don't want them to be able to find out what my Reddit handle is, in private would be a different story.

**The debt:**

I currently have about $47k in student loans total. Payments should start becoming due November/December but nothing is finalized yet (that's a whole different conversation). Credit cards are about $4-5k with around $1k going towards that a month. It would not normally be this high but I had to move to accept this position and I did not have much cash on hand but I had $8500 or so in credit available. Given this my credit score is around 640 from the usual 730ish. On top of that I bought a Purple mattress to help out with sleep apnea. It really helps if anyone is considering it, still wake up at night but it's about half the number of instances.

**Stock offerings:**

The urgency is that right now, my employer is offering ESOP with a max 15% of my paycheck post tax contributed at a 15% discount of the stock price (the price has yet TBD but I have a feeling the price is going to rise or be stable). I make around $3600 after taxes and other items taken out (HSA, and health insurance premiums). Rent, electricity, etc leave me with around $1000 left over to do with as I please which I'm currently using to polish off my credit cards and other debts. 

We do have a 401k available and I was contributing the max of 5% however there is no matching right now. Every 6 months during a review we do get stock from what I'm told (I'm at month #2 as of this week) which is around 10 shares.My position does have room for upward mobility and the next step up gives me about $7k/year in pay additionally and if I stay for at least 4 years I'll have $7500 in equity share fully vested (apologies if I'm using terms wrong or incorrectly, finance is not my forte). Right now those shares are worth around $9400.

Since the 401k isn't matching right now I've currently set it to 0% and maxed out 15% on the ESOP. At the moment,the stock is worth $362.91. This time last year it was $223.24 and has consistently trended up since the IPO a few years back. This month's high was $386 and the low was $306. I'm fairly confident the stock won't crash anytime soon and with our recent product finally shipping we are on track to be extremely productive and successful.

**The Question:**

Now, what I want to get input on is if I should throw every spare penny at student loans? Or should I try to invest some of it and use the rest to pay off loans?

And would I want to consolidate my student loans? They're all through the Department of Education federal loans. Most subsidized. If consolidation is a good idea, does anyone have any suggestions on who to do this with? Would I want to wait until my credit score is back up to the 730 range or try to do that now so that I better know my future budget?

The 15% discount guarantees I win right out of the door but I'm told I have to keep the stock for a year or two and I don't know why off the bat. Something to do with tax rate on those shares?",finance

personalfinance,Paying off spouse's student loan debt or invest?,"Hey guys, long term lurker here..   Current situation is that I have 80k in the bank, and a job paying 52k a year.  I do not own a house, and total expenses are around 1k a month. 

My wife is currently entering her 3rd year of medical school, and by the time graduation rolls around she will have roughly 120k in student loan debt, at a 6.7% interest rate (I think).  We have been paying interest down as she goes so it does not compound.

My plan is to save roughly 90k to pay off this debt upon her graduation.  Is this the wrong way to go about it?  I do not have as much job security at my current workplace, so I do not want to put it all towards it currently. Also, I do not think investing it would give me any sort of returns greater than what paying off her debt would. 

Any advice is appreciated!

Edit:  Thanks everyone for the help.  I'm going to pay off 40k of the current outstanding, then as graduation approaches I'm going to pay everything else that I have saved, keeping 10k in savings.  Should be able to whip this thing in a couple of years post graduation hopefully!

personalfinance,Should I pay off low-rate student loans faster?,"Hi all!


I'm about to get married, and in the process combine finances. We already live together and share a joint checking account and credit card we use to manage our rent, shared car, and other shared expenses. Sharing costs have been going well, no worries there.


With the marriage I will be ""inheriting"" her student loans, which we will pay off together. My own student loans were all un-subsidized and carried interest rates close to 7% so I am eliminating them as quickly as possible. Her loans are a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized across ~10 individual loans adding up to about 25k. Less than half of that amount carries interest rates in the range of 6%, but the other 17k is closer to 3.5%. After the wedding, I was planning on aggressively eliminating our loans by paying ~$3k/m towards them for about a year, paying those with the highest interest rates first (above and beyond the minimum payments of course). We have a pretty decent emergency fund of about 4-6mos, but don't have any other cash savings. We fully fund our 401ks + iras so I'm not worried about retirement either.  

My main priority after eliminating the loans will be to save for a down payment. I don't think we'll be buying a house within the next 3-4 years, but I'd like to give myself the option eventually, and anywhere I'd want to buy will require at least $100-150k to put down 20%.  With that in mind, am I better off parking that money elsewhere, or eliminating the remaining loans ASAP? My question is, once the higher rate loans are gone and we're down to the ones at ~3.5% does it make sense to keep paying beyond the minimum (by this i mean the minimum amount to pay them of over 10 years)?",finance

investing,Why is the Indian government 6 month bond yield so high?,"https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/india-6-month-bond-yield
Does it mainly have to do with India being a developing country? I get that the bond yields are comparable to other developing countries. The way I understand it, yield rate is directly proportional to the confidence of the government paying back the bond capital. With the Indian government being so stable with BJP in majority in both houses (soon in the lower house) I'm kind of surprised that the short term bond yields haven't gone down at a much more rapid pace. I see a good investment opportunity and wanted to get the complete picture.

Am I missing something? Can someone explain why is the government paying high interest rates even for shorter periods?

Edit: I wanted to keep the explanation simpler. I get that Yield % is directly proportional to Inflation % and Investment Opportunity (Risk) % 

I have made a huge assumption that I'm going to get the same yield in the future as well but, even with that this seems like a really good opportunity to miss out on.",finance

*For Immediate Release*
               
Press Contacts: Washington, DC, Llew Claasen, press@bitcoinfoundation.org
                
Washington, DC – **August 16, 2017** – On August 16, 2017, Llew Claasen, the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, the world's oldest and largest Bitcoin advocacy organization, announced that the Bitcoin Foundation has retained counsel to advise it in its effort to push back against increased federal and state regulatory efforts to control and stifle the adoption and use of so-called “virtual currencies” such as Bitcoin.
                
The first priority in this effort will be to engage into a more open and diverse dialogue with the U.S. Congress, especially as it relates to the introduction of a bill bringing Bitcoin in the scope of money-laundering enforcement (see S. 1241-Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017).
                
This approach was recently reflected in the Bitcoin Foundation’s recent opposition to the adoption of the so-called “Uniform Regulation of Virtual Currency Businesses Act” by the Uniform Law Commission (“ULC”).  The Bitcoin Foundation remains opposed to this proposed model act because its approval by states would discourage inclusive financial innovation arising out of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  Furthermore, the Bitcoin Foundation continues to reject the proposed statute because states already have significant disagreements and approaches as to how to classify or regulate Bitcoin, and because the proposed statute is subject to significant legal uncertainty due to the current legal challenge against the New York “BitLicense” before New York courts.
                
*“This increased regulatory push by federal and state authorities, including criminally charging bitcoiners such as Faiella, Lord, Petix, Klein, Mansy, and Steinmetz, if it continues, is sure to threaten the existence of the fintech industry nationwide. Just as the fintech industry’s use of cryptocurrency was stifled in New York by the adoption of the so-called Bitlicense, it is highly likely that increased regulatory and legislative burdens will have a similar negative impact. These innovative businesses will migrate to more welcoming jurisdictions and weaken America’s ability to compete in the emerging field of fintech,”* Said Claasen.
                
The Bitcoin Foundation retained the Ciric Law Firm, PLLC in these efforts.  This firm is already challenging the Department of Financial Services’ “Virtual Currency” regulation promulgated in 2015 at Part 200 of Chapter 1 of Title 23 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations. This challenge was filed by a small business owner, Theo Chino, plaintiff in the case filed in the New York State Court System on October 16, 2015.
                
In 2015, NYDFS promulgated its controversial “Virtual Currency” regulation (Part 200 of Chapter 1 of Title 23 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations), also known as BitLicense, aimed at regulating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency businesses in New York. In October 2015, a small business owner, Theo Chino, filed an action in New York State Supreme Court against NYDFS arguing that the agency exceeded its regulatory mandate, and that regulating Bitcoin lies with the legislature, not NYDFS.  The case is Chino vs. NY Dept. Financial Services (“NYDFS”) (Index No. 0101880-2015).

*For Immediate Release*
               
Press Contacts: Washington, DC, Llew Claasen, press@bitcoinfoundation.org
                
Washington, DC – **August 16, 2017** – On August 16, 2017, Llew Claasen, the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, the world's oldest and largest Bitcoin advocacy organization, announced that the Bitcoin Foundation has retained counsel to advise it in its effort to push back against increased federal and state regulatory efforts to control and stifle the adoption and use of so-called “virtual currencies” such as Bitcoin.
                
The first priority in this effort will be to engage into a more open and diverse dialogue with the U.S. Congress, especially as it relates to the introduction of a bill bringing Bitcoin in the scope of money-laundering enforcement (see S. 1241-Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017).
                
This approach was recently reflected in the Bitcoin Foundation’s recent opposition to the adoption of the so-called “Uniform Regulation of Virtual Currency Businesses Act” by the Uniform Law Commission (“ULC”).  The Bitcoin Foundation remains opposed to this proposed model act because its approval by states would discourage inclusive financial innovation arising out of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  Furthermore, the Bitcoin Foundation continues to reject the proposed statute because states already have significant disagreements and approaches as to how to classify or regulate Bitcoin, and because the proposed statute is subject to significant legal uncertainty due to the current legal challenge against the New York “BitLicense” before New York courts.
                
*“This increased regulatory push by federal and state authorities, including criminally charging bitcoiners such as Faiella, Lord, Petix, Klein, Mansy, and Steinmetz, if it continues, is sure to threaten the existence of the fintech industry nationwide. Just as the fintech industry’s use of cryptocurrency was stifled in New York by the adoption of the so-called Bitlicense, it is highly likely that increased regulatory and legislative burdens will have a similar negative impact. These innovative businesses will migrate to more welcoming jurisdictions and weaken America’s ability to compete in the emerging field of fintech,”* Said Claasen.
                
The Bitcoin Foundation retained the Ciric Law Firm, PLLC in these efforts.  This firm is already challenging the Department of Financial Services’ “Virtual Currency” regulation promulgated in 2015 at Part 200 of Chapter 1 of Title 23 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations. This challenge was filed by a small business owner, Theo Chino, plaintiff in the case filed in the New York State Court System on October 16, 2015.
                
In 2015, NYDFS promulgated its controversial “Virtual Currency” regulation (Part 200 of Chapter 1 of Title 23 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations), also known as BitLicense, aimed at regulating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency businesses in New York. In October 2015, a small business owner, Theo Chino, filed an action in New York State Supreme Court against NYDFS arguing that the agency exceeded its regulatory mandate, and that regulating Bitcoin lies with the legislature, not NYDFS.  The case is Chino vs. NY Dept. Financial Services (“NYDFS”) (Index No. 0101880-2015). 
                
The Ciric Law Firm, PLLC, located in New York, NY, specializes in commercial litigation services for businesses, nonprofit organizations and individuals, as well as in cultural heritage law.

personalfinance,(UK) How do bonds where interest is paid monthly work?,"For example, I was looking at a bond with an interest rate of 2.5% AER, paid monthly. If I were to invest £1000, would I be left with with 1000*(1.025)^12 after a year? Or does it mean I get a 2.5% total interest after a year: 1000*(1.025)?",finance
personalfinance,"[Question][Credit](US) I have $3,000 to put down on a card, which one should i put it on?","Hello, I need help making a decision.

I currently have around $3,000 that i'd like to put on a credit card (or several) in order to lower my monthly interest charge or clear them. here's the list of the cards I have with balance and interest rates:

- Best Buy Credit= $6,477.03 (current balance) interest rate: 18.99% (minimum monthly fee $165- I usually pay $200/month)
- Sam's Credit= $1,798 (current balance) interest rate: 23.65% (minimum monthly fee $65- I usually put down $80/month).
- Amazon/Chase $4.002,89 (current balance) Interest rate: 15.24% ($114 minimum monthly fee- I usually pay $150)

As you can see, my concern is that the one that has the highest interest rate also has the lowest balance, so I don't want to mess up.

Thank you all in advance for your help.",finance
personalfinance,Worth refinancing a navient Student loan of $10k w/ 10.25% ?,"So im about to finish paying off the debt i acquired when i moved into my apartment a year ago since i bought new everything with my fiance (furniture, bed and etc) via no interest store cards. I plan adding the amount i would had been paying if i was still paying off those cards towards my student loans, about $600. I moved out my moms house a year removed from graduating and working a real job and currently make $65k. In hindsight, i wish i could still be living with moms to have the cost of rent be additional income but getting engage and being 27, it was time to move out.

I currently have $45k in federal student loans via greatlakes and $9,927 via sallie mae / navient. I want to focus on paying off the navient first as its the one with the highest interest with 10.25%. Right now im just making the standard payment on the navient while on a IBR payment plan for the federal loans. Couple of years ago my score was in the low 600's but have since improved my FICO score to 730. Ive been hesitant on refiancing the navient loan due to fear of being rejected and take a hard hit inquiry on my credit score but im to the point where i feel like i have a good chance on getting approved.

With that, would it be worth it for me to refinance my navient loan of $9,927 with a interest rate of 10.25%?",finance
personalfinance,[Serious][Long] What is the Best way to get out of debt?,"I am trying to get better toward my money. 2 different time this year alone, i have been unemployed for 1 month. The first month (Jan-Feb) I was unaware that my previous job was temp (amazon fullfillment) until my birthday when I attempted to walk in. Apparently an email was sent out, however alot of us did not receive it. A month later I was able to get a job at a call center. During that month, I don’t remember much. I do remember i tried to collect unemployment but before I could, i got a job. The second month was more so of over confidenceand unplanning. I discovered a government funded program that would train me in the Cybersecurity field. Since I previously dropped out of college due to learning and money issues, I figured this would be a good investment. The whole program is about 3yrs. After the first class however, i will be assisted in finding a related job (IT Fundementals). Because the first 2 weeks of prerequisites (for a lack of better words) I had to leave my job (second since Feb). Since I was in training at the time, i wasn’t allowed to miss but so many hours. With the classes, i couldnt miss but so many hours. So I had a decision to make. And I decided to stick with classes thinking I could easily find a job. It had always been easy for me. Before 2017 it would b 2 weeks before I could find a job. This wasnt a problem since I had money. I was proven wrong. Once reason, obviously is due to unplanning. The second is due to restricting myself. I refused to take a certain field, such as construction or fast food. I wanted a job I could be able to keep and possibly give me a career. Perhaps the fact Im a job hopper is another factor that played. Finally I took my fathers advice and applied to temp agencies. I tried at least 5 different agencies before I got a temp at a local college cleaning dorms. Wasnt the best job (another job zi would have refused appling to), but it was a job.

During this month i missed 2 months of rent to my dad ($800 total), a car payment and insurance ($500) a hospital bill paid monthly ($200). As for credit cards, i paid the minimum $50 (later ilearned it was $58). My credit spending went up during this month. With BP I had a couple hundred balance and now it is $1000. Capital One was already high die to chrismas spending. It was $2000. I had been driving for Amazon and made a couple hundred. I used that to pay down the balance and now it is now $1600. A year ago I literally walked out on cookout during lunch since I had gotten a job at Walmart. I was lucky to get it back after the temp job.

Seeing that this second month was worse than the first, I decided to see want I could do to make the most of my money and how I can save money in case I go through this again. My first start was to start saving again. During one of my bad month last year, i was forced to take money out of my savings to pay bills. That was around $400. I went to pnc my bank to deposit my first check from my temp job. I was in the negative by 400 and was told that i had to deposit it into my checking vs savings. After this I decided to look into another bank, after a hour of looking at interest rates, I decided Coastal Federal Union (CFU) would be my best bet. I also I saw that for me to make the most out of the account, I would need a checking account. I do admit I am still rather confused about credit unions and how it’s different from a standard bank.

While I was at PNC today depositing a check, I decided to ask a simple question. So i went in a told them I thinking about switching over to CFU. and I wanted to know how I could go about this. I had no ill intentions toward PNC. I had them Since 2012 when I opened my savings account. Somehow I ended opening up a checkings account and thats the story i ended with the Virtual Account. I was confused about it then and I am still confused about it now. I shouldve known the advice or whoever was not gonna help me for when Im ready to close my account. She attempted to convince me to stay by giving me advice how how to spend less money and make a comeback (since I was in the negative) she was ables to refund me $182 in overdraft fees. She told me to take out 60 (thrifty spending) + $25 (gas) and lock away my card. This was not a problem as I cannot use my card to begin with. She said it would help with rationing my money. Before I go on let me explain virtual reality: I have 3 accounts. One for checking, a short term savings, and a long term savings. I learned that from a youtube video. It seems like a good idea and would be better if I understood it. However that is too many accounts to keep up with. She had me put $50 in my short term (i think). And I free money when she showed me how to make a deposit on my app ($1.01), how to deposit a check at an ATM ($1.01 shit free money for something I already know), and how to cash a check at the ATM ($1.01 this I didnt even know was possible). She told me I should look into consolidating my debt of $12,000 since I also have a car loan through them also. Since I have a credit score of 742, she said another credit card would not help. After spending about an hour in there, i left unresolved but yet helped.

And of course on the way home I get hit with a speeding ticket. A problem but I have 2 months, so not that much of one.

I decided to go by CFU and see if I could make since of how they work. She did not really help. Probably due to my lack of communication skills. With PNC, she did all the talking and asked questions. With CFU, i told them i was thinking about opening up a checking account and not ready (in case they decided to pressure me into doing so). Honestly it was a waste of gas as she only mimic what was online.

So now I come to you all for the best advice possible.

**Short Term Goals**

*All by Jan 2018*

* Get my checking back to a balance of $1000 at least. The more the merrier. 
* Save $1500 for a security deposit in Dec/Jan. **THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE** 
* Get rid of all debt excluding the car payments. It should be noted that I has a hospital bill from last year. It recently went to debt collection. I only have $500 left to pay. Might be paid off on my credit card. I also have a paypal of $200 but havent heard from them in awhile. Haven’t seen it effect my credit score so im not too worried about it. 
* Aside from saving the $1500, just save money in general to have money in my account.

**Long Term Goals** 

* Save at least $5000 to move to Florida (in NC currently. 5 years) 
* Pay off my car and save enough for a down payment toward a Mustang or Camaro (used or new: unknown. Time: assuming everything goes right from now on: 4 years)

**Optional as of now** 

* Opening a retirement account. Dont know much about this and the sound of money coming out of my paycheck doesnt sound appealing.

**My debt**  

* BP: $1,034.29 *On hold for 1 week since I have $90 in cash from PNC. 
* Capital One: $1,919.36 
* Hospital bill: $500 
* Student Loans: $1,840.15
* Car: $9,090.61 
* PNC: $200 Deposit made today

**Normal Monthly Payments**

* Rent: $400 
* Car: $250 
* Car Insurance: $150 
* Gas: $25 to fill up estimate $75/month 
* Phone Service: $50 
* BP: $30 (auto payments) *will be 100$ when im stable* 
* Capital One: $60 *will be 100$ when im stable* 
* Hair cuts: varies $5-$20 
* Student Loan: $15
* Groceries: max of $100

With this information, please help me get stable again and lower my debt. And tell me the best savings option I have. I do not want to open another credit card. I am willing to switch banks. I am not trying to lose another month again. It was really depressing. Thanks in advance.

*Update: I had been saving spare change for the longest. After that saving plus the $90 i took out, I not have $128.60 in cash.*",finance
personalfinance,Credit Card History and Moving Banks,"I am married and have 3 credit cards. I believe only 1 is under my name. 2 are active and the other one is ""active"" but haven't used in a very long time. It also has a small limit - $500. I believe 2 of the cards are just under my name and the 3rd has both mine and my wife's. Each card is from separate financial institutions due to moving and just life situations.

I'm wanting to consolidate all my accounts to a new financial institution and wanting to just deal with them moving forward. I know a lot of your credit is based on your history and I've read in the past that I shouldn't just cancel credit cards as it could affect my credit. I have good credit right now and don't want to mess anything up as we plan on buying a house in a year or 2.

My plan is to take out a personal loan from the new financial institution and pay off the 2 cards and consolidate the debt onto 1 loan. I'm not too sure what to do with the 2 cards after. Any advice? I've also read up on consolidating debts and I feel like this is a safe route due to the lower interest rate and paying 1 interest rate vs 2. I would gladly take any extra advice on this though.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Prioritizing,"Hi Reddit,

So I recently graduated college this may with a B.S. in mechanical engineering at 23 Y/O. During the process I took out essentially 4 loans if I lump the federal ones together:

Federal: $33k total
WF1: $10k total 11.24% flat
(WF1 scares the fuck out of me)
WF2: $9k total 7.79% variable
WF3: $2k total 7.4% flat

I recognize that I could've done this in a much smarter way but not the point. So my question comes down to which private loan should I focus on; WF3 then snowball into WF1? Or just pound at WF1?

Here's my situation:
I worked for Lockheed Martin as an intern during my final year and then they hired me on as a contractor 3 months before I graduated. I was working 35 hours a week during final 3 months of school courses and came out with a 3.49. Because of how hard I busted my ass I was able to do 2 things:

1) saved up 6 months expenses (including rent+utility, auto, all student loans) = $11k. After midnight I'm at $12k. I've worked an average of 55-56 hours a week ever since the week of graduation. 

2) I was offered full time salary position this week in which I plan to counter for a few k more. Regardless it's a good foot in the door.

My biggest thing as a contractor was that I was not guaranteed overtime forever so saving 6 months was crucial for me. Now that I'm going to be salary with a decent pay (even if they deny my counter it's in my range) I could potentially dump some savings into my private loans. My grace doesn't technically end until November 4th but Ive already paid $1k off WF1 and setup auto payments with fed loans. The position I'm being offered will pay overtime (only after 5 hours) and this will be a viable option potentially for a few more months so I can keep cranking out more.

Some key notes is I have access to NFCU and USAA. I've recently opened up 3 accounts, USAA amex $8k CL for gas, Amex Blue $4k CL for grocery, and NFCU CR $16k CL. All my fako scores are in the 710-750 range. No CC debt since I'm only using these for the cash back.

I want to speak with NFCU about refinancing some of my loans but I don't know how likely that would be immediately since I literally just got the offer and all of my new CC's are less than a month old. They also declined my auto loan 3 months ago due to age of credit. I plan to do it at some point with someone but wanted to let the new accounts and inquiries age a few months.

Any advice at all will be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,How long is normal for a credit score to recover?,"About 4 months ago I bought my first home ($400k).  A week later I opened up a small biz finance account with Wells Fargo ($50k) as a 'just in case' option (5.35% static interest rate with no fees!).

My credit score went from 805 down to 760.  That's expected, as I now have a higher utilization rate.  I just logged into my Credit Karma account and now have a score of 812 on both Transunion and Equifax. 

That seems... a little *fast* to now have a higher score, when I am obviously indebted for more, and have a higher debt potential than I had before.  Does this sound right?  Is it a faster recovery/upgrade than normal?",finance
personalfinance,Paying Student Loans in Grace Period,"I have several student loans spread across different types

* Parent PLUS (refinanced into my name) @ 4.6%
* Direct Unsubsidized @ 3.76%, 3.86%, 4.29%
* Direct Subsidized @ 3.76%, 3.86%, 4.29%, 4.66%
* Perkins @ 5%
 
The parent PLUS loans were refinanced into my name with a private bank so I lost the gace period and need to pay at least the minimums on those. The other 3 I do not have to pay on yet because they're all still in grace. The unsubsidized/PLUS are currently accruing interest, while the subsidized and perkins are not.

My question is where should I target additional money towards to pay these off the quickest? I know typically you should pay any extra towards the loan with the highest interest rate, but does that change if the highest interest rate loan isn't currently being charged interest?

Would it be best to apply my money towards the perkins loans so that when they do start accruing interest at 5%, the principle will be smaller and the interest accrued will be less? Or is it better to pay extra towards the 4.6% PLUS loan that is accruing interest right now?",finance

personalfinance,Best HSA Provider? And am I doing the right?,"Open enrollment for health insurance is this week/next! And I noticed that we had a high deductible account eligible for an HSA. I'm 26 and hardly if ever go to the doctor and I know I can max HSA + 401k + IRA this year and next so I thought it was probably the right choice. 

However, my company uses Gusto as a benefit/payroll provider who do not offer an HSA as a benefit. My company will not provide an HSA account (or match etc). So I think I'm on my own to pick the HSA. I looked up some [sites](https://20somethingfinance.com/best-hsa-account/) that listed the different HSA account administrators that I could potential pick. I'm leaning towards Health Savings Administrators since they have Vanguard Admiral shares. Thoughts on them? Is there anything better? The annual custodial fee also confused me.

I live in CA. So I think I can't deduct HSA from my state taxes? Would doing it on my own mean I don't get FICA either since I'm using post tax contributions? 

Would I be able to deduct it from my federal tax rate? Are HSAs worth it if I have to do it on my own? My company pays 90% of the premiums from the providers. So the HMO/PPO plan isn't too costly

I do want to eventually get lasik and get reimbursements later on with my HSA. But I was still planning on waiting a few years for it anyway.

I want a security that roughly holds its current market value while providing an low risk income source. I'm wondering if this would be a good option for that.

MachineLearning,[D] Explaining ML to sociology students using a cat analogy — looking for feedback.,"My partner is a sociology student and is going to be using some machine learning techniques for her masters thesis (and possibly PHD). She has been tasked with explaining machine learning to others in the department; in particular her supervisor who struggles to turn on her computer in the morning!

After discussing it with me, and like all good internet users, she decided to use a cat analogy and I wondered if anyone had any thoughts, suggestions or feedback:


&gt; Can you train a cat and a computer?
&gt; 
&gt; In my research I am hoping to use an e-Research technique called 'machine learning' to identify and extract recipes from about 30 years of newspaper and magazine articles. However, as soon as I say machine learning to many in my faculty, I get blank and often bored looks back.
&gt; 
&gt; So, working from the standpoint that machine learning is understandable to all and that everything computing can be explained with reference to cats . . . here is my attempt:
&gt; 
&gt; This is my cat Trilby. She is 17 years old, a moggy and adored beyond the point which is humanly rational. While Trilby finds us acceptable humans (mostly), her main love in life is food. If Trilby had her way, she'd have an endless supply of biscuits in her bowl and would spend the rest of her time in a food coma. Trying to be responsible humans however, we only feed her twice a day.
&gt; 
&gt; Originally, I fed Trilby in the morning, as soon as I got up. Over several iterations of my getting up and feeding her Trilby *learnt* the parameters of breakfast. A pattern was established, the training was repeated several times and she learnt a new behaviour.
&gt; 
&gt; This worked really well . . . for a while.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately, after a time, Trilby also learnt another cue - if I woke up earlier, she got fed earlier. So, she started waking me up earlier and earlier, I would get up and feed her, the training would be reinforced. Until the morning when at 4.00am she woke me up by slipping her paw under the duvet and swiped my hip *with her claws out*. I can tell you this is not a good way to wake up.
&gt; 
&gt; The training had gone awry and we needed to come up with a new training model. So, rather than my feeding her as soon as I got up, my partner started feeding her *after* he'd had a shower. We all struggled with this new training model at first, but over several iterations Trilby learnt the new pattern of behaviour and does not wake my partner (or myself) in the morning.
&gt; 
&gt; This is just the kind of model I will be using in machine learning. At the moment, my computer can't recognise recipes. So, I will give it some cues and parameters and over several iterations of training, much as Trilby learnt the cues for breakfast, my computer will learn to identify a recipe. Then, once my computer has learnt what a recipe looks like, I can leave it to process my magazine and newspaper article download and find the recipes for me.
&gt; 
&gt; Machine learning is not magic, it is yet another process of learning, it's just my computer which is learning, rather than myself or my cat. Training occurs through small, simple iterative steps, which gives it the ability to process more complex tasks — in this case recognising recipes.",technology
personalfinance,"Long time PF lurker, finally admitting I need help! Please help me and my family.","Added per request: Current credit score 705 FICO 679 for both Transunion and Equifax per CreditKarma

&amp;nbsp;

A little bit about me. I am 30 years old, I work in customer service / life insurance sales. I currently make $15 per hour with OT and bonuses I make about 35k a year. I am married and have owned my own home for 2 yeas.  I am adopting my 13 year old nephew out of the foster care system. This adoption will be done very soon. My job is very secure, however my wife's is not, its actually ending in 1 week leaving us up in the air for her income. People always need a nanny so she never goes long without work. We have no savings, no windfalls, no help from family. Our credit cards are out of control, I never miss any payments and always pay more than minimum but they never go down. We are so used to using them and then I make a payment and nothing happens same balance give or take $50. Over the years one card turned into 2 and then 3 and so on. Use one to pay off another, only to start spending on the paid off one. I made a terrible foolish mistake of buying a brand new car, I was upside down with a lemon of a car. Was sick of getting nickled and dimed and just made the plunge. Currently I owe more than the car is worth and I barely drive it. I just hit 12k miles in 2 1/2 years. Stupid, stupid, stupid I know! My wife on the other hand drives a ton but refuses to drive my car even though it has 2x the MPG. I live 1 mile from my job, to lazy to walk but I could. My credit is fair, used to be around 740 but now its around 670 with my credit cards so close to maxed. I have no derogatory marks and 100% payment on time history. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am SERIOUSLY considering getting a loan from one of the companies that keep soliciting me. I want to take out a loan large enough to wipe out my CC debt and get rid of the cards. I wont close the accounts but I will lock the cards up. I do not know if this is a good idea or not, but I pay $700+ on my cards and they never move. I think I could get that loan paid off pretty quickly if we just buckle down. I need your help Reddit, is this the best idea? The hardest part right now is having so many active accounts and the temptation to keep spending on them. If my thoughts are right who is the best company? I get offers all the time from Discover, Lending Tree, Prosper and a few others. They all say I am pre-approved for up to $35,000 to pay off debt. Any advice, I am all ears, please help me!

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loan now or invest in a home?,"Right now I'm down to about $8500 in student loans, and I have about $9500 in the bank. I realize having savings for emergencies and the like left over after paying would be smart so I don't want to completely empty my account just yet. I'm also considering buying my first home sometime in the next year or so I'm trying to decide if it's smarter for me to use my money to invest in a home and pay the loans off over time or if it's better to just pay off the loans in one lump now and save up again to eventually buy a home further off in the future.

I have 3 small separate loans with between about 3-4% interest rates and my monthly payment is about $102. I'm currntly earning about $40k a year before taxes and come 2018 I will be earning about $50k a year before taxes. This doesn't include overtime (of which is plentiful and I will be taking advantage of). Other than car insurance which is about $1200/6 months I have no other debts or regular payments. Side note...I also have 3 cars, 1 of which could possibly yield $2-4k, and another I would be more reluctant to sell but could possibly yield $8-14k depending on the buyer (my toy 😁). This would also bring down my insurance payment if course.

Tldr: Do I invest in a home and pay off my student loans over time or just pay off all of my loans now and start saving all over again for a house?",finance

This puts me in the 25% tax bracket for California. I was thinking of using Ally bank as I hear about them a lot and the interest rates are basically as much as I am going to get. Is this a solid way to go? If not, what would you suggest?  Thank you in advance!",finance

personalfinance,[USA] Does claiming a standard deduction for taxes rather than itemizing have any effect on deducting business expenses (namely my vehicle)? Can I do both?,"I'm having trouble finding a clear answer on this.

Due to being a student and working only part time as an independent contractor (driving for Uber, dog-sitting through Rover, delivering groceries through Shipt), I'm definitely not going to make more than $6300 this year. Which means I'm more than likely going to claim a standard deduction come tax season and therefore won't owe anything in Federal taxes.

I understand that with a standard deduction you can't itemize your deductions, it's one or the other. However, I am under the impression that business expenses aren't related to the standard deduction, so I'm allowed to deduct business expenses related to my vehicle under 'actual expenses incurred' while still claiming a standard deduction of $6300. Is this correct?

Also, I do understand the standard mileage deduction is preferred over actual expenses incurred for Uber drivers. However, my car is under my father's name which means I'm not eligible to go the standard mileage deduction route. I can still do actual expenses incurred so that's what I plan on going with.

I do know that no matter what I am going to have to pay the 15.6% Self-Employment Tax as an IC. I also know that the standard deduction does not effect this at all, unfortunately. Standard deduction will only apply to Federal taxes. However, if I'm able to still deduct business expenses related to my vehicle, will this still reduce my taxable income from the Self-Employment Tax? For example, I deduct $1500 of $5500 due to gas, maintenance, oil changes, etc., that means I'm only paying the 15.6% Self-Employment Tax on $4000 of income instead of $5500, correct?",finance

I'm getting married soon!  woo hoo! i need more money! boo hoo! As a disclaimer, we're not here to debate the merits of spending money you don't have on a wedding.  Thanks!

So my fiance and myself have decided that we probably need to get a loan of 15k.  That should give us a little bit of buffer for any sort of ""oh shit, we forgot about xxx.""  I've been shopping around for personal loans and the interest rates are insane!  i can't find a Credit Union or a Bank to go below 8%!!!!  My fiance's student loans are only 5.3%!

So with that said, this is where we are.  i can get a 401k loan at ~4% interest(which is paid back to myself) or get a bank loan with ~8% interest.  The debt will be paid back relatively quickly(within 2 or 3 months most likely by wedding cash gifts).  I can't forsee the outstanding loan going past 6 months(but hey, things happen!)

So what have you.  who has a sound opinion on the matter?  Any experience one way or the other?

personalfinance,1040 ES taxes - from Fellowship stipend,"Hello everyone, 

I accepted a fellowship with ORISE with an annual stipend of about $55,000. I was looking into how to calculate the taxes I would have to pay, since federal, state, medicare, and social security will not be withheld. I know that I would have to fill out the 1040 ES form and pay quarterly. 

According to the 2017 Tax Rate Schedule, I would be in the third bracket ($37,950-$91,900). Does this mean that I would have to pay 25% of my earnings ($55,000) in addition to the $5,226.25? 

(0.25*55,000) + 5,226.25 = 18,976.25

If this is the case, does this mean I would have to pay quarterly $4744.06? That's insane that my taxes would be over 33% of my stipend.

personalfinance,"Should I consolidate high interest credit card debt, even though I am in good standing and have never missed a payment?","Hi Personal Finance,

I am self employed as a pianist, and do reasonably well $20,000 - $30,000/year.  Recently I have tried to consolidate the debt I carry to save in interest.   Many pre-approved debt consolidation companies have ironically denied me due to high debt to income ration, but I called up National Debt relief and it looks like they may be able to help me. 

The problem is, they can't consolidate one of the main loans I wanted to consolidate due to it being secured.  (This particular one was for a grand piano I bought, and carries a 13% interest rate!).  

The main reason for my debt was starting my business as a self employed musician.   I bought a grand piano to teach and record on.  A computer capable of recording, recording software, and digital interfaces/mixers, wires and speakers.   I also bought a portable keyboard, P/A, stands, etc and other necessary items for when I gig or play weddings.  

Current credit score - 665

My debt (all are in good standing and have never had a missed payment)

$7,884 on a car - 4.5 years left at $189/month.  This would not be consolidated.

$7,822, on the grand piano.  This is actually a 10 year loan which I am in year 3 of, but am trying to pay it off quicker as the interest rate is close to 13%.   Unfortunately this can't be consolidated due to it being secured by the piano.  The piano is appraised at $14,000.  Payments are $153/month.

American Express - $10,477 - Interest rate is variable, but the minimum payment is about $275/month.  My last statement showed $122 in interest charges.  I generally try to put $400/month down on this card.

Chase Card - $3,202.  This was a balance transfer, and in 30 days the original interest will be tacked on if it is not paid in full.  I do not have the ability to pay it in full before then.  Minimum payment is $32, but I generally pay $100/month.

Capital one - $392.  This is a secured credit card, which I am not worried about as it basically just has my insurances on it, and I pay it every month.

In order to work with National Debt relief, they want me to stop making payments on the Amex, and chase card (the only 2 they will help me with), so they can negotiate a better deal.  It also requires that I close out these cards.   

Considering that they can't help me with one of the main loans I wanted help with (piano), and that all of these accounts are in good standing, should I still go forward with the consolidation?  Is there a better method.  While I am able to make the payments on time, the interest is debilitating, it feels like I am getting nowhere. 

I have read through many of the advice columns here, and understand that consolidation can be dangerous as it doesn't solve the root problem of spending.  I however feel that this won't be a huge issue for me, as 75% of my debt was starting a business.  

My other expenses are: (per month)

Cellphone - $100
Car Insurance - $82
Groceries - $400
Gas - $150
Rent -$350 (really lucky situation)
Internet - $80
Gas/Electricity - $150 average, $240 in winter.

personalfinance,23 years old with student loans and employer 401k match. Roth vs. Traditional?,"Hey all,

So I'm a 23 year old single male who's one year into my first job out of college. I've been contributing to my Roth 401k at 5% for the last year, and now my employer matches 100% of my contribution up to 5%. 

I pay about ~$700/month in student loans, but I'd like to get that up to $1000/month. I figure I can make this happen with some budgeting and making some sacrifices here and there. I have a private loan at a rate ~10% and federal loans ~5%.

I understand that a Roth retirement vehicle is the way to go at a young age assuming that I'll be in a higher tax bracket later on in life than in my early career.

My question is that in order to pay off my private student loan faster, should I switch my 401k to traditional, and put the roughly 25% in taxes that I'm paying on my current contributions towards the 10% loan? Is it worth it in the short run to pay some taxes on distributions in retirement?

Thanks!",finance
investing,Market Jumps on Steve Bannon's Firing (or resignation) from the Trump Admin,"The market rationale being that Steve Bannon being gone makes it a better environment for Gary Cohn, and his pro-market/wall street economic agenda and policies. Also keep in mind that he's likely the next Fed chair, if trump admin remains intact. Whether or not and how long Cohn himself will remain, or if trump's admin and the GOP will be able to implement changes in the current, deteriorating environment, is yet to be seen.

personalfinance,The snowball method- paying off loan with largest monthly bill vs loan with highest interest,"I've been following the advice to throw as much money as possible toward the debt with the highest interest rate. Once it's paid off, you can use that monthly payment toward the loan next in line.

However, it can't throw that much extra toward this debt due to other high monthly payments, such as my car. While the car loan is only 3% versus the highest student loan at 10%, it is a much higher monthly bill. I was thinking- why is it not advised (or commonly heard) to pay off that debt with the highest monthly payment? The car payment is $300 monthly; that would be a good chunk to make available toward other loans. By chipping away at the student loans over the last 3 years, I feel like I've barely made a dent.

Which technique would you suggest in loan payoffs and why?",finance
personalfinance,Using a 0% intro APR credit card to pay off college loan,"My question is regarding my debts (mostly student loans) and my tactics for paying them off. Here are my debts:

* $2,500 Credit Card with &lt;1% interest charged every month.
* $3,500 at 3.40%
* $11,000 at 3.76%
* $5,500 at 3.86%
* $12,500 at 4.29%
* $10,500 at 4.66%
* $4,955 at 6.80%

I have frozen my credit card and that is the only debt I am actively paying off right now. All of my loans are from the federal government and not private loaners. Most are still in their grace period, but the interest on the unsubsidized loans is racking the total due up!

I get offers in the mail almost daily to sign up for 0% into APR (for 15-20 months) credit cards from CitiBank, Mastercard, Discover, etc... My question is: would it be viable/legal to open a 0%  Citi credit card, use it to pay off my 6.8% interest loan in full, then pay off and close the citi credit card before the 0% promo ends? Effectively I'm looking to avoid paying any more interest on that $4,955 student loan. Is this a dumb thing to do? Could I potentially hop from promo credit card to credit card and pay off all my loans like this? Would that ruin my credit?

Also, where can I go to lay out a complete outline of my income, expenses, and debts to get some general advice on paying them off quickly? Is there a sub specifically for that?

personalfinance,$155k in student loan debt. Plan to pay off as fast as possible. Advice needed.,"Hey /r/personalfinance, heres my situation (I'll try to keep it succinct):

**Background:**

* I work in tech in silicon valley CA (new grad level)
* Share a 2x2 apartment with a roommate
* Drive old paid-for car to work

**Income:**

* $107k yearly salary 
* 10% annual salary bonus
* $170k RSU on a 4 year vesting schedule, first 1/4 vests in May 2018

**Savings:**

* $18k in checking
* $22.3k in savings (~6month emergency fund, see expenses below)
* 10% of each paycheck into 401k, company matches 50%
* $5k in stocks
* $1k in bitcoin

**Expenses: (monthly)**

* $1850 (includes utilities)
* $200 food
* $60 gas
* $45 gym
* $15 internet

Not really paying for food during the week since its provided at work, but I eat out/drink on weekends. Phone is paid for by work.

**Student Loans:**

* $130k PLUS loans (between 6.06%-6.96% interest)
* $25k federal sub+unsub loans (between 3.5%-4.4% interest)

I have monthly minimum payments as follows:

* $1607 PLUS loan (I set auto pay to $1800)
* $258.77 unsubs+subs (auto pay set at this amount)

**Questions:**

I feel like Im set up fine, but these loans bug the shit out of me so I am looking for the fastest way out of them. Not looking for help from my parents, as this was my decision to invest in an expensive education.

1. Should I decrease 401k contribution? Leaning towards no, because my company match beats my loan interest rates
2. How much should I keep in my checking account? $18k seems like a lot to me and I am not sure where to put it
3. Should I maintain my position in stocks and bitcoin? Or is this a stupid move while I am in debt?
4. When my first 1/4 of RSU vests, should i sell immediately and dump into loans, or hold and reinvest?

Any advice is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage refinancing 15yr/30yr and removing PMI,"Hi all


About 2 years ago my wife and I bought a house with 5% down and a 4.25% interest rate (30 year conventional) that pretty much drained everything that we have. It was risky and it's debatable whether this was the best idea but we had our reasons. 


Fast forward 2 years and I've been extremely lucky, my salary has increased by over 30% to ~125k and I have ~75k saved, my job is very stable and in a very in demand industry. My wife has not been working as she has been unable but is now able to work again. Since she isn't working now though we don't want to consider any future earnings as part of these calculations.


Current mortgage situation is we now have ~10% equity and it would cost about 40k to increase to 20%. I have already confirmed with the lender that paying to 20% now would remove PMI assuming an appraisal &gt;= original value. 


The total mortgage payment per month is approximately $2800 inc tax, pmi, insurance etc. With other fixed expenses around $500. No debts or other loans. Total take home salary after taxes, retirement etc ~$7200.


My options are basically:

1. Keep current lender, increase equity to 20% and remove PMI. This would reduce monthly payment by $250 and reduce payoff time by 5 years.

2. Should I refinance to 15 year? Estimates suggest that this would increase my monthly payment by about $200-300 but ultimately save significantly in the VERY long term.

3. Should I refinance to a new 30 year? Estimates suggest that this would save ~$500 per month assuming PMI removal and same interest rate.

4. Something entirely different?


Are there any gotchas with refinancing, formidable 1 time payments? Does it even make sense in my situation? We intend to stay in this house long term.",finance
personalfinance,Tax question regarding bonuses (CA),"Hello, 

So the way my pay works is I make a flat hourly wage but a large portion of my income comes in the form of an incentive structure. For example, in hourly I got 1352, but in incentive I got 777. The problem is they put this in all in one check, meaning the incentive is withheld as a bonus at 25%. So even though I made 777 in incentive I had 717.99 deducted from my paycheck in total.

My question is is their any risk filling out my W-4 as exempt? Doing the math, I saw would I would owe in federal and state taxes over the year, and even in the amount I would pay during tax season my AGI would still be 9,000 higher than if my taxes were automatically deducted.

With an insensitive structure like this would it make sense to file exempt? 

Thank you for your help.

Edit: withheld my incentive, not taxed

I started making my student loan payments in November. I owed, I believe, $260/month on about $27,000 in loans but have always paid $300/month with the extra always going to the highest interest rate loans. I now only owe $205/month on that.

I will be attending law school next August. Assuming I may have to take loans then, what is the best move with my current undergraduate loans? Is there any point in paying over the minimum anymore?

Would refinancing increase my loan payments at first? Should I keep my current loan seeing as my payments are now much lower?  
  
**Side note about above retirement accounts. 1 is a 401k from a previous employer. I have not moved that money yet and have not even touched it but I don't believe the account is accruing money well at all.

personalfinance,"£20,000 to Invest. Where? (UK)","So to explain my current situation I am 34, no family, a decent job and low living costs ensuring that I have somewhere around £1000 a month of disposable income that I am mostly not spending. I do own my home but have a mortgage (£140,000 or so) but with a decently low interest rate.

I also have well over £20,000 in cash which really needs to be doing something other than sitting in my account. I could pay off a chunk of the mortgage but suspect this is not the best choice.

One option I have been looking at is buying a cheap house locally and renting it, but this would need a 25% deposit and given the taxes/expenses for second properties I should probably save another £10,000 or so before considering it.

What should I do with that much money in the meantime to avoid it just sitting around being eaten by inflation?",finance
personalfinance,Changing careers: advice on next steps,"I am a single 31 year old lawyer who has been practicing for 6 years,considering taking a large pay cut, career change and lifestyle change to go back to school to get my MLIS and become a law librarian. Currently making $130k (take home $7600 a month). Average entry level law library job makes in the $40k-50k range. MLIS costs $18k, probably would aim to complete it online while working full time, over 1.5 years. Looking into options where I might work at a public library during that time and get tuition assistance, but that's up in the air and nothing I am depending on. Here's my current debt/savings situation:

27k student loans refinanced at 3.3%. $580/mo, on track to pay off in early 2022.

17k student loans refinanced via my sweet parents at 3%. $375/mo, on track to pay off in 2022 also. 

17k auto loan. $400/mo. Also set to pay off in 2022 by chance...this interest rate is just under 3% I believe.

15k in a mutual fund. Contributing $150 monthly. Considering moving this to a better performing fund in the near future. Would like to let this keep growing because I am in my early 30s and know I will want to buy a house in this decade. Goal is $30,000 for house DP. 

40k in savings. I would like to move $25k of this into a high yield savings or no withdrawal penalty CD soon. This would be my emergency fund.

Roughly $50k in my 401k that I have no plans on touching. 

Should I use $10-15k of my savings to pay off a good portion of my student loans now? Or keep it handy for future tuition/more emergency fund given the unknowns during a career transition? I am considering at some point trading my car in to get a lower car payment, so not interested in paying the car off immediately. 

Right now housing/utilities/phone/insurance (fixed costs) are about $1500. I am working on my spending, which I have not been great on in the past,and will be reducing some of my housing costs soon which should allow me to bring in more money to pay for school and/or pay off debt. I would like to avoid student loans for tuition but it may be unavoidable.

technology,Congressman's Reply to Query about Net Neutrality,"This was what I received in response to asking him to support Net Neutrality. Clearly I'm not going to get any support from my elected representative. 

  



&gt;Thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality and internet freedom. I appreciate hearing your views on this issue. 

&gt;For the previous twenty years, the internet has flourished with little government regulation and has undergone rapid growth during this time. I want to see this success continue into the future without the heavy hand of Washington bureaucrats.
&gt;
&gt;Recently in 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) made an unprecedented power grab by reclassifying internet service providers from Title I “information services” to Title II “telecommunications services,” using regulatory powers they did &gt;not possess without the consent of Congress or the American people. This reclassification treats the internet like a utility, subject to similar controls for the water or energy industries, threatening current and future internet development with a web of &gt;government regulation without the input of the people’s elected representatives. 
&gt;
&gt;Earlier this year, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai proposed reversing the 2015 decision with the intent of restoring the market-based policies necessary to preserve a free and innovative internet. In doing so, Chairman Pai recognized that decisions on how to regulate &gt;internet service providers should be made with the benefit of open Congressional debate and with public input, not by an unelected regulatory body. 
&gt;
&gt;I appreciate hearing your support for maintaining a free and open internet. Just as I led the fight to thwart internet-hampering legislation previously, such as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), I will continue to work with my colleagues to prevent harmful &gt;government over-regulation from stifling online freedoms. The internet is a key pillar in our 21st century economy and I work to ensure it is not threatened by the missteps of cumbersome, antiquated Washington.

personalfinance,Roth IRA Question,"Hi all,

I hope this isn't a really stupid question, but I want to verify my understanding of Roth IRAs before I make a move.

So we currently have a myRA account. It's a Roth IRA through the government - guaranteed never to lose your money on it since is tied to the treasury interest rates or something. I am aware that it is a horrible retirement account BUT we actually have used it as part of our emergency fund. We opened it last year so we put the max $5500 in it. It has earned around $10 a month I believe in interest. 

I just received a letter saying the government will be discontinuing the program and that I need to remove the money. I need to verify that I understand the following:

1) I can withdraw the original contribution of $5500 with zero tax or penalty. I would then need to roll over the interest earned to another Roth or I will be liable for tax on that part (not like it would be much).

2) ANY Roth IRA has a policy that you can withdraw your original contributions, just not any earnings. So, if I did roll over the entire account to a new Roth, will that $5500 still be considered an original contribution on the new Roth? I'm not experienced with rollovers.

3) The myRA is in my husband's name. He has no other open Roths at the moment. I have a Roth in my name. Is it possible to roll it over to me or no? 

I am considering just withdrawing all of it because our emergency fund in the local bank took a hit earlier this year and I am not comfortable putting it in the market. The interest earned is not substantial enough to consider rolling it over in my opinion, but I just want to make sure my current thought process is logical.

Bitcoin,[Serious Question] Real interest rates and Bitcoin lending in a deflationary environment,"I've been thinking about this for a while and my comment in another post on this sub got me thinking about this issue more. I am posting here to see if any people have come up with solutions / discussed the following, which I see as a potential issue that will need to be overcome.

Maybe not everyone will agree, but I think it is clear that we need effective systems of lending to have a useful currency. Right now people who buy a house use their own money for ~20% and other people's money (ie the banks) in the form of a loan for the other 80%. I am not saying everyone should buy a house, but it is probably a net good that there are systems in place so that people can afford to buy a home/other large ticket objects before saving up 100% of the purchase price.

Lending depends on the idea of interest rates, the amount of money that you pay to borrow money. For example, you may get a loan for 10,000 USD and have to pay back 10,500 USD. In this case, the nominal interest rate is 5%/year. The REAL interest rate (in buying power terms) will be: Real Rate = Nominal Rate - Inflation rate. If the inflation rate is 2% for USD, then the real rate on that loan is actually 3%.  (5%-3% = 2%)

With a currency that appreciates in value over time (ie is deflationary) rather than depreciates (inflationary like most fiat currencies), the inflation rate in the above equation is negative. Consider a deflation rate of 10% in the above situation, ie Inflation Rate = -10%/year. With the same loan from above the Real Interest Rate =5% nominal - (-10% inflation) = 15%. We can see that because of the deflationary environment, the true cost of the loan in buying power terms is quite a bit higher. 

If people anticipate deflation (ie currency appreciation), then interest rates should naturally adjust downward. However, there is a lower bound to how far down nominal interest rates can go.  No lender will lend at a nominal rate below 0%, because they would be better off just keeping their money.  I used this example in another post. 

 * Scenario 1: Deflation is 10%/year. Keep 1btc. Lend none. After 1 year you have 1 btc. 
 * Scenario 2: Deflation is 10%/year. Lend 1 btc. Ask for 0.95 btc in return. 

You have more buying power than you did a year ago... but you still only have 0.95 instead of 1 btc. 

Thus in an appreciating currency, the best real interest rate you are likely to get is = 0% nominal + Deflation rate. If the deflation rate is high, then loans will be punishingly expensive, making it not economical to get a loan. 

  Has anyone thought about this issue and how to get around this problem?

Recently the SEC declared the DAO as securities:
https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131
Basically this means that they are subject to the agencies regulations. From their standpoint, these tokens are a form of shares and selling them without licenses violates federal securities laws. Many people who were unable to access ICOs because of geo-restrictions used VPNs. From my knowledge, the reasons ICO providers prevented US citizens from participating was to protect themselves legally from the United States government. That is true, but also note that the investor themselves can be at fault as well.

personalfinance,Using Total Control Account to Pay off Medical School Loans?,"Hi

I have a Total Control Account of about $154k at 1.5% annual yield. I also have about $118k in med school loans (~5-6% interest rate) and another expected $72k in tuition/loans before I graduate. 

My spouse and I want to buy a house at some point in the future. Our thinking is 

1) Pay off the current $118k loan using the TCA

2) Use the remainder of the TCA to pay off part of the expected tuition. 

3) The remainder of the tuition (about $36k) we can pay off from our own savings. 

Under this scenario, I will finish med school debt free and not have to worry about interest. My spouse's income and my residency income will be pure income and we can probably live off of one income and use the other to save for a down payment for a house. 

My questions are

1) Do I have to be aware of anything with using the TCA to pay off the loans/tuition? (e.g. taxes, fees, etc.)?

2) Is this the best course of action?

I have no debt, and manage to pay my credit card in full each month (it can be as high as $2K as NYC is $$$, typically closer to $1K). I also end up helping the girlfriend out quite a bit, as she freelances and some months are better than others for her. My employer has committed to a minimum 3% raise per year, and I know there is room for upwards movement.


I guess my questions are... Is something glaring and obvious that I'm simply blind to beyond cutting expenses? Can I in some way make my money work better for me than it already is? I don't think I make nearly enough to warrant a financial advisor, is this true? I know I'm doing better than some of my peers, but I don't want to grind 60-70hr weeks until I'm in my 50's with nothing to show for it.


I'm nowhere near FI/RE, but the more I read the more intrigued and inspired I am.

personalfinance,Closing Costs Options. How to allocate 15k,"1st time home buyer. The seller has agreed to givs us 15k to cover certain minor and major fixes. The major fix down the road is a an 18k garage wall fix in about 2-4 years. All other fixes involve minor leaks and improvements (total ~1,200). 

Because credits can only be applied to closing costs, we can only accept 8k as a credit right now. The other 7k has to be allocated either to points to bring down the interest rate (currently 4.25) or reducing the total home price (currently 450k)

We have enough cash on hand to make the current down payment + closing costs up front. I'm wondering your thoughts on how we should allocate the 15k. Options:

1. 8k toward closing costs, 7k to lower home price
2. 8k toward closing costs, 7k to points, remaining to home price
3. All 15k toward home price

personalfinance,"College freshman with ~8k in savings, what should I do?","I've been able to save up 8k throughout high school but mainly this summer. Another asset I have is a 2005 Ford 500 but I will not have it down and college and am lending it to my mother since my brother totaled hers. 

I am taking ~5800 in student loans for my first year but $4900 of that is subsidized loans which won't accrue interest until 9 months after graduation. The other $900 is unsubsidized, and I accepted this loan amount before realizing I could waive medical in college so I thought I'd need the extra money. I won't be taking out anymore unsubsidized loans ideally. And only plan on taking subsidized loans next year then I should have my tuition paid for with scholarships and then pay for an apartment and housing on my own. 

My main question is what should I do with my $8000. Ideally I'd like to keep at least a couple of grand as an emergency fund. Also I have applied for a credit card through my bank but will likely be denied due to no credit history. I will try and open a secured line through my colleges credit union and keep utilization to 10-30%. I was thinking about investing a $1000-$3000 in the stock market, I've been mainly interested in stocks like V and AMD. At this level with such small amount I'm investing how should I diversify my funds (like how much per stock)? I've looked into one year CDs but most have about 1% interest rate and seem almost worthless. Are there any other options I have?",finance
personalfinance,Buying a Car Before a House Advice,"My husband and I are looking to purchase our first house in March of next year, but I would first like to buy a used car in October of this year. The credit union we plan on using for our mortgage offers their lowest interest rates for credit scores of 740 or higher. Right now my credit score is about 770 and my husband's is about 760. 

My question is, how will a car loan affect my credit score? I've read that it will affect my credit utilization, but I'm not sure how that works. I know my credit utilization needs to stay below 30% (it's at about 15% right now with my current car loan and monthly balances for a credit card). Will the price of my car be added to my available credit to determine the credit utilization amount? Basically, I want to ensure that a new car loan won't damage my credit enough (in addition to the hard pull itself) to take me below the ""excellent"" credit range. 

Some other information: First, the only other debt I have apart from paying off our credit cards monthly is about $3000 remaining on my current auto loan and a $9000 account balance on a 0% interest rate credit card of my mom's that I'm an authorized user on and don't want to remove because it's my oldest account by far. Second, I'll probably put the new auto loan in only my name so a hard pull doesn't affect both my credit and my husband's. Third, I know that obtaining a loan for a car will lower the amount of a home loan we are able to attain. This is fine with us as we plan on spending much less than what we will likely qualify for on the house. Finally, I know that waiting to buy a car after the house is an option, but it's one that I would prefer not to take unless the credit hit will definitely bring me below the ""excellent"" range, so please save that piece of advice, as it's already being considered as our backup option. 

Additionally, if there is anything else we can do in the next six months to help improve our credit (account age and total open accounts are our ""lowest rated"" areas), we'd appreciate that advice as well. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,"New Job, Student Loans, Medical Debt, My Finances -- Need Advice :)","Hi all,

I am 22 and just got a new job after graduating and need some advice about how to deal with the bills I have as well as budgeting expenses. I read this sub daily and have a decent idea of what I need to do, but want to confirm or get an alternate opinion from all of you!

**Monthly Income &amp; Savings:**

* Monthly After Tax Income (before overtime) -- $2,400
* Checking Account -- $1000
* Normal Savings -- $1,500
* Recent Windfall -- $8,700
* Stocks &amp; Mutual Funds -- $6,000

**Debt:**

* Outstanding Medical -- $500
* Student Loan Balance -- $28,000

**Expenses:**

* Monthly Rent (living at home but contributing) -- $200-300
* Savings Goal -- $240
* Food -- $200
* Fun -- $150-200
* 401k w/ Match -- $145
* **TOTAL** -- ~1010

To preface, my student loan interest rates are at max 5%. I was thinking about using all of the windfall on the loan balance and then putting around 1400 a month towards the loans.

If using the windfall, I could have them paid off in 14 months.

If using the windfall + stocks, I could do 9-10 months.

I am also considering maybe my savings goal is too high (at 10%) especially, when I'm not really saving towards anything, unless my normal savings are too low.

I'm young and living at home, and I feel my expenses are minimal -- I'm not sure if a huge emergency fund or big savings target would benefit me as much as somebody else.

1) What are the benefits of paying my student loans off in 9 months vs more than 1 year? -- I'd like to live on my own ASAP I think, but need to pay these loans off first.

2) I am willing to be frugal, and if I don't use all of my fun or food spend in a month, I will put that towards loans or other debts.

Anybody have any opinions on this?
Thanks so much!

personalfinance,Trying to figure out taxes - dependent with income from various sources,"I moved from my college town to a new town for an unpaid internship that will start in January. In my college town I had a student job, for some reason (someone explained it to me once that I was working for a public university so I was counted as a government worker bc it was partially federally funded?) I didnt pay social security or medicaid. I've had witholding taken out this year, I think bc I made a mistake when I filled out my tax form when I was accidentally taken off payroll and had to be put back on. I made 2,565.41 this year there.

I'm trying to find jobs so I can save as much as possible for during and after my internship. I was offered a job as a afterschool care worker, and it is contract work. I would get a flat rate per shift I work, about $25. I would theoretically work this job four days a week for every week until school ends for Christmas.

I have an account on rover.com and have been paid once for a housesitting job and theoretically will get little jobs for the rest of the year. It's my understanding I will have to pay self-employment for this as well. I've made $75 so far.

I am also looking for another stable part-time job, the one's I've interviewed for would not be contract and I would have taxes taken out as I receive each paycheck.

MY QUESTION IS: How much should I save to anticipate owing the IRS come tax season? I know self employment taxes are 15.3 for the contract work, which would be around $250-$300 from how much I would probably make from the afterschool job. But would I also owe income tax if I make more than like $7000? Like I said before, I'm a dependent, my parents pay for my rent and utilities and a lot more. All of the different jobs and tax laws and tax brackets are confusing to me trying to figure out how much I should save to pay off any self-employment/potential income taxes I would have.",finance
gaming,Are Sensitive Players Welcome in Online Gaming?,"I have been gaming since I was at least 7 years old. My very first game I ever played was a Nascar game for he PS1. I can easily look at my stack of PS2 games and, just by the spineart, recall memories from almost every game on that list. Now, 16 years later, gaming seems different to me. People seem...meaner.

Now, toxicity is nothing new to me. My first experience with gaming toxicity was in the multiplayer lobby of Black Ops in 2010. Up until that point, I had always needed a friend or a family member to come over to my house to play PS2 with me. However, back then I fancied myself someone who was hardcore and didn't care about the abuse flung my way. I was going through my ""emo"" phase and had the mentality of ""fuck everyone in this lobby"". But that was just a phase. It wasn't who I really was. It was only after that phase subsided that the true me started to deal with toxicity and it was absolutely horrible.

I've always been a sensitive kid. My parents never told me I needed to ""be a man"" or that I was ""weak"". I never went out hunting, I never was taught how to fight, I didn't play sports...Hell, I didn't even participate in the old ""dissect the dead frog"" assignment in school because the thought of mutilating an animal, even a dead one, made me extremely uncomfortable. My mom gave me nothing but love and affection and my dad wasn't really the manly type either. I was raised to be a lover, not a fighter. Compassion, kindness, empathy and love were the core values instilled into me and that's what made me who I am. I am terrified of conflict and have mild social anxiety.

So naturally, upon hearing toxicity in games, particularly within Overwatch over the past year, it severely bothered me. It got so bad that I officially gave up playing competitive Overwatch once I finished my Season 5 placements. Even if myself or a friend wasn't the one being attacked, it was still disturbing to watch one player abuse another. My darkest fears would run through my head. ""What if that person being attacked is suffering?"" ""What if they got onto this game to calm themselves down after a fistfight with their parents?"" ""What if this one toxic player's comment is going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back and that victim of toxicity was just given their final reason to off themselves?"" I think these things, petrified, knowing I should intervene, but I know if I do it will all just get re-directed back at me, and I myself am too fragile to take that kind of abuse on either. People on other subreddits have decided I have a Superman complex. I wouldn't say it's quite the same thing, since I don't get off on saving people, but I won't deny that saving people is the goal.

On countless subreddits I've asked, ""How do I deal with this? It's killing my love for the game and causing me more stress when I should be de-stressing."" I almost always get the same universal response in one phrase or another: ""Quit being a pussy."" ""Man up."" ""Develop a tougher skin.""

I'm not here for advice this time. I know that no comment on Reddit is ever going to make me change who I am and I have accepted that. Instead, I wanna ask a question. Why? Why do we respond this way to sensitive people who just want to enjoy a video game. Why is it so hard for people to accept that, for some, toxicity isn't a mild inconvenience but instead a crippling virus that can choke and strangle one's passion for video games to death from their soul? Are people who are sensitive like me even welcome in the video gaming scene?

I feel like kind, caring, fragile people like me are the silent minority. It's like if someone points to toxicity and says ""this bothers me"", the gaming community's response is to just ""get over it"". Lest we forget, ladies and gents, verbal abuse is NOT NORMAL HUMAN BEHAVIOR. Just because the community has become complacent and has accepted abuse as ""the norm"" doesn't make it acceptable or right. I know it's a problem that's too big for one person or even one company to solve, and I know that the rallying cries from people throughout this Industry and others to just be nice to each other fall upon deaf ears when emotions are high. I know toxicity isn't going away anytime soon, but why must those opposed to it be cut off? Why must their negative reaction to a very unnatural and unhealthy human interaction be scoffed at and pushed aside?

I don't feel welcome in Overwatch. In fact, I've never felt truly welcome in any online game. It's like every battlefield I step onto, whether it be a warzone or a golf course, I'm the only one there looking to have fun. But I came here to start up a discussion. So, in your opinion, are sensitive people welcome in online gaming? Should everyone have the ability to enjoy a game or should the sensitive people stay away from your favorite pass time?",technology

personalfinance,Financial Planning for closely timed Student Loan Refi / Home Loan / First Baby,"I recently completed my medical residency, and am fortunate/excited/terrified to have a number of life events occurring all at once (new job starts next week, student loan refi, house purchase aimed for spring 2018, baby on the way in spring 2018).  I have reasoned out the below plan from my research and was hoping someone could offer any advice, criticism, or agreement.    


My financial situation:    
**Current Debt**: $153,000 at weighted avg 6.5%; have offer to refinance at 3.625% fixed on a 7 year term at ~$2100 per mo payment; no other debts (cars and wife's loans paid off)    
**New Income**: $260,000 pretax, also with chances to work extra shifts    
**Signing bonus**: $75,000 structured as a forgivable loan at 2%; forgiven 1/3 at 5 years, another 1/3 at 6 years, and final 1/3 after 7th year working    
**Wife income**: $74,000 pretax (will return to work a few months after baby)    
**Retirement**: ~$70,000 saved for me, ~$45,000 saved by wife    
**Savings currently**: ~$30,000    
Strong ~760 credit scores    


My current plan is to refinance my student loans now at that dramatically improved interest rate as I don't qualify for PSLF.  Subsequently I will be receiving the above listed ""bous-structured-as-a-loan"" which I will likely combine with our current/future savings over the next few months until ~March 2018  to create a home loan down payment.  We live in the expensive greater-DC area real estate market, and are unfortunately looking at home in the 600k-700k range.  I believe I will qualify for a ""Physician Loan"" which will allow me to put down minimum of 5-10% without PMI (though I will likely do more than that), and also will exclude my education loans from my income-to-debt ratio.    


Questions I'm hoping someone more knowledgeable can help me with:    
1.  The $75,000 bonus at such a small interest rate that is eventually forgiven is obviously great.  With it being structured as a loan, will this actually impact my mortgage rate in any meaningful way since it'll likely be viewed as debt?    
2.  Is there any benefit to refinancing my student loans after obtaining a mortgage?  In my mind it seems like it would be more difficult and may result in not getting approved or a worse rate given my increased debt from home loan.  The only benefit I could think of would be choosing a longer term for student loans if the monthly cash flow was tighter than my mock-budget showed.  And even if that is the case it appears I could simply refinance my student loans again later next year if needed.    
3.  It was rumored to me that physician loans carry worse interest rates than conventional 30 year mortgages?  I plan to get quotes for both but was curious if anyone could comment on that.    


Would appreciate any other insight and advice.  I think I've budgeted for house closing costs, continuing emergency fund, retirement contribution when employer match kicks in Summer 2018, adding life insurance through employer, etc.  I admittedly don't have a clue what kind of money I'm looking at for the early stages of a newborn, but tried to build in a buffer knowing it's likely a very variable number.

personalfinance,Was given some savings bonds and wanted to see if I was planning on handling them okay,"Hello PF,

I was given some savings bonds yesterday and wanted to know if my plan was the best way to handle them.

My Situation:

* 26 years old
* ~$50k salary
* 767 FICO
* Only debt is ~$9k left on my auto loan at 1.99% on which I've been paying extra principal each month (expect to have this paid off in 15-18 months at current payment rate)
* ~$2k E Fund in Ally earning 1.15% and putting $300-500 away each month until I reach my $10k goal (savings amount will increase when I pay off my car)

The Bonds:

* All series EE issued from 1992 to 2003
* Can't seem to use them for tax exempt education spending (I want to get a masters eventually, but sounds like I had to be 24yo+ when the bonds were issued?)
* Bonds currently worth ~$7k
* ~$2,500 of the bonds are currently earning 4.00% interest until they reach their 30 years from issue date (ranging from 2022 to 2025).
* ~$3,000 of the bonds have already matured and are still earning interest until the 30 years are up (2025 to 2029) with interest rates between 1.01% an 1.68%
* Final ~$1,500 has not reached their doubling date are are earning interest between 1.07% and 1.68% (15 $100 face value bonds have 17 year maturities ranging between 2017 and 2020 and 4 $100 face value bonds have 20 year maturities which will all mature in 2023)

My Plan:

* Let the bonds earning 4.00% interest continue to accrue interest as it is risk free and above the 10 year T-Bill rate
* Let the bonds that have not yet doubled reach their doubling date upon the 17 or 20 year maturity date and then cash them out if their interest rate is below the 10 year T-Bill rate
* Cash out the bonds on their next interest payment date that have already doubled and are earning less than the 10 year T-Bill rate

So, this plan would provide me ~$3,000 (current value) in taxable gains within the next couple months. **If this plan is the best plan available to me with these bonds, what should I do with the ~$3,000?** My options are:

* Pay down a large portion of the auto loan (1.99% loan is higher interest than the bonds are currently gaining, so this would still be a ""risk-free investment"")
* Contribute the gains to my E Fund (earning 1.15% interest which is higher than some of the bonds and lower than others)
* Contribute the money to my IRA (employer does not offer matching on the 401k plan, so everything is in my Vanguard IRA in a target date mutual fund).

**I'm currently thinking of splitting the money 50/50 between auto loan and my IRA. Is this advisable or should it just all go to my IRA?**

personalfinance,27 Looking for the best way to approach credit card debt,"Hi, I hope that you may be able to help! During college i racked up some credit card debt and haven't taken paying it off too seriously. I have ""good"" credit, I pay way more than the minimums and always pay my bills on time. I want to get more serious about paying it off since i'd like to move out in the near future and I'm trying to figure out the best way to do that. 

Currently I'm roughly 15k in debt and paying it off feels never-ending thanks to interest rates. Right now I'm debating if I should take out a personal loan. I've researched LendingClub and they're offering me an interest rate much lower than any of my cards and I'd be able to pay it off in 30 months. Do you think this is my best option or are there better alternatives?

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,[Debt] Unable to acquire a private loan for graduate certificate program,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to see if there was any other way to get a private loan with poor credit/ prior defaulted debt. A bit of backstory. After graduating in 2014 with a bachelor's in biology, I was unable to get into any medical schools. I tried beefing up my resume with research, new MCAT score, and clinical hours but was only able to get an interview at my home school and an eventual waitlist. I was however accepted to a graduate certificate program with this school which gives direct admission to the medical school upon a 3.7 GPA and costs 21k. It is not eligible for any financial aide or federal loans given the certificate status. 
  
Now where I fucked up royally. While working and doing research, I completely pushed aside my 10k in student loans. Didn't answer phone calls, emails, nothing. Obviously, they defaulted. When I attempted to get loans for this program, I kept getting denied. No matter who the co-signer was, those defaulted loans destroyed me. I removed myself from the program and worked full time as a server first, then a teacher. I went through loan rehabilitation and my loans are now within good standing since last month.  
  
Fast forward to this month and I was once again wait listed for their medical school and accepted to this graduate certificate program. I thought that since my loans were within good standing, that I would have no trouble in getting a new private loan. But, I guess I was naive in this again.  
  
I had already transferred to another school that paid 25% less in order to pay off the graduate program and work full-time which is highly advised against by all my advisers as the course load would mirror first year medical students. I just feel like if I attempt both a full-time job teaching and the graduate certificate program, I'll just be ruining my life even further.
  
I first wanted to ask if there was any remote solution in terms of private loans that would allow me to attend this graduate certificate program?
  
Second question, If not, How would you recommend I continue forward in my finances and life in general? I've had tunnel vision towards medical school for 8 years now and I just don't think it's in the cards for me.",finance

Monthly Breakdown Estimations:

* Salary: +$9k 
* Other salary: +$5k (depends $2-10k from side business)
* Rent: -$1200
* Monthly expenses (food, laundry, etc): -$700
* Other expenses/etc (dine out, subscriptions, insurance): -$500
* Estimated tax: -$5000? (state, federal)
* Net: +$6600 (savings, 401k)

Questions:

1. 401k - currently $0 contributed. My employer will match up to 6% (~$500/month). Should I still max out my yearly contribution ($1500/month)? This would significantly cut from my savings and prevent me from investing elsewhere (mortgage, stocks, etc). I am leaning towards maxing it out (because I have nothing now) but I am not too comfortable putting that much in each month. 
2. Rent - I'm decently comfortable in my current place but would prefer to live alone. Would it make sense to budget at $2500/month?
3. Pure savings - my goal is to save at least $3k/month. Does this seem right? 
4. Investments - Any suggestions on starting with this (stocks, bonds, etc)
5. Real estate - is it worth considering purchasing a condo/co-op down the line? I won't be able to do mortgage payments right now (unless maybe if I add a guarantor). 
6. Tools - Any suggestions? (investing, budgeting, etc). I heard Mint was good but banks don't like it.",finance

personalfinance,Should I try to refinance my student loans?,"I have about $29,000 in federal student loans at an interest rate of 5.375% (this is after the 0.25% discount for auto pay). The minimum monthly payment is $186.94, but I try to pay more if I can. Currently pay $250 per month, but have paid more in the past that I can't pay right now. My wife and I had our first child in April and she is no longer working, so we have lost about 33% of our income. 

&amp;nbsp;

Paying $250 per month means it will take about 14 years to pay off with about $12,000 in interest. These numbers aren't accurate though because I plan on paying more when I pay my car off in April 2019 as well as when we are able to. 

&amp;nbsp;

My question is, would it be worth trying to refinance the student loans with a private lender to get a rate lower than 5.375% to try and reduce the interest paid and get them paid off faster? I am afraid that the only way I will be able to get a lower rate is to pick a very short payoff time line, which will require larger monthly payments that we can't afford right now. 

&amp;nbsp;

I realize many people say investing the money is a better option than paying off student loans early, but I just want the peace of mind knowing they are gone.

personalfinance,Multiple questions from a new college graduate,"I just graduated from pharmacy school in May and passed all my licensing tests (yay!). With all of these changes I have a few questions that hopefully you folks might be able to help me with.

First of all is my rapid change in taxes. I have gone from making $10k a year to $115K, which caused me to change my tax forms (as it actually matters now). Should I, as an unmarried 26 year old, be claiming 1 or would zero make more sense? I would really like to keep my taxes breaking even, as I prefer the government to not have my money anymore than they must. Is there anything new I should think about when I file my taxes next year?

Secondly, I have a lot of debt from school. Currently I have $104k in federal debt which range from 3.4% to 5.6% interest rate and $75k of private loan debt which ranges from 7.49% to 7.74% interest rate. I was thinking about consolidating and refinancing my loans, should I do both the federal and the private? Or leave the federal ones alone? My credit score is about a 730, would I be able to get better rate if refinance.

My final question is about a financial adviser and having someone do my taxes. Would it be worth it to sit down with someone to figure out stuff for the first year and set me up for a few years, or would it be a waste of money.

If anyone has any other things I should be thinking about this year, I would appreciate it.

* I have no other debt besides my school debt

* I share my apartment with my girlfriend, costs for utilities and rent are ~$1550 a month total

personalfinance,Auto loan interest rate discussion/question,"Okay, I was just approved for a 20,000USD loan for a newer model SUV that is needed for my growing family. My lender (NFCU) just sent me the loan documents. The credit score they acquired was a 670, giving me an interest rate of 8.04%. I'm not necessarily concerned with any opinions on these specific figures. I am questioning whether I should cancel the loan and re-apply at the beginning of next month or not. The following reasons as to why I would wait til next month to apply.


* I just paid off roughly 50% of my debt at 10k of 20k from my previous vehicle sale.  
* The 670 (for a fact) is not an updated representation of those loans being paid off.  
* From my experiences this would put me into the 700+ credit range.

Now my main question is do you think it is worth it to wait and reapply in the beginning of September once my credit score is updated? I'm only assuming it will be updated then because every month that I have checked it, there has been a time stamp for an update around the 5th of that month, as well as that is what my loan counselor said should happen. Will that much of a change in credit score affect my interest rate in a significant amount?   
Thank you all in advance for your help. Much appreciated.

Edit: FYI the possible percentage rates from my lender for this loan at 72mo. was 5-18% if that gives an idea of how much it could change. I would also see the options from the dealership that the current owner has it financed through once I make the trip up there. Possibly a lower interest rate there as well.",finance

Bitcoin,"Looking for critique on a ""Brain Vault"" idea","We've all heard that doing a Brain Wallet is a bad idea and I should probably just use Warp Wallet and be done with it, however I was trying to think of a way to hold multiple wallets in my brain without too much work and came up with an idea I'm hoping someone with a deeper knowledge of cryptography can tell me not to do.

My idea would be a brain vault in the sense I could easily remember how to get the keys to say, 10+ accounts. It would also allow me to ""back up"" my accounts to a safe deposit box in such a way that even if the government could take those paper backups they could never seize the bitcoin from them. In a way, this system would be like an HD brain wallet, so here goes:

My brain vault would be something like:

""Today, I'm going to store my Bitcoin in:""
(This I would keep in my mind as the ""Vault Phrase"")
 
Then I would remember (and back-up to a safe deposit box) the countries in which I've ""Stored"" my bitcoins. Next I would choose a country, let's say Germany. So Germany is in a list in my bank with a number next to it in the safe-deposit box, but it's also something I can easily remember without the bank, It's such a basic piece of information I can simply put it up on Google Docs as well with the amounts, these have each become separate accounts I can retrieve simply. What I would do next was SHA-256 both my code phrase as well as my code word so I would have my vault-phrase as:

""Today I'm going to store my Bitcoin in:""
SHA'd: 5cca96a6abc26effebd53412edd7bf1a39e6a4da421b6497fa458eb77912376b

""Germany""
80db4ccdca106d37b920206331fcfe3e9e50a9e763d89b54ce3ad5ac8cf30f03

Finally, I'd assemble the two (which is easy to remember to do since one naturally follows the next) in some scheme such as:

""5cca96a6abc26effebd53412edd7bf1a39e6a4da421b6497fa458eb77912376b+80db4ccdca106d37b920206331fcfe3e9e50a9e763d89b54ce3ad5ac8cf30f03"" 

this string would then be SHA-256'd to a final:
e6a325c430dcab9af196edcda30501d5e4aa53dda82dd08c7e5ca7340423bb67 

which (through familiar means over at bitaddress) finally becomes our ""German"" account. 1D2NXX1mJcLUmwdRAihjdfQ6jP9ZdRHUvh

This system could be implemented using a Question and Answer scheme as well. With the Vault-Phrase: ""Who's got my Bitcoin?"" and answers being family or friend's names. The overall idea is that one is manually creating a salt and pairing it with simple passwords that serve as a two-factor method of backing up stuff.

Ok, I'm ready for you all to tell me to shut up and go buy a Ledger-Nano. But cryptographically speaking, could someone explain why it's a bad idea? Or was it possibly an ""ok"" idea but I just spoiled it by saying it online?",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Community as a whole and the need for mutual respect,"First off, let me state that even though I may support one side more than another, I tried to write this post from a neutral point of view. At times it may not seem like it, but that was my intent. I will be posting this to both subreddits and hoping that they will both consider my thoughts and try to have a little more respect toward each other. Also, I'm sure that these issues were pointed out long ago, but it doesn't look like they're subsiding anytime soon.

As 99% of you are aware of, the users at /r/btc and /r/bitcoin have very different views. These seemingly polar views have divided the community into two separate subreddits, However, are they really as different as we think they are?

I like to compare these differences to the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States. They're not too far apart on a political spectrum but their opinions differ vastly. You see, although they disagree on many topics such as abortion or gay rights, they would much rather live under a state controlled by the opposing political party as opposed to a regime like North Korea's or in a place with no laws. For us, this is pretty similar, as most cryptocurrencies are used as a replacement to fiat.


#Mutual Respect

Right now, it's a terrible time to join the bitcoin community. Insults are being thrown from each side I may dislike it, but there is nothing I can do to stop it alone. However, change comes with individuals who are willing to accept it.

Like politics, the discussion of Segwit and the blocksize has turned into a shitstorm of mudslinging. Both subreddits are guilty of these antics and are slowly turning Bitcoin into a toxic place for newcomers. A lot of members of /r/cryptocurrency also express their disdain toward the Bitcoin subreddits due to all the negative drama going on, and rightly so.

As Bitcoiners, I feel that we should all respect each other despite our differences. We all support Bitcoin in one way or another. We're all here for a similar reason, and that is to ensure that Bitcoin stays in this world for the long term and maybe someday, it'll overtake a fiat currency.

So next time, instead of name calling or insulting somebody who supports a different view than you, think about what you have in common. Think that there is another person on their computer with actual feelings. There are ways to have polite discussions or debates without resorting to insults.

#Interpretation

Like many other situations, interactions between members of the bitcoin communities can be interpreted differently. For example, if somebody posted the wrong rollercoaster gif on /r/btc, they can easily be downvoted to oblivion. An example on /r/bitcoin would be that if somebody said they were holding on to one specific coin when in reality they support Bitcoin core and just bought into the other one as a short term investment. They may be downvoted as well with no explanation, or in severe cases their post may even be removed. 

Interpretation applies heavily to the new members of the Bitcoin community. They're new to the whole concept and may have been fed misinformation by whoever introduced them. They may be here because they're looking for free money. They may be here because of the Media. They may be new to this Subreddit but a seasoned veteran in the other. The point still stands that you don't know what they've went through and their whole story. Before jumping on somebody and calling them an idiot for supporting ""the wrong bitcoin"" or being a ""paid shill"", take a look through their post history. You may find that there might be more to the story.


#Newcomers

When it comes to newcomers, there are 3 that come to mind for me.

1. Newcomers to Bitcoin in general

2. Newcomers to the other Subreddit

3. Newcomers to Reddit

##1. Newcomers to Bitcoin

People are referred to bitcoin in a variety of ways. The news, youtube videos, family, and friends are all ways that people get into bitcoin. 

Some of these newcomers may think that Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. That's completely fine, but it seems that too many of these newcomers get downvoted and laughed at for legitimate questions. 

I will delve deeper into this in the Propaganda part of my post, but these newcomers often don't get the whole story. They may be clueless and not know what a chain split is. I think that educating these newcomers completely is important, but then again, it feels that both /r/btc and /r/bitcoin are more interested in rallying support for their side.

##2. Newcomers to the other Subreddit

Be sensitive when it comes to people coming from the other subreddit to check it out rather than to troll. Tread carefully and talk to them more rather than downvoting them and attacking them for their beliefs. You may find that you have more in common than you think. Differentiating between a troll and a clueless newcomer may be difficult, but take your time and be patient.

For example, let's say that somebody grew up in a very conservative Christian family in a small town in Texas. Eventually they move out and encounter many gay people and despise them. They may call them derogatory terms and insult them. Maybe that person can be swayed, to change their opinion on the matter. Maybe eventually, his best friend will be a gay man, or perhaps he's gay himself but suppressed his feelings due to his parents. Or maybe that person will be stubborn and stick with the information his parents fed him. It's hard, but instead of hating them, you should try to talk to them, or relate. 

##3. Newcomers to Reddit

Reddit accounts are easy to create, that's undeniable. There will always be people creating multiple accounts looking to troll. However, one thing that should come to mind is benefit of the doubt. If somebody claims to own 20,000 bitcoins they bought in 2010, ask them to sign a message instead of immediately calling them a fake.

This type of behavior is more prevalent in /r/bitcoin, due to the fact that their flair shows how long they've been a Redditor for. The majority of new accounts on /r/Bitcoin or /r/btc may be trolls, but the few that may not be are the ones that make it worth talking to. 

#Propaganda 

Unfortunately, we are in what seems to be a state of war and propaganda is one of the most influential ways to convince someone to support one side over another. Misinformation is spread throughout both Subreddits by users hoping to convince newcomers to join their side. 

I personally don't support propaganda and would rather be able to see both sides of the arguments, but as of now it doesn't seem possible. It's like if the United States took the website 'www.government.com' and censored anything relating to communism. Meanwhile, China took 'www.gov.com' and promotes communism while disliking every post made by someone who supports democracy. Where is the middle ground? Unfortunately on Reddit, we don't have a ""middle ground"". Whoever snatches up the first subreddit gets it and there is nothing we can really do about it. I would love for /r/bitcoin to be a place where neutral people discuss their thoughts and /r/bitcoinsegwit and /r/bitcoin8mb can be for those who support different views. However, this will never happen and we have to deal with it. 


#Trolls / Derogatory Terms / Freedom of Speech

There are lots of trolls in the Bitcoin community. There will always be trolls on the internet whether we like it or not. Both /r/bitcoin and /r/btc have different ways of dealing with the trolls, but the fact remains that trolls exist even after other trolls are dealt with.

To all you trolls out there, the ones that go into the opposing subreddit and insult others, I have a question for you. Why? You can try to justify your behavior by saying that you're trying to open the eyes of the censored individuals or that you're helping newcomers by preventing them from investing in the wrong coin that you believe is going to 0. However, using derogatory terms is disrespectful. Is it too much to ask to use proper or neutral terms for the opposing side's coin? It's not like you have to call the other coin the ""true bitcoin"", just use a name acceptable by them instead of purposely triggering them by using names that are deemed unsatisfactory by the other side.

As for derogatory terms used on their own subreddit, I dislike it for sure. However, there is really no way to stop it from happening unless we all come together as a whole and condemn it. I personally consider these terms to be like the n-word, as they can be interpreted as hate speech. However, everyone sees things differently and when it comes to freedom of speech, anything goes. 

There should always be room for open discussion. Right now, both subreddits are guilty of suppressing opinions to some extent, whether it is by downvoting or removing posts. In one subreddit the members have more power while in the other one the moderators do.I wish that there was a neutral place to discuss these issues respectfully, but it doesn't seem like it will be on Reddit.

#Conclusion

So, if you have read through this whole wall of text, I commend you. Whether you choose to change your current behavior or not is something completely up to you,

Maybe this will reach the front page of both Subreddits. Or maybe this will be downvoted and be a lost part of the sea of hatred. Or maybe it'll even be removed. I have no idea what the reception to this post will be. But the important part to me is that I expressed my true feeling. You may call me oversensitive, a social justice warrior, or even a shill if that's how you feel. And I'm completely fine with it. The important part is that this was something that I needed to get out of my mind and onto the Internet. And maybe, just maybe, I can help to influence change throughout the community. 

/r/btc and /r/bitcoin, we are family no matter how different we may be. We all stemmed off of a simple concept that somehow a digital currency would replace the fiat currency we've used for our whole lives. We started together and even though we're in different places now, we should still treat each other like family, and respect each other.

Edit: Side note: I am a new Bitcoin holder and don't know much about the rivalry and history between /r/bitcoin and /r/btc. However, I do have an understanding of peaceful discussion and hope that one day that we'll be able to have civilized discussions. I won't be responding to any of the comments to try to promote neutrality and not express my personal opinion.",cryptocurrency

Also, I'm sure that these issues were pointed out long ago, but it doesn't look like they're subsiding anytime soon.

As 99% of you are aware of, the users at /r/btc and /r/bitcoin have very different views. These seemingly polar views have divided the community into two separate subreddits, However, are they really as different as we think they are?

I like to compare these differences to the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States. They're not too far apart on a political spectrum but their opinions differ vastly. You see, although they disagree on many topics such as abortion or gay rights, they would much rather live under a state controlled by the opposing political party as opposed to a regime like North Korea's or in a place with no laws. For us, this is pretty similar, as most cryptocurrencies are used as a replacement to fiat.


#Mutual Respect

Right now, it's a terrible time to join the bitcoin community. Insults are being thrown from each side I may dislike it, but there is nothing I can do to stop it alone. However, change comes with individuals who are willing to accept it.

Like politics, the discussion of Segwit and the blocksize has turned into a shitstorm of mudslinging. Both subreddits are guilty of these antics and are slowly turning Bitcoin into a toxic place for newcomers. A lot of members of /r/cryptocurrency also express their disdain toward the Bitcoin subreddits due to all the negative drama going on, and rightly so.

As Bitcoiners, I feel that we should all respect each other despite our differences. We all support Bitcoin in one way or another. We're all here for a similar reason, and that is to ensure that Bitcoin stays in this world for the long term and maybe someday, it'll overtake a fiat currency.

So next time, instead of name calling or insulting somebody who supports a different view than you, think about what you have in common. Think that there is another person on their computer with actual feelings. There are ways to have polite discussions or debates without resorting to insults.

#Interpretation

Like many other situations, interactions between members of the bitcoin communities can be interpreted differently. For example, if somebody posted the wrong rollercoaster gif on /r/btc, they can easily be downvoted to oblivion. An example on /r/bitcoin would be that if somebody said they were holding on to one specific coin when in reality they support Bitcoin core and just bought into the other one as a short term investment. They may be downvoted as well with no explanation, or in severe cases their post may even be removed. 

Interpretation applies heavily to the new members of the Bitcoin community. They're new to the whole concept and may have been fed misinformation by whoever introduced them. They may be here because they're looking for free money. They may be here because of the Media. They may be new to this Subreddit but a seasoned veteran in the other. The point still stands that you don't know what they've went through and their whole story. Before jumping on somebody and calling them an idiot for supporting ""the wrong bitcoin"" or being a ""paid shill"", take a look through their post history. You may find that there might be more to the story.


#Newcomers

When it comes to newcomers, there are 3 that come to mind for me.

1. Newcomers to Bitcoin in general

2. Newcomers to the other Subreddit

3. Newcomers to Reddit

##1. Newcomers to Bitcoin

People are referred to bitcoin in a variety of ways. The news, youtube videos, family, and friends are all ways that people get into bitcoin. 

Some of these newcomers may think that Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. That's completely fine, but it seems that too many of these newcomers get downvoted and laughed at for legitimate questions. 

I will delve deeper into this in the Propaganda part of my post, but these newcomers often don't get the whole story. They may be clueless and not know what a chain split is. I think that educating these newcomers completely is important, but then again, it feels that both /r/btc and /r/bitcoin are more interested in rallying support for their side.

##2. Newcomers to the other Subreddit

Be sensitive when it comes to people coming from the other subreddit to check it out rather than to troll. Tread carefully and talk to them more rather than downvoting them and attacking them for their beliefs. You may find that you have more in common than you think. Differentiating between a troll and a clueless newcomer may be difficult, but take your time and be patient.

For example, let's say that somebody grew up in a very conservative Christian family in a small town in Texas. Eventually they move out and encounter many gay people and despise them. They may call them derogatory terms and insult them. Maybe that person can be swayed, to change their opinion on the matter. Maybe eventually, his best friend will be a gay man, or perhaps he's gay himself but suppressed his feelings due to his parents. Or maybe that person will be stubborn and stick with the information his parents fed him. It's hard, but instead of hating them, you should try to talk to them, or relate. 

##3. Newcomers to Reddit

Reddit accounts are easy to create, that's undeniable. There will always be people creating multiple accounts looking to troll. However, one thing that should come to mind is benefit of the doubt. If somebody claims to own 20,000 bitcoins they bought in 2010, ask them to sign a message instead of immediately calling them a fake.

This type of behavior is more prevalent in /r/bitcoin, due to the fact that their flair shows how long they've been a Redditor for. The majority of new accounts on /r/Bitcoin or /r/btc may be trolls, but the few that may not be are the ones that make it worth talking to. 

#Propaganda 

Unfortunately, we are in what seems to be a state of war and propaganda is one of the most influential ways to convince someone to support one side over another. Misinformation is spread throughout both Subreddits by users hoping to convince newcomers to join their side. 

I personally don't support propaganda and would rather be able to see both sides of the arguments, but as of now it doesn't seem possible. It's like if the United States took the website 'www.government.com' and censored anything relating to communism. Meanwhile, China took 'www.gov.com' and promotes communism while disliking every post made by someone who supports democracy. Where is the middle ground? Unfortunately on Reddit, we don't have a ""middle ground"". Whoever snatches up the first subreddit gets it and there is nothing we can really do about it. I would love for /r/bitcoin to be a place where neutral people discuss their thoughts and /r/bitcoinsegwit and /r/bitcoin8mb can be for those who support different views. However, this will never happen and we have to deal with it. 


#Trolls / Derogatory Terms / Freedom of Speech

There are lots of trolls in the Bitcoin community. There will always be trolls on the internet whether we like it or not. Both /r/bitcoin and /r/btc have different ways of dealing with the trolls, but the fact remains that trolls exist even after other trolls are dealt with.

To all you trolls out there, the ones that go into the opposing subreddit and insult others, I have a question for you. Why? You can try to justify your behavior by saying that you're trying to open the eyes of the censored individuals or that you're helping newcomers by preventing them from investing in the wrong coin that you believe is going to 0. However, using derogatory terms is disrespectful. Is it too much to ask to use proper or neutral terms for the opposing side's coin? It's not like you have to call the other coin the ""true bitcoin"", just use a name acceptable by them instead of purposely triggering them by using names that are deemed unsatisfactory by the other side.

As for derogatory terms used on their own subreddit, I dislike it for sure. However, there is really no way to stop it from happening unless we all come together as a whole and condemn it. I personally consider these terms to be like the n-word, as they can be interpreted as hate speech. However, everyone sees things differently and when it comes to freedom of speech, anything goes. 

There should always be room for open discussion. Right now, both subreddits are guilty of suppressing opinions to some extent, whether it is by downvoting or removing posts. In one subreddit the members have more power while in the other one the moderators do.I wish that there was a neutral place to discuss these issues respectfully, but it doesn't seem like it will be on Reddit.

#Conclusion

So, if you have read through this whole wall of text, I commend you. Whether you choose to change your current behavior or not is something completely up to you,

Maybe this will reach the front page of both Subreddits. Or maybe this will be downvoted and be a lost part of the sea of hatred. Or maybe it'll even be removed. I have no idea what the reception to this post will be. But the important part to me is that I expressed my true feeling. You may call me oversensitive, a social justice warrior, or even a shill if that's how you feel. And I'm completely fine with it. The important part is that this was something that I needed to get out of my mind and onto the Internet. And maybe, just maybe, I can help to influence change throughout the community. 

/r/btc and /r/bitcoin, we are family no matter how different we may be. We all stemmed off of a simple concept that somehow a digital currency would replace the fiat currency we've used for our whole lives. We started together and even though we're in different places now, we should still treat each other like family, and respect each other.

Edit: Side note: I am a new Bitcoin holder and don't know much about the rivalry and history between /r/bitcoin and /r/btc. However, I do have an understanding of peaceful discussion and hope that one day that we'll be able to have civilized discussions. I won't be responding to any of the comments to try to promote neutrality and not express my personal opinion.",cryptocurrency

MachineLearning,[D] Best Way to Format Multiple View Inputs for a ConvNet,"I was just messing around with [pysc2](https://github.com/deepmind/pysc2), DeepMind's wrapper for the StartCraft 2 API, and I was looking for thoughts or papers on the best way to format the visual and non-visual data together into one input that could be fed to a deep conv net or some variant.

Then at 5000 I could transfer again to earn .65%. (I'm pretty sure that these rates are absolute garbage.)

Bitcoincash,Bitcoiners who use Tor be warned!,"A revised Rule 41 would allow the FBI to use a single warrant to hack an indefinite number of computers anywhere in the world.

stocks,How much to invest in the market. Follow these steps.,"I hear this question all the time. How much should I invest in the market?  I say as much as possible. Here are the steps to take, of course your situation may be different:

1. Pay off high interest rate loans. No sense investing in the market if you are paying 20% interest on an open credit card balance.

2. Save up for an emergency fund. Usually 3-6 months of cash to pay all your bills. This is important. If you don't do this an emergency may force you into expensive debt.  This fund isn't necessary if you are living at home with parents who can act as a backstop.

3. Max out your 401k Match with your employer.

4. Max out your HSA if available. You will have medical expenses now or in the future. This is a huge tax saver because you can avoid social security taxes and income tax.  Also you can invest your HSA balance into Index funds.  Fees may be higher than brokerage accounts but the tax savings make up for it.

5. Max out your Roth if available.

**The first 5 steps are basically designed to maximizes tax savings and avoid getting into expensive debt.  Not all debt is bad.  But 20% credit card debt is a killer.**

I've grown up in a ""always pay cash for a car"" home so I'm naturally pretty wary of taking out a loan on a car which will depreciate.

Should I go for it? My credit score is 772 (thanks, credit card autopay!) so what kind of interest rate should I expect?

personalfinance,"Considering a home equity loan/refi, advice welcome (US)","Hello PF, 

My wife and I are considering either refinancing our mortgage or a home equity loan. We currently owe around $215k and the house is worth around $280k. We purchased the home about 5 years ago. We're considering taking $20k out and putting $10-15k of that back into the house by remodeling our kitchen and two bathrooms (nothing major, replacing countertops/sinks and a new bath insert) and replacing the back section of our fence. The remaining $5k would be used to purchase our son a car next summer when he turns 16. 

We currently pay $130/mo in PMI, which I believe we may be able to eliminate if we refinance, though our interest rate would go up (currently it's at 3.75 I believe). 

Also, we are looking to sell this house in 5 years once both of our children are out of the house and moving closer to our work. 

As far as debt goes, we have two car payments totaling $500, which will be paid off in 4 years as well as about $20k in student loans. No CC debt, and our combined income is around $125k. 

I'm not really sure what the pros and cons are between refinancing or a home equity loan, and at this point we haven't decided whether we're going to do this at all, we're in the info gathering phase right now. I'm a bit nervous even considering something like this TBH. What advice would you give us? Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Does it make sense for me to refinance to get rid of mortgage insurance yet?,"I bought my house 3 years ago, for $147k with 5% down on a 30 yr fixed mortgage. The current balance of the loan is $135k. I know I can't completely trust Zillow for true home values, but it's telling me my home is worth $170,000 at the moment. That fits with what I've noticed selling in the neighborhood recently. 

So here are my current loan details: 

 - Current Principal Balance: $134,678.24
 - Current Interest Rate: 3.875%
 - Principal &amp; Interest: $679.13
 - Property Insurance: $175.50
 - County Tax: $81.67
 - Monthly MI amount: $97.88
 - Total Scheduled Payment: $1,034.18

For pretty much the entire 3 years, I've been paying an extra $150/month on my mortgage, bringing the monthly payment up to $1,184.18. I'm very comfortable continuing to pay right around $1,200 every month regardless of actual payment amount to pay the mortgage down faster. 

So I get spam about refinancing constantly, and I finally decided it might be time to look into it. Here's what SoFi says I'm ""pre-qualified"" for, none of these include mortgage insurance: 

- 4.125%, no points, Principal + Interest: $654.28
- 4.000%, $844 cost of points, Principal + Interest: $644.51
- 3.875%, $1,856 cost of points, Principal + Interest: $634.82

So even going with the higher interest rate at 4.125%, adding in my insurance and taxes, the monthly payment comes out to $911.45, that leaves me with $288.55 extra per month to throw at the principal. That has me paying off a 30 yr loan 11 years early. 

If I go with the lowest interest rate, and pay the up front cost, my payment is $891.99, leaving me with $292.19 extra, which also has me paying off the loan 11 years early. 

Am I thinking about this right? It seems obvious to me that I should refinance, and I don't think I need to worry about paying the cost of points to get the lower interest rate. What am I missing?",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off some mortgage or invest with 500K cash?,"My wife and I purchased a house early this year with 1.5m loan, interest rate is around 3.2%. At the beginning we wanted to keep our old house as an investment property but later we realized its location makes it harder to rent than we thought, so we sold it. 

Now the problem is, we got about 500K cash out of the old house selling. At the beginning we wanted to payoff some of current mortgage due to it's pretty high, but a friend says it's not wise given the interest rate is relatively low, and our income can cover it fine for now. He suggested us to invest it to get better return. 

So I'd love to have some suggestions on what to invest or where to find help. To me I still think housing is more reliable then stock market (we are in bay area), but housing investment also comes with additional cost like property tax, as well as more effort if we want to manage it our own, or lower return if have somebody manage it.

Thanks in advance for any help!  Have been a longtime lurker and have learned a lot!

I currently am going back to school (in about 1 week) for my second bachelors.  I've applied for financial aid and have the option of accepting UNSUBSIDIZED federal loans.  The interest rate is 4.45%

This made me wonder if it's cheaper to get a private loan.  I have excellent credit (800+) but have never taken out a loan for school before.  Is it possible to get lower than 4.45% on a private loan?  Any other things I should be aware of?

I am aware that I would have to start paying back the loan immediately + I would have to be aware of early payment penalties, etc.

We are not desperate for money right now so we are not in a huge hurry.  We are planning to take out the loans because it will help us keep a decent amount of cash on hand in both savings, emergency fund, etc.  If we realize we have enough cash, then we will pay off the loans earlier or decline them as we go.",finance

personalfinance,Recovering financially from relationship with a gambling addict...need help with budgeting and possible bankruptcy,"I was in a long term relationship with the father of my child for almost a decade. The last few years of our relationship he developed a very serious addiction to gambling on sports and going to the casino. This absolutely ruined the both of us financially. We split late last year due to a combination of his addiction and infidelity. 

Right before we broke up he took our rent money, gambled it away, and we were served an eviction notice. He moved out into his own apartment, and I moved into a new place as well.  He chose to default on all his debts, is being sued be his creditors, and will most likely file for bankruptcy at some point. I, on the otherhand, have been struggling to keep all my debts current and out of default. Though I don't have any late payments on my credit report, my credit score is in the low 600s due to my credit cards being completely maxed out. I also now have a default judgement for the past due rent at our old place. 

I feel like I'm finally turning a corner on my financial situation, but I still feel like maybe bankruptcy would be my best option. I really want to avoid this as I would like to buy a home in a few years, but if I need to do it I will. 

I have 2 kids (one from my ex and a 12 year old with my ex husband who is deceased), and work full time as a nurse. My salary is right around 52000/yr, and I bring home 1500 every two weeks after all deductions. I'm salary, so there's no option to increase income with overtime. I also receive a small (300/month) payment from social security on behalf of my son due to his fathers death. I receive no child support from my ex as we split custody of our daughter 50/50. 

Expenses are Rent: 850 Natural Gas: 50 Electric: 100 Cable/Internet/Phone: 125 Cell Phone: 150 (this could be lowered I'm sure) Car Payment: 375 (this is absolutely killing me, I'm upside down and the interest rate is 16%, 14k balance, car is worth maybe 10k) Personal Loan 1: 135 (5 payments remaining) Personal Loan 2: 198 (4 payments remaining) Personal Loan 3: 183 (22 payments remaining) Student Loan: 168 (27k balance), and 4 credit cards maxed out totaling about 12k with an interest rate of 15%.

personalfinance,Chase won't lower APR,"I have a Chase Amazon card, I've had this card since 2008, and since then it's been at 29.99% ""variable"".  When I call in, they keep telling me they do 6 month checks to see if they can lower my APR and that they cannot do any better.  This is always the excuse, and even speaking to a supervisor I get told that this is indeed and insane rate but they can't do anything about it despite being on time and in good standing, my last late payment was apparently more than 5 years ago although I don't recall ever being late and apparently everything is hunky-dory except I can't get rid of this utterly insane rate.  I'm also seeing that I need to get my debts in order as they've crept on me more than I'd realized. 

Right now I am at $6k of my $8k limit on this card and it's at the top of my list to clear out because it's freaking 29.99%!, although it's also my biggest due to vehicle repairs last year and previous balances. My next highest APR is 23.99% is also the next highest owed at $2,500, and I also have a 11.40% card plus I recently got a 0% APR balance transfer that I am working on finishing off before the period is over(which I moved from the Chase card but it was only for $1400 so it seems I can't get another card.  My other cards don't have the capacity to shift much as they are not as big as this card is.  I could shift $1k to my 11.4% apparently without a fee so that seems like one step but I still would have a metric-buttload of money at 29.99%.  I recently tried SoFi from an offer I got in the mail but they declined me(despite the usual you've been pre-approved!"" marketing crap) I think because of the balance transfer card which was only a few months ago. 

I do have some empty accounts I've already paid off, I have another card at 27.99% which has $2400 available and also supposedly without a fee.  Both this account and the 11.4% accounts are from the same bank and both accounts would charge this ""purchase rate"" for my balance transfers. Unless I am missing something in the fine print this might be my best first step as it's better than 29.99% and would remove $3400 from that card to some extent.  I also have about $700 available on my 0% APR card

I have another card with $1k available that I am not fully understanding.  It's purchase APR is 23.99%, the balance transfer option I have says it would be 3.99% until 7/1/2019 but I don't know how that works with the purchase APR.  Does this somehow calculate 2 different balances on the same card?

But at the end of the day, what could I do to get Chase to lower this interest rate?  The excuse the give makes no sense, and they won't tell me WHY it can't be lowered any further.  After I explained that I get daily mail with 0% APR balance transfers, which is the truth as I get anywhere between 3-8 of these a week, at least.  I was told by the supervisor that I should go for it as the interest rate is ridiculous(his words) and he couldn't do anything about it. 

For easier reading:

* Card 1 - Owed $6k with $2k avail at 29.99%

* Card 2 - Owed $2.5k with $1k avail at 23.99% (apparent 3.99% APR on balance transfer until 2019?)

* Card 3 - Owed $2.5k with $1k avail at 11.4% (balance transfer at purchase rate, but no transfer fee)

* Card 4 - Owed $1.4k with $700 avail at 0% until April 2018 but will be 23.99% (unknown balance transfer option)

* Card 5 - Owed $0 with $2.4k avail at 27.99% (balance transfer at purchase rate, but no transfer fee)

I take home about $1292 every 2 weeks, my rent is roughly $950 which at least includes water.  Phone, Internet, Vehicle/Home Ins.(paid off veh.), and Electricity is about $350-$400(studio apartment) and this is going to change soon for the better I hope.  I also have a student loan(in parents name) I've been working on since 2005 which is $255/month and I'll be working on that for the next decade more. My parents want me to get this put in my name, I don't even know what the total is anymore but somewhere in $30k range but I have this on auto pay and have never once been late since graduation. 

I have $2700 in the bank, but I saved that purely for moving so once that is in order I intend to dump it into the absurdity card from Chase. I'll be moving in with my brother to lower both of our bills and I can trust him as we've rented together in the past and get along. 

So all in all, I am looking for advice overall. But mainly, I don't understand how I can't lower the Chase card.  I do have a lot of debt, but it's been manageable and while I'm not losing sleep over it, it's very annoying thinking that I have been a loyal customer only to get the shaft.  It seems quite unethical (and very confusing, other than greedy-greedy money) and at this point I am wanting to close shop with Chase who I have a checking account with as well and remove them from my life altogether if they want to act like this. The worst transfer would be 27.99% which is better than 29.99%, and no apparent fee but is it really worth it? Am I possibly missing anything? I haven't call the 27.99% bank to see about working out a better rate but if you have advice on how I should approach that I'd appreciate it as well.",finance
personalfinance,22 year old with no financial experience,"Hello all,

I have just finished school and was offered at job making around 70k before taxes.

She has full access over the funds that I have made throughout my life, including the 5 years of working part time. To expand on this, she has always questioned how I have spent my money and asked for my reasoning and I feel as if I have had no individual thought on personal finance and budgeting experience because of this. 

I know there is a lot of information on the internet on how I should budget and so forth, but I would really like to know where would be a great place to start. I'll still be living at home, so much of this money will be going into savings and what not, but I would love to have some input on how I should be saving money and budgeting.

To me the amount of money I will be making seems like a lot for a 22 year old to handle and while I still have school loans to pay, I feel as if I will spend it on useless things that will affect my life in the long term.

Their base salaries are around 40k from what i have gleamed from casual conversation. They would like me to go work for them but I have not met to discuss pay or anything and can only assume it will be the same base. How would you address the below concerns.  

Things i will be giving up.  
1. I enjoy stability in pay    
2. I have great 401k matching    
3. I have healthcare.  
4. Get a standard cost of living raise per year 2.5 to 3.5%  

More Background:
I worked for my brother in laws brother (James) for 5 years ending in 2009. He owned a pharmaceutical wholesale company and I did sales, i was paid a crappy base salary 25k a year without ever receiving a raise but I was younger 24 through 29, had no kids living at home so I didnt need much.  

Anyways, during my time (James) asked his brother (My brother in law) if he can find someone to develop a software for his pharmaceutical company to meet federal regulations that were to take effect in 2009. They outsourced development to two Canadians and once finished decided why not license the software to other companies. Problem was the federal regulations kept getting pushed back and 2009 was moved to 2011 and 2011 eventually became 2015. So because of this they didnt have demand and had only 6 clients for a 6 year span, enough to pay the developers to stay on hand and make custom mods.

Fast forward 2015 arrives and finally the federal law came into effect, theres only 3 players, my brother in laws company 50/50 partnership with his brother, another company with 50 million in VC and a third mid sized company. Turns out being small has allowed my brother in law and his brother James to undercut competition and grow the user base rapidly from 6 in 2015 to what i believe is north of 60.  

Anyways back to the point, I need stability and I was thinking a larger base with a smaller commission might work but my base would need to be at least 60k, I would also like to ask for 1% of stock for each year they continue to employ me up to a max of 5% or something to ensure im compensated should they ever go public or something.  

Things to consider...  
1. I cant move up in my current Job, no college degree.  
2. I am probably paid in the upper limits for what I do and where i live.

The question is: What do I do win the remaining profit from the sale? My first inclination is to just get rid of all debt and just have the mortgage. We would then use the little bit left for updates to the house as we move in.
Would it be smarter to take that extra money and invest it? 

To complicate matters, I am potentially leaving my job to run our startup full time and might cut or income to around 3750 per month.

Tl;dr: Profit from the house: better to take that and pay off debt, put down a bigger down payment, or invest?

personalfinance,How do you go about consolidating credit card debt without getting a personal loan?,"Over the past few years due to two big cross country moves, three failed cars, and some medical expenses, I've racked up about $10,000 in credit card debt. I make about $22,000 per year after taxes and have been paying slightly more than the minimum payments (when I can afford to) each month. I've been breaking even every month and not making much headway on the debt due to high interest rates, and I'm looking for a way to consolidate the debt into one payment with a lower interest rate so I can pay it off quicker. (It's split between 4 different cards right now.) I have no derogatory marks on my credit report and I've never missed a payment nor have I been late on any of them, but because I have a high credit to debt ratio, I still have a low credit score (around 591 according to Experian) which prevents me from getting a loan. Are there other ways to consolidate credit card debt like you can with student loan debt? How much higher would I have to raise my score before I could realistically apply for a personal loan to pay off the credit cards to get a better interest rate?

personalfinance,To invest or pay loans? (CANADA),"Hi PF,

Long time lurker but I have a question for you guys. I have a personal loan of 75K with an interest rate of 3.45% (Prime+0.5%) and the minimum payment is about $900. I have the ability to pay $3500 towards my loan every month.

I've been looking into investing and I'm wondering if it would be feasible to pay the minimum on the loan and invest the rest (approx. $2600) into a diversified portfolio (eg. Canadian couch potato ETFs).

Is it worth it? Or should I just be focusing on paying student loans to get out of debt faster? I don't have any personal goal except to retire as early as possible.

btc,UASF supporter and SegWit2x opponent being schooled on how Bitcoin works (crossposting to both subreddits),"**Edit**: this reply to /u/jonny1000 and crosspost have been censored on /r/Bitcoin and I can't post anything there anymore. Apparently they have shadowbanned me there. I wonder why.

---

You can follow the conversation we have on the topic of BIP148/BIP149 UASFs and how they are fundamentally much worse than any of the major hard fork proposals:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6v0gll/why_segwit2x_b2x_is_technically_inferior_to/dlynwsk/?context=9

And this is the text of my last response:

&gt; No, BIP149 is different. BIP149 it opt in for miners, they do not need to do anything.

Did you just blindly swallow all the propaganda about BIP149 that was fed to people, without understanding it? From your analysis of BCH/B2X you don't come across as having no clue about blockchain dynamics and security. BIP149 is as opt-in for miners as any other consensus change, soft or hard fork. Put yourself in the shoes of a miner. You are running one node software, someone mines the first block claiming 100% of SegWit spends as fees, the blockchain splits and you end up on one chain. Do you keep mining with the same node software as before? Do you start claiming SegWit outputs for yourself as well (only possible on the non-BIP149 chain)? It's your decision, but it's quite an important decision. Quite consequential.

&gt; I think most were bluffing. Could be wrong though.

&gt; I'm not saying bluffing is any more justified than not bluffing. Actually bluffing is probably even worse.

This is quite important. If you know of people who were speaking in favor of BIP148 who were bluffing, please tell us who they are. It would really help our community. If you think that some people did wrong things, it would help you as well if you speak out and shine the light on some of those wrongdoings.

&gt; Well I said 5% to 10%. Then you give a 0.3% example. Not sure why...

It is not an example, it is the empirical observation that only about 0.3% of the total hashpower was voicing support for BIP148.

&gt; Err, not sure I agree with that. Also I do not think the whitepaper talks about this either.

On page 6 read 11. Calculations:

&gt; We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest
chain...

&gt; The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's
Ruin problem....

&gt; Given our assumption that p &gt; q, **the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the
attacker has to catch up with increases.**

This is relevant for the probability of a UASF chain wiping out the majority chain once (which can then reappear).

&gt; Sorry, I do not follow. Not sure why or how non-UASF miners could do that. Please explain the scenario? I think that is unlikely to be an issue, as users would probably make sure funds were in a different output on both chains before using SegWit. 

Read [the link I already provided to you](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin/pull/205):

&gt; it does make bcoin UASF-aware and redeems all value sent to witness program outputs in the mempool. As far as the main chain is concerned, these outputs are still pushdatas (anyone-can-spend)...
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you're running this code when the BIP148 hardfork happens, you could essentially get free money from transactions which have the nerve to send money to an unenforced soft-fork address...
&gt; 
&gt; This works because:
&gt; 
&gt; * The majority of the hashpower does not support UASF.
&gt; * Pre-UASF nodes will follow the chain with the most work.
&gt; * Non-UASF nodes will follow the chain with the most work.
&gt; * Witness program outputs are anyone-can-spend on the most-work chain.
&gt; * BIP148 misleadingly states that it will ""deactivate"" once the locked-in state is reached, but due to poor implementation of the code/idea, UASF behavior will never truly ""deactivate"" in reality. It may never follow the best work chain again and only end up following its own chain.
&gt; * The UASF does not prevent replay attacks in any way. The initial funding of a segwit addr is valid on the main chain.
&gt; 
&gt; If a UASF user sends their old coins to a p2wpkh on uasf-coin, anyone can redeem their money on bitcoin...

Author: chjj

&gt; Also, this concept is very different from the wipeout issue.

Indeed it is. It is much worse.

&gt; Im not sure miners stealing user funds is likely to be helpful.

It's not stealing, it's like someone convincing you to leave your cash on a sidewalk and then someone collecting it. Blame the person convincing you and then yourself.

&gt; if the economy wasn't running SegWit clients, doing BIP148 would have achieved nothing.

The fact that most of the economy was running SegWit-aware versions of Bitcoin Core is irrelevant for the chainsplit and subsequent critical security implications. Indeed BIP148 would have achieved nothing for those nodes without the mining majority (except for the free bitcoins for the miners). The economy, with few exceptions, was NOT running BIP148 clients.

&gt; Well it only worked once.

There were several soft forks which used very similar activation, by miner signalling.

&gt; The old BIP148 like method worked 5 times in the past

Show me one example of a soft fork which was activated when it didn't have a majority of hashpower on its side, or even that was not thought to have a majority on its side.

&gt; &gt; which could have been used against a UASF chain if it ever threatened to overtake and wipe out the main chain
&gt; 
&gt; Well the UASF did win...

No, there was no minority activation and consequent chainsplit, which this conversation was about. No one needed to employ this (except BCH which split even more explicitly).

&gt; ?? The miners ran BIP148 compatible code...

The miners ran code which prevented the detrimental effects of BIP148, starting with the chainsplit. In that sense it is a ""UASF defense"".",cryptocurrency
btc,Inspiring post by /u/CryptoDonDraper (2 years ago) that reminds me why I am here,"[Original post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ls7c5/what_many_of_us_dont_get_about_bitcoin_its/)

Are you worried about the trolls, the Professor Bitcorn and BitCon types the media books on their shows, while ignoring people like Andreas, Roger, TwoBitIdiot, Circle execs, the Xapo CEO - all of whom would be better representatives of the technology and the currency.

Look, these people are playing their game: they don't want Bitcoin to succeed.

Allow me to repeat that: they do not want Bitcoin to succeed.

For people in the media, especially television, who already have money - they don't want to hear the Bitcoin narrative. They really don't. They're busy and being told their millions are worthless fiat shit bothers them. People don't like change - we couldn't even switch to the metric system in the States. This turns money around, a full 180. Some aren't ready for that.

And the credit card companies, the banks, some governments... Bitcoin is not a thorn in their side. It's an existential threat and, as with Occupy, they're doing their thing to make it go away. How much of the regulatory and legislative shitstorm do you think has been generated by card company lobbyists whispering into the right people's ears? Think about it.

This stuff is not conspiracy thinking. It is economic war. They're threatened, and they are attempting to crush that threat.

I was never in Occupy, I found it pedantic, but a friend was. Recently we were talking and I told her ""something like that was doomed from the get go - no clear demands, no clear leaders, no vision"".

This led to a very scary conversation about her experiences in Occupy. She's one of the smarter people I know, definitely not a UFO/conspiracy/NWO conspiratard. And she said, point blank, it was her experience that at least 1 out of every 4 ""Occupiers"" by the end of it was a fed, undercover cop, or provocateur. None of it made sense toward the end - crazies showing up to meetings, advocating violence and property damage. People with no history in activist communities whatsoever popping up with recording equipment, not journalists mind you, and asking questions and taking face shots without permission.
All that scary Cointelpro shit they used against Martin Luther King, Jr and others whose views were a little too ahead of the curve?

Those programs have not ended, they have just been compartmentalized and in many cases privatized. Internet trolling is big business. Social engineering and opinion ""shepherding"" is also big business.

Why do banks advertise on TV so much? Why do they sponsor so many stadiums?

The Buttcoiners frequently say Bitcoin is a cult. Money IS a cult: flip around a dollar bill, you'll find more occult creepiness than in the last twenty minutes of Eyes Wide Shut.

Money is a psychological phenomena, and Satoshi got the economics right for duplicating that phenomena, without needing a government to kickstart it with all of their imagery, force, and bullshit.

One of the recent favorite lines of Bitcoin detractors is ""the blockchain technology is great, but the currency side of it will never work"".

This is intentional, one last attempt to undermine Bitcoin in the courts of public opinion.

""The engines on this plane are great, but it will never fly.""

Wrong. Currency, value transfer, is the whole fucking point of Bitcoin. Notice how the trolling increased as Changetipping took off? That's because if tipping goes viral, the threat to them increases - it cannot be stopped at that point.

Also, sorry it took me so long to get to the point of this post: Bitcoin's biggest strength IS its currency aspect.

All the rest is nice bells and whistles, but currency is what Bitcoin was designed to replace. As Gates said, ""Bitcoin is better than currency."" He's not a dumb guy. That's one of those five word quotations that doesn't seem like much today, but in three years will appear positively prophetic in its accuracy. Bitcoin isn't just another currency. It's not just some card network for transferring ledger credit/debit balances around. It's a technology inherently better than govt-issued currency itself, just as email is inherently better than the post.

The logical conclusion, therefore, is that price does matter. Sellers - each of us - decide the price of Bitcoin. Given how much bullshit they are throwing at the wall lately trying to slow us down, I no longer recognize Bitcoin as a $350, $500, or $1,000 per coin technology.

It's become personal. I'll HODL until the bastards are out of business. Because if more of us thought like that, Bitcoin fairy tale time would be here a lot sooner. These banks and institutions are begging to be put out of business. And they know it, or the trolls and media shills wouldn't be out in force.

Time to finish the job. HODL til the bleed. For every shill who says price doesn't matter and Bitcoin will never work as money, I say it is money - more money than your derogatory surveillance and war funding Chuck E Cheese notes, more money than the heavy metal our predecessors used to have to lug around.

And price does matter. The detractors will see that this holiday season. Satoshi built a brilliant Chinese finger trap for money: it won't take much fresh seasonal demand to send all these numbers astronomical.

And I think enough of us are pissed off that we won't sell when things heat up. That's when it gets fun. To quote my favorite Bond villain, ""Hello, James. Welcome. Do you like the island? My grandmother had an island. Nothing to boast of. You could walk around it in an hour, but still it was, it was a paradise for us. One summer, we went for a visit and discovered the place had been infested with rats. They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut. So how do you get rats off an island? Hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait and the rats would come for the coconut and... they would fall into the drum. And after a month, you have trapped all the rats, but what do you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it and they begin to get hungry. And one by one... they start eating each other until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what? Do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees, but now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now, they only eat rat. You have changed their nature. The two survivors. This is what she made us.""

personalfinance,Can I get American Opportunity Credits from years when I was claimed as a dependent?,"Hello everyone,


I graduated from college this year and am trying to get my financial situation in ship shape as I really bungled it up last year and want to make sure it never happens again. What I'm trying to do today is file my tax returns which I have an extended deadline of October to do.


**Background**: My parents normally filed through turbotax with me as their dependent, but this year they wanted to try having me file independently to see if it would make things easier on them. It apparently did in some way, but that's not the purpose of this post or my concern. As I was at school, I gave them every bit of information regarding my income and expenses that they wanted so that they could file as me on turbotax, but it wouldn't go through because the IRS claims that my birth date is incorrect. I know this to be untrue because I have a wealth of documents to prove it and have gone through several government background checks that never had any issues with my birth date. My parents tried to get the program to accept it so they could e-file but had no luck, so they filed for an extension so that I could handle it when I got home. They're immigrants with extremely sub-par educations so when anything paperwork related gets complicated they hand it over to me. I graduated and got home a few months ago but didn't get around to the tax return issue until today because A. I was fully immersed in job searching and just emerged successful (huzzah!) and B. I was in no rush because my father said that turbotax said I would only get $48 back from the federal government and owed the state government nothing.


**Background of what happened today**: I went through the entire program and verified that the IRS mistakenly believes my birth date to be incorrect. I can apparently only correct this by going to a SSA office and it will then take 4-6+ weeks, but I can still file by mail so I'll be doing that. 

*However*, I noticed some of the things my father said in my education section were incorrect and when I corrected them turbotax changed my refund from $48 to $1048, saying that I qualified for an American Opportunity Credit. I contacted my parents and they said that they never saw anything about that credit in the years that they filed me as a college student who was their dependent, so whatever they did that prevented it on this return that I corrected must have been done there too. My expenses for this last year of school were pretty consistent with the expenses from the other three so I doubt it was differing expenses that disqualified me from it.

**My question**: Can I go back into their tax system and amend their previous returns so that I get the refund for American Opportunity Credit for those years? Would I even get the money or would it go to them? Could it perhaps have gone to them and they didn't realize it because they still had to pay enough that there was no refund? 

I know nothing of taxes so these may be dumb questions - I never had a course on it and they don't understand well enough to have taught me, so please be gentle.

Monthly payment: $3,347.22 ($639.32 principal, $1290.46 interest, $1,417.44 escrow) 

Current mortgage lender offered the following rates. Because we are already a customer, they said they didn't go through the thorough process that a 3rd party lender would go through. 

**23 year 6 month refinance. FHA loan**

Loan Amount: $333,691

Interest rate: 4%

Payment for years 1-11: $3,204 ($1,827.16 Principal + Interest, $216 PMI, $1,161 escrow).

Payment for years 12-24: $2,988 (PMI removed)

This loan has $13,625 in closing costs. 

**Quicken Loans offered the following options:** One thing of note, they based these options on my wife's credit score which is 746. 

**30 year fixed conventional loan**

Interest rate: 4.18%

Loan amount: $340,000 ($330,800 estimated payoff + $1,800 closing costs + $7,400 - $7,900 escrow

Monthly Payment: $2,863 ($1,660 principal &amp; interest + $43 PMI + $1,160 escrow)

-reduces monthly payment by $484/month. Can pay down debt and then pay direct to principal once debt is paid off. 

-PMI would be eliminated in 4 years

**23 year 6 month fixed conventional loan**

Everything the same as above but monthly payment would be $3,098/month 

Thoughts? The 30 year fixed is the most attractive as paying almost $500 less a month would be money we could use to pay down debt but I'm not too keen on going back to a 30 year mortgage. Then again, once debt is paid down (currently paying about $600 a month in CC debt which, after this refinance, I could consolidate on a debt consolidation loan) we could easily put an extra $500 a month direct to principal.",finance
personalfinance,Choosing which student loans to pay off first,"I currently have 7 student loans with varying amounts and interest rates listed below. I think I have the priority correct, but want to double check.

* A: $4,942.55 at 3.86%, subsidized
* B: $6,863.03 at 3.86%, unsubsidized
* C: $4,514.91 at 4.66%, subsidized
* D: $4,470.62 at 4.66%, unsubsidized
* E: $2,423.07 at 4.29%, subsidized
* F: $3,281.72 at 4.29%, unsubsidized
* G: $10,266.83 at 6.00%, unsubsidized

I'm still in school so all of my loans are in deferment. I have about $1,000/month available right now I can contribute to paying them down, and was planning to focus entirely on loan G until it's paid off, then potentially pay off D, F, and B (I've also considered opening and maxing my wife's Roth IRA at that point given the lower rates, but it feels negligible either way).

Is this the best strategy? For instance is it still best to pay off the higher rate if say for instance loan G's total due is less than D, F, and B? I figured it would be since it could be looked at as a constant ""6% return on investment"" regardless of the principal amount, but I want to make sure. I won't make any payments on the subsidized loans until I graduate as it doesn't make sense for me to pay down 0% debt at the moment.

btc,A $5 fee to send $100 is absolutely ridiculous,"--This is the post that got deleted from r/bitcoin along with an edit that might not have got in before it got deleted. --


When I first got into bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, it was said that there were low fees and immediate transactions. Instead I'm waiting multiple hours and paying a 5% fee. Might as well just use paypal... smh.

Edit: This post has been marked as AstroTurf... it's not. I'm not and have never been subbed to r/btc, I have never posted or commented on r/btc and I don't even own any bitcoin cash. I was just fed up with paying large fees.

personalfinance,"$150K Student Loan Debt, Unsure Where to Begin","Hey PF! Looking for advice on student loan debt. Very long story short, I owe just shy of $150,000 in student loans. Currently, there are 4 separate loans: $33,592 at 10.25%; $53,007 at 9%; $53,330 at 10%; $5,684 at 10%. All of these are private loans through Navient/Sallie Mae. 

I know ***nothing*** about how to best approach handling this. All of the loans are from my undergraduate years; I'm now a graduate student, entering my final semester (woo!). The loans have been on deferment during my time as a full-time grad student. When I graduate in January, it's time to roll. 

My father has suggested finding an outside company to pay off the entire sum of the loans, consolidate all four into one (or as few as possible, anyway), and then pay that outside company at a lower interest rate. Is this even possible? It sounds like a solid idea to me, but I'm unsure of how practical it is or if it's my best option, etc. What ""outside company"" should I be looking into? If someone could advise me on this or point me in another, better direction, I'd really appreciate it. 

Also, my plan is to go teach English abroad for one year after graduating. The news of my debt was quite the surprise to me (it's a long, personal story. I was led to believe I had no loans remaining.. Alas). I understand that I might have to sacrifice my dream of going abroad given the circumstances. However, I'm curious if anyone knows anything about paying off student loans while teaching abroad? I know that, generally speaking, it's possible. But I'm not sure with the amount I owe if it is practical. Are there ways to continue deferring while teaching abroad? Or, I know that payment options exist that determine your monthly balance in accord with your salary. Is that an option while teaching abroad?

Thank you!

**TL;DR**: Becoming an English teacher. Significant student loan debt. Can I afford to go teach abroad for a year before settling into my true teaching career?

**EDIT**: I ought to mention, I'm aware of a loan-forgiveness program for government employees (includes teachers). The program would require me to make an on-time, full payment for 120 consecutive months (10 years), without fail. After that, my remaining loans would be forgiven. Does anyone with experience with this kind of program have any insight? I'm curious as to how significant the monthly payments would be in accord with my earnings as a teacher. I'm also unsure I'd be eligible to enroll in this program while teaching abroad and then transition into a more legitimate (and much higher-earning) teaching job in the States. 

**EDIT 2 (Important, sorry!)**: I won't be responsible for the totality of my debt, thank goodness. My parents (bless their souls) have said that they'll be helping me along the way, accounting for approximately half of the sum. This leaves me responsible for about $75k. Yes, I realize I'm a fool for not mentioning this sooner. I'm at work and had some time to post about this, but I rushed a bit and omitted some important details. Further, my mother will be receiving a rather significant inheritance whenever her father passes (morbid, but reality) and she has promised to use a percentage of it to further help my debt.",finance
personalfinance,Trying to decide whether to contribute to 401(k) or to pay off debt.,"I am 26 years old. I currently make $41k a year while being a trainee for the job I'm eventually going to be promoted to in 3-9 months. I anticipate a pay raise to high 40s, or low 50s. Based on my current income and my debt, I'm trying to decide whether it makes sense to contribute to 401(k) or to hold off and pay as much debt off as possible.

Currently paying around $150 a month pre-tax for benefits (including $40 per month to an HSA, which I am considering reducing to 0, company contributes $500 to HSA)

After taxes, my monthly pay is $2025.20 without any 401(k) contributions.

My company match for 401(k) is 100% up to 7%. If I contribute 7%, I end up contributing about $220 per month to my 401(k).

My current bills are as follows:

Rent: $467.50 Internet: $25 Loan: $550 Car: $267 Car insurance: $127 (will go down in 6 months).

Total bills: $1436.50

Gives me about $560 a month to work with for groceries, gas, parking, bus / parking etc if I don't contribute to 401(k), or $340 to work with if I do contribute the max 7%.

My loans are as follows:

Parent plus loan: $80,000 at 8% interest (will be refinancing, hopefully at a 3.9% rate with Citizen's bank).

Federal student loans (consolidated): $20,000 at 6.5% interest

Car: Currently $13,500 at 8% interest.

My question is whether I should try to tackle the debt before contributing to 401(k)? or maybe set 401(k) contribution a bit lower and pay off a bit more of the debt?

I'm feeling very overwhelmed by the huge hole I've put myself in and want to get the hell out of it, but don't want to do so at the expense of my retirement. 

I know I'm not making a TON of money, but I didn't expect to feel so broke making over $40k, which I've always considered to be a decent living salary.

Any advice is much appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Car loan denied but I have the car,"Hey guys, 

So a month ago I was pre-approved by Bank of America for 8k on a car. I went to a major dealer and found one for 6k. We did the paperwork, sent it over, and BoA denied it saying the minimum loan was 7500. The dealer gave me a warranty and service agreement that bumped the price up to 7501. We resubmitted the paperwork and BoA approved it and sent over papers to the dealer. I drove off the lot, having traded my car and paid them a 900 dollar down-payment. 

Fast forward a month, I get a call from the dealership saying ""Hey, Bank of America says the car value must be 7500 and that adding the warranty didn't change that and so they denied the financing. Do you want to give us a check for the whole thing or have us look locally for financing?"" I definitely don't have the money to pay outright, or even close.  If they come back with a crazy high interest rate or no financing at all, what are my options? The paperwork on the car lists bank of America as a lien holder. Can I just give the car back and get my down-payment and trade value?

personalfinance,Recent Promotion/Raise,"I am currently employed as an electrical engineer at a medium sized utility.  My primary job is Long Term Planning for a large portion of our service territory, however I have ""acquired"" several ancillary duties along my way. These duties include leading several committees tasked with improving current processes, taking the lead role on group projects instead of more senior members, and most importantly serving as a member of our under-staffed capital budget coordination team.

For weeks now I have been told by my boss, his boss and other leaders that I am doing a fantastic job. I recieved word today that I am being promoted to Engineer III from Engineer II, something my boss tells me is long over due.  The only issue is that my new salary is barely higher than our stated ""market minimum"" for an Engineer III. The difference comes out to be a 7% raise in income, while our annual ""performance/inflation"" raises are typically 3-4%.  I feel under-paid.  This frustrates me because there are more senior folks who do less and take less responsibility but earn 30% more than I do. I understand the raises take time, I just feel like my promotion should have come with a larger increase in salary. Am I complaining too much or does this sound like an issue?

personalfinance,What sort of living expenses would I be seeing if I buy an an apartment as opposed to simply renting one? (Canada),"I have about 30K in the bank currently from living on the cheap in my parent's basement, but I'm feeling the urge to free myself and become independent.I had other plans for that money I was accumulating. Namely going back to school, but at my age I think I have bigger priorities to settle.

I've never actually lived on my own before, so I'm kind of oblivious  what I'm going to have to pay for. If I bought my own apartment, I would of course have to get a small mortgage, but since I have such a large percentage of the cash up front (looking for a 2 bedroom apartment in the 70-100K range), the mortgage would be significantly less than a month's rent, even with a bad interest rate.

So what else should I be factoring for? Utilities are a given I would say, should I expect to be paying a flat fee, or just whatever energy I've consumed? Internet as well of course. 

Is there anything else? Since I'm looking at buying an apartment that is inside a building complex, do you typically have to pay a monthly or yearly fee for the right to live there? Or is that a case by case scenario, maybe complexes with more to offer to the residents like a pool, gardens, etc will charge extra, while more basic setups don't?

It really all boils down to whether I would be paying more on average if I rented a basement suite or small apartment  (only one bedroom if I'm renting), or if I took out a small mortgage and bought a decent place?",finance

Bill and Post 9/11. I have been overseas since 2005 and wasted prime saving opportunities in my mid to late twenties when I had a job paying $120,000. 7 years ago I lost said job due to some legal issues in which I was not at fault and had to work my way back up various company ladders until last year when I started making $150,000. I now have a wife, 2-year-old and an another child on the way early next year.

I do not have a military pension. My previous base was $70,000 and my HOLA and COLA was higher than now. Currently my Base is $117,000 and my HOLA and COLA is lower. My previous 401K I used to climb out of debt 7 years ago hence being so far behind (it was around $45,000). I can up the 401K to the max limit as suggested and start to put money into another account of what type I'm not sure. I thought about consolidating all my savings as well or should I leave them?

As for the utilities it is because I'm in Germany and it includes everything that I did not want to list out a total of 8 different things.

Edit #2
I want to say thank you to everyone. Me being ignorant and accepting the ""defaults"" for a lot of items is killing me along with me buying a car that I did not need, but wanted to fit in with the culture. I maxed my 401K on Tuesday, removed over $300 from my auto insurance, stopped buying coffee at work and started using my coffee maker again. I have been doing the numbers on selling my Audi and buying a used car out here for half of the monthly payment. I also increased my savings to $2,300 per month. If I stick with this and save here and there I can save around $70,000 this time next year and the following year have 2X worth of my base in savings.

My goal now is focusing on Term Life Insurance and where to properly invest this money.",finance
personalfinance,Early investor/savings advice please!,"Hello,

I am a 26 year old recent Master of Fine Arts in Painting graduate who is about to jump back into the working world and would like some advice on my current financial status and how best to move forward.

In advance, forgive me for sounding ignorant, my goal now moving forward is to start better educating myself on the workings of investing and saving for my future financial goals because I seriously lack knowledge in this at the moment. I am just trying to be smart moving forward, because I know every little thing makes a difference in the long run. I also am aware I probably won't be making much in the art field (I am in the arts administration field, working in galleries and museums and I am certified to be a professor now). Lastly, my partner just began medical school, but we keep our finances separate and split everything. 

I have no debt, good credit and live on a budget of about $2000 a month. I started a Roth-IRA in college with $5500 and it has increased to $6600 (~5 years) without me contributing anything more. I use Bank of America and so my Roth-IRA is with Merrill Edge. Recently, they recommended I liquidate and move into a 'Guided Investing' Roth-IRA because it will be given more constant attention based on my goals (I chose medium risk investing).

I have a few thousand in savings now that I keep as an emergency fund, but I am willing to invest another $2000 and I am wondering if I should contribute to this Roth-IRA or I was recommended by my State Farm agent to consider starting a Universal Life Plan, which I would begin contributing $50 a month and it would give me a $50,000 initial basic life insurance and a guaranteed interest rate of 2%. I don't currently have life insurance.

I've heard its best to diversify, so I am leaning towards starting this account with State Farm and once I start working, I will slowly begin contributing to my Roth-IRA. This is what I am unsure about - is this a good idea? Are these good companies to continue with?

Also, we were considering buying our first home when we moved towards the medical school, but now that medical school has started, we are thinking it might be best to wait and because this isn't necessarily where we want to continue to live.

I am posting because I just want to get advice and see if I am on the right track financially. I feel I have developed great budgeting and saving skills, but I lack knowledge about bigger picture things.

Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Should I ask for closed (paid off) credit cards to be removed from my credit report? (CAN),"I'm a first-time poster and long-time lurker so first off, thank you to all of you who provide such great advice. I have learned so much through reading this subreddit.

Now for my question: A few years ago, I got a CapitalOne Gold Mastercard with a $5000 balance. Long story short, it went to their internal collections department, and I managed to get them to close the card, and negotiated a 0% interest rate to pay down the balance. Last month that balance reached $0 (hooray!), but the card is still showing on my credit karma report. I'm wondering if there is any benefit to calling CapitalOne or TransUnion to have the card removed from my credit report. Does having a closed card have any impact on my credit score? 

For additional context: I have 2 other credit cards that are closed that I am paying down (balances of $5500 and $2000). One is at 19.99%APR and one at 5%APR (a one-year negotiated term with the credit card company). I am using the snowball method so I am paying down the 5%APR one first and then will focus on the $5500 one. I also have a Visa card that is open and I am using. It has a $2700 credit limit and is almost maxed out, but I will be making a large payment on it on Friday that will take it down by about $500.

I also have 2 lines of credit (student lines of credit, cosigned with family members at $17000 and $15000). Both are low interest - Prime +3% and are currently in interest only payments because I am still a student. I also have a small government student loan ($10000), which I am not paying because I am a student. 

Basically I'm wondering if removing the $5000 from this closed CapitalOne card from my credit report will improve my credit score because it will mean a lower amount of 'available' credit, or if because the card is closed that is irrelevant?

Thank you so much for your help!",finance

personalfinance,Loan payoff strategy,"We have student loans to pay off. All under the same provider, but in different groups - each with different interest rates. 

No payments are actually due as my wife is still in school getting a Master's degree on top of other credentials, but interest is constantly accruing as these are grad loans. We are aggressively paying them off at around $3000 a month (this image does not show them all). 

My question - what is the best strategy to pay them off? I cannot get my head straight on this. We are currently paying all payments monthly to the highest rate group, which has dropped pretty significantly in total and is now the lowest balance. I pay twice monthly (cashflow based) on this loan at approx $1500 a time. 

Is this idea of paying only on the single loan with highest interest approach the best strategy or am I missing out on something? Total balance is around $45k across groups with interest rates between 5.31% and 6.31%.

Recollection of the past: South Korea's story

In 1960, there was a small boy taking a stainless steel cup in his school backpack each morning to have UN-AID Food Rations at lunchtime. Now that boy is standing in the lecture room as a mentor at the WNU Summer Institute, to share his experience and knowledge about nuclear energy with 100 fellows from 40 countries. Jaekyu Lee reflects on Korea's progress and its current debate on the future of nuclear power.

In 1960, there was a small country with a GDP per capita of less than USD 100; one of the ten poorest countries in the world. At that time it had failed to secure a loan of just USD 30 million. The loan was needed to build a fertilizer plant to drive growth in agricultural production and to emerge from poverty that had resulted from three years of war and 36 years of colonization.

About 35 years later in 1996 it became a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In the 2010s, it became one of the top 10 biggest trading nations in the world. They call it a 'miracle', the Han-River Economic Miracle. But nobody thinks this effect came without any cause! In the 1980s, it was a small country struggling for economic development with no domestic natural resources like oil, gas and coal, but strongly driving for self-reliance through nuclear technology.

Bitcoin,The IRS Has Been Using Bitcoin Tracking Software Since 2015,"https://www.coindesk.com/irs-using-bitcoin-tracking-software-since-2015/  ----copy/paste----
The Internal Revenue Service is using bitcoin transaction tracing tools developed by startup Chainalysis, according to a new report.

Documents obtained by Washington publication The Daily Beast show that the tax agency has been using the startup's software since 2015.

Additional data from the General Services Administration, which handles the US government's logistics, indicates that the IRS has an active contract with Chainalysis that is valid through the beginning of September. To date, the IRS has paid Chainalysis more than $88,000.

The IRS states in the documentation that it's using the software to ""trace the movement of money through the bitcoin economy,"" going on to explain:

    ""This is necessary to identify and obtain evidence on individuals using bitcoin to either launder money or conceal income as part of tax fraud or other Federal crimes.""

While it's no secret that US officials are interested in closer oversight of cryptocurrency activities – a group of influential senators pushed for this kind of policy shift in late May – the IRS contract is notable given the tax agency's investigation of potential tax avoiders and its ongoing lawsuit against exchange startup Coinbase.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, the IRS wants to obtain several years' worth of data on customers of Coinbase.

The startup has pushed back against the IRS in federal court, ultimately forcing the tax agency to narrow its information request. In recent days, groups like the libertarian think-tank Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Washington-based nonprofit Coin Center have moved to oppose the effort in subsequent filings.",cryptocurrency
economy,New economic downturn?,"First off, I am not an economist (I'm an engineering consultant who happens to invest a lot). There, I've said it. I'll also say that economists have a pretty awful record when it comes to predicting economic downturns.
I'm starting to feel a little uneasy about the UK economy for several reasons (not just Brexit) and have carried out some research. Some of this research has lead me to believe that even worse problems are appearing in the US and China as well.

My reasons:
A few large housing construction clients have recently started delaying payments to My company (and others) and have even written this into all new contracts. Looking at the financial statements of these companies has shown that they hold a disproportionate amount of property in London. A potentially related issue is that house prices in London have stalled (and reversed in some areas). A deeper look at the UK economy shows that the UK House price / earnings ratio is currently 5.73%, a 2nd only to the all time high in mid 2007 (that date sounds familiar). 

Quick research:
I then looked at UK personal debt and you guessed it, currently running at an almost all time high of 126% of income. Therefore it is not unexpected to find that consumer spending is almost £60,000,000,000 more than the consumer disposable income. Personal savings are currently 1.7% and have dropped significantly since last May (possibly to cover gap between disposable income and spending).

Before I lose every bodies attention by spouting numbers, I should note some of the reasons behind the 2007/2008 recession:

-Low interest rates meaning more people believing they can afford homes out of their reach

-Government backed mortgage schemes

-Lax regulation of lending

It is worth noting that in the UK at least, these are all true. Low interest rates are leading to high inflation and must rise eventually. The government ‘help to buy’ scheme has increased the potential for risky lending. The regulations for lenders are much firmer than in 2007, but in the last budget some of this was reversed.
I have not considered other countries in as much detail, but have noticed the US housing market has effectively stalled (I’m not sure about the historical performance of this and should look at it again in the future). China’s economic data has been taking a downward turn for many years, which is a bad sign, especially as its debt to GDP ratio is increasing fast.

When will it happen?
Large economic downturns are often caused by a bubble in a market (i.e. housing, fad companies etc). A few potential hazard areas to look out for could be:

- Car finance market is vastly overpriced and could burst at any time

- housing market (again)

- tech company bubble. Are facebook, twitter, etc worth anything (never mind the Billions they are listed as)?

-credit / storecard lenders. It’s worth noting that Provident are massively struggling at the moment and might well go under (caused by unrelated circumstances, but may be a trigger).

As I said this is just my interpretation of the data and I may be finding correlation that is not relevant. If anyone has a better insight into this, or knows more about economics than I do, I’d be happy to hear your opinion.",finance
personalfinance,Is it even worth asking for more money for an entry level job?,"I'll be interviewing soon for my first, real world big boy job in the field I went to school in. Without giving away too much information, the position is a six-month contract job and my title would be ""Associate Imagery Analyst"". Their advertised starting hourly rate is $15/hr full time until the contract expires. Keep in mind I didn't find this job on my own, I was found by a recruiter who thought it would be a good fit for me. Plus, from the conversations I've had with him, it seems like they may be having some difficulty finding enough people to fulfill this contract with the vendor (there are five positions they are trying to fill, so far I think he is still looking for three more). They were hoping to find enough people, from what I can presume, in order for everyone to start next Monday, I interview on Thursday.

Looking on glassdoor for my state (Colorado), the lowest minimum salary for imagery analysts is $37k per year, which I would expect is fair for someone straight out of college. When I did the math (and it is entirely possible I did it wrong), the hourly rate to meet this minimum salary would be $18.5/hr. Is it still worth it to ask for more? I definitely need this job to get my foot in the door in this industry and I know plenty of peers who have told me how this job can be a stepping stone into something big in the future.

This job would work perfect for me because the hours are flexible so I can work 4 10's and then a full day at my internship in order to complete it by the end of this semester. I'm afraid asking for more might turn them off a bit but, and I quote from the recruiter, I'm definitely a ""shoe in"" for the position. He told me the interview is only 15 minutes and that he is highly confident I'll get the job. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,Sudden wealth - tax burden,"Hi all:

I have been fortunate in my business (self employed, only employee) and next year I will be receiving about $6m. I am comfortable with the size of my business and have no desire to reinvest any significant portion of that money into the business for the sake of growing it. 

Last year, I hit the top tax bracket and, because this was unexpected, I did very little tax planning and ended up paying approximately 54% in taxes between self employment taxes (my business is an LLC), state taxes, and federal income tax. That was not a good feeling.

I am interested in hearing some ideas for reducing that 54% number next year that I can note and raise when I sit down with a financial advisor. I know I can fund various retirement accounts, but the contribution limits seem so low that it doesn't seem like it'd make too much of a dent. I have also looked into electing s corp taxation, since a reasonable salary in my field and area is $100,000 so I could save decently on self employment taxes. But is there anything else out there worth looking into?  

I am happy to pay my fair share of taxes. It just becomes a tough pill to swallow when that number is above 50%.

personalfinance,Benefit to raising credit limits while paying off credit card debt?,"With all of my credit card accounts combined, I have ~$10,900 of debt out of a $19,000 limit. I'm using the avalanche method to pay off my debt as I can (unfortunately three of my five accounts have a 23.99% interest rate). My longest account is two years--I clearly did a decent amount of damage in that time.

My reasoning is that in the short term, successfully negotiating a credit limit raise would lower my utilization and give a slight bump to my credit score. This is pretty important to me in the near future for two main reasons:

1) I'm headed back to complete undergrad within the year and will more than likely have to apply for a private loan. (Looks like most of them check your credit score--I'm an independent student at a private university and won't have a cosigner.)
2) Emergency ""funds"": While I know credit cards should not be used like petty cash it'd be nice to have the option, however undesirable.

My score is 674 right now. With all that said, is it worth it to call a credit card companies and ask for a raise? Is it likely, considering my two oldest accounts are nearly maxed out? Any options I'm missing?

Bitcoin,B-CH supporter being schooled on how Bitcoin works (crossposting to both subreddits),"You can follow the conversation we have on the topic of BIP148/BIP149 UASFs and how they are fundamentally much worse than any of the major hard fork proposals:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6v0gll/why_segwit2x_b2x_is_technically_inferior_to/dlynwsk/?context=9

And this is the text of my last response:

&gt; No, BIP149 is different. BIP149 it opt in for miners, they do not need to do anything.

Did you just blindly swallow all the propaganda about BIP149 that was fed to people, without understanding it? From your analysis of the two hard forks here you don't come across as having no clue about blockchain dynamics and security. BIP149 is as opt-in for miners as any other consensus change, soft or hard. Put yourself in the shoes of a miner. You are running one node software, someone mines the first block claiming 100% of SegWit spends as fees, the blockchain splits and you end up on one chain. Do you keep mining with the same node software as before? Do you start claiming SegWit outputs for yourself as well (only possible on the non-BIP149 chain)? It's your decision, but it's quite an important decision. Quite consequential.

&gt; I think most were bluffing. Could be wrong though.

&gt; I'm not saying bluffing is any more justified than not bluffing. Actually bluffing is probably even worse.

This is quite important. If you know of people who were speaking in favor of BIP148 who were bluffing, please tell us who they are. It would really help our community. If you think that some people did wrong things, it would help you as well if you speak out and shine the light on some of those wrongdoings.

&gt; Well I said 5% to 10%. Then you give a 0.3% example. Not sure why...

It is not an example, it is the empirical observation that only about 0.3% of the total hashpower was voicing support for BIP148.

&gt; Err, not sure I agree with that. Also I do not think the whitepaper talks about this either.

On page 6 read 11. Calculations:

&gt; We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest
chain...

&gt; The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's
Ruin problem....

&gt; Given our assumption that p &gt; q, **the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the
attacker has to catch up with increases.**

This is relevant for the probability of a UASF chain wiping out the majority chain once (which can then reappear).

&gt; Sorry, I do not follow. Not sure why or how non-UASF miners could do that. Please explain the scenario? I think that is unlikely to be an issue, as users would probably make sure funds were in a different output on both chains before using SegWit. 

Read [the link I already provided to you](https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin/pull/205):

&gt; it does make bcoin UASF-aware and redeems all value sent to witness program outputs in the mempool. As far as the main chain is concerned, these outputs are still pushdatas (anyone-can-spend)...
&gt; 
&gt; So, if you're running this code when the BIP148 hardfork happens, you could essentially get free money from transactions which have the nerve to send money to an unenforced soft-fork address...
&gt; 
&gt; This works because:
&gt; 
&gt; * The majority of the hashpower does not support UASF.
&gt; * Pre-UASF nodes will follow the chain with the most work.
&gt; * Non-UASF nodes will follow the chain with the most work.
&gt; * Witness program outputs are anyone-can-spend on the most-work chain.
&gt; * BIP148 misleadingly states that it will ""deactivate"" once the locked-in state is reached, but due to poor implementation of the code/idea, UASF behavior will never truly ""deactivate"" in reality. It may never follow the best work chain again and only end up following its own chain.
&gt; * The UASF does not prevent replay attacks in any way. The initial funding of a segwit addr is valid on the main chain.
&gt; 
&gt; If a UASF user sends their old coins to a p2wpkh on uasf-coin, anyone can redeem their money on bitcoin...

Author: chjj

&gt; Also, this concept is very different from the wipeout issue.

Indeed it is. It is much worse.

&gt; Im not sure miners stealing user funds is likely to be helpful.

It's not stealing, it's like someone convincing you to leave your cash on a sidewalk and then someone collecting it. Blame the person convincing you and then yourself.

&gt; if the economy wasn't running SegWit clients, doing BIP148 would have achieved nothing.

The fact that most of the economy was running SegWit-aware versions of Bitcoin Core is irrelevant for the chainsplit and subsequent critical security implications. Indeed BIP148 would have achieved nothing for those nodes without the mining majority (except for the free bitcoins for the miners). The economy, with few exceptions, was NOT running BIP148 clients.

&gt; Well it only worked once.

There were several soft forks which used very similar activation, by miner signalling.

&gt; The old BIP148 like method worked 5 times in the past

Show me one example of a soft fork which was activated when it didn't have a majority of hashpower on its side, or even that was not thought to have a majority on its side.

&gt; &gt; which could have been used against a UASF chain if it ever threatened to overtake and wipe out the main chain
&gt; 
&gt; Well the UASF did win...

No, there was no minority activation and consequent chainsplit, which this conversation was about. No one needed to employ this (except the hard fork, which was an even more explicit split).

&gt; ?? The miners ran BIP148 compatible code...

The miners ran code which prevented the detrimental effects of BIP148, starting with the chainsplit. In that sense it is a ""UASF defense"".",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Advice/opinions on first time financing of vehicle?,"Hey all, looking for a bit of advice.

I'm at the point where I've owned my first car (2006 year model) for 5 years now. Deciding I want something newer technologically, and ready to part with my original baby. Hoping to keep the budget under $20k (lower is better of course) and the monthly payment at about $350 or less.

I have a monthly income of about $2800 after taxes, $1300± available after rent/bills and such. So financially I feel I can handle the burden of a car note. My main issue is being in my early twenties, of course my credit isn't up to par. Limited history, 1 derogatory mark from Comcast, total score 552 as of writing this.

So with that said, what am I looking at as far as possibilities go? Too high to justify interest rates etc? Or would it be reasonable to look into a new vehicle within the next year or so?




Edit: if at all important, no significant savings currently, but putting a small amount away weekly to have ""something"".

Final edit: I appreciate all of the advice. While I can afford the new car, it simply wouldn't be wise. My plan is to get a secured card and build my credit for at least another year, while also taking the expected payment amount ($300 or so) and putting it away monthly to get used to the expense. Then using the saved money toward a downpayment.

personalfinance,Hit a dead end trying to pay for college with a family that's weighing me down,"Okay Reddit, this is a mouthful but I'm desperate for advice and don't have reliable adults with solutions in my life. I've searched Google endlessly but I need personalised advice 

Tl;Dr for background as to why I'm in this situation:
-My parents are toxic and mentally/emotionally abusive, they tried to kick my brother (John) and I out of the house, threatened to call the cops on us for trespassing, threaten us that they will ruin our lives the way we ruined theirs, charge for anything they can think of, and don't allow us to be home when they're home unless it's to sleep
-I think something is wrong with my dad mentally but I can't get him to go to the doctors-- for example, he hangs out with Johns 18yo ex girlfriend and treats her like his daughter but does stuff to hurt John and I 
-My mom is completely on my dad's side no matter how much we try to reason with her, we've got a 10yo brother that we've stuck around for, and John and I are decent kids-- neighbors love us, bosses love us, teachers love us, we don't get into trouble or act shady... we just have very dramatic, erratic and aggressive parents 

Here's my financial problem:
-I attend U of San Diego, a private school that costs approximately $23,000/semester for only tuition, dorming is $5000 for a total of $28,000. My parents cosigned my last two semester loans with me but now I'm in my final year and they refuse to cosign again. They absolutely, completely refuse and said they don't care what happens. My cousin was going to cosign with me but had to back out for personal reasons and I have no other family or trusted adults to ask. 
-(Per semester) I have a scholarship of $9000 and receive $2000 in subsidized federal aid and $1000 in unsubsidized federal aid (which I try not to use). Financial aid covers about $11000/semester and I usually save $2-3000 to help pay... So I only need to take out $14-15000 in private loans (Wells Fargo) per semester 
-My Academic Advisor, the only adult I feel like I can turn to with my situation, helped me appeal to Financial Aid, the Dean and professors involved in student affairs so that I could get more aid. By the end of the process I was only given $4000/semester more. However, because of issue with my family I haven't been able to save up that $2-3000 so I still need $13,000 in loans
-I've had a credit card for 10 months, with decent credit but when I applied for a loan they said it wasn't strong enough and I needed a cosigner
-My parents make just over $100,000/year but I dont see a dime of it... I've been financially independent since I was 19 and I just turned 22. They used to pay for my car and cosign my loans but I've paid for everything else (health, food, gas, community college) by myself 

Here are my questions:
-Besides federal aid and scholarships, both of which I've already pursued, is there another option that will help me pay for school? 
-Can I somehow be declared independent even though I don't meet FAFSAs general criteria but I'm basically independent anyway? (I hardly even live at home also) 
-What are trustworthy companies that offer student loans for borrowers with minimal credit and no cosigner?
-At what point is an interest rate for a student loan too high?
-I also need a car but should I prioritize that over paying off my $2000/$3000 c.c. debt or should I lower my c.c. debt first? 
-What can I do to make myself eligible to borrow without a cosigner for the spring semester?

In advance: THANK YOU REDDIT!!! This summer has been hellish and devastating and I want nothing more than to finish my last year of school so desperately. 

Edit: thank you for all the responses I recieved. Even though unfortunately none of them worked for me for, anyone else who reads this post I encourage you to try anyway. Its worth it to go to school and don't get discouraged until after you've tried everything. Also don't be embarrassed that now you're behind, everyone goes at their own pace.
A couple other things suggested to me were peer to peer loans and credit unions. 
Good luck!!! And to those of you lucky enough to go to school, please don't waste it, and please thank your parents for helping you finish your education.

btc,My experience with a big blockchcain,"First and foremost, at this stage I'm still in both camps when it comes to bitcoin. I can honestly see the reasons why people support both coins. Especially on-chain scaling seems so simple and effective, I couldn't see why we would need anything else.

So to investigate further I decided to get my hands dirty and set up my own node. That was more than a week ago, and the blockchain isn't even 30% downloaded at this point. 140GB is A LOT of data to download. I realise I may be able to tweak some settings to speed it up, but for this experiment I wanted to see how a non-technical person would experience it.

I think this illustrates the problem with a very large blockchain. I am located in South Africa, with a 20Mbps fiber connection (or at least that's what they sold me). Local access is very fast, but downloading from other countries is  slow. If the blockchain were much bigger I would have just given up by now - 140GB is just about as much as I'm willing to try to download. 

To put this into perspective, I work for a software company and we have lots of clients in the USA. We regularly need to get data from them, normally 100GB+. In order to get the data as soon as possible (in less than 2 weeks), it's usually cheaper and quicker for us to ask the client to buy an external hard drive, copy the data on there and send it via Fedex to our offices in South Africa. I'm looking at a stack of 500GB hard drives as I'm typing this.

So in summary, after a lot of reading and trying it out for myself, in my opinion the blockchain needs to be as small as possible or else we're not going to have many nodes, especially in developing countries like South Africa which needs them the most.

personalfinance,Pay off student debt or invest??,"Hey Personal finance. I want to know if i should pay of my student debt or invest my money.

I am aged 21.

I am coming towards the end of my University degree and thinking about my student debt. I expect to graduate with roughly $30,000 in debt. The interest rate in this debt is indexed to inflation. I will not be required to make any compulsory repayments until i earn over $55,000 a year.

I currently have $60,000 in equities, in the form of 2 index funds. Most the this was purchased through working during highschool and Uni. 

Once i finish should i pay of my debt with the money i have in shares? 

My thinking is that if can earn more than the inflation rate in the stock market than i should not pay of the student debt until compulsory repayments are taken out of my pay.  If so my current strategy would be best. Is there any assumptions i should be considering now or in the future.

I have steady employment making $20 an hour for about $450 a week and have the capacity to invest or pay debt at a rate of about $1500 a month. I also expect to earn a one of payment of roughly $5000 per year on a ongoing basis through a inheritance arrangement.

FYI, I'm 24 years old, married, and our household is earning about $100k gross annually.

The theory, in my mind, is my 401k and ESPP have been averaging about 10% returns annually combined. The credit card has an interest rate of 15.65%.

So really my predicament is X loan - (New monthly payment in December 2017) = $1000. If that makes sense.

1. DIRECT STAFFORD UNSUBSIDIZED: Loan Amount: $7,302 Interest: 4.29%

personalfinance,How do I figure allowances for federal and state taxes?,"So I'm 23 and sad to say I still don't really understand taxes. I file every year using TurboTax but I don't really understand what I'm doing, I just follow the prompts and I've never had issues. Though I always get sizeable refunds so I assume that means I'm overpaying in taxes correct? Anyway my main question is how I'm supposed to figure my allowances for federal + state (IL) W-4 form. No one can claim me as dependent and I am single with only one job. Judging by the form I got from my job that means I should be filing with 2 allowances. That same form also says that number may be different from the number of exemptions I claim on my tax return which I don't understand because I thought the W-4 was for my tax return? However, after recently reviewing my pay stubs it shows that I'm claiming 0 allowances for state, which I don't remember doing when I got hired and don't think is right. Am I supposed to just claim the same amount on state and federal? I tried googling this but couldn't find any concrete answers.

personalfinance,Question about the right bank and credit card,"Hi all,

So I've decided it's time to get my first credit card. I'm 27, have a full time job and a side hustle, and haven't been late on a bill in over 5 years. I figure a I should start building my credit. But I have a few questions. 

I've already checked out some of the wikis and read how not to use credit cards, to avoid annual fees, and choose a credit card based on it's rewards. If I'm always paying it off in full before the deadline, interest rates shouldn't matter too much, but obviously I should still try not to choose one with insane interest rates. 

My main question is, should I change banks before doing this? I am currently banking with Wells Fargo. I've heard really shitty things about them, and I'm wondering if getting a credit card with them is a huge mistake. I could go with a credit union, which is the most popular opinion, it seems. But are there downsides to this? 

If any other info is needed from me, feel free to ask. Any advice is most welcome. I'm excited to start building my credit the right way. Thanks!",finance

I'm a 29 year old male in eastern Canada. I live alone. Because of stupidity while travelling, school, and poor financial habits, I've racked up a bit of debt. I also didn't get good education on finances while growing up. I'll give you the numbers;

-I am about $3500 in debt on my credit card.
-I'm $15 000 in debt on a line of credit due to schooling (flight school is expeeeensive).
-I live on my own, pay $800/month on rent.
-I make $21/hour, so after taxes, about $1000-1200/pay, so about $2300/month.

Bitcoin,I'm not worried about or our ability to mature the technical gaps currently facing crypto-currency. I am however worried about how US government / banking could tank value through regulation. Thoughts?,"From what I've researched, I think it inevitable that at some future date the US government and major banking institutes will determine that crypto-currencies are taking a bite out of their profit / control. They could deem bitcoin's ""illegal tender"" and shut down exchanges. They could threaten the loss of your tax-ID if accepting bitcoins, hell just the mention of the government getting involved in anti crypto-currency restrictions could tank value.

And the way I see it, how impactful this is to the crypto community has to do with how early the government acts. If they act before wide-spread adoption, where most still need to transfer funds from digital currencies to USD to make purchase for everyday life, we are F'ed. However if wide-spread adoption happens before government regulation hits, we may be far enough along where staying bitcoin to bitcoin (or whatever is the leading crypto-currency) for all your needs in life is possible.

We will overcome the transaction per second bottleneck, continue to patch vulnerabilities in the code, and think of new and innovative ways to use transparent block-chains. I just worry that it could all come tumbling down with hardcore government regulation and attacks. As as soon as the US government starts down that path full force, other counties will follow suit just like dominoes. Sure a few countries will allow it to be traded / mined, but then the value is .3 cents a coin and no one wants it anyways.

Am I seeing this wrong? Thoughts?",cryptocurrency

I look out further and find from Ripple themselves the RPC tool:

Rippex deducted my coins that never arrived. It shows up one directory but not on the other. How can that be aren't they all the same directory??

personalfinance,Is it worth it to pay my mortgage off this way?,"New home owner here. Got an amazing deal on my house at 80k. The mortgage is $711 per month. I chose bi-weekly payments because ive heard it takes 7 years off. (30 year loan, I've never verified that to be true though) The break down is pretty much 111 goes to principal, 300 interest, and 300 escrow.(that's not exact but is very close) That percentage makes me want to puke so I put 100 extra on principal each month. 

I recently took a pay cut but can still swing the extra 100. My car will be payed off in 8 months. That frees up another 400 per month. When that happens I'm considering putting another 150 or 200 of that toward principal.

My main questions are.. How much faster will it be payed off by doing Bi weekly payments and an extra hundred. If the biweekly actually shaves,off 7 years but the 100 only takes off like 1 year then I'd rather put it toward saving or investments. Same with the car money, if it pays it off significantly faster it seems worth it to put as much toward the principal as I can.

Ive looked online,for a payoff calculator, but all I find calculates a monthly payment, not ""if I put 'x' amount down with this interest rate it will be payed off in 'y' years

personalfinance,Defaulted on private student loan,"Hey all, just trying to get some perspective from outsiders as I've just learned of this today.

So, for college I had to take out federal and private loans. My private loans were through Sallie Mae. I got messages in college saying that Navient would be taking over Sallie Mae loans (or so I understood). 

My loans were deferred until I graduated, then I started paying Fedloan servicing as well as Navient. I thought that was all I needed to pay. 

Dumbass me didn't realize I still had loans to pay from Sallie Mae. Numerous emails to my old unused .edu email shows they tried to contact me. Mail to an old mailing address was sent. Basically, I've defaulted on my loan (through no ones fault but my own) and have been told today after a phone call that the amount due is about $16,000. 

It hasn't gotten to legal proceedings as I have a co-signer on the loan. Buddy who spoke to me from Sallie Mae says they might be able to work it down to $12,500 ""off the top of his head"".  

Now, I'd accept defaulting and going to collections if it was just me, but my co-signer is a parent and I don't want them to fucked for my mistakes. 

At this point, I could be able to get by with paying my max of $2500 per month.

Is there any chance I could convince them for a 5 month payment plan? I'm doubting it, as I've read it's either lump sum or nil most cases. Am I basically either going to have to borrow from friend/family, take out a loan for the loan, or eat the hit on credit for both me and my co-signer?

Any help would be appreciated. Again, I know I'm a dumbass, I'm just looking for clean-up now.

personalfinance,Best place to stick money for 6 months,"Just received a one time payout of $100k from a business venture I was involved in (effectively a buyout). No taxes were taken out, so I know we'll be on the hook come April. We (wife and I) spoke with a tax accountant who said to prepare for as much as 55% being gone (if self employment tax applies, etc), so we are trying to figure out the best place to stick our money.   

Our plan right now is to just put $50k in a 6 month CD and see exactly what we owe after deductions and what not, then invest whatever is left in April. But a 6 month CD will probably only make $200-$300 in that time period. It just seems like we're missing out on some potential  here. But an index fund has some risk. Savings accounts are slightly lower interest rate.

Has anyone else been in this situation before and what did you do?    

Any advice on where to stick a large chunk of money that I probably need to have in 6 months, but that I also would like to get some return on? Or is the best advice just to be really conservative with it, file taxes as early as possible, and then get any extra into something else?

personalfinance,Recently acquired a new job and the taxes being deducted out of my first paycheck seem abnormally high. Did my tax bracket change? Is there a formulation on how I can calculate the correct amount?,"I recently got a new job and was surprised at the amount of taxes deducted out of my first pay check. My prior job I was making $47,000 and was approximately getting about $400 removed from each paycheck (federal tax, CA state tax, medical, social security, disability). The pre-tax amount per paycheck was around $1,900 and the net was around $1,500. My new salary is $68,000 and pre-tax amount on my first paycheck is $2,615 and the net amount is $1,868. Taxes being deducted are now $746 per paycheck. This does not include any other deduction such as insurance. 

I thought that I still fell into the same tax bracket between $37,950 to $91,900 given my 'Single' filing status. If my research is correct, my tax rate should be 25% however given the numbers on my first paycheck, I am paying 29%. 

On my W-4 form, I list 2 allowances. Please advise if I need I'm being deducted too much in taxes or i this is accurate. I don't want to adjust my allowances for fear of owing money come tax season but would like to see my paycheck be higher as I did receive a $20,000 raise by switching jobs however I'm only receiving $7,200 of that annually.

If anyone has any options or things for me to consider, I would greatly appreciate the tax expertise.

personalfinance,Question about when/how to trade in my current vehicle!,"Hey r/personalfinance!
I'm a medical student who currently owns a 2011 Chevy Cruze, on which I owe $6,710 currently at a 5.9% interest rate. The car has over 70,000 miles on it and has recently begun experiencing some mechanical issues which I have been paying out a lot of money to deal with. I do not feel very safe driving the car long distances, and next year I am likely to be doing at least an hour commute a few days a week to and from clinical rotations.  


I'd like to see about trading this car in to get a used vehicle with low mileage from a reputable manufacturer so that I don't have to worry about my car continually breaking down and costing me money. But I've never traded a car in before. My current KBB value for the Cruze is $4,200 trade-in and $6,301 private seller. These are both a little below what I currently owe on the vehicle.  


My questions:  
- Is there any way I can get out from under this car sooner, rather than later?  
- Does anybody have any advice about trade-ins at a dealership? I know absolutely nothing about how they work.  
- Is it a bad idea to finance a used vehicle while I'm in medical school? Am I making a bad financial decision by trying to find a reliable vehicle that won't suddenly and unexpectedly blow my budget with repairs?  
- Can somebody walk me through what my best options would be for this situation?

I am an in-state resident and my bill for last year was just above 26,000. As a sophomore, my financial aid totals were 20,820.00, including Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans.

This year, my FAFSA was selected for verification. After verification, I received my Financial Aid Report. My financial Aid for this year is only $7,500. This includes 5500 in Federal Subsidized loans and 2000 in Federal Unsubsidized loans. Because I joined the commonwealth honors college, my bill for this year is just above 30,000 dollars. My expected family contribution for this aid year is just above 19,000.

I come from a divorced family, and there is a court agreement that states my family has to help me pay for college 60/40, up to ten thousand dollars, for all four years. My mom does not mind helping, but my dad has an issue helping me pay for school. It is a battle every year. Last year, he did not pay at all, and my mom ended covering his portion. 

I called the office of financial aid and asked why my aid was so low. I was told that when my dad filed his Dependent Verification Form, he listed 36,000 dollars in deferred income. This is true - but (at most) my father is only willing to help with the court ordered 6,000 dollars. I was told that because of this, I will not be receiving any more aid.

Now I am stuck with, at best, a ten thousand dollar bill that I can not afford to pay. Other than dropping out or taking private loans, what can I do? Any assistance would be much appreciated.

personalfinance,Possible Large Pay Cut to move to Salt Lake City?,"I'm just looking for opinions on my current situation/dilemma from others on what they would do.  My wife and I currently live in Federal Way, WA (30 mins south of Seattle).  I make 103k/yr and she makes 41k/yr.  My current job also has decent benefits to include a state pension, 457b (currently maxing out each year, but am way behind on retirement funding), 25 days PTO, get every other Monday off, and work from home 3 days per week.  We also currently own a house here which was 290k, and have only owned for 2 years, and 2 months.

Her family lives down in the Salt Lake area and we're considering moving down there as early as next year.  Part of the reason is due to possibly bringing a kid into the situation in the next couple years (being around family important, which is why we wouldn't have a child here), and partly because I think I'd personally be happier in general living down there. 

I realize the cost of living down there is a bit lower than here from everything I've been reading, but it doesn't seem terribly lower than here in Federal Way unless I'm mistaken.  Realistically based on jobs I've been looking into (I'm a senior system administrator currently), I'd be qualified making anywhere between 60-85k there (wide range, I know).

Plan A:

Plan B:

personalfinance,I need to figure out whether it is better for my elderly (62 yo) father to get Term or Whole Life insurance. [Florida],"Please read before commenting. 

The situation is as follows:

My parents are immigrants to the US with practically no cash, no chance of ever investing in stocks or putting money in IRAs or any other of the upper-middle class strategies for 22 year old college graduates of PF usually focus on. They have a good amount of debt, live paycheck to paycheck and rent.

Anyways, in 2003, my parents bought term life insurance for 15 years at a total premium of 100 dollars for both of them and a death benefit of 500k for my father and 250k for my mother. They got this with the help of an agent who is now retired. 

The policies expire in a couple of months, and it looks like they can keep the same policies, but the premium guarantee period expires after 15 years. I don't know how much the premiums will cost now but they will go up. My father also now has pre-diabetes and hypertension.

So now my father wants to purchase another policy since he obviously hasn't died. Before you say ""why do they still need a policy, its not needed anymore etc etc etc"", they want a policy, I already told them I don't need any benefit, but they still want a policy primarily for my mother if my father dies. Therefore I am looking for advice that is not ""don't get a policy"". 

The three options that they seem to have is 

1. Keep this policy and see how much the premiums go up until he dies. 
2. Find another term policy for 15-30 years and see how much that premium would be. Since he is pre-diabetic, I don't think this is an option.
3. Get a Whole Life policy with the same company with a guaranteed premium.

The agent from before who is now retired (and therefore get no commission or anything, he's helping as a family friend) advised my father to go for option 3 because they will not ask for a medial exam in the same company. But I see than in PF and the rest of the internet whole life policies are hailed as Satan's work incarnate. I don't see any cons to it if the premium is lower than a new term policy or the current term policy. People talk about the ""estate tax"" but Florida doesn't have an estate tax and the federal estate tax waiver is 5 million dollars. 

So the question is, why would it be a bad thing for my father to get a whole life insurance policy if it means no medical exam and the premiums are similar to a new term policy?

TLDR

- Father's term policy will lose its premium guarantee soon
- Wants a new policy with a fixed premium because with no death benefit my mother will be basically be left on the street and I can't support her.
- Since he now has pre diabetes and hypertension, probably will not be eligible for a policy if it requires a medical exam
- If he gets whole life from the same company, they will not require a medical exam
- no estate tax

personalfinance,22 years old considering options of buying vs renting,"Hey PF, I'm currently stuck in an internal debate. I'm moving back to my hometown in the Midwest, where cost of living is pretty reasonable. As I started to look at housing, I started to think that perhaps buying a house would be the smartest option for myself. I need some guidance in this thought process. It's not something I'm looking to do right away, but I would want to start the buying process in a year or less, if possible.

Some basic information about myself:

- 22 years old, 33k/yr salaried in a stable career, take home $880(after 401k contributions) bi weekly
- make quarterly bonuses that vary, currently usually about $500 after taxes but since I'm internally transferring to a completely different region it is expected to increase.  
- owe $13k on my car still, my monthly payments are $280, my interest rate is really awful, I am planning on refinancing as soon as my loan balance is low enough.  
- owe ~$600 on an amex, currently not paying interest and working on paying it down asap.
- credit score currently sitting around 670, credit karma estimates it would go up to ~730 if I pay off my amex(seems a little far fetched to me tbh).  
- currently have $300 in savings, I have not really been mindful about saving ever since I bought my car a year ago, but I am working to change that. 

Why I want to buy rather than renting:

- average rent for a 2bd apartment or townhome is approximately $900, I would have a roommate to make it personally $450. This is usually including most utilities.   
- I've looked at houses that are selling for ~$60k, more than two bedrooms, that are not in need of major repairs, and the estimated mortgage payment would be around $400 for a 15-year fixed with 10% or $6000 down.   Assuming utilities and taxes aren't outrageous, it'll workout to just a bit less than renting. I would still have a roommate to decrease monthly payments.  
- I have a breed of dog that is considered a ""dangerous breed"" and it is seriously limiting my options for renting.
- I like the idea of paying into my own equity.  
- I work for a bank and would receive benefits in the mortgage process.  

 

I am aware of downsides, like being financially responsible for repairs, major or minor. The market's alleged impending crash. Risks to my credit if something happens to my finances and am unable to pay my mortgage. I really need some outside opinions and input to help me think about this. I appreciate all advice in advance.

In my case, the highest interest loans are on the smallest balances. Is there a systemic way to calculate how to allocate excess payment to minimize interest paid over time?

I have a 770 score, good credit history, and have not had problems pinching pennies. 

On a separate note, how does the minimum $470 payment get allocated to my principal and interest? What can I expect once I graduate? Will MGL sell my loans off to a number of small companies? Is this $470 a number I can rely on being my minimum payment?

I called the number provided by my employer and the agent said it was because I was over paid on my EI I was on over five years ago.   

The agent said I was sent letters regarding the matter, but I never received anything. The agent pretty much called me ignorant. I'm just at a loss! I was never notified of this, and they wouldn't even tell me how much of my paycheck would be garnished.   

What are my options? What do I do? I'll be grateful for any advice moving forward. And if this isn't the right sub, I'll post elsewhere. I'm honestly in such a panic right now.",finance
personalfinance,"20k student loans, make around 70k pre tax, advice on prioritization of payments.","Hi All,

Some background real quick.  Graduated college a few months ago with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  I got lucky and landed a nice job at a large company straight out of school, hooray!  Live in Oregon.

So finances:

I make around 70k/year pre-tax.  This includes bonuses, 4 quarterly per year and 1 annual.  Income without bonuses is about 64k.  I have 20k in student loans.  Was 25k about 2 weeks ago, but I got my first check, which included a 7.5k (before tax) relocation bonus.  I immediately used that first check to pay off 5k of my loans.  

The above payment took care of most of my unsubsidized loans and the interest they had accumulated, with only 1.5k unsubsidized left at 3.76%.  The remaining 18.5k is federally subsidized until mid-December 2017.  The 18.5k is split between 4 loans (4 years of college), with an average interest rate of 4.125%.

I have no debt other than the student loans.  Pay off my credit card every month, think I've been late on 1 payment in 4ish years because I was dumb and forgot about it.  Believe I have a decent credit score (if that's relevant).

Retirement and Investments:

I'm currently enrolled in my companies stock purchasing program which takes 3% of my post-tax income, this can be set to anywhere between 1-6%, but can only be changed every 6 months.  I have 10% of my income going into a Roth 401(k) through work, they have a contribution amount but I honestly haven't figured out exactly how it works.  Fairly certain its based on my pay, not a direct match.  I also contribute 40% of any bonus' I receive to the 401(k) (didn't apply to relocation bonus).  the 401(k) contribution can be changed whenever I want.  

I also have 1.5k in a Roth IRA that I created when I was 17ish.  This doesn't have much contributed to it because during college I only worked summers.

Expenses:

$500/month rent

$75/month utilities (roughly)

$500/month food (was $400 in college but I feel like I spend some more now, haven't been keeping track because of laziness after graduating).  Probably my highest wasted spending area.

I don't drink or spend money on any of that type of stuff, which saves me a lot.  I do however spend a decent amount on video games.  My plan is to give myself a set amount to spend per year to make sure I don't go crazy now that I actually make consistent money.

I also plan on buying a car in about a year for 5-6k.  This would be from my dad, its a car I've wanted for a long time and he's finally convincing my step-mom to sell it to me.  The value is around the same as my current vehicle, but will have worse gas mileage.  I don't think fuel will factor in too much, but I will need to save that money up to purchase the vehicle.

I would also like to have around 10k in liquid or semi-liquid assets just in case something goes wrong, I don't want to be in major trouble.  Timeline for saving this amount is variable.


My strategy:

I see my highest priority as paying off the student loans while not contributing to my Roth IRA at all until these are paid off.  I'm on a 10yr loan payment plan, but my goal is to pay them off in 2-4 years.  Borrower allows me to pay extra/early with no penalty.

My main question is if maybe I should contribute less (or more) to the company 401(k) or focus on the student loans, which I feel like I'm doing with the situation outlined above.  

Another question I have is the Roth IRA worth contributing too at all, or should I focus on the company 401(k) while I work here (could be 2-40 years)?  Highly variable timespan I know, but that seems to be the case with the company I'm at.  Either short-term or full career length.

Really any advice is greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Applying for a loan - help!,"So I'm applying for a student loan but through a private company because the student program isn't degree-terminal, it's for a certificate, which doesn't qualify for government loans.

My question is this: When I'm applying for a loan, I realize that amount of credit vs balance is crucial: the lower the balance while maintaining high available credit is good. However, on applications they usually ask about my bank account balances - checking and savings balance, right?

So, should I pay off a bunch of credit debt and have more credit available, but a smaller bank account balance? Or should I keep a higher bank account balance, but keep the credit card debt? Which will make me more eligible for a better interest rate?

Also, I realize that you can't lie on your annual income - you have to submit tax forms and what not - but can credit card companies actually tell what's in my checking/savings account? Not that I'm trying to lie about that either (really!), but I'm asking because if I say what's in my bank account, but then pay off a lot of stuff later, won't that look different than what I said on the application?",finance

I'm living at my dad's currently where I will start my 2nd year at CC getting my basics out of the way which I decided to do to save money up for a 4 year so my dad created a 'deal', where every A I made he would refund me in full and every B I made he would refund me half. This worked the first semester, and I got 3/4 of my money back from him, but as soon as the second semester hit and I had paid the CC he claimed my behavior wasn't good and the deal was off. Not sure what I did honestly, and pretty convenient, but fine. I started to pay for it myself, since my dad hasn't done his taxes in years (he claims he's waiting to hire an accountant lol?) I apparently can't apply for FAFSA or a federal loan. 
   This has worked out ok until 2 weeks ago, he decided he would give me till September 1st to find a roommate and move out or pay a hefty rent price to him. I had already been looking for a couple months to move out because living with them is absolute hell, they are always being nosey, looking through my stuff, I can't bring friends over, ect. So they tell me that they've put an ad up on craigslist and will put my number on it so that I can find a roommate. So for the last couple weeks I've looked all around and I've only found creepy men and flakey people and it seems kind of sketchy. If I do move out, I only can make enough to pay for necessities, and I can't pay for car insurance. I can use some of the money I have saved for next semester, but that's it. I know that my dad makes 80k annually + 1.8k a month for child support from my mom, but he lies and claims it's a lot less and that's why he can't pay my tuition or my therapist appointments and pills for my bipolar (really fucking sucks), or a bigger apartment instead of having me and my sister of 16y/o share a room, which I'm really doubting because it's a luxury apartment and costs 1000+ than the places half a mile from the area, and he just bought a 2k poodle and expensive car for himself. He frequently refuses to buy me and my sister anything other than kraft mac and cheese and ramen to eat while going out to eat for him and my step mom. 
   I work a 30hr job at 15/hr and plan to take 13 hours this semester, but I've been thinking that I might have to drop out to be able to afford to live. I really don't want to do that though, I have mental health issues and I feel like I would become more depressed if I had to drop out because I love school but I hate living with my dad because we fight so much and he lies all the time. I think he's a narcissist because of the things he says and even my mom told me that when they were together he would give her 300 a month for her, me and my sister to survive off of while he kept the rest. 
   Is there any way I can find financial help without taking out a private loan or is my best bet to drop out of school this semester while I figure things out? My first day of classes is next monday and still don't have a place to stay until then. I know this is not just a personal finance question but also a general help question but I thought this might be the best subreddit to post in.

personalfinance,How much should my downpayment be?,"My wife was recently in a car accident. She was hit by someone who ran a red light. She's ok, but her car is totaled. We will be getting a check for about $11k from the insurance company. She is looking at several cars that are in the $15-18k range. I can't figure out the math regarding the best way to handle this. The highest interest debt we have is a $15k student loan at 5.44%. Should we try to put down a minimal amount toward her new (to her) car and use the surplus to pay down higher interest debt, or put down as much as we can to try and get the lowest rate possible? 

It seems to me that if the interest rate for the new loan were to be fixed at some rate below 5.44% and not dependent on the amount of the downpayment, it would make the most sense to put $0 down and use the entire insurance check to pay down the student loan. But we would certainly be offered a lower rate if we put down more money up front. So at what point do we cut it off? At what point does the lower rate for the higher downpayment become not worth the missed opportunity to pay down the higher interest debt?

Lastly, let me just say that I really appreciate this community. I have learned a lot about managing my finances in the last few years since I started reading this sub. But I know that many here will say that we should just get my wife a cheap civic and use the bulk of the insurance check to pay down existing debt, or at the very least buy a car that is less than $11k so that we can avoid taking on more debt. That isn't going to happen. She's getting a car in the range of $15-18k. I'm simply trying to get some help with the math and find the best way do disburse the insurance check between the downpayment and the existing debt. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

However, a few months ago a job great opportunity came along and my perspective shifted greatly, also due to having a long-term relationship with someone in my current city (Washington, DC). I'm planning on exhausting my 3 years of OPT (work visa for recent grads) and after that either grad school or permanent work visa.

I also have been saving and have a good amount invested in automated investing apps (Betterment) alongside with some other riskier investments (cryptocurrency). Here are the questions I mostly need advice/comment on:

1.  I have a secured credit card and have been using it sparingly. Any advice on which cards to get and how to get approved for unsecured ones? In particular, nothing I do seems to have an effect on my credit reporting (it is never available, and I've had an SSN for the past 2 years). The biggest issue I've had is with landlords, which by no means accept tenants with no credit history. Speaking of housing...
2. Should I consider buying a house anytime soon, or at least start saving with that in mind? I've been considering the idea after seeing so many friends do that in their early 20's and paying their mortgage by renting the second room. The idea of paying ~10k+ a year on rent stinks. However, having no credit, I'll have to wait a good amount of time to be able to get decent interest rates.  My savings amount to ~30k which need to grow much higher in case I want to put a down payment while having extra security funds.

personalfinance,Tesla (Kilocar) Lease (-$200/mo) vs Buy Question,"TL;DR:I can't quite wrap my brain around the depreciation vs loan amortization numbers to get an exact comparison. It seems there are a lot of ways to run the numbers and I guess it would involve coming up with an estimated depreciation curve to compare with the linear decrease in buyout on K? 

Sample Lease:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gpjj_lZZGxJQ9TkI7Mk5YAvBIqU1OFHkdcL0TpRNsJ0/edit?usp=sharing

For starters, the lease is through a third party called Kilocar who can beat Tesla's lease prices by $200/mo across the board, and has shorter terms:

Tesla Lease:36mo, $5k down

Kilocar Lease:&lt;24mo, $200/mo cheaper than Tesla stated lease price $5k down

So the Kilocar vs Tesla lease is a no brainer, but I'm trying to compare the (K) Kilocar lease(with buyout option)  to (B) buying outright myself... 


The included sample lease is probably the best resource as far as reliable numbers, so I'd like to run a comparison based on that purchase price, but I included a screenshot of Kilocar's comparison with slightly different #'s... 

Both K&amp;B would get me a 7500 fed rebate(with Kilocar I don't get it until I buy it out) 

K requires a nonrefundable $5k down-payment (which they basically give back to you in the $200/mo discount off Tesla lease) 

K provides flexibility to switch to new /different model at any point, no charge. 

K covers tax/title /license/delivery fee etc (only tax on lease payment) 

K allows buyout as soon as Jan 2018 with buyout calculation as noted in lease contract 

K gives me $1k refer a friend discount for each person referred, so there is opportunity to significantly reduce my payment

B financing through Tesla is (. 99%) up to 72mo

B has large sales tax up front, I believe 6.85% without limit, so ~$6.5k +title etc

I'm accustomed to owning outright, I do like to tweak things on my cars, and I put a lot of miles on (15k/yr+), but I guess that stuff doesn't factor in much with the buyout option because K doesn't require mileage penalties if you buyout at end of contract 


My not very scientific analysis:

K seems to get me lower monthly payments, and makes it more affordable short term by eliminating the big sales tax up front, but I can't quite wrap my brain around the depreciation vs loan amortization numbers to get an exact comparison. It seems there are a lot of ways to run the numbers and I guess it would involve coming up with an estimated depreciation curve to compare with the linear decrease in buyout on K? 

That's about where I get lost in the weeds. Thanks again for looking this over, LMK if you have any questions.

Years ago, I had a credit card. I was terrible with it. If I got low on cash, I would pull funds from the credit card, ultimately maxing it out multiple times. I did end up paying it off, but it took a lot of patience and perseverance. The account was then closed to avoid temptation. My credit score is less than impressive (other stupid past decisions), but it's climbing, albeit slowly.

Fast forward to two months ago, I received one of those credit card offers from my bank (USAA). I've been reading a lot of PF over the last couple of years after paying off the old CC and have effectively grabbed my finances by the balls, so after mulling it over for a week or so, I applied. To my surprise, I was actually approved! It's got a $500 limit and a 24% interest rate (gross), but I've not had an issue with that.

I've integrated in into my weekly budget and use it strictly for groceries, gasoline, and certain monthly bills. That's it. Nothing more. I even wrote out a few simple rules that basically spell out ""don't be stupid, stupid"". Whenever I use it, it gets paid off in 2-3 business days, which is when the charges are posted.

Those tweets weren't for us. I hope you realize. They were for BANKS.

They were for future investors in the banking industry who would seek to make use of something ENTIRELY BENEFICIAL WITH ZERO RISK.

And do you want to know how you assess risk in the banking sector at that high a level? You hear it from all the people also in your position or higher whose entire life and legacy will be determined by how well they manage to avoid risk and keep the ship from sinking at all.

So what is Ripple doing?

THEY'RE GIVING ALL OF THEIR CLIENTS A CHANCE TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN USING THEIR PRODUCTS AND ARE AT THEIR LEVEL. Hell, even the placement is insane because it's in Toronto, which will already have half the financial world attracted because of SIBOS (more on that in a sec)

I'm sorry that you may or may not have bought in at a point that resulted in a loss for you, or that this coin dropped while whatever you held before went up. BUT THAT IS NOT RIPPLE'S FAULT. THAT WAS YOUR DECISION. 

You can either sell and leave, or stay and hold, either way, BE QUIET UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE TO SAY.

And look who they got to speak for them, it's not just about money, I mean, it definitely is in large part for the speakers, HOWEVER, just like any salesman that has control over what he can represent, these men are still selective in whom they speak for especially as keynote speakers IN FRONT OF THE CROWD THEY HAVE LISTED ON THE DAMN WEBSITE.

I don't understand why there isn't more hype, RIPPLE IS NOW GONNA BE AT SIBOS AS WELL AS THEIR OWN SWELL CONFERENCE AND THE DATES MATCH UP.

They went from uninvited to SIBOS to somehow booking the previous chair of the Fed Reserve (And as much as I understand he's hated by many, regardless of his performance he is a BIG deal with BIG connections who attracts BIG names ESPECIALLY in banking or does it not matter to you that he was one of the top 3 dudes in US money for 8 YEARS) and also suddenly becoming one of the main events at SIBOS.

This is the cryptocurrency with the most positive real use cases aside from Bitcoin (even then honestly, the proportion of positive results and non complaint uses is probably much higher for Ripple by now) and the most potential money value attached to it and y'all wanna sell just to get rid of it? Short term explosion is ONLY healthy in cases of sudden, but facilitated adoption by a critical mass of actual users.

Has that happened yet? No. Will it happen? VERY SOON (after all, Santander is already using an App with their network and Japanese banks have been testing the software VIGOROUSLY while making use of the XRP token)

So please, learn to breathe, know that this is an investment and that there is no easy way to make instant money short of proven insider info and dumb luck.

MachineLearning,"[R] New approach to Sparse Discriminant Analysis, looking for feedback!","Hi /r/MachineLearning 

I've been working (in collaboration with others) on this R package [accSDA](https://github.com/gumeo/accSDA), (accelerated sparse discriminant analysis), which is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/accSDA/index.html). The research behind this has mostly been application of alternative optimization approaches, which are considerably faster than the traditional approach (old version available as an R package [sparseLDA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sparseLDA/index.html)). I am currently looking for feedback on the package.

**What problem does this package solve?**

This algorithm solves supervised classification problems with multiple classes, where the number of variables can be considerably larger than the number of samples, i.e. *p&gt;&gt;n* problems. The underlying optimization problem that is solved is called *sparse optimal scoring*. This is achieved with an elastic net regularizer.

What the algorithm essentially does, is that it finds the best projection of the data, to a lower dimensional space (representation) for linear separation. These projection vectors the method finds, (discriminant vectors), can be sparse, meaning that the algorithm ""chooses"" the most promising variables to use for the projection, I.e. the ones that matter for the task at hand. After the selection of variables, you can also use another classification algorithm, so you can use this in a sense as a supervised version of sparse PCA, or you can just classify according to the nearest centroid. The dimensionality reduction is better than PCA, because we use the labels, I.e. it is supervised, we are looking for the directions of variation that separate our classes.

I have several example use cases, but the examples in the accompanying paper are rather convincing. Here are a couple of other ones:

  1) I have used this to [detect foreign objects in multispectral X-ray images of food items](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-59126-1_29). To summarize, these images are like regular images, except each pixel has 128 channels instead of just 3 for red green and blue. So for each pixel we have a spectrogram, that gives a measure of the material composition of the sample. I can release the code for this article and some example data if there is interest.

  2) I used this in a machine learning competition on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/indeed-ml-codesprint-2017), the *indeed* challenge. The task was to create a multilabel classifier to tag job descriptions for tags like, BSc degree needed, 5+ years experience needed, etc. In this case I just used the method to select the best terms from my document term matrix and I fed that to xgboost. I was pretty satisfied with my performance, since I am no expert on NLP problems and this was my second ML codesprint. I ended up in the 25th place and got a t-shirt :)

The feedback I am mostly looking for is:

  1) Can you get this to work? Was it hard or easy? Is the documentation clear? Should I add more examples?

  2) Would a semi-supervised version be interesting?

  3) Would a sparse ordinal classifier be interesting? I.e. ordinal labels.

  4) A C++ backend for the R package, that could also be used as a backend for a python implementation.

  5) Any quirks you want to see fixed?

Hope I get some feedback!

Also, if there is another subreddit where this would be relevant, I would like to hear about that!",technology
personalfinance,Unusual employer commuter benefit,"I asked this yesterday in the help thread, but I'm still confused. I've used commuter benefit savings before but, my the way my new employer does it is that they that they withhold it from your paycheck, only, rather than give you a card.

""In simple terms, we lower your gross pay to reflect your commuter spending so when you file your taxes for 2017,  the amount you spend per year on commuting is not calculated into your gross earnings—money is not actually set aside or taken out of your paycheck, it's more like an allocation to save on taxes. You may continue to pay for transportation as you have done already.""

The explanation seems off, but maybe I'm not used to this. Am I missing something?

Edit: I am going to try to access ADP, to check my paychecks to clarify where the money is going.

Edit2: I checked my pay stub, as requested. What they do is deduct the ""benefit"" by the amount I asked for.

personalfinance,I am in my late 20s and recently diagnosed bipolar. I need some coping techniques for curbing compulsive spending until therapeutic treatment can be determined.,"Hello /personalfinance!  Thank you, as always, for the invaluable service you provide the Reddit community.

For at least the last ten years, I have carried a dual diagnosis of depression and anxiety.  For years, I believed those issues were what caused all of the uneasiness and mental turmoil in my mind all the time.  Things like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia never occurred to me because those are ""serious"" issues and I did not think mine were.

For as long as I can remember, I have also been awful with money and financial planning.  I have never had a savings account with more than $100 in it.  When I improved my credit enough to qualify for credit cards, I immediately took out six of them and proceeded to nearly max out any of them with a 0% introductory interest rate.  I purchased new kitchen appliances and tile flooring in credit knowing I probably could not afford it.  I bought a brand new car in 2015 (STILL kicking myself every day for that one) which I pay $470 a month for.  I buy things almost every single day because once I become fixated on something I ""need,"" my brain cannot let it go.

My therapist informed me that compulsive spending is a hallmark trait of bipolar disorder; when I am manic I buy because I'm having fun and when I'm depressed I buy for the instant gratification to cheer myself up.

Obviously the main goal for me now is getting my therapeutic and medication regimen straightened out.  However, my therapist of course warned me that could take months. 

In the meantime, I am desperate for tips, tricks, and techniques to help me curb my compulsive spending, combat the overwhelming desire for instant gratification, and get some control over my life.

Thanks so much, guys.

[**Edit:**] I was on mobile and apparently accidentally flaired my post as ""Insurance"" the first time around.  Oops!

Second: I am blown away by all of the responses already.  I thought I would be lucky if I got maybe one or two responses after a few days.  Thank you all so much.  I will respond individually with questions or accolades as time permits.  Also, I want to recognize this community for their health-friendly approach as I haven't seen a single poster say anything negative about my mental illness which is so helpful in a time like this when I am struggling to accept it.",finance

personalfinance,"Graduated From Med School Off Cycle, and can't find loans to apply to residency programs. What options are out there?","Thanks for reading! Throwaway for identification purposes.

I recently obtained my MD. I graduated off cycle, and couldn't start residency this year, 7/1/17. I'll be starting next July, 7/1/18. For now I am working two part time jobs, including at a doctors office, which is *great* experience, and a great connection I cannot let go of. 

Due to having over $200,000 in loans already– No bank will give me another loan. I need a very small loan, 4k, in order to apply to an appropriate amount of residency programs. 

I'm living almost paycheck to paycheck in a high cost of living area. I'm doing well cutting corners and living frugally. I do not have the savings to drop the needed 4k in September. Unfortunately family assistance is not available. 

The only options I can think of are: 

1. Put the applications on my credit card, maxing it out. Current card has a 12% interest rate. (Seems like a bad idea)

2. Sign up for a new credit card with no interest for a year. (I see small perks including miles, which I'll need for traveling to interviews anyway). This seems like the better of these two sub-par options.

Other than that, I cannot find any other options personally. I'm all doctor– zero financial wisdom here.

personalfinance,"Bill given to a creditor, but it's more than the amount it should be.","I'm not quite sure how to handle something when the bill is wrong. The fact I owe money is real, but the amount is wrong.

Well... I broke the contract and would be receiving a bill. They never tried to bill me, (problem could have been discovered before they gave it to a creditor) 

The bill given to the creditor from the company is 14% more than the contract, and the company withheld my last paycheck, and didn't even apply it to the Bill, it just disappeared. And that wasn't in the contract. (I wouldn't have minded them withholding it if it went to the bill, but it poofed into thin air.)

personalfinance,Should I follow through with a Cash Value Life Insurance policy as an investment tool?,"Hello Everyone.

I met with some financial advisors from Mass Mutual a couple months back and one of their recommendations was to open up a Cash Value Life Insurance policy as an investment tool.  They have since completed the underwriting process for me and my wife, and before I jump in and commit to this, I want to double check and make sure I'm not making a big financial mistake here.

Some background: My wife and I are in our early 30's, we have ~$25k in savings in the bank and ~$26k in 401k.  We have no debt (student loans paid off, cars paid in full, and we rent).  We're hoping to save up to buy a house in the Denver area, and to have kids at some point (i.e. college funds for them eventually).

Basically, I'm looking for better options for investment options than keeping the money in a bank, since the interest rates are less than 0.1% in my money market savings, and somewhere around 0.2% (or less) for my time deposits. 

I'm also working on opening a brokerage account with Mass Mutual for investment purposes as well (low risk investments, treasury bonds I think).

I'm speaking with the financial planners later today for more details on my specific Cash Value Life Insurance policy (i.e. premiums, rates of returns, etc.).  I'll post more details after our talk.

What I'm looking for is advice on whether or not this Cash Value Life Insurance is a good idea, or if it's a terrible idea I should run away from right now.

Thanks.

CryptoCurrency,Tips for newcomers... from a former noob,"I've been involved in this space daily for about 4 months now. I don't know everything, but I've learned plenty a lessons about trading and the way this industry works. I figured it would be beneficial to compile some things people new to the industry may find useful. These are the tips that were given to me/I've learned:

1) Charts with lines and arrows are crap (sorry to you chartists out there). This isn't like dealing with stocks. You cant project earnings, look at financials, etc. People will constantly look for trends, some of which may actually be true, but the majority of people are just making a case for people to buy in to a specific token. This is a 24/7 365 industry, and it acts as such. It's always changing and trying to predict successes is like herding cats. I love day trading stocks and charting is a huge help to me there...not so much here. 

2) Holding is the best policy. Unless you're working with enough money, day trading can be difficult to turn a profit. You may very well hit the jackpot one day and wake up with some serious $$$, but don't expect every project to do that. This industry is reliant on adoption, and fed with speculation. Pick projects you can see lasting in this industry for years to come. 

3) Speculation rules the world. Words have serious power in this industry. A tweet from a developer can result in a spike, so do your best to stay on top of any news. I've only been on Reddit for two weeks, simply cause I felt like I had nothing to contribute previously, but don't be afraid to share what you find (with sources of course). Reddit is a great place for it, however....

4) Most of the Subreddits dedicated to specific projects are full of people that are invested in those tokens. Of course they are going to talk about how a friend of a friend heard that XXX is going up 500% tomorrow. Do your own research, never take advise from anyone simply because they have a lot of up votes. 

5) Don't store tokens on an exchange, unless your day trading. Even then, its risky. Use a paperwallet for long term holding, an external drive, or even something as simple as a desktop wallet (each token has something!)

6) Don't invest more than you can live without. This is so important. Yes you can make good money if you play your cards right. But chances are you wont be a millionaire overnight. Invest for your future. You'll thank me when you wake up in 5 years and now have a way to pay off your house/car, go to school, take a vacation, etc.

7) Don't be a dick. People are passionate about what they're invested in, and get offended when someone questions their logic. Just ask questions and respect people's opinions. 

8) Dont be intimidated if you dont understand the technology behind projects. Do your best to read the whitepapers, gain a bit of technical knowledge, and compile some data about projects your interested in. It's going to help you in the long run. This industry is still relatively new, and there are few ""experts"" out there, so dont panic like I did and feel overwhelmed. 

9) Dont pay anyone for advice. There are people on Twitter that claim to be right about every major spike, and then offer their services for a fee... Just dont. Come here and ask people what they think. Reddit is a nice place to ask questions and get in on news. 

Okay crypto world, take it from here:

personalfinance,What's the best way to save up for a house downpayment?,"I've recently relocated to the US from Canada to work here. Where I live, the price of owning seems significantly cheaper than renting. I can expect to stay in my current position for the foreseeable future.

I'd like to save up for the downpayment for a house. As a recent US immigrant, all my savings are overseas, and the exchange rate is not advantageous to bring it here right now. As a recent US immigrant, I am under the impression that I'll have to come up with the full 20% downpayment if I want to buy a house.

I've taken a look at the housing market in the neighborhood where I want to live, and I have realistic expectations. I calculate that, if I save 50% of my after-bills pay, I'll have saved up 20% of the price of the house within two years, which is reasonable. I can possibly do it faster, depending on how life goes.

I guess my question is on the practical stuff-

-What's the best place to put the money while I'm saving? Saving accounts have atrocious interest rates. Investing seems best for the long-term, otherwise I'm at the mercy of month-to-month changes in the market. 

-To buy a house, should I aim just for the 20%, or should I also take into account closing costs, etc...? Do those go onto the mortgage, or do you need cash in hand?

Thank you for any advice.",finance
personalfinance,Why did Jay Z and Beyonce take out a mortgage on their new home?,"[Jay Z and Beyonce took out a $52.8 M mortgage on their new $88 M home](http://variety.com/2017/dirt/real-estalker/jay-z-beyonce-bel-air-compound-1202538487/). Their net worth is a combined $1.16 B. Why did they take out a mortgage when they could seemingly readily pay for the house up front?

At first I was thinking with a low enough interest rate they could invest the money and, with high enough returns, simply generate a profit off the mortgage. But after running the numbers, even at 1% annual interest, they would have to generate at least an average of 13.6% return on investment for that strategy to be profitable. (1-principal/total mortgage payments)

Edit: Does someone want to help me figure out what I was calculating? I figured the monthly payment, PMT, (at 1% annual I got $169,826) multiplied by 360 months, N, minus the original principal, P, is the total amount in excess of principal that they'd have to pay due to interest. Divide that by how much they did pay to get the percentage of what they paid that went to interest payments. (PMT * N - P)/(PMT * N)",finance

I'm currently entering my first year of college and just recently applied for a credit card from 1st Financial Bank. (I applied but as of right now have not gotten a response.) So as of right now besides the base credit you start with I have nothing. But I'm trying to buy a car. I don't have one specifically picked out yet but at most I'm planning to spend $7,000. Fortunately my Financial Aid and State Grants cover my entire school tuition and even gives me an extra couple hundred dollars for myself. In order to buy the car I took out a federal loan totaling about $5,500 over the span of the entire school year.

personalfinance,Student Loan Excess Payment Allocation,"I am in the midst of paying off my student loans, all federal. For some background:


I make around $60k annually. My payment is $400/month. I have been paying $250 bi-weekly (for an extra payment annually) as well as directing my tax returns to these loans. 


I am paid ahead through 3/2018 with this method, so I have the option to allocate excess payment to principle balance. I had always heard to direct excess to the loan with the highest interest rate. My question is: with my highest interest rate loans now having lower balances, how should I best allocate those excess payments? Am I costing myself money by not paying toward the lower interest/high balance loans?
 ([These are my loans](http://i.imgur.com/eJptq85.jpg))

Other tips accepted/appreciated.

(PS, my plan is to begin paying more than that $500/mo, but I have been working to build up a healthy emergency fund with any money leftover at the end of the month. Once I hit my goal, excess money goes to the loans.)",finance

I'm aware the food expense is high due to eating out often. This is my unfortunate vice, and I simply haven't been motivated yet to do more of my own cooking.

Edit: Some people have asked additional questions I'll add to the OP.

My immediate goals are to maximize retirement saving and to build up sufficient funds to buy a house when I'm in a lifestyle situation to do so. I'm not looking to retire early, but I would like to be in a position where I have started early and can afford to back off rather than the other way around. As for a house, my job is stable for the time, but I do plan to marry at some point in the distant future and will be seeking to do so then. My credit situation is good, when I applied for my car loan it was at 780. It has likely dropped since then as I acquired a new card. I could probably stand to have more cards and a higher limit from a credit score perspective, but I don't like having additional cards as it seems like more hassle for me to manage. As for an emergency fund, it should probably be larger, but I do have family to fall back on in the worst case scenario.",finance

personalfinance,Wife bought a car and they just called saying they couldn't get the interest rate she signed for,"So my wife bought a car earlier this week and the salesman just called saying he couldn't work the financing they agreed to on the paperwork and that she needs to come back and sign new papers for a higher rate. It's only a matter of tenths of a percent and will only raise the payment $9, but I was wondering if this is something they could actually do? Isn't the original paperwork essentially a contract and if the dealer can't commit to the terms, that's their problem and not ours? Any help/advice is greatly appreciated.

Neither of us have purchased a vehicle before. We're not married and we have a combined income of roughly 50k and can put up to 4k down comfortably(Is more better?). Im looking at a cpo 2014-2016 gmc terrain from Carmax in the 17.5 -19k range. Both of our credit scores are just shy of 700. Does anyone have experience with buying from carmax recently? 

I know carmax offers multiple tiers of financing, but I've read it can be beneficial to seek a loan from a local credit union or bank. What are the pros and cons of going with a credit union over in house financing? How do i go about getting a loan from an insitution ive never used before, is it straightforward? We currently bank with wells fargo and both have a credit card with them. How high is too high of an interest rate?  We're looking at buying asap, Hopefully next week if all goes well!

personalfinance,"This makes sense, right?","I started a new job and screwed up my withholding.  I plugged all my numbers into the IRS calculator and it looks like I am going to be on the hook for a $2k tax bill if I don't change anything.  I can pay that.  That isn't a problem.  

I realized today, though, why not just stuff $6k into my HSA right before the end of the year?  At the 28% tax bracket, this would be a tax savings of about $2k give or take a few hundred and would bring me almost to the break even point.  

If I didn't do that, I would pay the $2k tax bill and put the other $4k toward my student loans.  That would mean I was paying 28% (taxes) to save 6% (my SL interest rate).  Instead, I can make a 28% return (my tax savings), plus whatever I can return by investing my HSA balance, and never pay taxes assuming I take my withdrawals against qualified medical expenses.

personalfinance,Another professional health school debt scenario...,"Hi everyone,

I don't check this sub very often but I would imagine that you guys get a LOT of questions on debt from med, dental, etc students. Well, here's another one but I haven't taken out the debt yet and still have a year to hopefully make the best financial decision to lessen the debt-load. I will be going into my final year of undergrad this year and currently have around $7k saved in my bank and can probably get it up to around $10-12 by graduation. However, as of now, I have a lease+living expense would take $5k away from that. I can probably give away my lease and live at home if necessary. I plan on working over the summer and am guessing optimistically to make $10-15k (prob closer to 15) so in total I'll have maybe around $17k plus or minus a couple thousand before entering optometry school. 

I am praying to god whatever school i go offers at least a couple thousand scholarship, which I expect to get if they do since I almost aced the OAT and after includnig that and doing work study, Im guessing my overall debt over the four years will be around$170-175k (not including the $17k i can chip in from undergrad). My parents havent really said much but I wouldnt be surprised if they chipped in at least $10k toward the debt also so my ultimate debt upon grad will be maybe around $145-150k. 

Post-grad, I expect to make around 100-120k pre-tax and I want to pay off the debt as aggressively as possible. I've lived like a peasant for the last 3 years, plan on living like a peasant during the optometry school, and don't mind living like a peasant for a few years after that. What's the best way to tackle the debt- a long repayment plan with small min payments and then throw all my extra cash at it like water on a fire? Should I try refinancing? I know very little about refinancing but from what i've read, typically you can refinance the fed loan from 6.8% to something a lot smaller (~3%) with a private company with little cons to this option.

personalfinance,"32, 92k salary, no debt, no assets, minimal savings.","Hi all, 

I'm not sure if I am in a healthy position with my overall finances, so I'd like some input. 

My whole life I've felt like I have been ""behind"" of where I thought I should be, and for the first time I'm feeling optimistic about the future, which is making me second guess myself. 

I was recently given a 30% raise in July. I also happen to make my last student loan payment during the same week. While the good vibes were flowing, I also decided to quit smoking. Two months later and I haven't bought a pack. :) 

The first few paychecks after the raise I didn't know what to do with the money, but now I've decided to put all 30% if my raise into savings and retirement funds. 

Here's my planned budget. 

Retirement:

My Roth 401k and Roth IRA are going to be maxed out, starting in 2018. For the remainder of this year I have substantially increased contributions, and will be on track next year. I have 15k in a traditional 401k, from putting in the minimum match for the last couple years, but I'll be switching over to 100% Roth contributions going forward. I work in in a financial company and with my 401k I have access to vanguard large cap and extended market index funds, with .04 expense ratios. 

Savings:

I have 8000 in a individual money market fund, which earns a decent interest rate, and is liquid enough for me to treat as my emergency fund. I also have 3k in a traditional savings account, just in case. 

Expenses:

I live in a tiny studio apartment, which costs about 1000/month, with all utilities and internet included. I have earmarked an additional 600/month for food, fun, and miscellaneous expenses. I have no television (not even Netflix), and my company pays my phone bill. I drive a 2010 chrysler Sebring, which is boring but dependable, and is fully paid for. 

My take home is about 1575 every two weeks, after taxes, and after putting enough into my Roth 401k to hit 18k by the end if the year. I hope to take 750 from every check and deposit it into savings. My Roth IRA contributions will come from those savings every year. 

At this rate I should be able to save about 15k a year. 

So, this is a large shift for me. Prior to the raise I was taking home about thr same amount of money, but I was only saving $100 per paycheck. The rest went to bars, dinners, and other stupid expenses. 

I feel good about my plan, but I wonder if it's enough. In 3 years I'll have enough for a decent down-payment on a condo, but I've already spent 3 years in this shitty apartment and I don't know if I have the patience to wait. 

I am also hoping to buy a nice car, which I know PF will shun me for, but I think if I stick to this budget I should be able to treat myself to a 40k depreciating asset, right? I would likely pay cash for it, but that means postponing home ownership. 

Maybe I should invest that 15k in my brokerage account somewhere? If so, where? 

If you've made it this far, thank you! Tell me what you think.",finance
personalfinance,(PT) Starting a new life abroad,"I'm not sure this is the apropriate sub for this question, but here goes:

I'm 32yo guy, single and fed up with my life and work in my hometown for some months now, and I've been considering to start a new life somewhere else, completely on my own. I decided that I would begin looking for a new job starting September, since August is the major month of the year in my current job - I work with my father in a family business, a retail jewelry/watches store in a small town. I make the minimum wage (about 570€/month) and currently have a savings account with around 3000€ (I know, it's not much).

I have three options in mind: move to the capital (Lisbon), move to the UK or move to the US (preferably). Moving to lisbon won't be much of a problem I guess, but I think it would be only a temporary solution to gain some experience in a ""real job"" before moving abroad.
 
The big problem here is that I don't know how to look for a job in these countries - are there any good online sites that help with that? - nor do I know anything about living in these countries when it comes to personal finances, health, etc. How can I learn more about this?

I suppose I could start by moving to one of these places and start looking for a job there, but again my savings aren't that big and I don't think I could support myself for too long with it if I don't get a job fast.

Also, I'm a little affraid because I think these 2 countries aren't exacly fond of foreigners right now, but maybe I'm wrong.

personalfinance,Debt consolidation while abroad (UK/LUX),"So I recently moved to Luxembourg for a new job which I start in a few weeks. I'm basically living alone so now I have to really get my finances in order as I don't have anyone to fall back on IF I needed it.

I've got a bank loan back in England for around £13,000 but to pay off today is £9,832.56. The interest rate is quite high(19.9%) and I'm paying £230.31 monthly. Got a single 0% Balance transfer credit card for 32 months which is being managed fine.

My question which I can't seem to find an answer to as it only comes up with people running away from student loans abroad. Can/How can I take out a new loan which will have a lower interest rate or lower monthly repayment if I am technically no longer a UK resident. The new job is for 2 years minimum but subject to a 3 month probation period so I'd say I'm like in some sort of Limbo of being a uk/lux resident. 

My overall plan for this is to just reduce my UK outgoings as next year I plan to start renting a apartment (currently a friend has offered their spare studio apartment rent free) so any changes I can do will help me more next year. Right now it's not essential but it would be nice to get myself sorted out sooner than later.

Bitcoin,COINBASE ACCOUNT RECOVERY - No webcam? No problem!,"I figured out a way to recover a lost coinbase acct. without a webcam! Since modern web browsers access the webcam via a driver call (at least on windows), you can download software that will install a webcam driver on your machine. This particular software will let you feed an image into the driver so when your browser makes a webcam driver call, it will feed it the picture you provide! I've already tested it and it works great! I used this sofware on Windows 7:

http://splitcamera.com/

install it, take a selfie pic and download it, and set the selfie pic as the camera source. Go thru the coinbase recovery steps and when the time comes for the webcame to kick on it will be fed the selfie image you set. Works just fine!

I cannot directly borrow money from a Canadian bank to purchase U.S. property, but is there anyone out there who managed to, let's say, refinance their Canadian property and used the money to purchase a U.S. home outright?  I am looking to purchase maybe a 150K to 200k condo here (in the U.S.), so I don't need a ton of money (It would seem like I am positioned well in this).  I just need justification from someone who did this before?

By the way, I have no plans of selling my Toronto condo... I just want to borrow more money from my Canadian bank to purchase my U.S. home, but the money I will be receiving from the bank is more of a re-finance of my Canadian condo... is this even possible??

I need feedback, pros/cons to this, etc... thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Am I really supposed to put all extra money towards student loans (debt) first and not prioritize retirement or other savings?,"Hi there,

Throwaway for privacy reasons. I read this thread a lot and have read the sidebar on what to do about money, retirement, debt, etc many times. However, I really just need a perspective based on my specific circumstances and was hoping to get clarity. 

Based on what I've read, it's better to prioritize paying off debt, and then focus on retirement. But, indulge me more a minute while I lay out my circumstances:

I just found out that I'll be promoted next month, and together with my spouse's salary we're looking at an annual income of ~$178k, monthly income of ~9600 after tax. I haven't received the finalized salary, but I can estimate what my salary is based on the fact that my org has salary bands for each position. I live in MA (Boston area), which I think is important to include considering the high cost of living. 

Here's our current situation:  
$1850 rent  
$200 utilities  
$1000 a month to emergency savings (currently @ $18k)  
$800 month to a savings account earmarked for a future downpayment  
$100 for our individual savings accounts  
$50 towards a joint savings account for non-emergency expenses   
$2000 month joint budget for our expenses (includes car insurance, groceries, internet, etc)  
$1450 for our own personal expenses  
I'm currently contributing 9% to a 401k through my work that has no match  
Spouse is contributing 8% to a 401k through work that matches up to 6% plus an additional 4% bonus (not a match)  
$862.28 for student loans- I currently owe: $64k across 6 loans, with interest rates ranging from 5.35%-7.65%. I've been doing a snowball method, and have managed to pay off two loans in the past year. 

So, I guess the question is, I'm expecting ~$1200 month extra with this promotion. I was thinking that I would put $200/month more towards my loans, and start an IRA with $430/month contributions. The rest of the money I would put towards our various savings accounts (if it matters, $200 towards the downpayment fund, $150 towards the joint savings fund), and put $150 towards spending. 

I'm feeling concerned about not having enough saved for retirement yet, and would really like to add more towards that. However, my student loans are obviously an issue, and based on everything I've read it seems I should prioritize paying that down first. However, if I put all the money that I would put towards the IRA towards the student loans, I'm not able to save for retirement which could hurt us in the long run. 

I guess my question is- is my plan reasonable? Is it okay for us to try and pay off the loans while simultaneously trying to build an emergency savings and downpayment fund? Or, should it really be focused entirely on student loans until they are paid off?

Also, we're both 29, if that makes a difference.",finance

# **WEEK AHEAD: Dow closes higher on tax reform hopes, notches first weekly gain in three weeks** - *[(CNBC.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/25/us-stocks-central-bank-jackson-tax-reform.html)*

*****

&gt; * Markets rebounded this week: The S&amp;P 500 closed the week up 0.72 percent while the Dow Jones industrial average about 139 points.
&gt; * President Donald Trump will start publicly campaigning for highly-anticipated tax reform next week, according to his chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn.

*****

&gt; U.S. stocks closed mostly higher Friday on new hopes for tax reform, with the Dow Jones industrial average notching its first weekly gain in the last three weeks.
*****
&gt; Markets also got a boost from speeches by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. Yellen said the financial system is safer now than it was in the years surrounding the housing crisis, while Draghi said the global recovery is ""firming up.""
*****
&gt; The Dow closed 30.27 points higher to end at 21,813.67, with Home Depot and IBM contributing the most to the gains. The S&amp;P 500 ended 0.17 percent higher to close at 2,443.05, after energy and telecommunications stocks gained. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.09 percent to end at 6,265.64.
*****
&gt; The Dow pared earlier highs, when it traded over 100 points higher in the wake of Yellen's address.
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump will start publicly campaigning for highly-anticipated tax reform next week, according to his chief economic advisor Gary Cohn. In an interview with the Financial Times, Cohn said that the president will begin calling for long-awaited reform next Wednesday when he visits Missouri.
*****
&gt; Wall Street has eagerly anticipated major tax reform ever since the 2016 presidential election. Tax code overhaul was a cornerstone of Trump's policy agenda, and a major goal of congressional Republicans, but prospects for a sweeping plan have since faded. Continued turmoil between business leaders and the Trump administration peaked last week, when a number of corporate CEOs left the president's advisory councils.
*****
&gt; Markets rebounded this week. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.72 percent while the Dow added 139.16 points for the week.
*****
&gt; Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott said he anticipates reform, but still remains uncertain over what form the tax plan may ultimately take.
*****
&gt; ""It remains likely, but the real question is what form it will eventually take,"" said Luschini, suggesting that the overhaul may have to be watered down before any legislation passes. ""Congress has to double down in advance of upcoming elections.""
*****
&gt; In Jackson Hole, the heads of global central banks convened for the annual Economic Policy Symposium to discuss global monetary policy.
*****
&gt; Janet Yellen, looking back a decade after the initial onset of the financial crisis, said Friday the financial system is safer now than it was then though some adjustments may be needed to regulations.
*****
&gt; Though the speech is closely watched in financial markets, Yellen offered no clues about the future of monetary policy, instead focusing on the history of the crisis and what regulators have done in response. Yellen did not comment on the path for future rate increases.
*****
&gt; ""The events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented, and these reforms have made the system safer,"" she said.
*****
&gt; Michael Arone, chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, was not surprised by the lack of excitement out of Jackson Hole.
*****
&gt; ""The most exciting thing out of Jackson Hole is the fishing,"" Arone joked. ""Overall, I think monetary policy is going to remain easy ... You saw the dollar decline, signaling not a whole lot of expectation of a rate hike.""
*****
&gt; On the other hand, Yellen did mention the likelihood of ""the all-too-familiar risks of excessive optimism, leverage, and maturity transformation reemerging in new ways that require policy responses.""
*****
&gt; Chief market strategist at Prudential Financial Quincy Krosby felt that the fact that Yellen mentioned those risks may leave a 2017 rate hike ""on the table.""
*****
&gt; ""Having her mention the risks means to me she's keeping a December rate hike on the table,"" said Krosby. ""They believe keeping rates too low for too long can create financial fault lines. It allows for risk-taking to continue.""
*****
&gt; ""If we do get a tax cut before December, that should help her"" in preparing to hike rates, said Krosby.
*****
&gt; The euro climbed to $1.1930, session highs, after Draghi's remarks about the strengtehing global economy, it's highest level since January 2015.
*****
&gt; Ahead of the speech, some speculated Draghi might use Jackson Hole to hint at when the ECB might begin tightening monetary policy by cutting back on its asset purchase program. He did not comment directly on monetary policy.
*****
&gt; ""I think both [Draghi] and Yellen had very defensive speeches, they wanted to defend their regulatory accomplishments"" said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. Noting the strengthening of the euro over the dollar, Klein added that ""the weak dollar should be better for stocks.""
*****
&gt; Weak inflation data may keep central banks from raising rates this year. Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reported that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.1 percent in June after a similar gain in May. The core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure.
*****
&gt; Sovereign bonds were up after Yellen's prepared remarks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.171 percent. Bond yields move inversely to prices. The fall in yields follow months of declines, with the yield on the U.S. 10-year note down about 30 basis points since January.
*****
&gt; On the data front, orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, tumbled 6.8 percent last month as bookings for transportation equipment plunged 19 percent. The drop orders was the biggest since August 2014 and followed a 6.4 percent increase in June.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: End of August Market Weakness**

&gt; Over the last 21 years, the last four trading days of August (next week) have been somewhat bearish. The lone exception to this trend appears to be the small-cap Russell 2000 index which has managed a small average gain of 0.04% while advancing 12 times (57.1% of the time). The worst losses came in 1998 (Russia turmoil, currency crisis and hedge fund debacle) during the briefest bear market on record. Solids gains were logged in 2015 and 2011 (brisk sell-offs occurred earlier in the month in each year). DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have been down five times in last eight years.

*****

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: September Worst Month of the Year**

&gt; Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA (–0.8%), S&amp;P 500 (–0.5%), NASDAQ (–0.5%) (since 1971), Russell 1000 (–0.6%), and Russell 2000 (–0.5%) (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble madness. In post-election years, September’s overall rank improves modestly in post-election years going back to 1953 (second, third or fourth worst month depending on index). Average losses are little changed. Although September 2001 does influence the average declines, the fact remains DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined in 9 of the last 16 post-election year Septembers.

###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://68.media.tumblr.com/f2b7f37cfed01b04924594446a7b78fa/tumblr_inline_ov7js05h6R1spdppr_400.jpg))**

&gt; Although the month has opened strong 13 of the last 22 years, once tans begin to fade and the new school year begins, fund managers tend to clean house as the end of the third quarter approaches, causing some nasty selloffs near month-end over the years. Recent substantial declines occurred following the terrorist attacks in 2001 (Dow: -11.1%) and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 (Dow: -6.0%). Solid September gains in 2010; DJIA’s 7.7%, S&amp;P 500’s 8.8% were the best since 1939, but the month suffered nearly the same magnitude declines in 2011, confirming that September can be a volatile month.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Is Dr. Copper sending mixed signals?**

&gt; Copper has a myriad of industrial uses making it a vital element of the modern day economy. Because of this fact it is often been thought of as a leading indicator for economic activity and for stock markets. Copper’s recent surge back to around 3$ per pound has caught the attention of many, but is this surge being correctly interpreted?

&gt; As a leading indicator, copper’s recent surge would seem to suggest strength or at the very least anticipated economic strength which could in turn result in higher stock prices. This may or may not be the full picture. Some of copper’s recent move could also be due to forecast supply shortages this year and next. Some of this surge could be in anticipation of massive U.S. infrastructure spending. And in the next chart, U.S. dollar weakness is also likely giving copper a boost. Year-to-date, the U.S. dollar index is down 8.7% compared to a 19.3% gain by copper.

###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://68.media.tumblr.com/5f81a6f209624493e9eb54d7eaac0e34/tumblr_inline_ov3u5rJYAd1spdppr_500.jpg))**

&gt; Lastly and potentially least optimistic is the possibility that copper could be forming the proverbial top that has frequently preceded other stock bull market tops. Although, we should not be overly concerned with this possibility until copper’s current rally actually begins to fizzle or actually breaks down.

# **What Could A Government Shutdown Mean For Equities?**

&gt; Although we consider it unlikely, the U.S. government could shut down later this month for the first time since 2013 if a must-pass spending bill does not clear Congress. Shutdowns have been rare the past two decades, but they happened quite often in the ‘70s and ‘80s. Per Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist, “There has been slight underperformance on average during times of a shutdown, but recent history suggests markets look past Washington’s squabbling, regardless of the length of a shutdown. The previous two shutdowns in 1995/1996 and 2013 did little to slow down those bull markets, despite each lasting more than two weeks.”

###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/4-18-17-fig1.png))**

&gt; Two final things to consider:

&gt; * The last two times a government shutdown happened when Republicans controlled both the House and Senate (as they do now), the market rose.
&gt; * The previous 18 shutdowns started in September, October, November, or December. This could be the first shutdown in any other month, making an April shutdown all the more interesting.

My situation, I graduated last year 23 years old and have Student loans.   I have 16 K in savings and would like to A pay off a good chunk of my loans or B save it for an emergency.  What should I do?  Currently I make about ~~73K with a bump to 77k in December after all expenses I have about 600 dollars left every month.

Also something to throw in the mix is I have a $7000 expensive that  I am going to be using to help my mom.

personalfinance,(CAN) Should I take a mortgage from my boss' professional corporation?,"So I'm a 29 year old criminal defence lawyer going into my second year of practice. I have about $40,000 in student debt. I work in a small shop, three lawyers who have independent practices, one of whom is my boss and has three associate lawyers working for him (me included). I make $57,000 salary before taxes per year, but have a bonus structure wherein after the first $100,000 I bill out in a year, I keep 25%. At this rate for 2017, I'll probably get like a $30,000 bonus? 

I live in Alberta, but am from BC, and it's no secret that I'm not the biggest fan of living in Alberta. I am definitely my boss' best employee (not meaning to brag, we're criminal lawyers and extremely blunt about where people stand etc) since I bring in the most money, and do all of my boss' legal research and writing. I'm also single and not interested in having kids, so there's no dreaded maternity leave concerns on the horizon. 

The other day my boss approached me and said that his professional corporation could give me a mortgage loan with no down payment and a much lower interest rate than a bank. I don't know what that interest rate would be, I was honestly too flabbergasted to ask any follow up questions at the time. He has been my mentor for many years, we're very close and I know that he likes me and wants the best for me, but he's also an extremely shrewd business man, so I'm quite certain that the offer is clearly in his best interest too. I'm thinking partly he wants to secure me in Alberta and with his company, and partly there's probably some financial benefit to him. 

A bit of background - it's common to be an associate in an arrangement like mine for a couple years, get some experience under your belt, and then become independent. Three of my boss' associates have done this in the last year after working for him for a couple years. My thoughts are that he maybe is hoping that this would prevent me from doing that? 

I am not a business minded person (I'm kind of a book-smart, life-dumb, academic type), so going independent has never much appealed to me. Our industry is WILDLY competitive, and doing marketing, reconciling trust accounts, keeping the lights on, managing a staff, all that bullshit really doesn't appeal to me. That said, obviously I can't predict the future and maybe I'll want to start my own shop down the road (LONG way down). 

So, basically I'm wondering if anyone has any insight as to the benefits/downsides of this kind of arrangement? I have never really considered buying a condo, but I guess I'm currently wasting money by paying rent every month for my shit hole apartment, which I could be paying towards a mortgage instead? I would be looking for a condo in the $200,000 - $250,000 range if I decided to do this. 

I appreciate any insight - I'm pretty obtuse about this stuff.",finance

However, next year I am entering a master's program that will cost somewhere between $15k and $30k for tuition depending on which school I attend.

I know this doesn't account for the Fed and interest rates but if shit hits the fan, folks tend to flee to safety, which is usually bonds.  This drives yields down, and bond value up.  But treasuries yields are currently under 3% which is where inflation has been at for the past 30-years.

personalfinance,advice on strategy of leveraging debt,"Hello!

I'm trying to create a long-term plan to eventually have enough income producing assets, to be, at best, an extra source of income, at worst, a safety security net. There might be some stuff that looks better on paper than in real life or certain things I'm just not at all considering, so hope you guys can poke holes and share your own experiences. 

Currently, I am fortunate enough to be in a financial situation where I can outright buy property, and property prices are re-adjusting downwards due to some federal initiatives to cool demand. I was thinking of purchasing (with no mortgage) a bachelor condo in the region center/core and renting it out. I would then buy another place with mortgage this time for myself to live in. I'm pretty much leveraging myself with debt to buy more at a lower price while the market is cool(er).

I calculate that my monthly expense will be 45% of my net monthly income (includes mortgage, 0% interest debt payment, car insurance, tax, EI, etc.). The expense to income ratio was around 33ish% with just the mortgage. 

Is this a case of easier said that done? What might the financial ramifications be if there is a fluctuation in price or any other market shocks that come to mind?

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Young teacher feeling suffocated by credit card debt,"Throughout college (which my parents offered no financial support for) I used two credit cards when I found myself in emergencies or to help pay tuition bills when I was struggling.

personalfinance,When should I refi my auto loan?,"My goal is paying less interest overall and getting a lower monthly payment.

I'm looking into refinancing my auto loan as I currently have $33,543.32 left with a 4.9% interest rate. It was a 75 month loan and the contract will end 8 Jan 2023. The monthly payments are $636.81. I don't have to make another payment until 8 Oct 2017 and it will only be $165.97.

My question is should I refinance when I get my loan down to $30k just before my next payment is due or, if I can manage, refinance at $28k just before the new year so my car is still under the ""new"" category and qualify for lower rates.

Im looking into loans with Navy Federal, USAA, and NIHFCU. I'm on the bubble of having excellent or good credit score(730-740). USAA interest rates would be 2.99%-4.49% depending on how they view me. Navy Federal my car is over their new car mileage which would put my rate around 2.79%-3.49% depending on the term length. NIHFCU has the potential to grant me a 1.74%-1.99% again depending on the term length.

personalfinance,"Bout of depression and poor life choices; stuck with $8k debt, decent job, but still falling behind &amp; juggling payments.","Hello, Reddit. I'm a 28-year-old male, who due to some seriously bad life decisions and a long bout of depression (that I am slowly but surely ascending from) I have nearly 15% of my takehome pay taken in wage garnishments from defaulted student loans, plus a $300 car payment on a leased vehicle I NEED for work. My job is by no means an unlivable one; I'm making far more than minimum wage, but I've put myself in such a situation financially where I'm struggling to make ends meet.

&amp;nbsp;

My current expenses total roughly $1400/mo, without budgeting money for food. I have attempted to apply for a personal loan through my credit union, as using one to consolidate the defaulted student loans &amp; car loan into a single payment would bring that amount down to a much more manageable amount, due to the removal of the garnishment + reduced interest rate (car loan is ~27%) and hopefully monthly payment. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not really holding my breath on receiving that personal loan, though, due to less than stellar credit. Any advice, any at all, on how I can manage to get myself afloat without bankruptcy/equally desperate measures?

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: I feel I should mention I am on an unfortunate time restraint. My lease holder has already stated that they intend to repossess my vehicle for breach of contract if I am late again, and my landlord has also threatened to evict me due to breaking my lease if I am late on rent. :/",finance
personalfinance,"28 y/o, married, no kids, massive student debt (250k), 100k salary, what are my next steps?","Hey everyone, 

Created an anonymous account for this one.  See the details below.  I'd appreciate any help.

Total student loans: $250k (undergrad + non physician healthcare degree) 

Interest rate: 6.38%

Salary: 100k, plus 0-35k/year production bonus starting in 1-2 years.  Work in a private practice clinic (not eligible for PSLF). 

Home situation: Married, no kids yet, own the house.

Credit: 800+ credit score




Currently, I'm on REPAYE which will last for 25 years.  My current monthly payment is about $800.  Over those 25 years, I'll end up paying close to $600k (including the tax bomb in year 25).  Standard 10 year repayment at $2800 per month will result in paying about $340k total. 

Options

A) Refinance to ~4.8% interest rate with private lender, lose government repayment plans, and pay aggressively over 7-10 years.

B) Continue on REPAYE, pay a lot more each month, hope something happens in the government that could positively affect my situation (unlikely).

C) Try to renegotiate contract at work so I remove my potential production bonus, but have a fixed annual amount go toward my student loans (~15k/year?)

D) Quit the practice and find a non-profit job so I can go for PSLF.  This is really tempting, but I wouldn't feel right about this move.  My employer invested a lot in me as a new graduate and has big plans for the future.  It's always an option, though, if it makes the most sense.

I just got out of the military and am contracting in Afghanistan. I left with a few thousand in my bank account. My only payments are vehicle (owe about 20k and making $500 monthly), cell phone ($10 monthly for suspended service), vehicle insurance (minimum monthly coverage USAA for the state of GA…can’t remember off the top of my head), and $75 monthly for a storage unit. I don’t own property or rent. My girlfriend moved back home to Australia and I may be joining her soon after I return from this overseas job, so I’m looking to be able to invest in something that won’t fuck me over if I move across international borders.
Job specifics: Hourly pay is $44/hr for first 40 hours of 71 hour workweek. $29.33 for the remaining 31 hours. I get a daily per diem rate of $3. As of right now, I’m having taxes taken out of every paycheck for Federal and State (GA), but once I’ve been in country for 330 days, it will become tax free (up to a certain amount, obviously), which means I’ll get a sweet tax return come spring of ’18. In other income, I’m getting about $900 monthly for VA disability. Final paycheck before taxes, I’ve calculated to be $153,259.19.
I’m looking for investment advice that’s safe and low maintenance as I can’t dedicate much time to handling a portfolio over here, but I don’t want my money just wasting space in my checking and savings accounts. I also need to be able to manage this without getting penalized majorly for moving internationally.

2. Sell my stocks and keep the money as emergency funding while living off of loans
3. Keep the investment in stocks and hope the market beats the loans' interest rates

personalfinance,Question about credit: Opening/Closing cards and balance transfers,"First time ever in r/personalfinance so I'm sorry if I write anything incorrectly or neglect to include information...

So I have a four-figure balance on a CC with BoA with a roughly 12% interest rate and no yearly fee. My only expense going to this card is a monthly auto insurance payment that requires a CC and not a debit card, and I pay that off right when it's charged. I could pay the balance off right now, but that would wipe out most of my checking and savings. I have been making payments slightly above the monthly minimum and to cover the interest for each month, but I've hit a pretty rough patch financially and am trying to eliminate as much unnecessary spending as possible, and my two-figure/month interest payment seemed like a great place to save some money. 

I am looking around for a new CC with an introductory 0% APR for x-months and ideally with no balance transfer fee or yearly fee, like the [Chase Slate card](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/chase-slate?SP4R=FH24R8&amp;iCELL=61FX&amp;jp_aid_a=SLAT&amp;jp_aid_p=mptarg1/ccpers2). However this card would have a higher interest rate than I am currently paying, once the 15-month 0% period is over, and I don't expect to have the balance paid off by then.

My first question is, could I do this every x-months, transferring my balance to a new card each time the interest rate kicks in without too greatly negatively affecting my pretty respectable credit score?

My second question, does anyone already know of any cards that this plan would work well with (if not this one), or is there already a list cultivated somewhere in this subreddit that I missed?",finance

btc,"Been wondering this for a while: Can a version of bitcoin: BTC1, Seg2x etc be co-opted by a government like the United States to create a currency that can be government controlled.","Below is an excerpt from an article on Medium by Beautyon theorizing about BTC1 turning into some sort of Fed Coin.  If governments were using it to transfer vast amounts of money on a small 1mb type system would miners have a sufficient profit incentive? I have read, but apologize for not being able to find the article, that the sound money concept offered by a bitcoin structure would entice government involvement. 
Could this possibility also be one reason why, not the only reason, that people like Roger Ver are holding onto the bitcoin aspect and not fully committing to Bitcoin Cash?  
Here's the article excerpt:
BTC1 is the is the obvious candidate.

Why BTC1? Once again, developing a bespoke system from scratch is bound to fail. The Canadian Mint Chip is an example and that failed before Bitcoin was as big as it is. The only possible candidate here is BTC1. It has vocal industry support from incumbents and it is not Chinese. Think about who is behind BTC1. Jeff Garzik already owns a Blockchain Surveillance Company that services Interpol and others, so he is “on side”. He has the minimum skills required to fork Bitcoin. Do not be overly shocked by a surprise return to Bitcoin of Mike Hearn, who will join Gavin Andressen and Jeff Garzick on JeckyllCoin as developers. Hearn will eat this dish of vengeance with ice.

Barry Silbert and his “Digital Currency Group” are rallying companies with large numbers of users behind BTC1, and so they will have an off the shelf user base in the millions, running on a version of Bitcoin which is indistinguishable from Bitcoin at this point.

When Congress anoints BTC1 as the official Bitcoin, the price will increase dramatically. Bitcoin will finally be “legitimised”. Banks will offer Bitcoin companies accounts and the ecosystem will burn white hot.

…but there is a catch.

What these people are offering is a classic fraudulent “Bait and Switch”

They will offer both legitimacy and a slightly higher capacity at first, and whopping great profit for Bitcoin holders, only later to inject lethal poison into Bitcoin, utterly destroying and wrecking its fundamental proposition.

There will be an increase in the total supply of Bitcoin beyond 21,000,000, Address Blacklists, KYC/AML, reversible transactions and everything else characters like Mike Hearn, half wit economists like Paul Krugman, un-American Police Men like Preet Baharaha and Federal Reserve central bankers think are necessary. Remember also, that the block size increase of BTC1 is just the first of many, making the private operation of a Bitcoin full node impossible, cutting off access to all but the most thoroughly vetted and incumbents from the legacy financial system.

It will be the death of Bitcoin. Using actual Bitcoin would need to be illegal the moment this law is passed. Starting an alt coin with the correct characteristics would need to be made illegal. Even if they were not made illegal, it would be very difficult to replace or even compete with a government anointed JekyllCoin.

Game Over for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin,Trying to understand a sybil attack,"Hello,

Can someone explain to me the following scenario:

An attacker has one strong machine with considerable hash rate and many spoofed nodes with very low hash rate.

Eventually, the attacker's strong node creates a block with malicious transactions. The spoofed nodes accept that block. Because the attacker can create many spoofed nodes he can do a 51% attack.

From this I infer that the bitcoin protocol should know to ignore nodes with low hash-rate for verification purposes. However, I havn't seen this written anywhere...
Is this how it works?

Should I take out a personal loan?,"I graduated from a public in-state university with over $19,000 in student loan debts, even with scholarships and a full Pell Grant. My scholarships can't carry over into graduate programs, and neither can the Pell. I'm starting my graduate program here in Germany, and on top of living costs and student fees (about $2000 per semester for 4 semesters [still a fraction of the cost of most US programs, but still a good chunk of money out-of-pocket]), I need to have a bank account with €9000 per year (about 21,500 USD total for the two years) or show proof of my parents' financial resources. Family assistance is not an option for me, and although I may use that option to appease the visa office I still need money for the other stuff. Working to cover my expenses is difficult for several reasons: 

1. My German is only at a low intermediate level, which could cut it for some jobs but they'd usually rather hire someone fluent.
2. Student visas restrict the amount that you're allowed to work, and this amount doesn't provide enough to cover all my needs.
3. My current job is freelance, which isn't allowed under the student visa.

So I thought about taking out some personal or student loans. My thought was, I already have a lot of debt, so what's a couple thousand more if it allows me to get my degree? Is this a good idea? How much is reasonable to take out? Should I take them out from my bank?

personalfinance,How to determine if you can really afford that car,"I keep seeing posts where people are struggling with their budget but have some ridiculous car payment. Let's have a little discussion for people who are looking to buy a car. Here's some advice I'll give. Your mileage may vary (oh yes I went there). This advice is in USD but works anywhere. 

Don't get stuck holding the bag on a car that depreciates faster than you pay it off. I've done the math at a bunch of different interest rates, and the bottom line is that 48 months is the magic number for loan terms. At 4 years or below, you're typically safe. Maybe you can push the boundary at super low interest rates, but there are other reasons not to finance for too long, including risk of financing a used vehicle for longer than expected reliable service life. 

Next, write out your full budget and see what you have room for. Here's where young folks get trapped: maybe if you're still in school or fresh out of school and have super low living expenses, it will appear like you have tons of room for a fancy car. As soon as you become fully independent with a real place to live and food needs and all that jazz (which will very likely happen within a few years), that magic car budget will vanish before your eyes. Be realistic. Account for all the standard living expenses, fun budget, savings, and then be honest - what do you really have to spend on transportation each month? For a lot of people, it'll probably be a few hundred bucks. Then, subtract what insurance and gas and other associated fees will cost you, and multiply what you're left with by 48. That's what you can afford to finance (including interest!) 

Does the number come out well under $10,000 (or equivalent low amount for whatever country you're from)? For many people, it probably does. Don't be discouraged, for you can get a great reliable car under ten grand. 

Does the number come out to less than $5000? Very common! Save up and buy a car in cash.

I feel like people tend to look at $20K as cheap for a car, but it's not cheap at all. Include taxes and fees, finance over 5 years at 5% and you're looking at well over $400/mo. Then tack on insurance (easily $200 for a young driver), and then tack on gas. That $20K car costs you $500-700 per month! If you aren't bringing home $5K+ each month, that probably doesn't fit in your budget. The reality is, even a $20K car is not realistically affordable for the majority of income earners. 

What about $30K+ cars? Radio commercials make them sound so affordable, but cars in the $30K-$40K range should be seen as luxury vehicles. We're talking six figure income required. Yet, so many people buy $30K SUVs and get screwed by the monthly payments. Please don't let it happen to you. 

I work in a respectable profession and make a fairly decent wage. People always ask me why I drive a 10 year old car. It's because that's what I can realistically afford! Society in general has inflated expectations on what they can afford. It's time to fix this and save people from ruining their budgets.

I am great with saving money but have almost no knowledge on what to do with it, so I could really use some impartial advice. I apologize for the block of text.


I'm 25, and I've been working for the Federal government for the past 3 years during and after university. I have zero debt, and I've managed to save up $30,000.00 which I have all of it in a TFSA. I've been to a few banks over the years to get advice on how to invest some of it (RSPs, bonds, things like that, I really was/am clueless). Every bank told me different things, and I'm pretty stubborn/frugal when it comes to money so I panicked a bit, and just left it all in a TFSA, to be safe. 


Now to the dilemma; my contract with the government is up at the end of September, and I'm planning a three month trip to Asian with a good friend of mine. After that, instead of coming home, I'd like to go to Australia or New Zealand and try living out on my own for a while. I have planned on touring which ever country I choose for a little bit to get a feel for it, then settling down and just experiencing life in a new city with whatever job I might get, doesn't have pay much (or be in my field of study), I just want enough to get by.

personalfinance,"[Housing] I should rent and wait to buy a house, right?","Background: I'm 28. Have a bachelor's degree in cinema, I know not the most employable degree but if I was going to go to school I wanted to study something I really had an interest in. It was great, I learned a lot, worth it.

After staying in San Francisco for a year after graduating I moved back home to Elk Grove, right next to Sacramento California. Took me a while but I got a decent job with the state. Recently promoted in May so now I make roughly the average for a college graduate for my age - $45,000 a year or closer to $48/49k with the overtime I work a few times a month. Come next May I'll be able to try for a promotion which would make me about $54k before overtime and taxes, and until I get promoted I'll still get a 5% raise once I've been at this position for one year, though of course I want to go for a promotion asap. I've been living at home and paid off all my student loans from school, $23,000. For the past two years I've been pretty frugal. Now debt free I've started spending a little more, but still am saving 1-2k a month. Since i'm living at home my expenses are virtually non existent, like $50 for car insurance and $25 for my phone bill. Aside from groceries and eating out, I rarely buy anything big. My biggest purchase this year will be getting the transmission rebuilt on my car for $2,495 next month, and paying for my first vacation as an adult in Mexico next year to be a groomsman in one of my oldest friends wedding.

Investing wise I'm definitely behind. I went into buying a house with a close friend, I know probably not the best idea. We bought a house that his father's company is using as a care home with a grant they got from the federal government. The grant came with like 200k in renovations to update the house at no cost it's part of qualifying for the grant. So the house was nice, then got a lot of upgrades to be up to code to care for the people who will live there. I paid 30% of the down payment, my friend the rest, and whenever we want to refinance we will sell the house to the business and get the difference. So if we bought the house at 400k and in a year sold it for 500k, I would get 30% of the 100k difference, so 30k. You all may have questions and issues about that, but I only bring it up to show that I am considering my future and investing at least 5K into something next year, probably my work's 401K or IRA, and maybe other areas as well.

NOW MY QUESTION: I live in Elk Grove, CA and work in Sacramento, CA and like the city. Ideally I want to move to Sacramento so I can drastically cut down my commute which will save me time and money on gas as my car is a gas hog, but it's my first car a 1969 mustang and I love it. I would like to get a very fuel efficient car in the future, but can't really spare the down payment or monthly costs right now. The problem or issues I'm considering is the fact that there is virtually nothing in Sacramento or any of the decent surrounding areas where I can rent anything for less than $950 a month. I've been desperately planning when I can move out from home and finally have my own place and the current plan is November after pushing it back twice, one so I could invest in that house, and again when my car decided it should probably get a new transmission. So come mid October I'm going to start walking the neighborhoods of midtown Sacramento and hopefully come across a decent deal on a place in an area where I don't really have to worry about my car or apartment being broken into. Unless I find a great deal, I'll likely be paying $1k a month in rent before utilities and everything. That seems ridiculously high for me as I only take home $2700 after taxes, benefits, social security etc, and any overtime I work that month. $1k is more than 1/3 and almost 1/2 of what I make. So is renting feasible or should I wait until I have enough of a down payment to buy a house or condo?

Housing costs are on the rise, and I'd be lucky to find something in my price range which online calculators say is about $210-$225k depending on my down payment. Side note I write as a hobby/passion and maybe in a year or so I hoe to self publish, or in an unlikely scenario get someone to publish my first novel. I don't expect it to make any serious money, but hopefully it could make me $50-$100 a month which I would consider a resounding success. I only mention this to say that I am working towards making investments, earning more from my day job, and maybe one day making money on the side with my writing. Should I just stick it out a couple more months until I can buy a place? Issue with that is anything I could afford would be nice, but not a place I'm really happy with. So I'm thinking maybe just bite the bullet now on renting a slightly expensive place, and hopefully in 2-3 years be at a place financially where I can afford a place I'm really happy with? Man just seems like so much money to be spending on rent, but I don't know how much longer I can live at home as it makes dating more difficult, and I would just not like to be under my parents roof anymore after almost 4 years. Any advice??

investing,Tax-Free ETFs,"I have come across a few tax-free income funds with pretty good yields. For those that don't know, these funds usually buy municipal bonds and other public sector debt that is tax free, so the fund itself is tax free in a federal basis. There are also tax free funds on a state by state basis, so you can buy these funds and collect income completelt tax free.

Examples: 

- [BFZ](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ABFZ&amp;ei=816kWaGECYS02AbD4KrIBw) is tax free federally and in California.

- [MJI](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AMJI&amp;ei=AmCkWYmjK4nNjAHOl73gAQ) is tax free federally and in New Jersey

There are others too. So my question is, what is the catch? The two examples above are 5-6% yield, tax free. This seems very appealing - and very high, for tax free highly rated debt. Some of the fees are high, but if you're pulling in 5-6% after fees - and tax free at that - this seems like a no brainier to park a sizeable chunk of your portfolio (in this low rate environment).

personalfinance,Grandpa [101] died left my mom [62] his house. She can't afford the house and expects me to pay-(NY),"This is a throw away account BTW...

My grandfather died last year. His home is a large 2 family house that has no liens on it.  Problem is the house needs significant updates (electrical, pluming, windows, kitchen, bathroom, insulation etc).  The foundation and roof is solid.  The other thing is it is located in an economically depressed area (including high crimes, not a nice area,  and one of the worst school districts in NY) and the tax rate is high, which would make renting or selling this house rather difficult. Also I think there is type of old heating system in the basement that will most likely have to be removed for/safety code reasons if it is rented out.  


My mom and uncle are set to inherit the house because they are next of kin.  My uncle is significantly older than my mom and said he wants nothing to do with the property because 1) he is too old and he and his wife have a ton of medical expenses and 2) he does not live in the community and has no desire to stick around here. He also no longer drives so there is really no point of him being bothered with this. 


My mom wants to keep the house with the goal of fixing it up and renting it out so she can live on one side and rent out the other side for additional income. This would be a great idea but she has a some sort of judgement against her for over $20,000, which she claims to not have any knowledge of, she has bad credit, she is on disability and has a very fixed income, and to be honest, she is not business or money savvy.


Now here is where I come in-she expects that I pay the property and school taxes (we no longer get the elderly resident discount which means the taxes are $3,000+), the housing insurance, along with any county sewage and water until she can figure out what to do next.  Then there is also the issue of having to hire a company dump the furniture. (We already looked into charities taking it and they refused because the stuff is in horrible shape and is really too old for them to get rid of).  That is going to cost at least $1,000 with the truck rental, hired hands and the dump fees.  I already looked into doing this piecemeal in a way to keep costs down, since dumping items within a certain weight is free,  but that only works if you have free access to a truck along with people who are willing to move furniture, which we don't have.


When I asked my mom how I would get my money back from the taxes and other items I paid for, she had no answer.  She also didn't seem to know exactly when the liens would fall off her credit report-she claims January 2018, but is very tight lipped on the details.  When I asked why she could not sell the property as is, the answer I got was a cross between she didn't like the offers she received for the property (i think someone offered her $5,000?) and a fear of housing insecurity due to the rising costs of living and the fact that my 18 year old brother still lives at home, which means she cannot move into senior housing.  I can't afford to take on this renovation project because as someone who works in the non-profit world with a child, just don't make enough money. I also left that area to get into a better school district so there is no way I can afford my expenses and paying for renovations when I have no plans to live there. Lastly I do not even want to live with her or close to her....she is not easy to get along with and I just can't be bothered with her antics anymore. 


So with me being unable to realistically afford this project and she being in denial about being able to afford this, does she have any options?  We don't have any family with experience in home repairs and would be willing to pitch in. the house is not rent-able in its current form-you can't even run the microwave and TV at the same time without tripping the fuse. No one in the family wants the home as is either because if its location and the work that needs to be done. I am just fed up with being expected to drop money into something that has no real return on investment.


tl:dr-mom inherited a home that needs major renovations but she is on a fixed income and has bad credit. She expects me to pay for the taxes, insurance and other bills until she figures out her options. I don't want to and can't afford to. Does she have any other options to keep the house?",finance

personalfinance,Tap Into Roth IRA to Kill Student Loans Once and for All?,"25M and I have $2600 left on my private student loans. High interest rate, around 8 percent. I was living with my parents for the last 2.5 years and paying them off at an accelerated rate. In the last month, I have moved out of my parents and now pay rent. 

Another two or so months at home would have allowed me to pay off the remainder on the loan, but my timeline moved up a bit when I found a great apartment with some friends. 

Essentially, I am using what what was once my accelerated loan payoff for rent/utilities/everything else that comes with living on your own. However, as this amount is so small, I'd really like to wipe it out. The minimum on the loan is $400 or so, and I could drag that out over a couple of months. But even that gets tough with my increased cost of living in the city. 

I only have about $1500 in a savings account, but don't want to tap into that. Other assets:

$3500 in a Roth IRA

$2200 in Brokerage Account

$5k or so in an employer sponsored IRA (I wouldn't touch this)

I'm wondering if there's any harm in tapping into the Roth. I believe that'd be more tax-advantageous than the brokerage account. My parents offered to finish this for me over the next two or three months, but I'd really prefer to do it myself. 

I don't regularly contribute to the Roth anymore, save for $100 or so a month. Mostly just past tax returns.

2. I have better credit than my husband. If the cards are currently in his name, can I open a transfer card under my name and still transfer?

3. Are there cards without a balance transfer fee?

4. Any other suggestions or tips? I am happy to share my budget if anyone is willing to look it over.

THANK YOU!

personalfinance,Will my interest go up if I decide to pay my loan back early?,"I just finished my fafsa and it says I may be eligible for 5,920 dollars from the pell grand and 5,500 dollars from the direct stafford loan. It says there is an interest rate of 5 percent or 10.61 for every 1000 borrowed over a 10 year time period.  

If I decide to pay this back in, let's say, 2 years, then will my interest go up or will anything else happen?",finance
personalfinance,Paying Student Loans off quicker without paying extra annually.,"So I have heard a lot of places discuss paying loans bi-weekly instead of monthly in order to monthly in order to pay off the principal more quickly and lower the total amount due.  But I have not heard anyone talk about making just one annual payment.

Example: you have $200 due monthly.  Once a year you make a single $2,400 and you are good for the rest of the year.  This way you aren't paying extra, but you are taking out the principal right away and thus accruing a lot less interest.

I messed around with an excel spreadsheet to try to make sure this makes sense, could someone check my logic on this one?

Edit:  I probably should have include the following information:  These are federal student loans and you are capable of making early payments that are applied to the interest and principal right away and count towards the next payment date.  Also interest accrues daily, but its 
Principal x Interest Rate,
NOT: (Principal + Accrued interest)x Interest Rate",finance
personalfinance,Should I sell the car I just bought? Moving to a city where I don't really need it; but I'm under water.,"I recently bought an economical mazda sedan, 50k miles, 2013, 4 cylinder. Not sure exactly what I can sell it for - KBB says $8.6k, I'd hope $8k and minimum I'd sell it for is $7k. The balance on the loan is $9.3k, so I'm under water. I'm paying $230 a month in payments, and my insurance is about $150 a month; so that's about $450 a month if you add in $70 a month for maintenance. For comparison, a commuter subway pass will cost me $340 a month. 

Here's my situation: I just moved to Boston and got a place that is extremely accessible by subway, and most people say it's not necessary to have a car. I think it'd be nice but not necessary; the main reason I'd want to keep it is for weekend/holiday trips, and I think I could get a rental or go with a friend in those cases. 

I'm going to stay in my current job and housing situation for at least one more year. After that, I plan on selling my stuff and traveling for a year before taking classes and eventually going to medical school. 

Assuming I could sell it for at least $7.5k all in, that'd leave me with about a $1.5k balance on the loan, which I can pay off with six monthly payments (or I could just pay it all off in one lump sum - the interest rate is low so it would make about a $20 difference). 

Should I just suck it up and sell the car?",finance

personalfinance,"Debts, vehicle, tuition, and moving: a saga","Debt 

*Throwaway because personal information.* I have a lot going on so I apologize in advance if this gets muddy. I'm 23 and I make ~45K/yr. I was unemployed for a significant chunk of 2016 and when I *was* employed I made less than $1000/mo but somehow didn't qualify for food stamps or anything. So I was forced to live on my credit card, let a debt default, my credit score took a dive (was near 600 last year but now I've got it back up to 707), and I had to borrow quite a bit of money from a friend who was generous enough to pay my rent and car payment for a few months. I'm in the process of getting my act together. Since I started my new job in January I've paid off the debt that was in collections, saved a little money, and started paying the rest of my debts too. Currently I still owe:

- $1254 to my friend

- $1430 on my credit card (27% APR, I got it in college when I had no idea what I was doing)

- $9329 on my car (6.12% interest and it's a 2013 Mazda 2 with 61K mi)

- $22940 on my student loans (no clue what the interest rates are, it’s a few loans)

Car

My car has been good to me but it’s not what I need or really want. I’d love to be able to trade it in for a Subaru Outback but I really don’t know much about that process. Kelley Blue Book tells me it’s worth $6900 and trade in value $3500-4700, which is disappointing because I owe so much more than that. If I keep it for a few more years and pay it off will it be too old to trade in and just be worthless? If I tried to trade it in now would I even be able to get a decent rate on the Outback? Is my credit too bad to get a good rate on that? Is this going to just put me in a deeper hole with my debt or would it be reasonable? If I trade it in do I also need to have a downpayment or is that the whole point of the trade?

Tuition

I decided pretty last minute to go back to school for my Master's and I get tuition reimbursement through my job. Reimbursement is great, but it's reimbursement so I have to pay it all up front. I really want to avoid taking another student loan on a semester that my job will pay for eventually, that just seems insane, so I'm trying to pay it out of pocket. I asked for an extension on my tuition deadline and they gave me until 30 September. If I had decided any earlier in the year that I wanted to go back to school then this wouldn't be an issue but it was pretty last minute. My tuition this semester is $3665. 

Moving

I am about to move across country from Georgia to New Hampshire for work. It’s the exact same job in the same company but I think I’d be an idiot to not take it. I’ll be getting a raise, they’re paying for my relocation, I’ll be able to live alone, it’s a pretty similar cost of living in NH, the job is more secure, and there’s more opportunity in my industry there than there is where I am now. My job is actually in Massachusetts but I have decided to commute because NH has lower taxes, lower cost of living than MA, looser gun laws, and I’ll be closer to the mountains. When my boss proposed this to me originally it was the end of June and my lease on my apartment was set to expire in the end of July. I agreed to do it before I got any definite information on the move because if I waited I would be stuck in my apartment for a whole year more and I figure worst case scenario is that I stay and just get another apartment in the city I already live in. I let my lease expire I packed up all my things and put them in my friend’s storage shed for the interim. When I committed to this I thought I would be moving in the first week of August but now it’s looking more like sometime in mid October if I’m lucky. So I’m basically homeless which kind of sucks but there are some silver linings. My company can’t really do anything to expedite the transfer so what they are doing for me instead is sending me on extended business trips to MA until the transfer is final. Job is paying my hotel, airfare, meals, rental car, gas, parking, everything. As a result, the majority of my paycheck gets to go into my savings account! After taxes/401K/insurance I take home about $1200-1300/mo. This means my current expenses/budget is:

- $68 phone (I am on a family plan with my aunt and cousins so I can’t really change this)

- $19 renters insurance (I’m trying to cancel this policy bc I shouldn’t be paying insurance on an apartment I don’t live in but I haven’t been able to get in contact with a person at my insurance company yet)

- $223.93 car

- $10 spotify (worth it, it’s only 10 bucks)

- $12 Hulu (guilty pleasures and whatnot)

- $250 credit card (I’m trying really hard to pay this off first because the interest rate on it is just so damn high)

- $50 to my generous friend

- $80 student loan (I deferred them again when I was unemployed last year so they don’t actually expect anything from me but when I got my job this was what I could afford so I just haven’t changed it)

- the rest is going into my savings but I leave myself like $100 to do dumb stuff like go to a movie

I have two checking accounts and one savings account. 

- Checking account has $35

- Savings acct has $837

- Checking acct 2 has $2585

I have $240 coming in from a gun I sold to a friend and $300 from my security deposit on my old apartment which will put my Checking 2 at $3125. I use my savings account for an emergency fund, Checking 1 for my bills, and Checking 2 for major purchases (new tires, vet bills, guns, upcoming tuition). Should I be putting more/less money towards my different debts? Does what I have going seem reasonable? I want to be able to pay my security deposit/fees/utility startup fees on whatever new apartment I get after I’ve paid my tuition. Because of my weird housing situation and how most of my money is going to savings, I should have at least $5325 in Checking 2 but hopefully more. So I should be able to comfortably pay tuition out of pocket and not completely drain my account. I’m getting money for the relocation from my job but they haven’t told me exactly how much it is yet. I’ve heard rumors of it being a very generous amount though and anything I don’t use I get to pocket. I’m still a little nervous that after tuition I won’t have enough to cover the new expenses. Am I just being paranoid here? Since I’ll be living alone for the first time I have to buy some things to furnish my new apartment that I didn’t need to own before because I had roommates. I’ll also be paying more on my utilities because I won’t be splitting them. The raise I’m getting should be enough to cover the rent I won’t be splitting but after that I’m not sure if I’ll be able to maintain the amount I’m putting into my savings/debts. 

I guess I’m mostly just looking for a little advice, reassurance, tips, and wisdom. Is there anything I’m doing that’s like a big red flag or am I doing ok? Should I be rearranging where I put my money? Am I being realistic with my plans here or am I just completely delusional? Should I just abandon the idea of getting an Outback? Is that just frivolous? Is there anything I’m just overlooking completely with the cross country move? With my credit score do you think I’ll even be able to qualify for a new apartment without a cosigner in NH? I’m sorry this was a lot of information to take in. It’s a weird and stressful time in my life.",finance
personalfinance,Credit utilization - how is it determined?,"Is it based on the amount of debt owing divided by the available credit? Or based on how much is owing on each credit item?

Tangerine MC: $12,000 limit and $19 owing (will be paid off next month) 
CIBC VISA:      $1200 limit and $125 owing (will be paid off next month

LOC (RBC):     $32,000 limit and 0 owing (paid off just this month) 
LOC (CIBC):    $21,200 limit and $15,550 owing 

fwiw, I had a personal loan which I paid off this month (about a year earlier than the original term) 

re: LOC's are unsecured and yes, I robbed Peter to pay Paul. I was mad at RBC for increasing for interest rate on my LOC in March of this year so I decided to see if CIBC would be give me a better deal. Their interest rate is just a bit lower than RBC so I borrowed from my CIBC LOC to pay off my RBC one and I'll be aggressively paying off my CIBC LOC.  

If I calculate how much I owe by the available credit I have, I get a 19% utilization.  My CIBC LOC utilization rate is obviously very high at 73% and I'm hoping my credit score won't take too much of a hit.

personalfinance,Purchasing new home before I can sell existing one.,"Real estate market in my area is definitely a seller's market right now with usually multiple offers on the good houses. A neighbor's house just went on the market which is a little bigger and has a better lot and more potential than current home. We decided that we were interested in the upgrade and made an offer.

At my agents advice, I pre-qualified to cover the whole loan on the new home without making it contingent on the sale of my existing residence to strengthen our offer(seller is motivated to sell quick). I was approved to get the new loan without the sale of the old house. The strategy worked and we came out on top offer. Now I am trying to navigate the lending process for the new house that will be the most beneficial to me for the new loan and what happens when I sell.

For the new house, I am financing 494k including 5% down payment. I hope to pull about 175k equity from existing house after realtor fees when it sells. I already have an agent and not interested selling by owner. 

What is the best approach to get the best interest rate for both the preliminary loan and then apply the remaining 175k  equity to recast and lower my monthy payment after my current house sells in hopefully a few weeks?

investing,"Are index funds increasing the market's p/e ratio to a ""new normal""?","Index funds and passive investing make up a significantly larger portion of the stock market's capitalization today than during the dot com and mortgage bubbles. There's no way to really know the effect of this since there are multiple other factors at play, especially low interest rates. While I think that almost certainly the p/e ratio's ""new normal"" is higher, I'm wondering just how sustainable or cyclical it is. I'm wondering of all the talk about the historically high p/e ratio is overblown. Could Vanguard constantly chirping ""buy, hold, and ignore the day-to-day"" into their investors' ears be the saving grace that will hold off an epic sell-off? How plausible are the below sequence of events?

1) Passive investing is reducing volatility, and combined with the desensitization of investors to news, passive investing is allowing the market to march higher despite the fundamentals.

2) As a result, the ""boom and bust"" cycle could be exacerbated, as passive investors are complacent as the market rises, but (especially retail) investors panic and pull out at the same time during market downturns causing a snow ball effect.",finance

personalfinance,Need clarification with how income tax is applied with Roth/traditional 401(k)/IRA,"Okay so this is what I understand so far:


Yearly income: $60,000

Standard deduction: $6,350

Personal exemption: $4,050

Yearly income after removals: $49,600

&amp;nbsp;



Question 1: How does 401(k) and IRA contributions play in. Does a traditional 401k/IRA work like this:

Max 401(k) contribution: $18,000
 
Max IRA contribution: $5,500

Yearly income after contributions: $26,100

&amp;nbsp;

Question 2: So is that $26,100 what your tax bracket is based off of? (I know i'm leaving out state/local taxes)

If so Federal taxes owed = $932.50 + ($26,100-$9,325)*.15 = $3,448.75

Yearly income after federal tax: $22,651.25
* 
Yearly income after deduction+exemption added back: $33,051.25
 

&amp;nbsp;

Question 3: Does a Roth 401(k)/Roth IRA work this way:

(recall Yearly income after removals = $49,600)

Income tax is applied based on the $49,600 and then you can make the max contributions? e.g. (I know i'm leaving out state/local taxes)


&amp;nbsp;


Federal taxes owed = $5,226.25 + ($49,600-$37,950)*.25 = $8,138.75

Yearly income after removals - Federal taxes = $41,461.25

Max contributions: $23,500

Yearly income after contributions: $17,961.25

Yearly income after deduction+exemption added back: $28,361.25

personalfinance,I made a mistake co-signing a private student loan for my nephew. What are my options moving forward?,"My nephew came to me last year a week before his first year of college was to start because his FAFSA application had not been accepted (due to missing information). I stepped in to help him, because his own parents refused and I wanted to be the cool uncle. After all, if I hadn't co-signed that private student loan for him, all of his classes would have been dropped and his dreams dashed, yada-yada, ya. He was luckily able to get generous financial aid after that first semester, but sadly squandered the wonderful opportunity with which he had been provided by neglecting his classwork and bombing on his grades. I just found out this past week - last minute actually - that his 1.83 GPA is preventing him from securing financial aid for his current semester. It was complete news to me! Right now, it's looking more and more like he won't be able to finish his degree, which means I won't be able to defer loan payments much longer.

... So, ... I should've known better than to co-sign this private Discover student loan which was originally $5,800 (now ~$6,300 after a year's worth of interest at 8.25%). Given all that, is there anything I can do to lessen the pain, so to speak? Should I just bite the bullet and start making regular payments? Or, for instance, could I ever hope to refinance this usurious loan and get a lower interest rate? I have an excellent credit score and assets which I could use as collateral.

personalfinance,Should I refinance to a 15 year mortgage or do other things with that money?,"Ok so a little information about me. I am a 30 year old environmental engineer and I make pretty decent money. My wife is 29 and is currently in month 4 of a 24 month bachelor of nursing school program. I bought a condo 2 years ago in the very a very quickly growing market place, and have seen the value increase 32k since I bought it. Our long term goal is to be able to take a decent sabbatical when my wife gets out of nursing school, and to be able to live abroad. Her to do nursing and medical help and myself to help environmentally in places that need the help and resources. Ideally we would like to AirBnB our condo while we are abroad, or rent it out long term if necessary.

With those goals in mind, I’m trying to figure out if refinancing my condo makes sense. The current mortgage is a 30 year fixed at a 4.375%. With the almost certain increase in interest rates in December I thought about refinancing. It looks like I can get a 15 year mortgage at 3.5%. The refinancing would increase my monthly payments about $350-$400 a month from my current mortgage terms. Since buying the place, I have been paying down extra principal to the amount that averages out to be about $150 a month for the past 2 years. So it would only really increase $200-250 from what I currently pay every month.
 
So my question is… If the goal is to keep the condo long term to rent and/or AirBnB the property, does it make more sense to keep the payment as small as possible and do other things with the money (invest, finish some project I’d like to do in it), or does paying it off as quickly as possible with the shorter term mortgage to save myself the interest fees and be able to make more profit from the place quicker trump the short term payment increase?

To add a little flavor of my current financial situation. I currently have no other debt besides the mortgage and my wife’s nursing school. We have been saving about $600 a month for nursing school since she started and if my annual bonus doesn’t have to go to other things, we plan on having her school paid off or very close to being paid off by the time she finishes in 2019. I contribute 2% more than what my company matches into to my 401(k), we max out one Roth IRA account in a year, and we also max out our family HSA account.

Sorry if questions like this have been posted or asked many times before or if this isn’t exactly the right place to post it. Let me know of any other place to look if this isn't the right spot to post. I’m just looking for some help and advice on how to best move forward.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Russia's Love-Hate relationship with Cryptocurrencies !,"According to me there are a hand full of countries that can really influence mass adoption or rejection of Crypto currencies . Russia is clearly one of them , i have noticed several influential events in recent history that are extremely vital for future of Cryptocurrencies . Below is my observation and my humble opinion about future of cryptocurrencies in russia , also the impact what Russia can have on the crypto world altogether !

Russia is the home of the founder of Ethereum, the second most popular cryptocurrency in the world after bitcoin, Vitalik Buterin. The world’s largest bitcoin Miner, Bitfury , was created by another russian ,Valery Vavilov.
Cryptocurrencies have always been popular in Russia, but for years Russia and its government in particular has had a unique love-hate relationship with Blockchains , Bitcoins and Cryptocurrencies in general.

The Government initially tried to dissuade the attraction towards cryptocurrencies by indicating heavy-handed regulation, however they never really implemented them. Bitcoin mining too was considered taboo initially. Within the last few years, the problems surrounding the regulation of cryptocurrencies in Russia has been discussed over and over again. The spectrum of opinions of State authorities range from a complete ban of Cryptocurrencies to impose legal sanctions on all involved or even to create an offshore cryptocurrency Zone to facilitate its trade.

In November 2016, the Federal Tax Authority published its first document addressing the issues surrounding the regulation of cryptocurrencies. In December 2016, It was indicated than new regulations are being created and changes are being made in national legislation to facilitate the process of development and integration of new technologies, including financial technologies and Blockchain technology.

It has been a general observation that, as the country found itself in an economic stagnancy , with harsh economic sanctions , war like situation with Ukraine and western Europe over few years , volatility of Ruble and most importantly oil price crash - The stance of the government towards bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has softened - so much so that on June 2 2017 , Deputy chief of Bank of Russia stated in a public forum that 'It's Time to Develop National Cryptocurrencies'. Weeks later came an announcement that Russia is planning to implement a state sponsored Bitcoin mining company to rival China in Bitcoin Mining. Russia has lately come to be known as a Cryptocurrency Heaven.

But yet again in a typical contradictory attitude , yesterday Russia’s deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev has said it is “hard to argue cryptocurrency is not a pyramid scheme” and indicated a complete Ban on purchase and sale of Cryptocurrencies for Common people. Investement and trading can be handled only by selected qualified personnel. this announcement not only confused several investors but also created chaos in certain communities.

Here is what my analysis says !
Clearly Russian Authorities and government have recognized the oppurtunity and value in Cryptocurrency market. They want to invest heavily in the block chain technology but unlike other countries they want to use there state sponsored mining power on few (if not a single) selective crypto currency. Just like NEO is a state sponsored (or atleast approved if you what i mean) Chinese cryptocurrency , Russia too would come out with its own crypto currency, alternatively they may adopt any particular existing currency and try and focus there energies on it.
If government allows selected qualified advisors to invest in crypto currency market , its much more easier to influence there investments. the Russian authority might very well ban most of the currencies and allow investment only in selected currencies , supported by state sponsored mining for them.

What does it mean for the Investors ?
I personally believe , if any Government favors any particular cryptocurrency - it will definitely boom. any new currency or existing currency which is adopted by Russians officially will see mass acceptance and massive investment gains for the investors in long run. while banning of direct investments in crypto will hurt the market cap of most major players initially , i think Privacy crypto currencies like Monero , Zcash , Dash and PVX should benefit immensely.

Irrespective of what Russia does , be it a complete ban of cryptocurrencies or be it mass adoption on selective currency , it is safe to say that cryptocurrency have become too important in this modern day world.

personalfinance,Refinancing a car loan,"A year ago I was a recent college grad with basically no credit yet since my parents paid for school and I'd never had a credit card. I decided a good way of quickly building some credit was to get a new car with a loan (plus I like cars and was tired of my 03 jetta). I knew I would get a shit interest rate (ended up being ~7.5%) but my job pays well enough to be ok with it. My plan was to refinance when I could to get a better interest rate after building up some credit.  
  
Now a year later I have managed to get my credit score up to 749 so I think it might be worth looking into now. My current payments for the loan are ~350/month and the buyout is ~13k.  
  
My actual question is where are some good financial institutions to look at refinancing options? I'm ok with bumping up my monthly payment significantly if it means lower interest/quicker payoff time (I would be fine if payments were 500/mo)  
  
Is there anything else I should be considering when I do this?",finance

Anyway, I currently owe 10k~ with it being worth 7.5-8k on KBB. I am starting to experience some troubles with it now at around 60k miles and reading some of the Cruze stories it has me wondering if I should get out while I can.

personalfinance,Recently came into some money - not sure the best course of action,"Hi PF!
I'm hoping someone here can steer me in the right direction. My wife recently passed and I have been granted approximately $2,800/month in social security for our 2 daughters (10 and 4) as well as $50k in life insurance. 

I've already set up 529 accounts for the girls but I haven't started putting anything in there as of yet and the life insurance is sitting in a Chase account. I'm not sure what is the interest rate.

I was able to take my girls and my parents to Disney World for a week with what I had saved. Now that we had our fun, I think it's time to start focusing on setting up the girls and myself for the future but I'm not sure where to start.

I'd like to start contributing to the 529 accounts so I can have their college taken care of. I'd also like to eventually buy a house as we are currently living in my parents house. While they have been tremendous help with helping raise my girls, it's not the ideal situation. 

So, long story short (too late!), is there anything I can do to further my income (or reduce taxable income)? I'm very new to this as I've never had this kind of money before and I don't know what my options are. 

If you need to know specific numbers like take home pay and whatnot, please let me know.

personalfinance,Urgently Need Help - College Trying to Collect 5 Years Later,"Hey everyone. I’m in great need of help, this situation is killing me and actually causing me anxiety and depression. 

So I’m 24 years old, I work a per diem job 2/3 days a week, get as much hours as I can. I live at home, only bills are my car insurance and truck payment, as well as gas. Which is about $500/month plus gas. 

Anyway things are ok, I have about a $1,500 credit card balance, and about $800 in my savings. The interest rate is fairly low as it’s from a credit union. My credit score is about 785. 

Finances are going pretty good, up until a few weeks ago. I received a bill of student accounts from a college I went to in the Fall of 2012. They’re saying I owe a balance of $6,800 for tuition. I know for a fact I went down and withdrew from my classes but they claim I only withdrew from 2 classes, received a partial refund for those, but the other 2 classes I received grades (F’s) so I owe the tuition. I told them I withdrew and they said they’d run an attendance check with the professors (From 5 years ago?) and when that came back they said I had attended 6 classes and received an F for the semester. Therefore making me liable for the $6,800 bill. Important to note, when I went down to withdraw I think they mention that I had to follow up with the professors and tell them I had withdrawn, which I didn’t do. I haven’t received anything from this school for 5 years, up until this letter. 

I never took out a loan to cover tuition, never made any kind of payment. I’m not sure if/what I signed back then paperwork wise but I didn’t make any payments or take any loans. I know that at others colleges I’ve attended when you don’t make any payments or sign up for a payment plan, they automatically drop your classes and you’re removed from the roster. This is what also should’ve happened here. I can’t be held liable is their registrars office failed to withdraw me from all classes. Why would someone withdraw from 2/4 classes, and then go a few times to the other 2 classes and just fail? They won’t have any attendance sign in records or test grades of mine since I was not their. They claim professors have records that I was there. 

They are getting ready to send my account to collections and I don’t know what to do. 5 years later I randomly receive a bill for $6,800 from a school I never went to? I can’t even afford to do a payment plan with them even if it was rightfully owed to them. Please help",finance

personalfinance,How should I handle an IRA cashout so that taxes/fees are properly taken care of and possibly minimized?,"Hi there. Hoping the collective intelligence of r/personalfinance can guide me through a suboptimal situation.

My husband and I have old traditional IRAs that we opened when we left our places of employment (20 and 15 years ago, respectively) and rolled over our existing 401k and 403b. And the money's been sitting there ever since. He started working for the federal government and we've been putting money into a TSP. I left work to raise the kids. I have a side gig doing programming, but it's not producing much. Mostly it just keeps me in the loop so that when the kids are old enough, I'm not completely unemployable. I will probably start working again within 5-7 years. The IRAs have a combined balance of 85K. The TSP has 405K. We're in out late 40's, so retirement is at least 15-20 years away. 

Here's the issue. We have 80K of debt. One income + kids + things that happen to houses and need fixing + crappy habits = WAY too much debt. The crappy habits we've been working on a lot over the last few years and it has helped. The other stuff is trickier (we've decided to keep the kids, they've grown on us). Right now we're spending $1300/month servicing our debt and that's mainly because I've been really aggressive at pursuing low-interest alternatives for the money we owe. Only (only!) 10K of the debt is at a rate higher than 5% interest.

We've decided to cash out the traditional IRA (we consider the TSP off-limits). I know from reading other posts on this topic that folks are going to tell me this is a terrible plan. I know we will only get about 45K of that 85K, essentially throwing the rest in the crapper. But I did run the numbers and make spreadsheets and used online calculators to figure out what losing 10% of the money now to fees, plus the tax-free earnings (taxes on disbursements are going to happen either way, and we probably won't have a much different tax bracket at retirement vs now) means compared to the interest we'll save. It's still a loss, but not a net 40K loss. And it means that we'll have a shot at actually paying down the debt if we continue to throw $1300/month at it event though the debt is lower. Also, psychologically it means a LOT to us to feel like there's a light at the end of the tunnel.

So IF we were to do this, I have many questions. What is the most sensible way to deal with tax withholding? Should we pay a certain percentage up front and put the rest in a short-term CD or something like that until tax day? Or just have it all withheld when we withdraw it? Should we take part of the money out now and part next year so we're not ratcheting up to a much higher tax bracket for 2017? This will essentially double our income for the year. And there's probably other questions I don't know enough to ask. Thanks in advance for any guidance.

personalfinance,Thoughts on new federal student loan repayment plans?,"I graduated from college a few months ago, and because of unrelated personal problems, I'm just getting around to reviewing the financial damage of the past 4 years.

I have ~30k in federal loans from a liberal arts degree from a solid public school in NY. While I'm not completely in the shitter, I've made some poor choices about my future and I'm finally ready to be smart about them. 

There are several options for repaying your student loans. The standard monthly payment plan provides the total amount paid that is closest to my current balance in the shortest amount of time. I'm wondering if I should just pony up, get a job as quickly as possible, and begin repaying as I make other plans on the side? 

But then, there are newer options like ""income contingency"" plans. These are very tempting to me, because while I'm interested in making money right now, I'm also much more partial to getting a service job this next year, and making small payments on my loans while I continue to ""figure it out."" 

My question is, is it totally and completely foolish (like the behavior of 17-year-old me) to opt for a repayment plan like that? Will I get totally robbed by interest payments in the end? Are these adjustable over time?

Also, does anyone know if you can tell your Student Loan Exit Survey that you plan on attending grad school in the coming year?

Personal finance is as essential as geometry, man. Why was this not included in the public school curriculum?

financialindependence,Quantifying the Cost of Commuting,"I am recently looking for a house and am in a dilemma that many face: closer-to-work houses are more expensive.

Similar to the NY Times Rent vs Buy calculator, I figured it may be wise to consider the cost of commuting to compare any two houses (just like rent vs buy) with some set of parameters.

It quickly got more complicated than I anticipated. Although MMM has done some quick analysis on this topic, his numbers are clearly ridiculous ($15,900 per mile) and have a number of pesky assumptions that are incorrect. 

Obviously there is some point where buying a house further away is worth it, if it is cheap enough. I'd like to quantify this for anyone's individual situation.

So I am looking to come up with a model and am curious if anyone has already done it or wants to help. Below are what I see as the important parameters

1) Needs to assume all the cost savings (lower downpayment, closing costs, lower monthly payment) of buying a house further away are invested in the stock market at some interest rate. 

2) Needs to allow variability for the user to input their own rate that their value their extra time spend not driving at, as well as their cost per mileage. Also input mortgage specifics such as the downpayment, interest rate, PMI, property taxes, etc. 

3) Ignores personal preferences towards city/country living and ignores the additional risk of more ownership in an illiquid, undiversified asset. 

Then the calculator would output what price you would want to buy a house at x miles away at y commute time in order to be equivalent to the closer, input house. The user can compare to their individual market to see which is the better choice. 


Looking forward to discussion.

personalfinance,Currently 40k in credit card debt with my home loan interest rate going up in 1 years. Unsure of what to do.,"Hello, /r/personalfinance im hoping you will be able to help me out. I am 48, father of 3, currently 40,000 in credit card debt due to expenditures for our children and an unforeseen job loss a few years ago and our home loan will be going up soon too. We updated our loan after the 2008 crash however it has led to a consequence we didn't predict that came with the job loss. My wife and I applied for a home equity line however our debt to income ratio is too much to get approved for it and because of the updated loan we took out after the crash, the fine print states we can not refinance the home till its fully paid off which will be at least another 20-30 years. 
  
I have been in a new job since however in 1 year I will no longer be able to afford the payments for both our mortgage and our multiple credit card bills. If we can pay off the credit card bills or at least consolidate them into a lower interest rate loan, my wife and I will be able to make more then enough to even restart saving up for our retirement but currently this seems like a fickle dream.  
  
I am honestly at a loss however because if I sell this home, it will be almost impossible for me to stay here where my kids are going to school (They are not in college so they will still be under my roof for at least another 4-5 years). Moving away from the area may be very hard on them which we already did once when we moved cross country to here to California in 2005 for my original job that I now no longer have.
  
I currently have 67k saved up in my retirement account however since it is a traditional ira and I am not yet at age 59 I will be subject to an early tax withdrawal penalty but would this be a viable option for me to pay off our credit card debt or will this be more harmful for my family in the long aspect of things?

We own our home and have a balance of $149,000 but recently appraised the value at $220,000. So we have nearly $70k of equity. Regardless of the debt, we intend to sell this home and buy elsewhere, or a dream would be to build a custom home, but are not necessarily in a hurry to either anytime soon, still, we wouldn't be mad at the thought. We currently both work in property management and could be in a unique situation to temporarily move into a luxury apartment at a very comfortable rate as well, a part of my short term plans between homes. Combine we make over six figures a year and are both looking at raises which is helpful for future planning as well, but no guarantees. I started the process of a cash our refi which will pay of one of my autos (although that wasn't my first choice) and a few of my larger debts - this would knock down my debt by nearly 2/3rds but would raise my mortgage payment by $300 as well as losing almost whole percent on my interest rate, increasing from 3.15% to 4%. This would also eat up a large chunk of my equity, putting the new price tag on my home with me owing $190K to the new lender. I am torn between doing this method, paying the remaining debt off over the course of a year and then approaching a sell of my home and beyond OR simply selling my home now and taking the full amount of extra funds (minus fees and current mortgage of course) and paying off as much of my debt as possible while also saving some for moving/new home expenses. I would likely still move into an apartment temporarily as I am offered month to month at no premium and wouldn't know where I am going right away any how. I am also concerned that if I rebuy my home at the higher rate the market could change rapidly and then suddenly be upside down in my existing home and stuck here for a long time, already knowing I want to move. My questions to those who can offer advice is, is a cash out refinance a good way to go, or should I consider a sale of the property and if so, now or after paying down some debts on my own. There are a lot of factors, I am extremely torn, and have few outlets to help with these types of financial matters. Any and all advice is beyond welcomed and appreciated.",finance

I also owe $5500 in Perkins loans, originally $6,200 but I paid off $700 over the summer, which does not show up. I know the Perkins Loans are serviced through my university, not the federal government, so is that why? Or are they supposed to show up? 

Also if anyone has any tips on building credit past that 700 point mark any advice is appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,"Not sure if this the right subreddit to ask this on, but I have a question about FAFSA","Im barely starting out my senior year in high school. Just got out of meeting talking about important dates regarding graduation, FAFSA, and scholarships. During it the counselor said that if I qualify for FAFSA, I don't have to pay it back. However, my parents say to instead only apply for scholarships because FAFSA will most likely have some interest rate.

  So my question to people who have gotten FAFSA is, is what my parents say true or not? And what should I do for money for college. My family doesn't really have much money so we're hoping I get a scholarship. The school year is only 3 weeks in so I appreciate all future help.

Ripple,http://investinghaven.com/growth-stocks/ripple-price-rise-2017/,"[Why The Price Of Ripple Will Rise Above 0.50 USD In 2017](http://investinghaven.com/growth-stocks/ripple-price-rise-2017/)

Things look very bullish for Ripple. Given the setup of Ripple’s chart combined with the fundamental drivers behind Ripple we expect that Ripple’s price will rise to $0.50 in 2017, around year-end the latest.

First, and foremost, Ripple’s chart looks awesome. After an amazing rise early this year, Ripple’s price touched $0.40, and came back sharply since then. From mid-June till mid-August 2017 Ripple’s price did basically go nowhere. A relatively long (in cryptocurrencies terms) consolidation took place between $0.16 and $0.20.

When Ripple’s price almost doubled overnight, last week, it was the first sign of a new potential upleg. What caught our attention on Ripple’s chart is that it rose sharply, but, more importantly, came down only to test what is called its breakout point, which is the point it crossed once it rose over its falling trendline (the black falling line on below chart). The fact that Ripple stayed about that $0.21 level since then is extremely encouraging.

Ripple must continue to trade above $0.21 in order to remain bullish.

From a fundamental perspective, we know that Ripple was involved in a task force organized by the Federal Reserve which was meant to improve the (meantime very old school) payment platform. Cross border payments which take 3 to 5 days is really a sign of outdated systems. Ripple could be playing a role in the renewed payment platform of the Fed, among many other central banks around the world. This article learns that the UAE government is also looking at Ripple to improve its payment platform, while this one says China is also interested to work with Ripple.

We do not base our trading decisions on articles. However, there are sufficient fundamental drivers which make us believe that Ripple is here to stay. Combined with the breakout on its price chart we expect Ripple to trade at $0.50 by the end of 2017.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Financially Beneficial to Turn Flooded Home Into Rental Property?,"I've already seen a great post about how to deal with flooded property but I'm curious about ways to be financially smarter.

My primary residence was flooded with 4 feet of water. It is two story. I am going to assume everything on the first floor is a complete loss but hopeful the second floor is still salvageable (assuming no dams break and I can start drying out the house before too much mold takes hold).

Anyway, we have about $100,000 (before the flood) in equity and a mortgage with about $250,000 remaining. I, like the previous post, have no flood insurance.

If my home were already a rental property then all of my repairs would be tax deductible. Any thoughts on saying it is now a rental (and actually treating it as a rental after repairs). What steps actually have to be accomplished to transform the house into a rental for tax purposes instead of a primary residence?

Note: I converted a previous primary residence into a rental 9 years ago, but that was much easier because there was no damage, the house was livable and it was planned in advance. It happened at the beginning of 2008 BEFORE Ike but I was able to use a special depreciation allowances for placing a rental into service in a Federal Disaster area. Some of the benefits of that rental in 2008 make me wonder about placing this current home into service as a rental...

Edit: I didn't really proof before I posted. I don't like how ""financially smarter"" sounds at the beginning, so I'm sorry. Once I reread that I thought he first answer to being smarter would have been if I had Flood Insurance. Now I just want to respond in the best financial way possible.",finance
personalfinance,"I make decent money, but I really don't know what to do with it.","I've read the Prime Directive post, which was incredibly helpful. I've also read quite a bit of the other posts in the sidebar, and I didn't find anything really detailing how one should be spending based on their income. Obviously, advice for someone who is making $25k a year is going to be different than someone who is making $80k a year.

Anyway, a bit of background:

My monthly salary is 15k. According to my most recent pay stub, the breakdown looks like this: 

* $7,500 Gross 
* - $1,591.74 (Fed tax) 
* - $465.00 (Social Security)
* - $108.75 (Medicare)
* - $639.00 (State tax)
* - $1.21 (Worker's Benefit Fund)
* = $4,694.30 (Net)

So every two weeks I am taking home $4,694.30, for a monthly total of $9,388.

I am the sole bread winner taking care of a family of 3 (my wife, son and myself). I currently have a ~600 credit score (average between the 3 bureaus), $7504 in credit card debt, $30k car loan, and $62k in student loans.

My bill breakdown is as follows:

* $2,200 Rent / month
* $800 Groceries / month
* $200 Internet
* $400 Cell phones
* $80 Electric
* $650 Car Loan
* $400 Student Loans
* $50 Gas (I rarely leave the house)

My debt breakdown is as follows:

* $1,671 Credit Card ($1,675 limit, 24% interest rate)
* $500 Credit Card ($600 limit, 20% interest rate)
* $522 Credit Card ($450 limit, 33% interest rate)
* $2499 Credit Card ($2500 limit, 22% interest rate)
* $500 Credit Card ($500 limit, 20% interest rate)
* $1812 Credit Card ($2000 limit, 18% interest)
* $30,409 Car Loan (9% interest)
* $61,424 Student Loans (~5% interest)
* Two collections, both paid, one from 2012, other from 2014.

I'm incredibly irresponsible with money, and let my wife take over our finances about 2 months ago, so things are now improving. I like to buy books and electronics (computers, etc), and have since curbed that (i.e., I'm no longer allowed to do it). My credit is pretty bad at the moment, but it was absolutely horrible about a year ago, so it has been improving somewhat.

Anyway, I feel like I make decent money, but I still live like I'm basically poor (grew up poor as hell, lived that way most of my life, I know what it's all about). I still can't get approved for a house, I don't know what the hell I should be doing with my money, etc. I know that there are some responsible things I should be doing here, but not even sure where to start. My wife is in the same boat. She's responsible with money in that she does not spend it, but she also does not know finances very well and when we read the Avalanche method of paying of bills we both went, ""Ah, that's a good idea!""

I guess what I'm trying to say, I think with my current household salary, I may have entered a different income bracket about 3 years ago. Having grown up poor myself, around poor people, I have no idea what types of things I should be doing with money. Just looking for advice on where to start in improving things (e.g., credit), and then where to go after things are improved.",finance

General disclaimer - I'm well aware of the potential risks that come with the situation below, I'm not posting here for marriage/relationship advice, simply financial advice/assistance - thank you.

I'm a 24 (M) looking to purchase my first home; I've been renting for the last two years.
I recently went through Rocket Mortgage and got pre-approved for a $225k mortgage. In my area, $225k can get you a decently sized ~1500-2000 square foot somewhat ""updated"" house.

I have about ~$10k in liquid assets (cash in savings and checking accounts) as well as another ~$10k in 401k and Roth IRA accounts, I own my car outright and have about $20k in federal student loans.
I'm lucky enough to have parents who are willing to gift me an amount to assist with my down payment/closing costs associated with the purchase of a property. 

Now here is where I need some clarification/assistance:

Is there a gift limit for down payments/assistance with closing costs?
I currently live with my girlfriend (soon to be fiance) and she will be covering 50% of monthly mortgage/interest/taxes/insurance. She also is lucky enough to have parents who are willing to gift her an amount towards a down payment/closing costs. The mortgage is under only my name, because from my understanding you can only apply for a mortgage together if you are married. If that is the case, can she receive a gift from her parents, and then gift it to me to put towards the down payment/closing costs? OR am I wrong and we can apply for a mortgage together despite not being married?

Thanks for your help and real sorry about the wall of text.

That leaves us with $6,400 after all deductions. Out of those it spreads out following way:

- $2,450 towards mortgage payment + house bills (including property tax, internet, gas, water, electric)

- $650 towards transportation (auto payments + gas)

- $750 for food

I've made 100% of my payments on time, I just only have 3.5 years of credit and no open cards.

I've read young adults often start with the ""starter"" credit cards but it seems like the rewards aren't as good and the available credit is low. I'm not concerned with being reckless with this-I'm fiscally responsible and good at budgeting.

personalfinance,Sitting on home equity and wondering what to do,"Hi everyone, I was hoping to get some opinions on my situation as I’m worried that my inaction is causing me to miss some opportunities to get ahead. Here’s my situation: 

I’m 30 years old and bought a house in Southern California 5-6 years ago for $285K with current value at about $475K. I refinanced a little while back to get an interest rate of 3.25% and my mortgage payments are $1560 which includes taxes, insurance, etc. Outstanding loan balance is $266K. I’m currently employed with a steady career making $115K/year. 

My plan is to live here with my girlfriend (soon to be fiancée) and start a family. In the meantime we’ve started putting aside roughly 10-12K per year with the idea of having a down payment for another house in an area with a better school district eventually… I don’t really have a time frame for this as we’re also considering another slump in the housing market to make this move in any reasonable amount of time. I would then look to rent out our current house for roughly 2000-2400/month. 

Some alternatives I’m thinking are to refi and pull money out at as low an interest rate as possible to invest with, or sell and invest proceeds while renting in anticipation of an eventual housing bubble burst (obviously all speculation), or some other option?

So i come to you today to ask for your help with debt consolidation. I have a few loans out there that I've been working on to get rid of, but I'm not sure if I'm focusing in the right areas.

Income - $4000/m- $5000/m net income

Mortgage- $169000 balance@4.37 @ $1600/m  
(1490/m principal ,taxes,ins,pmi,escrow +110 extra payment) 

loans
home depot balance-$11000 @ 8.99%  
$281min payment currently paying $300

wells fargo loan balance-$3900 @ 10% 
$243 min payment currently paying $300

wells fargo cc  $4000 @ 0% (balance transfer paid off high interest cc) 
$88 min payment currently paying $400/m*

barclaycc balance $580 @ 0% (bt paid of loan) 
$27 min payment currently paying $200/m*

Motorcycle loan- $12000 @ 1.9% min payment $230  making 250$ payments

*Now as a disclaimer the balance transfers I'm paying them at a higher rate to avoid interest rate after the promotions ends
* Simple math wont take long to figure out that my income is &gt; then my loans and what I'm paying on them. I have other bills utilities and living expenses but i excluded them because they are taking care of and they are bills not compounding interest, but I have an extra 200$ a month now available, that i was paying on other debts and can a lot to my loans. 

i have a 750+ credit rating. I mention this maybe a consolidation loan would be best for me.

I also have a 10000 line of credit at 14% with 0 balance to play with but due to the interest rate being higher then all my other loans individually I don't think this is the best root, but I could be wrong. 

Another idea I've been told to, and done some research into is refinancing my home. Not in terms of amount but time. This is my third year owning it I have done a full kitchen remodel plus many upgrades around common rooms and bed rooms, plus some landscaping.

Any advise would be greatly appreciated, PF!",finance
personalfinance,Buying a house with contingency to sell my house?,"I purchased my first home just over 2 years ago.  I'm now married and looking at starting a family so we will be quickly outgrowing our current home.  I had originally planned on waiting until after our 1st baby was born (not currently pregnant) to seriously consider moving.  However, we recently got some advice that interest rates are currenlty very low so it might be worth considering an earlier move.

Our current house was purchased for $92,000 on a 15 year mortgage.  After bathroom remodels, landscaping, and an overall facelift we believe we could sell it for $100-105K.  Our neighbor with a smaller, more outdated, but very similar floor plan just listed for $110,000.

The problem is, we do not currently have enough money saved for a down payment.  We recently paid off both of our cars and student loans, so I'm confident we will be able to save money very quickly.  If we wait 1-2 years, we would have enough cash to make a very comfortable move.  If we want to move now, we would have to use the money from the sale of our house for the down payment on the new house.

I'm sure this is a situation that happens often, but I'm not experienced so I don't know the options.  What options do we have besides the following, and what makes the most sense?

1. Make an offer on a house with a contingency to sell our house.

2. Sell our house and then begin our house search.

3. Take out a loan on the equity we have on our house.",finance

personalfinance,Using 401k loan with high interest to funnel more money into 401k,"Throw away for obvious reasons.

I'm currently hitting 401k, HSA, and IRA limits (mine and wife's). I'm financially able to contribute more toward retirement, and would like to dodge taxes as much as possible.

A 401k loan with a high interest rate would seem to get more money in to the 401k beyond the annual limit.

Would this work? Is it foolish? It seems foolish at first glance without a clear reason why.

I'm pretty uneducated about these things.

Other details:
- My end goal is to retire early and possibly live as an expat somewhere; this would be, hopefully, about 20 years from now.

- We have a demonstrated history of properly handling a budget, so the risk of us ""blowing"" the loan funds is small.

- I plan on hiring a professional before the end of the year, so this somewhat idle curiosity. Admittedly, I'm procrastinating.

- I have $30k post tax in an index fund that I need to do something more intelligent with for retirement.

- I'm 33 years old. My wife is 34.

- ~250k / year salary (it varies based on bonuses, RSU, and ESPP performance)

- Debt free, but I pay $2800 / month rent in a very high cost of living area.

- Permanently kid free.

- Married. 

- My wife is a full time student seeking a phd and is unemployed. The earning potential for her field after graduating is limited to 40-50k.

- No plans to buy a house in the near future. Being nomadic has served my career well, and we enjoy being in new places, so I don't want to be tied to a location. This could change once my wife develops her new career, but unlikely.",finance
personalfinance,(MX) Paying taxes working remotely for an American company from Mexico,"Hey, I am not sure if this is the appropriate place to post or not, but hoping someone here can offer some advice.


I am a Mexican citizen and resident. Recently I applied for an instructor position at an online university based on the United States. All my duties would be performed remotely from Mexico. 


As a requisite for being an instructor they sent me a contract template to review. I have read the contract and have some doubts regarding paying taxes on the USA. I am aware that as a Mexican citizen I must pay taxes in Mexico and I know how to do it on my hometown. However, my main concern is paying taxes in the United States. Should I pay taxes in the United States (federal, state or local)?


I would be hired as an ""Independent Contractor"" and the agreement states that: “Instructor shall be solely responsible for, and shall file on a timely basis, all tax returns and payments required to be filed with, or made to, any federal, state or local tax authority with respect to the performance of services and receipt of fees under this Agreement”.


I am single, I have a B1/B2 non-immigrant visa and haven't traveled in the last three years to United States. I would be paid bi-monthly $400-600 (It’s a volunteer position). Based on this information, should I pay taxes? Should I file a return? If so, how should I proceed. On my side, there's not much to arrange. It is the legislation on the United States that worries me.
Any help or guidance would be really appreciated.

personalfinance,E-Fund Strategy,"Hi all,

I'll start out by stating, I *know* that emergency funds are there for easy access to liquid money, but I am looking for ways to juice the earnings without sacrificing a bunch.

Here's the situation:

* Emergency funds - $20,000 in total (four months of expenses at current spending levels; 5-6 months of expenses when eliminating unnecessary things)
 * Primary fund - $15,000 in a Capital One 360 money market (1.2%APY)
 * Immediate-access fund - $2,000 in a USAA Savings acount (0.3%APY)
 * Not-quite-immediate access fund - $1,000 in Capital One 12-month CD (1.25%, maturity January 2018)
 * Loosely-considered-""emergency"" fund - $2,000 in a conservative Vanguard mutual fund
* Personal situation
 * Married
 * We each have good, steady jobs
 * We are planning to have children in the very near future (yay!)
 * We each have both short- and long-term disability insurance, and we each have health insurance such that we will never need to dip into an emergency fund to pay for any medical emergencies

I'm not planning to make *huge* changes, but I am thinking about putting a few thousand into a 5-year Capital One CD; it has 2.1% interest and only a 6-month interest penalty for early withdrawal. Assuming I don't need to withdraw the funds within 14 months, I will break even against leaving the funds in the Cap One  360.

Are there substantial risks to putting, say, $5,000 into a 5-year CD  at what the Fed hopes will be the long-term inflation rate?

personalfinance,Help! I am conflicted on how to deal with our financial issues,"My bf and I have come to the sad realization of the debt we are in and that the Vancouver housing market is getting so expensive so quickly at the same time. I am conflicted on how to tackle this situation without making myself completely miserable in the process. 

I have $10,000 in credit card/LOC debt. 
I take home $4,100 after tax
My expenses total $2400 (including a $400/month car lease)

I am in the process of trying to find a new job to try to make a higher income, but Vancouver is notoriously difficult for trying to get higher salaries. This is not impossible but could take some time. 

With my car, it's a 2016 Jetta and my lease rate is only 0.90%. I put $2,000 down initially and the residual after 4 years is about $10,000. I really like this car and was planning on buying it out at the end. I have been going back and forth in my head about what to do with this car. One option would be to keep it as it is reliable, under warranty and a very low interest rate. The other option would be to try to get someone to take over the lease ($500 penalty from VW) but then I would likely have to give up the $2000 down payment as an incentive to the new person. I would also technically be losing out on my $4,800 years worth of payments I have made since I was planning on keeping it. I would then have to go buy a half decent car which would likely cost $5k-6k and a much higher interest rate. I really need a reliable car and can't really afford a lot of repair bills (or have space to fix myself) nor do I want to have to deal with a car that breaks down. I feel like maybe this is an okay solution but a temporary one that kind of costs me a lot to do. I also have to have a car so not having one is not an option. 

We both have the potential to bring in higher incomes in the coming years and we also want to buy a place in the next 1-2 years. 

What would you suggest in this situation?

personalfinance,(Safe) Investing for While I'm at College,"Hi all, first time posting in here. I'm about to be a second-year college student and (thank God and my family) won't be in any debt. I have two savings accounts, one containing money I've made from various jobs and the other is a much larger one that family has been putting towards since I was born to give me a head start when I'm on my own. 

Since I won't be graduating or presumably buying a house for a while, I figure now's a good time to put that larger chunk of cash in a safe investment to make me some money. I'm already investing in stocks a bit, have been for a few years, and definitely don't feel anything is safe enough to put what is basically my help-start-up money in there. I've been looking into CDs, mostly because of how much better they are than the pathetic savings account interest rates, and also due to them being federally insured. But I was wondering if there might be any other options that are better that I'm overlooking? I really want to keep the risk here as low as possible as you might guess. I've read a little bit about money markets, bonds, etc, and none seemed to be a better option (though admittedly, I don't claim to be an expert). Any info or advice you guys can give would be much appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,(US) Just received a $18.5k work comp settlement. I have about $25k in debt. Please help.,"Long story, but quick back story. I have been a mechanic for 10 years, developed severe carpal tunnel in both hands. Had to fight work and work comp to get coverage. Got the surgery and follow up physical therapy done and covered. I had surgery's starting in January and I am healed now but still off work and awaiting a FCE to determine my restrictions. However, most importantly my hands work great now!! Finally, my lawyer settled with the insurance company and I received my back pay and out of pocket expenses dating back to January. I am receiving current weekly benefits of 2/3's my average former weekly pay. I will not be returning to that job or career in the interest of my hands. I have been a volunteer EMT for 5 years and took a paid job at a ski resort on the ski patrol starting this November. It is a significant pay decrease at $12/hr. The trade off is I'll be doing something I truly am passionate about. I know this is not ideal given my situation but the plans not going to change, I just need to make it work. 

My goals are to get on top of my credit and try and keep an emergency fund with this settlement. 

So to the point, I finally got a settlement for my work comp claim. I have 18,500 in a few checks to deposit. I have accumulated debt from tools(necessary to my former job), stupid spending(working on that) and being off work for 8 months. 
I have 3 debt accounts totaling $25,779.20. One Is my Credit Card (CC), $9557.998 at a high interest rate (like 19%, not positive). The other is a Person Line of Credit (PLoC), 10,092.63 but at a lower rate (12%? cant remember) and finally a Personal Loan (PL) of $10k at a three year payment plan. Cant remember that rate but maybe 9% or 10%. I have 6,128.58 left to pay with 19 payments of $331.54 a month. 

I hope I have given enough info, please let me know if I need to add more. 
Bottom line question is, how would you recommend dividing up the settlement between credit accounts and try and keep some for an emergency fund?
I've read on here about paying off highest interest debts first and working your way down. What I am considering is completely pay off the CC, then applying something like $5k to the PLoC and keeping the remaining $3,443 in a savings account for emergency or helping supplement my PL if I'm short on cash. But that doesn't really ""sing"" to me, I feel like maybe there is something better to do.
I'm open to ideas and suggestions.

personalfinance,Consolidating Student Debt to a Credit Card,"So my girlfriend currently has $30,000 in student loans with a 4.5% average interest rate.

CryptoCurrency,Hear me out,"TL;DR at the end.

I know a lot of people think it's a huge pump and dump good for nothing coin. At least that's what I've mostly read, if anything else.
I'm talking about Cannabis Coin (from here on cc)

And it may as well be, idk, haven't made my DD.

But I was thinking the concept behind it may be very useful. Hear me out:

With a bunch of states legalizing it for recreational use, and the bomb that's gonna be when California starts selinng it legally on Jan 1 2018, the problem in the US regarding it's taxation stays the same.

AFAIK, since it isn't legal under the Federal Umbrella, cannabis businesses can't have bank accounts, therefore a lot of cash-accountants have risen to the occasion to make business out of this matter. Still, you can imagine how logistically impractical this process of moving a lot of paper is.

What if weed can be bought with cc? Businesses could then convert it to eth or btc or whatever and cash it out (or not, whtv) with their bank cutting out the middleman (aka the new cash accountants)

I mean sure, they could just straight up sell it for btc or eth or anything else, no need for specifically  cc, just that the whole concept got me thinking.

Please tell me what you think and even more please tell me if I'm incorrect in some respect, or add tour information.

Disclaimer: I don't even own any cc nor do I work with them, am not in any reddit or slack or whtv, just wanted to put my mind out there.

TL;DR: States legalize weed sales in the US. Illegal under Federal law. No Bank account for Businesses. Cash-Accountants, fees and heavy logistics for money transfer and taxation. Use Cannabis Coin (or any crypto for that matter) to cut the middleman and admin. costs.",cryptocurrency
investing,Why is inflation still low?,"Average inflation US (CPI) by year ([Source](http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/united-states/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-united-states.aspx))

* 2008 ... 3.85%
* 2009 .. -0.34%
* 2010 ... 1.64%

* 2013 ... 1.47%
* 2014 ... 1.62%
* 2015 ... 0.12%
* 2016 ... 1.26%

With interest rates being at historic lows for some time now, money has been very cheap. Businesses can borrow money at near zero rates, consumers have lower mortgages and CC rates which should mean more disposable income and spending. The Fed also printed tons of money to stimulate the economy during the recession with quantitative easing (QE) which means an even higher money supply. 


All of this suggests that inflation should be higher than what has occurred. Why has inflation been low these past ~10 years? Is it because wages have stagnated? Oil being extremely cheap?",finance
personalfinance,"Recent college grad with surprise baby on the way. Need help with budgets, savings, and student loans.","I'm 22, have 50k in student debt (25 private, 25k federal), just graduated from college, and am expecting a baby in December, and I'm not really sure what to do from here. I'm not screwed or anything, but I'm feeling overwhelmed. Also will be a single parent, with no child support coming in (but I don't need advice on that).

Currently, I'm working for as a civilian contractor for the military on the base in my town. I'm working in administration. I got my bachelor's in speech-language pathology. My undergrad GPA (3.0) was not high enough to get into speech path grad schools. Without a masters, this degree is pretty much useless, besides the fact that at least I have a degree.

I'd like to be a government employee rather than a contractor (better benefits, loan forgiveness, etc.) but there aren't a crazy amount of jobs. Still looking every day, and I expect I'll be able to go government after few months, especially when more jobs open up after the start of the new fiscal year.

Currently making a little under $15 an hour, which is ending up being $2000 a month after tax.

I moved back home so I'm living rent free, and most of my childcare will be provided by a family member for free (I'll need to secure drop-in care as needed, and need to build up a fund for this, probably.)

For insurance, I'm paying $300 a month for just  myself, which will increase to $500 a month after the baby is born. I also pay $20 to Spotify/Hulu, and have $280 of credit card debt which I've been fairly aggressively paying off, and have gotten it down from $500 over the last 3 paychecks. No phone payment. After my grace period, I'll owe $294 to my private loan lender, and $338 on my federal loans. I have the option to pay federal by income, which would lower it to about $20. I'm worried about not being able to save up/pay for baby expenses with the full federal rate, but I don't want to defer the payments entirely, because I've heard that if you defer again, you won't get the 6 month grace period if you return to school, you'll have to start payments immediately after paying. Plus, I understand there's federal loan forgiveness if you work for the federal government after a certain amount of time. 

I've been at my job for 6 weeks, and have gotten a half paycheck, and one full paycheck so I haven't really gotten into the swing of savings, but this is my intention/what I've done with the first full paycheck.

I've budgeted $80 a week for gas/food ($160/check), and I've been putting the cost of my insurance after the increase + the student loans (with the income based payment of $20 for federal) into my savings account in preparation for the increased payments. $100 to credit card. I also had to bite the bullet and buy maternity clothes, and I had to pay $300 on rent to my old apartment in my college town. I've since found someone to take my lease, but I'll have to pay the rent again for September and then I'll be free from this.

I'm just concerned that once I have the baby and my loans kick in, both in December of course, I won't have anything going into my savings and I'm worried about what I would do in an emergency. I also know my cost of living will be going up, and I'm really worried about how to estimate my expenses and start saving now. I feel like my budgeting skills suck and I don't know what I'm missing, but I feel like I'm not doing it right.

I have a savings and checking account, but if I start saving for multiple things, like a medical emergency fund, a new car fund, etc. how can I keep the savings separate/earmarked for their specific uses? My car is a gas guzzling POS on it's way out, but it works for now, but I don't really know how to save efficiently for more than one thing.

It's also worth noting that my credit is complete shit. It's 490. I know that's like worse than prison inmates, and believe it or not, it's getting better. It's risen probably 100 points over the last 6 months. Are the any tips for getting this up?

For the long term, I'm not sure what to do to have more earning potential. I definitely want a job making more than $15 an hour.  Most of my coworkers don't have college degrees and I think I'm capable of doing much better work, and feel unfulfilled and like I'm wasting my potential. Unfortunately, due to the nature of working as a contractor, there's no chance of pay increases. The work I due is mind-numbingly simple, and infrequent so I spend most of my time sitting around doing nothing, but I'm getting good resume padding, and I obtained a security clearance, which would probably put me ahead of candidates w/o a clearance due to the long process it takes to get one.

The military base is the biggest employer, and jobs here are either looking for less than a bachelor's (for ""technician"" positions, or beyond bachelor's, so I feel stuck in the middle having too much or not enough education).

What would be the best path for me to take? I'm not particularly passionate about anything, but I'd like to take steps for a better future, knowing that a ""dream job"" is probably pretty unrealistic. The salary cap for speech pathology and my GPA make me hesitant to pursue that. It would be almost impossible to continue working while I did grad school, and would have a clinical fellowship year that would be low income/unpaid, so it wouldn't be possible with a baby.

Is it the best option to get a masters in something, even with the debt I already have? Most jobs here are looking for anyone with a masters, not in a specific field. Should I wait until I have something I feel more passionate about? Is there something else I'm missing that would be better to do?",finance
personalfinance,Calculating AGI for Income Driven Student Loan Repayment,"Hey PF. Long time lurker here (on my alt so as to not provide too much identifying information). 

I've been working since I was 15, but only recently started my first full time job. I'm 22, fresh out of college and just started my first full time job at a college. I'm not exactly sure how to calculate my AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) and since I haven't completed taxes for the new job, I'm left even more clueless. 

First off, do you include itemized deductions when calculating your AGI? From what I have read you do not. I just want to clarify.

Next up, a pre-tax employer run ""TASC Flex Spending Account""  would have it's total subtracted from my Gross Wage before I even begin to total my AGI right? The employer is technically never paying me that money (even if I'm using it). 

As of right now I do not have an IRA in place (looking into that based on what I hear here) but I do contribute to Iowa's ""IPERS"". IPERS is taken out on a pre-tax basis, reducing my taxable wages, but I'm not sure if this effects my AGI. Anyone know for sure?

Do post tax insurance deductions lower my AGI? I don't believe they do, but I wanna check. 

Last but not least, Travel expenses, tuition/ fees, student loan interest rates, moving costs and charitable contributions are all acceptable subtractions from your Gross income to calculate your AGI. I feel like I understand these well enough, but I want to clarify. For Student Loan Interest, is it only the amount of interest paid up to $2500 a year or is it Student Loan Interest accumulated up to $2500 (not sure why it would be accumulated, but I wanna cover all my basis).

devops,Chef and IaC tool for GCP - opinions and suggestions,"hey folks.

So my company has started an initiative to move from our in-house cloud solution (RHEV) to GCP.

We are already cheffed up as far as chef-client (roles, cookbooks, etc) and quite proud of it, so I thought the next logical step was moving toward IaC with chef-provisioning.

However all of the chef-provisioning projects I've found for GCP/GCE are incomplete or outdated (chef-provisioning, using chef-zero + the GCE cookbook/LWRP). knife-google is really cool and works pretty well, but not what I'm after (IaC).

So has anyone had good results with the projects above and maybe have some reference to point me towards? Or am I doing this wrong and not seeing the big active projects for this sort of thing?

I'm leaning toward Terraform, but I feel that learning a new tool with a new language while also juggling the move (which of course is on a painful timeline) would add too many changes at once and cause more harm than good i.e. I'd like to stick with something made by Chef, or at least having the same ruby syntax.",technology

After doing the math out and before factoring in my credit card debt, this leaves me at about $392 saved per month, or $4,711 per year. With paying off my credit card debt, that is -$3 saved. Even without factoring in credit card debt, $4,711 is nothing. I want to save for a house and a wedding. What can I do?   




Due to my medical issues, I cannot work a second job on the side unless it is VERY low stress and low hours. I cannot get overtime. I am only 22 and therefore an entry-level employee. I do not have the experience or skills to have a higher earning potential at this time.   




Here is my student loan information. I have recently refinanced my private loan. 

Private Loan (6% Interest): $54,500

Federal Loans (6 Different Loans Between 3 and 6.5% Interest): $19,259

personalfinance,Why is it not incredibly common for people to start 501(c)(3) institutions to avoid paying property taxes on their homes?,"I was reading this New York Times Article about White Supremacists groups avoiding paying taxes by filing as educational non-profits: 

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/opinion/white-supremacists-tax-exemptions.html?mcubz=0

Which also links to the IRS criteria for filing for tax exemptions by creating an institution that meets said criteria: 

https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rp_1986-43.pdf


And it made me wonder. What is to stop a regular person from distributing pamphlets on something like ""wildlife conservation"" or ""Libertarian economic philosophy,"" while meeting all the necessary criteria, in order to avoid paying property taxes on their own home (assuming they list their address as their headquarters in their incorporation papers)? 

I have no experience with taxes other than my own personal annual filings for state and federal taxes. I understand that this may be a very dumb question, since it is true that most people do not file as a 501(c)(3) to avoid paying property taxes. 

Does anyone have experience or knowledge of how the IRS deals with these cases? I get the feeling that they must be aware of the possible tax loophole here. Of course it's possible that I just have not grasped what any of this really means.

personalfinance,Refinancing house loan and merging credit card debt into new mortgage?,"I have a few questions about personal finance in the credit/debt sector.


My husband is the only one on our current mortgage and both of our names are on the actual house title. We both have credit card debt (his about $8,000 and mine $2,000). 


He received a letter saying he could refinance and put his credit card debt into the new mortgage for a lower payment than what we currently pay. 


My questions are:


What are the pros and cons of refinancing and merging? So far it sounds like a great plan so that he would not have outstanding credit card debt we are making separate payments on monthly with a higher interest rate than what we would probably have on the new mortgage.

Secondly if we refinance we would want to do it with both of our names on the mortgage. Would that mean we could both put our credit card debt into the mortgage?

And lastly, how does that work? The company we refinance through would pay the credit card company and that would make a remaking balance of $0 on the credit cards?

Thanks for any info!",finance
personalfinance,Refinance house or hold steady,"Story. Our mortgage is through the builder of our home. It is currently worth just over 200k and we owe 167k right now. Our monthly P&amp;I is $1225 with 6.5% interest. The taxes and insurance are our responsibility. They are not included in our payment to the builder. We have 21 years left on the loan as of this month. We have been looking into refinancing and getting a lower interest rate. Since they are low right now.  (The builder does not refinance) Our credit score for both of us is over 740. We make enough money to comfortable pay the mortgage. We have talked to our credit union and they will only refinance a home  up to $150k so that's not an option. Who else should we talk to about refinancing? There are a huge number of online companies that promise the world and it is tough to sift through them to see who is worth speaking to.
Another challenge is that the mortgage does not show up on our credit report since the builder does not report it.

personalfinance,Buying a Second Home after owning 1st home with Current Girlfriend,"My girlfriend and I bought a home together 3 years ago.    We are getting married soon and thinking about upgrading but I would like to keep and rent our first home.  The 1st home is worth about $500k and we owe $340k on it.  I realize we may qualify for a second mortgage with the equity but I had an idea that I thought could be either smart or completely pointless.  

  My thought was to go get a new mortgage and buy my girlfriend out of the current home.  Giving her $100k to get out off the loan.  She would then take the $100k and buy our new home.  I think she would not have pay taxes on this gain but not positive since it is reinvested in primary residence.  

  Downside is we would not get as low an interest rate without combined incomes?  I can't think of many others besides maybe taxes.  

   We would then rent the first house, move into the new house, and get married.

  Am I missing something?  Is just buying a second home together much easier?  My hesitation is we wouldn't be able to take as much equity with a second mortgage as I would doing it this way.

personalfinance,Investor or Pay off Debt,"Hi all, 

I currently owe $10,000 at a pretty steep interest rate of 10%. However, I was recently given a pretty large cash bonus in the after tax amount of $24,000. I used $4,000 to pay down the loan to its current state of $10,000. Which means that I have $20,000 cash on hand and $10,000 left on the loan. I currently make monthly payments of $330 and will have about 2 years left on the loan. My question is whether I should invest or pay down my debt with the bonus. I know that generally it is better to pay down debt from a mathematical standpoint, but I believe my scenario might be a bit unique in that I have a strong dislike for my job as it is rather stressful and requires 70-80 hour work weeks. Ultimately, this is unsustainable and I am looking at different jobs (which would probably come with a pay cut). This means that I would need cash to hold me over should I need to move cities for a new job or any other expenses that may come up. I am 23 years old and living in NYC.

Is my line of thinking for keeping $20k liquid rather than paying down debt silly or okay for now?

Here's the gist of my financial situation: 

Current Salary: Gross $1050, net $750 after taxes and contribution to retirement, **so take home $3k per month**

Car Payment: $150
Car Insurance: $100
Renter's Insurance: $16
Cell Phone: $150 

Medical Bill: $32 (balance around $900 but not collecting interest)

Student Loans: $240 (lowest I can get)

Credit Card 1: Balance $1862.64, 0% interest until 7/18

Credit Card 2: Balance $3601.82, 21% interest so currently about $61 in interest charges each month, minimum payment is $91

Credit Card 3: Balance $2479.49, 19% interest so currently about $40 in interest charges each month, minimum payment is $61

Credit Card 4: Balance $742.19, 15% interest so currently about $10 in interest each month, minimum payment is $25

Personal Loan: Balance $4529.17, 15% interest so roughly $50-60 interest charges each month, minimum payment $185


**When it's all said and done, I have about $160 week/$640 month for food, gas, cat supplies, clothes, etc. and I try to save $50 week/ $200 month, but so far that's not really working too well.**

I've been wrestling with how to tackle the credit card debt... either working on that card with the terrible interest rate first or the small ones. 

Reddit, what do you think?


EDIT 1 - Thank you for you replies. So far - 

I've reduced my cell phone bill to $100/month. The unlimited plan is actually only $118, but I had to pay $150 last month because of previous overage charges. Either way, I will stick to the $100/month plan. 

When I get home, I am going to cut up my credit cards. I have an emergency card provided by one of my parents that I will keep for EMERGENCIES. 

September is a 5 week pay month, so I expect to save at least $700 next month toward my emergency fund. 

I have also been looking at part time jobs since posting this. I did serve for two weeks recently at a sports bar, but was let go after my schedule became too much to work around (I am frequently on-call for my job).

My lease isn't up until April 2018 so I won't be able to look for roommates to then. I live in the Chicago area - I am not 100% sure I will do better than $850 a month even if I had roommates. I know someone who pays $900 a month and has 2 roommates. I already live in a not-great area of Chicago. 

I appreciate everyone's input. Basically I know what the answer is, just needed some outsiders to give me the reality check I couldn't give myself.",finance

&gt; Dear Senate committee members

&gt; The Bitcoin Foundation, Inc. is a non-profit organization founded in September 2012. Comprised of senior leaders in the Bitcoin community, the Foundation coordinates joint efforts of the Bitcoin community, helping to create awareness of the benefits of Bitcoin, its use and its related technology requirements. The Foundation’s audience includes technologists, regulators, and the media, and its reach is global. The Foundation has been at the forefront of campaigning for an unimpeded economic system for the future. In November 2013, Patrick Murck, general counsel of the Foundation, testified before a United States Senate Committee convened to assess digital currencies. After engaging with federal regulators and lawmakers, a near-unanimous consensus that the federal government needed to be careful to avoid hampering the growth of the world's first completely decentralized payment network resulted. 

&gt; First, the Foundation wishes to express its strong and unequivocal opposition to a specific section of a bill titled “Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017” (S. 1241), Section 13, to the extent it includes “digital currencies” for purposes of Subchapter II of Title 31 of the U.S. Code, dealing with “Records and Reports on Monetary Instruments Transactions.” 

&gt; Second, we request that the United States Committee on the Judiciary formally investigates, whether directly or through the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the U.S. Department of Justice’s policy of prosecuting individuals who exchange bitcoin for cash or other financial instruments under the federal money transmitting statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1960. 

&gt; Further details of our submission to your committees are included in the letter attached here.

&gt; We look forward to engaging further with you about these very important issues.

personalfinance,"(UK) Recieved £6000, what should I do?","Recently came into a windfall of £6000 and I'm just wondering what to do with it. I have it in an ISA at the moment but the interest rate is truly pitiful and I can't help but think the money could be put to better use. 

As for a bit of background to this situation, I am 20 years old and I live at home. I have a full time job and I pay my parents £200 a month in rent. I don't have any extraordinary expenses apart from martial arts classes. I have a (crappy) car that I own outright and I'm based in the Midlands.",finance
personalfinance,Is there any mathmatical​ benefit to refinancing a mortgage to a shorter term other than a lower interest rate?,"#background

Four years ago I completed a mortgage modification.  As part of that they scheduled periodic increases in my rate which will max out at 3.75% tomorrow.  I have 480 monthly payments left (40 years) and clearly do not want to be paying that long.

#question

If I can refinance with no fees to 30 year, but it would be the same interest rate, would there be any reason to do so instead of just paying the additional amount as principle payments?",finance
personalfinance,$100K in debt with high-interest loans and fixed income. Help me hustle!,"Hi r/PF! 

Long time lurker posting on throw-away for social reasons. Here’s a quick snapshot of my situation:

-Currently &gt;$100,000 in debt due to poor financial planning (youth).
-Offered 90% scholarship to a small private university.
-Scholarship “recalculated” after matriculation due to errors on FAFSA
-Awarded multiple university scholarships (~$15K) which my Uni then deducted from my financial aid package (I got the prestige of the scholarships, but none of the money). 
-Worked my ass off and got a full scholarship to medical school.

r/PF, please help me figure out how to hustle this debt!

I had a rocky family situation growing up and used college &amp; loans to get out. I lived with friends for the last year of high school and got scholarships &amp; loans to pay my tuition. One of my parents co-signed ~80K of my loans until his debt was too high to co-sign additional debt. My grandmother co-signed the last of my college debt. Unfortunately, this is from a predatory lender (I wont name names, but let’s call them Fells Wargo), and is growing at 10-11%. 

Half of my loans are in deferment (staffords, fed loans) and half are in repayment. The high-interest loan payments are killing me right now. I get a stipend for my current studies ($22k/year) but my loan payments are ~800/month. I’ve been actively managing my credit since college and my FICO score is 730-750 from all 3 credit bureaux but I had a few late payments several years ago that are still on record.

I want to refinance my debt to manage my payments but my applications have been denied without a cosigner. My original co-signer (father) has poor credit and my secondary co-signer (grandmother) is in poor health and I am trying everything to avoid having her worry about this.  

I know many will tell me to “increase income, decrease expenses.” My income is fixed @ $1800/mo and I’m not legally allowed to hold another job but I’ve started responding to tutoring requests since I’m at a large university. I’ve tried selling plasma but stopped for medical reasons. My food bills are pretty low already, I use free services (gym, library) whenever possible, and I commute to work via bicycle most days. 

Once I graduate, I’ll be making enough money to aggressively pay down my debt but that’s still a few years off. I need to find a solution for the short-term that hopefully doesn’t sacrifice my long-term financial well-being.

Are there any ways to beat this debt that I’m not seeing?",finance
personalfinance,Best small loan for average credit?,"I have a credit score of 680 and have a history of 100% on time payments, I need a loan of 2000 dollars for some financial issues that have arisen this month, what would be my best bet for something with a low interest rate?",finance
personalfinance,College Student needing advice on student loans,"I currently have about $35,000 in student loan debt from my undergraduate degree with $25,000 of it being unsubsidized and therefore currently accruing interest. I was accepted into a graduate program which will be my last level of schooling and therefore have access to new student loan opportunities. I also set the loans up on a deferment plan with the loan company since I'm still in school and on a very limited budget. Some of these loans I've had for 4 years and they will be sitting for 5 more until I finish my graduate degree. My unsubsidized loans range in interest from 3.760%-4.660%. The current graduate student loan interest rate is 6.000%.

My question is would it be more beneficial to take out newer loans with the graduate student loan options to pay off the unsubsidized portion of my current student loans and pay the yearly interest on that or to keep them as they are and pay off the yearly interest?",finance
personalfinance,"Newly graduated, student loans, where to start?","Hello people of PF, so I recently graduated and luckily found a job. I'm making decent money and am able to stay afloat but I'm not sure where to start with my loans? Pay off private loans first? Pay off federal first? Pay the lowest balance off first or the one with the lowest interest rate? I've been doing some research and there are a couple of different methods I've found but not sure which is best. I just wanted to get some input from you guys. Thanks in advance!

Bitcoin,exchange and wallet advice,"It is common advice to new users that they move ""large"" amounts of Bitcoin to a wallet only application whether it be hard or soft. 

I take two issues with this. First, ""large,"" amounts of Bitcoin is relative. Are we talking 1 or 2 Bitcoin or 10 or 100. New users do not have a good sense of what a large amount of Bitcoin is. What is it?

 Second, Coinbase funds are insured for ,""any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft."" (Side note it may be a good idea to ask Coinbase to send you the policy limits.) Further, if you are a US resident exchanging Bitcoin for USD regularly your Coinbase USD Fiat wallet is federal insured up to $250k.

Why then would you move your Bitcoin  to an uninsured wallet? 

Before we just spew the line that we learned when we became part of the movement we should analyse whether the advice is any good.

personalfinance,I am 22 with a credit score of 780. Is this good? I applied for a line of credit for school and they offered me one at an interest rate of prime +4% which puts it right under 7%. Should I expect a better rate? Any other advice for me?,"Not a lot of money will go on the line of credit. $2000 at the MOST for only about 6 months. I've just never dealt with a line of credit. At first they wanted me to get a cosigner but I was insistent that I want to do everything on my own and that my parents do not financially support me or have anything to do with my finances and they haven't had anything to do with my finances since I was 16 and started working. They finally agreed to give me one without a cosigner. I fill out the paperwork tomorrow, if you guys have any advice for me, it's greatly appreciated.",finance
datascience,Common Question,"I've looked at many posts of people asking a similar question to what I'm about to ask, but I wanted to get an answer more tailored to myself. I was going to start applying to graduate schools for a Masters in DS, but after doing my research, I find myself really doubting that decision because as many people have said, many schools' DS programs are really new and fluffed. I am about graduate with a bachelors in Statistics. I'm comfortable working with C++, R Studio and I'm learning Python and SQL right now. After looking at many posts, I'm wondering if it would be a smarter decision to not go to graduate school, but try to get a job or internship as a Data Analyst instead and work my way up. 


I appreciate any feedback you guys can offer. Thanks.",technology
personalfinance,Getting out of debt,"So after I left the military I pretty much dug myself into this big hole of debt for about a year. Really all dumb mistakes as most young people do.

Anyways here I am $23,000 in credit card debt ($3,000 on one with a 18% interest rate and the rest on the other with 17% interest rate)

$850 to txtag


$500 to enterprise 


$2,500 to the VA 

Those three things I pay about $150 a month as part of a payment plan. 

I recently have a new roommate and a pay increase but both will probably not be around by the new year.

My question is while I have this extra money  should I...

  A)put most my money into paying off the three places and put the minimum amount on my credit card?

Or 


B) Continue paying the 3 places $150 a month and put all my extra money into the credit cards? 



Or


 C) Some other thing",finance
personalfinance,"Say ""No"" to CC debt","Hello, I have 5 CC's and I'm about $7,000 in CC debt. I pay about $250 a month doing minimum payments.

Thank you I appreciate the advice",finance
personalfinance,When does it make sense to take out a personal loan to pay off credit card debt?,"When I was 18, I abruptly became financially independent from my toxic family, leaving me on my own with basically no financial literacy. While I'm proud of the last 6 years, I'm now 24 and still living basically paycheck to paycheck, with about ~9k of credit card debt hanging over my head (plus about ~30k of student loans and ~3k in taxes that I'm paying by installment). ~2.5k of that debt won't start accumulating interest for another ~14 months because it's on a 0% APR intro rate, but it pains me to see how much I'm paying in interest on the other ~6.5k that *is* accruing interest.

Because I have good credit (hovers between 700 and 710), I get lots of mailers for personal loans that *seem* really appealing... but I have 0 financial sense and I'm not sure if this is a ""seems too good to be true"" situation? In my head, a personal loan sounds appealing because a) many of the offers I'm getting have much, much lower APRs than my cards (which are all 25%+) and b) having one monthly loan payment instead of juggling 5 cc payments sounds much, much easier from a practicality level. In my head, the personal loan would *just* be for the credit card debt; the interest rates on my taxes and student loans are relatively low.

What should I be looking for here? What are the hidden fees/costs or common pitfalls with personal loans? Like I said, I just don't have much financial literacy, so while it *seems* appealing I'm not sure if there are huge glaring red flags that I'm missing. The sense I get from browsing is that I just need to sit down and make a spreadsheet to figure this out, but before I start, is there something obvious that I'm missing?",finance
