technology,[x-post r/marchfornetneutrality] What Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Senator Patty Murray had to say in response to my email to them about NN.,"&gt; Dear Mr. kinggzy:  
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; Thank you for contacting me about net neutrality and the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) efforts to dismantle the net neutrality rules put in place under the Obama Administration. I appreciate hearing from you.  
&gt;   
&gt; First and foremost, I support net neutrality. As you know, net neutrality refers to the principle that internet service providers (ISP) should not be allowed to block, throttle, or otherwise discriminate between lawful content on their networks and across the internet. Net neutrality has been a core characteristic of the internet since its creation and has ensured that companies of all sizes have a level playing field to compete and pursue new ideas on. I am extremely proud of Washington state’s robust tech sector and firmly believe that net neutrality has be essential to its growth and development.
&gt;  
&gt; The net neutrality rules that are currently in place were adopted by the FCC on February 26, 2015 after millions of Americans wrote and expressed their support for a free and open internet. These rules provide the FCC with the regulatory tools to protect and maintain net neutrality across wired and wireless networks, and provide a general net neutrality standard to evaluate future ISP policies against. The 2015 rules did not empower the FCC to regulate how much ISPs could charge customers or invest in their networks. I supported these rules when they were initially adopted and continue to support them now.
&gt;  
&gt; That is why I am deeply troubled by the steps the FCC is taking to roll back its existing net neutrality rules. Already, millions of Americans have written in to the FCC urging the Commission to keep its current rules in place and not to replace them with a weaker standard. I agree with these comments and I will continue to fight for a free and open internet on the behalf of individuals and businesses in Washington state and across the country.  
&gt;   
&gt; If you would like to know more about my work in the Senate, please feel free to sign up for my weekly updates at http://www.murray.senate.gov/updates. Again, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with me. 
&gt; Sincerely,  
&gt; Patty Murray  
&gt; United States Senator  
&gt;   
&amp;nbsp;
&gt;   
&gt; May 26, 2017  
&gt;   
&gt; Mr. kinggzy
&gt; [address redacted]  
&gt;   
&gt; Dear kinggzy,  
&gt;   
&gt; Thank you for contacting me about your concerns with protecting net neutrality. I am honored to represent you and our district, which is home to incredible diversity, innovation, and progress. I am committed to fighting for a just economy that works for everyone, fairness and equality, health and safety, and livable communities that will serve as a model for the rest of the nation. Participation is key to the democratic process, so I encourage you to continue to contact your elected officials to express your opinions.  
&gt;   
&gt; The Internet should be free from discrimination against users and preserve choice and opportunity of communication for all people. I recently joined 32 of my colleagues in a letter opposing this Administration’s efforts to curtail net neutrality rules grounded in Title II of the Communications Act. I am also strongly opposed to further legislation or regulations that would threaten equal and free access to the internet, and I will vote against any bills that come to vote on the House floor that weaken net neutrality. Net neutrality ensures that Internet service providers (ISPs) treat all data and communications fairly without favoring specific content, websites, or services in ways that benefit their own profits. An open internet encourages innovation and competition and prevents gatekeeping ISPs to consolidate profits. It also guarantees free speech and communication, where people can voice dissent or use online resources to organize effectively. That’s why Congress must act to preserve an open internet because it allows customers to have consistent and reliable internet service that does not discriminate between networks or uses.  
&gt;   
&gt; However, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Commissioner Ajit Pai recently announced plans to eliminate existing net neutrality rules. This announcement comes in the wake of efforts by my Republican colleagues to roll back internet privacy rules that protected consumers’ personal information from being sold to third parties without consent. Not only are these rollbacks an attack on our right to free speech, but Commissioner Pai’s announcement is directly opposite to the will of the American public. The FCC adopted the current regulations after record breaking rounds of public comments in 2014 produced millions of submissions demanding strong regulations. In response to this unprecedented public engagement, the FCC enacted in 2015 the strongest net neutrality regulations in history that prohibit blocking, discrimination, or paid prioritization of internet traffic.  
&gt;   
&gt; Open access to the internet is indispensable to promoting innovation in business, free speech, and consumer privacy. Given public comments, FCC Commissioner Pai’s recent announcements is even more disturbing. You can be assured that I will oppose any efforts to dismantle existing net neutrality regulations, and that I will continue to work to uphold congressionally mandated communications rights.  
&gt;   
&gt; Again, thank you for getting in touch with me. Please continue to contact me on issues that you care about, and stay informed. Sign up for my e-mail newsletter at jayapal.house.gov/contact/newsletter so you can receive updates from D.C. and Seattle, join us on Facebook at [redacted, google it], on Twitter at [redacted, google it], and on Instagram, at [redacted, google it].

&gt; It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives. If you have further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call us at 202-225-3106.  
&gt;    
&gt; Sincerely,  
&gt;   
&gt; Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal  
&gt; Member of Congress  
&gt;  
&gt;  PJ/AB  
  
I just wanted to share. Don't lose heart, people. They are listening, they are responding, they are going above and beyond by actively promoting our free and open internet protections. I'm inclined to believe that this goes beyond emails to urge them to do what we want them to, and they are trying to educate those who might be on the other side currently or those who ask them about it.  
  
Please don't forget to do your part by reaching out to your own representatives from the senate and congress to let them know that you are opposed to the repeal of title 2 protections.  
  
A shoutout to my WA state representatives from congress and the senate. I appreciate your efforts and forward thinking.

personalfinance,Loan payoff question,"My husband and I have 3 personal loans from trying to refinance debt and being young and dumb.

investing,Bond etf question,"Im a relatively new investor and subsriber and was hoping for help on a question I had. Recently I've been wondering about my short term corporate investment grade bond etf. It's price has been going down lately but at the same time I'm of course earning interest. The etf lists around 3% weighted ytm. From what I understand of how bond pricing works, I always thought you'd always get a positive ytm, unless say corporation start defaulting, or inflation is high,etc. However these past few months, the capital losses are more than my interest gains. I understand why the price is going down, since interest rates are going up and the market is anticipating it to keep up with the yield. I just figured I'd earn a smaller yield, and it not actually be negative. Is this just a short term issue that should correct it self? Can I over the long term expect to achieve near the weighted ytm in a rising interest rate environment?

Bitcoin,A New CipherPunk Manifesto (redacted with the Help and life example of the 6 PHD DR Craigh S. Wright),"Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy mean I can't tell you, or a misterious entity will sue/block/beat me.  A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, that is why you should hire a PR Agency, preferably one that can deal shits happened with Spice Girls, Madonna, Bon Jovi, David Bowie. 

If two parties have some sort of dealings, then each has a memory of their interaction. Each party can speak about their own memory of this; how could anyone prevent it? HIRE THE FUCKING PR AGENCY! Partner with some Gambling Tycoon and make a company, then hire some more guys and call the ""Chief of Something"" . It's better that those hired guys have experience....like people who hired Philip Zimmermann.

Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary for that transaction.

A good way is asking that party to send you 5$ saying that you will send him back...when he does... disappear with some desperate message, THEY WILL NOT SEND 5 $ ANYMORE and will never ask proof again

Privacy in an open society also requires cryptography.  To encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy, and to encrypt with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy. Furthermore, to reveal one's identity with assurance when the default is anonymity requires the cryptographic signature.

FOR A BETTER PRIVACY FAKE THE SIGNATURE, that way no one knows anything and your Privacy is achieved


We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will speak. 
You can't fucking sue them so THREATEN TO SUE EVERYONE ELSE TALKING BAD ABOUT YOU

We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any.  I SAY IT AGAIN HIRE PR FIRM WITH EXPERIENCE IN CREATING NEWS FOR BIG BROTHER


We must come together and create systems which allow anonymous transactions to take place.  A BIG Server Farm or 5 in CHINA  is acceptable solution fucking raspberry PI are useless 2 Supercomputers that no one can find are better...as long as you steal the funds for those from some government

We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic money.

Cypherpunks have teams for writng their code e code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're going to realease tons of papers about it . We publish our papers  so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code MAY BE free for all to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we write YOU WILL USE IT ANYWAY. 

Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, that is why has no sense saying a signature is fake ...didn't you FUCKING read...NO RULES AT ALL

Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible, the federation of miners will watch over it forever

For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract. Social ranking is achived by how many Phd you have, even if some University deny you getting your PHD there, or even if your Phd is in philosophy and religion: a PHD  is a PHD ...it COUNTS FOR SOCIAL RANKING and I have 6 for God's Sake

The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks safer for privacy. Let us proceed together apace. MIners  in china are definitely more protected by their Country, the rest of the world have problem with Isis it's not safe.

personalfinance,(M/30) $98k income with $44k debt. Looking for best way to pay off debt and save.,"I've recently had a sizable increase in income and want to find the best way to pay off debt while simultaneously saving to an IRA account for retirement. Currently have no retirement saved.

Breakdown of debts:

- $22k in student loans
- $10k on credit cards (about $5k is on lower interest rate cards with 8%-12% interest, the other $5k is on higher rate cards 16%-23% interest)
- $9k car loan
- $3k backtaxes (currently paying $300 monthly installments to IRS)

Breakdown of monthly expenses I've been paying:

- $1400 for rent, utilities, internet
- $100 cell phone
- $90 car insurance
- $310 car loan
- $275 student loans
- $300 IRS installment payment
- $600 CC payments (about 2x and 3x the monthly minimums, but I could increase this)
- $600 for groceries and eating out
- $80 gas

My monthly after-tax income is roughly $5,600, and available income after above expenses is about $1,845.

Should I be saving to an IRA retirement account while I pay off debts simultaneously so that I can accrue compounding interest? Or should I make the debts a priority and pay those before saving? Which is the best course of action to becoming debt-free with a good amount saved for retirement?

Despite the CC debts my credit score is okay (671 FICO on Experian), so I'm tempted to consolidate some of the higher interest CC debt into an installment loan with lower interest. Would that be a wise decision?",finance
personalfinance,School Loan,"Just an obligatory I have never posted on this thread, so if I mess something please let me know and I will fix it. Also I am on mobile.

So I am entering my final semester and a half of college, I will hopefully finish next March with an ADN in nursing. I was fortunate that my first 2 years of community college was paid for through a scholarship that ran out and I am not eligible for. I am going to need roughly $7500 to pay for my final classes. I have tried applying for students loans through Sallie Mae and have been denied. I am not able to obtain a cosigner as my parents credit score is less than mine. My school will ONLY take Sallie Mae due to the federal default rate being to high. 

My place of employment offers $3000 a year in tuition reimbursement, meaning I need to pay the  $3000 up front to my school, and will be paid back when the class ends. 

My final idea is that I obtain a personal loan for the amount that is owed for the semester and then pay the loan off when I receive my reimbursement. Seeing as I am 20 years old with my oldest credit line only being 2 years, I know the bank loan idea is probably not going to happen, but it is my last shot. 

I live at home, my car payment is 400 a month, both credit cards are 50 a month, my gas costs are roughly 100 a month, car insurance 180 a month, and I am in charge of buying groceries for my household which runs about 300 a month. I make 1200 a month after taxes and try to save 50 a month.

personalfinance,Frustrated with Ally Bank service experience; are there any similar banks out there with good customer service?,"Over the past 24 hours, Ally Bank declined a debit card transaction, and then when I attempted to withdraw cash at a third-party ATM, the withdrawal failed, and the card was _kept_ by the ATM with a message about security.

personalfinance,What's the best way to handle my student loan?,"Hi /personalfinance!

I'm in a pretty good position, but I need some advice about the best way to handle my debt from my undergraduate degree. I'm 22, just graduated and started working, and I have five direct federal loans totaling $30,171.88. Here's the breakdown:

Loan 1: $4,524.73	at 3.860%	interest 

Loan 2: $1,504.86	at 3.860%	interest 

Loan 3: $8,412.84	at 4.660%	interest 

Loan 4: $8,042.22	at 4.290%	interest 

Loan 5: $7,687.23	at 3.760% interest 


Now, I'm fortunate in that 1) I got a job immediately after I graduated where I make $47,000, 2) my employer qualifies as a nonprofit and I'm eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), and 3) these loans are currently in their grace period, so I don't have to start paying them off for another few months. However, I'm pretty confused about all the different ways I could pay this back and which option is best for me.

I'm interested in the PSLF program; as far as I understand, if you work full-time in nonprofit or government work, you can make 120 ""qualifying payments"" under a ""qualifying payment plan"" over ten years, and afterwards the remainder of your debt is forgiven. It seems really geared for people with a LOT of debt working for really low wages, and if that were my case I'd just do this, but I feel like my debt isn't that bad and my salary is pretty good - what if I end up paying the whole thing off earlier than ten years, and there's nothing left to be forgiven? Or, what if I could have paid it off earlier than ten years, but dragging out the loan that long just adds on more interest and I end up paying more in the long run? What happens if I leave this job before ten years is up (this is pretty likely)? What if the education department actually makes good on the threat of dissolving this program? I'd really appreciate insight from somebody who's used this program or knows about it.

I have general questions too, beyond just that program. Should I try to set up another income-based repayment plan? Should I try to refinance these loans? Should I start paying these loans ASAP and not wait until my grace period is up? Are there other resources out there that I don't know about?

I have a lot of questions and I really don't know where to find resources to answer them. Is there a calculator out there that I can just plug in numbers to? Do I need to talk to a financial adviser? Is the answer actually really simple?

personalfinance,FedLoan Servicing – change in amount due and auto debit seemingly removed?,"I have my student loans paid through FedLoan Servicing, am on a REPAYE plan, and have had the monthly amount debited from my bank account automatically. No problems so far, up until now.

A few days ago, the total monthly bill decreased by more than $100, but the auto debit feature showed as still being the same (right) monthly amount. I thought it was just a glitch of some kind, as the scheduled auto-debit showed the right/current amount. However, logging in today to check, it appears that the auto debit line on the main screen has been removed, and it just shows as the bill due (with the wrong lower amount).

My bill is due tomorrow (debits automatically on the 2nd, scheduled), and I'm completely lost as to whether or not FedLoan will debit my bank account, or if I'd have to pay it manually. I'm also unsure what happened. I can't call them as it's a Saturday, and tomorrow is a Sunday, so I'm concerned that there may be a ""double"" payment (the auto debit and if I end up paying the bill manually).

Bottom line – I'm confused, there's no way to contact FedLoan until Monday, and compound this with the upcoming holiday, and I don't want a bad mark on my credit report. I re-certified way back in March or so, and they adjusted the amount to what it was right before the weird decrease, so that can't be it. I also didn't get any notices of a lowered amount due monthly (via email or mail).

As I'm sure many of you know, the minimum for each index fund is $3000, and I'm willing to put that much into VTSMX and VFINX if it's a good move financially. I understand the risks associated with these funds, so I am equally open to portioning money into a safer alternative to offset instability from either one of those. 

Ideally, I'd be adding in money to my portfolio over the coming years. This investment is not short-term and I see no reason not for it to be long-term. These funds will stay there for *at least* 3-4 years. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,End of Lease Term - Overmilage - Advice Needed,"Hey there, long lurker here and there is always great advice given, posting from a throwaway. 

I am nearing the end term of a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude. V6 engine. In good condition, no accidents. A few scratches here in there but otherwise good. It also has a set of new tires purchased approximately 6 months ago. 

Here's the bad - due to a 60 mile round trip commute I had for three years my car is significantly over my allotted mile agreement per my lease. To the tune of approximately $8,000. 

The lease buy-out option is $18,400. 

To give you a quick background on my financial situation - I am a teacher/coach making approx. $70k per year. 

Not sure what my best option would be here. A couple of scenarios I'm considering:

1. Taking the buy-out. Stretching it over 6 years. Make payments towards my car now and hope to revisit this scenario in a year or two. 

2. Take out a loan for half of the mileage penalty. (I can borrow against my pension at a fairly low interest rate). Make a lump sum payment towards the mileage penalty and trying to roll the remaining penalty ($4k) into the lease of a new, inexpensive car. 

3. ???

Again, not sure what my best play is here, but if anyone has advice or knows of stories where car dealerships have eaten a significant portion of a mileage penalty, etc. etc. 

EDIT: 

*Commute is no longer 60 miles. I know have about a 10 mile round trip. 

*Kelly Blue Book Value of my car as others have noted is about 14k. 

*My car has 68,000 miles on it.

personalfinance,"Bank of Americard - If a card charges a certain APR, how can you calculate the monthly interest rate?","I'm very confused. My friend was bragging about the Cash Rewards he's obtained through using the card, and I told him that the higher interest rate negates most if not all of your rebate. He shrugged it off saying that it's pretty much like a regular credit card then so whatever. 

But the only way to truly know is to calculate your total expenditure, separate each expense in the tiered percentage (3% cashback for gas, 2% for groceries, 1% other), find out how much you're getting back total, and then factor in your monthly interest payment. 

But the card only has an APR rate despite the fact that he makes monthly payments. I'm just confused how this works. How can a bank charge an APR on a credit card if they don't even know how much your annual expenditure will be? I don't have one, but aren't you paying interest on every billing cycle? 

Let's say your total bill for a month before interest is $190.70. How can you calculate the interest on this?",finance
personalfinance,Keep paying on credit card or pay off with loan? Help with decision?,"So I have about 11k of debt attached to a discover card at 18.74% and I could potentially go through lending club and get a loan to pay it off at 11.74% after factoring for the loan origination fee.

The upside to continuing with discover payments which I am making at least double payments each month, is the fact that each month my minimum monthly goes down. This provides security in the event something happens in the ~two years it'll take to pay it off. 

If I go with the loan I have a lower interest rate but my payment is flat each month at a little under what I'm paying now.

Purely from a financial standpoint definitely go for the lower rate, right? I don't have any fears for my job but a lot could happen over the course of the next three years (duration of the LC loan.)

 My SO was in need of a car, so we had our bank put the loan of my old car in her name. I went out and got another vehicle. My SO wasn't too fond of the payment of $256, so she refinanced. I believe that there was $6100 left on the car. The term is 60 months, at $156/month. Looking back, this seems like a terrible idea. She put extra money down, but we're not sure if we're just paying the interest. What options do we have? It's a 2011 VW Jetta SEL, with 84,000 miles. There's $5700 left, and it's worth about $5300. I had a couple of ideas, but I'm not sure if they're foolish. 

1. Try to refinance a second time, at a higher payment with a lower term. 

2. Continue making extra payments, is it possible to pay the principle only? 

3. The vehicle has a couple of issues, and VWs are expensive to fix. It needs a new front right coil spring, and may need more routine maintenance as it ages. Should we attempt to get a newer, more reliable vehicle? Maybe take the difference in trade in to the face? Can it even be payed off in full like that?

personalfinance,Deeply addicted person needs advice on credit card debt,"Hi,

I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons. So, please pardon the brand new account.

I'm addicted to food. Like, I spend 90-100% of my income on food per month. I only get by because I have parents who are supporting me, and they don't know about this problem. They don't ask about my finances. I also only work part time, so I make about $900 a month. 

From my past addictive behaviors, I have taken about $5.3k in credit card debt (over 5 years). I am not in a position to pay this much money back.

When I was still eating a lot (I am better now, but still spending 80% of my income on junk food), I already tried the Chase balance transfer Slate card. So, I can't use that to help offset.

I have $5.3k in credit card debt.
I'm at about 90% credit utilization...
I can't balance transfer unless there's another card like Chase's.
My credit score is suffering. 

In order to stop some of the damage, should I take out a personal loan to open up some of the credit utilization? It would also be a lower interest rate (I'm about 20% on all my cards).

The only issue I have is that I'm worried I might use the ""extra space"" to spend even more.. 

I am working with a professional on my addiction problems. I'm just not 100% there yet.

personalfinance,Questions about consolidating debt and interest rates,"After more than a decade of living with a ton of credit card debt acquired when I was young and stupid, I finally have a good handle on things.  I have made a ton of progress, but have some specific questions about further consolidation.

Currently I have the following:

1) A debt consolidation loan with a balance of $9,000 at a rate of 8%.  The initial loan amount was $21k, and this loan will be paid off in September 2018.  The monthly payment is $675.
2) Two credit cards with balances totaling $12k.  These are currently on 0% promotional rates that end in January 2018.  I pay $100/each monthly on these cards.

I would like to get this debt paid down as fast as possible, spending a max of $900/month toward it.  I currently have an offer for another consolidation loan at 5.5% for 3 years.  I figure my options are:
A) Wait until I pay off the $675/month loan, then start putting that towards the credit cards.
B) Wait until I pay off the first loan, then take out another for the 12k credit card balance.
C) Take out the new loan now, just for the $12k.  This would have a payment of $350 a month and would increase my total payments to more than I'm comfortable with.
D) Take out the new loan for both the credit cards and the old loan.  This would have a payment of $650 for 3 years.

I'm not sure if rolling the current loan into a new loan is wise or not.  Even though the interest rate would be lower, I've only got a year left, and thus would be stretching that out an additional 2 years.  The advantage is one payment, then in 3 years ALL debt is gone (not counting student loans, but that's another story).  I could also keep playing the 0% promotional balance shuffle rather than consolidating at 5.5%, but that would require a lot of discipline and potentially fees.

Other relevant details: I currently have 5 months' expenses in savings which I'd prefer not to touch for this debt.  I typically save about $250 a month and my overall budget is very comfortable.

Any advice, including calculators or other resources to help me decide the best path, is greatly appreciated!",finance

I know I will be making around $2400/month after taxes beginning in August. 

I owe about $32,000 in student loans at the standard federal govt rate (7.5%? I think? I'll check when I'm not on mobile). 

Additionally I'm planning on buying a used car that costs less than $10,000 (Ford focus or similar). I have to buy a car for transportation to work (it's a non-negotiable--I work too far away from home to bike). 

So I guess I'm asking for advice on how I should target my student loans, whether I should invest some of the money, etc. I have an IRA but I haven't contributed any money to it since I started working overseas. 

The standard advice is target the loan with the highest interest rate, which I guess in this case is the student loan. But then how should I pay for the car? Should I put some money toward both? 

The third option: keep paying on the student loan for six more years and opt into the Federal Student Loan forgiveness program (for being a teacher in a public school--I taught in an American public school for four years before teaching overseas). But that's ~$600/month down the drain and I think I may ultimately pay more money in interest than I would pay if I just paid it off early.

personalfinance,27/M Buried Head In Sand - Time To Own Up,"Hey all,


So I'll spare you the sob story.  TL;DR version is started a small business, went great for two years.  Just long enough to have a brand new pickup and motorcycle.  Work went away, loans didn't.  Vehicles left via tow truck.


My wife and I got married last October and we both knew the other had some debt.  The finer details weren't discussed much, just vague amounts as to what we thought we owed.  We haven't made payments on much since December of 2015.  The only work I could find pretty well paid the bills, put some food on the table, but didn't leave room for much else.  Since we couldn't afford to pay on our debt, we just tucked our tails and ignored the phone calls.


We are now in a somewhat better position and want to make a plan to get our debt straightened out.  We both signed up for MyFICO this evening and got our reports with our debt listed.  We aren't sure of the interest rates on any of it at the moment but we now know we owe a total of ~$26,856.  


Here is a brief breakdown:
5 somewhat small accounts: $2,301
Student Loans: $10,072
Repoed Bike: $7,075
Repoed Pickup: $2,501
CC: $4,907


I'm now in a position to bring home between $3,200 and $5,000/month.  There is a lot of opportunity for overtime at the moment.  We don't have any real monthly bills aside from utilities, groceries, and cell phones.  I paid my vehicle insurance for 6 months and shouldn't have a payment there for another 4 months.


Here is another (potentially) important tidbit of information.  My wife and I own our home, free and clear.  We have 6.5 acres and a large mobile home.  The land and home would probably appraise for around $145,000 or so.  The older pickup I'm driving is paid for.


Here is the downside.  The home needs a brand new HVAC system, septic system, and probably a new roof in the next year or two.  My pickup is a 2003 and is very hard on gas.  Probably $80-120/week hard on gas.  It may be time to trade for something smaller since we live around 30 minutes from work and town with a grocery store.  I do like the fact that I know the previous owner and have a very good idea of the maintenance history.  I know I shouldn't have any major issues for a good while but there will always be minor repairs.  


We have 0 savings right now.


I really HATE the idea of borrowing money against a home that is free and clear but is this a viable option?  Or would that depend upon the interest rates?  


We would really like get focused and pay this all off in the next two years.  I know it's a lot but I also know if I work 6 days a week and manage to bring home at least $4,000/month, it's a real possibility.  Should we let this go another month or two to try to get the HVAC or septic straightened around before we start setting up payment plans?


Are there any specific things we should do when speaking to debtors?  Should we ask for some sort of paper trail or proof of debt for everything?  Should we maybe even save as much as possible a month at a time and then call and negotiate what we pay?  


We could really use some guidance here.  Any and all input is greatly appreciated!  Thank you!",finance

* Loan 2 $8035.33 at 4.04% amount due $82.47

* Loan 4 $1032.19 at 3.51% amount due $10.34
* Total Minimum Monthly payment $196.72 (I intent to pay $210 a month as of right now)

Should I pay off loan(s) 3 and/or 4 right here, right now since I have the funds in the bank to do so? With $4000~ in checkings accounts and $2000 in a savings account, this would effectively use up 2/3 of all my current cash.

The couple reasons that I can think of as to why I shouldn't do this is because it simply isn't worth the huge cut in my savings just to save $70~ a year on two low interest and low principle loans. I'm guessing it would make more sense to do this with one of the two larger loans (if I had the funds to do so) In addition, I have no credit history (I was just approved for my first credit card a week ago, which hasn't even arrived from the mail yet).

The difference is that you can let the borrowed amount continue to accrue interest while you wait for your stocks or ETFs to rise in value, perhaps even for 10 years or so. You can't go 10 years without withdrawing money from a retirement account.

These loans are guaranteed for us to receive; in other words, its money that we **know** we will have coming. So, that leaves me with an extra $25k that will be going directly to me as a reimbursement (of my own money, ultimately, that I will have to pay back when I graduate). 

The problem is that all of the loan money disperses the first day of school, but I'm moving and spending a lot of money before then. 

Luckily, I've been building my credit during undergrad in anticipation of this. I have a decent (≈740) FICO score and was able to snag the Chase Freedom card with 0% APR for 15 months and the 15,000 point intro if you put $500 on the card in the first 3 months (which I've done). $2,500 credit line.

I plan on putting these up-front living expense costs (save for rent, which has to be cash but I have that saved up) on the Chase card and making minimum payments until I get my loan reimbursement next month. Then, I'll definitely be able to pay the card off in full. FWIW, I'll probably end up only putting about $750 on the card max.

I never keep balances on my cards, but with 0% APR till *next* September it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, especially given the circumstances. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,"Considering buy a $14,000 car. Should I?","Hi all.  Currently 22 years old, living with parents for now and bring home $3,100 after tax a month. 

**Current Situation:**

$13k in student loan debt with an interest rate of 3.7%
$9k in savings
$3.5k in personal investment fund

**Monthly Budget/Expenses:**

Paying at least $1,500 toward student loans a month (June I paid $2,250, May I paid $1,950)
Adding at least $300 a month to investment fund
$35 a month for parking at the train station
$75 a month in gas
$100 in personal care/hygiene (haircuts, etc)
Not super strict with any of my other expenses.  

**Car Situation:**

Currently driving a 1998 F-150 with 107k miles.  Just got quoted to fix front suspension at $1,500.  It doesn't feel like I should do the repair since I could only probably sell the car for $1k - $2k at this point. Looking to buy a 2014 Ford Fusion from CarMax priced at $14k.  I will probably put $4k down and finance the rest.  CarMax estimates my rate to be between 4% and 8% given my credit score, but I can probably get cheaper financing through Chase or a credit union.  

Although the truck has done me well, it feels like every 2 months something new pops up.  Additionally, I have a girlfriend/friends living about an hour away and don't feel comfortable taking the truck on the highway.  This will likely be my only longish drive - I drive about 5 minutes to the train station to get to work everyday. 

Honestly, I feel like I can afford the car, expecting a $200 monthly payment, however emotionally I feel like it is a bad idea to take out a car loan while still having student loan debt.  My goal was to have the loan debt paid off by January 2018 and to move to Chicago, a high cost of living city, by April 2018.  I might just be over thinking this but I feel like financing a car could throw a wrench into the mix.  

Any advice?  First time ever financing or buying a newer used car.",finance

The job I have now pays well, but it's new, and I'm factoring in the chance of losing that job. I could pay the car in full now, but rather than paying a huge chunk I'd rather see how I'm doing 1-2 years from now.

This is my first car purchase, and from what I'm reading interest rates may climb substantially when getting a long loan. So I guess the plan would be to get the longest term possible without seeing the huge jump in interest. What I'm concerned about, is that I read where you can run into issues with loans that do not allow you to pay it off early, or you'll have to pay the full amount w/ the totaled interests. 

What are things to look out for to avoid that? How can I be sure that I am getting a loan for say 60 months, that will allow me to pay it off completely say next year- should I feel comfortable enough to without the interest fees?",finance

Currently going into third year of college, but I only have loans from my first year (about 6k) because I went into the military and started using a free tuition program. This doesn't need to be touched until I graduate college, so as far as I know it's not negatively impacting my credit score.  I've been trying to do some research into credit cards as to what would be the best for me starting out, but I'm having issues really seeing what's considered good and what's considered something that companies just do to get someone to sign up but it's not great later on. Parents (mom/step dad) are not too much help other than ""don't run them up"". Step dad is also military, so his suggestions for who to go through have been Navy Federal or Chase. I remember as a kid my dad would swear by Discover, but I'm not sure if it's still an 'awesome' card or not. I know up where I'm at (rural NY) it'd be iffy to use, as not many places unless it's a chain would take it.

Again, I'm not too sure what's important when getting a card. I've gone through some of those card comparison websites, but I'm not sure what I'm looking at. My main plan for the card would be pay for gas and then pay it off when the bill comes around, or for any major emergency that my emergency fund couldn't handle. Suggestions as to what cards would be good for starting out, or even just things to look for while using comparison sites would be highly appreciated.

Tl;dr : I want to keep building my credit and a credit card would be the route I'm taking. I'm a college student and a member of the military and I have no idea what is considered a good credit card. Send knowledge please.",finance

personalfinance,Medical student tired of car issues - Do I spend a little more and lease?,"I'm a medical student and just finished up my second year.  I've already gone through one car on top of another somewhat costly radiator repair recently on the second car that i bought to replace the last one.
  
It's just really inconvenient to have to try to figure out how and when to get a car to a shop on top of school, carpooling, etc.  I don't live close enough to walk or bike because **I live with my parents to save money**.  

My only debt consists of federal student loans which is my main source of living expense money.  I have side income through a couple side things I do, but these are irregular and so I don't really count on them.... I would say on average, they would get close to covering the cost of a lease + rise in insurance I would see on a new vehicle.  
  
There is an offer for a **$0 down, no security deposit, no doc fee, no first payment, 36 month/10,000 mile, $99/month lease**.  I won't come anywhere close to 10,000 miles.  
  
  
I am very much so financially responsible.  My phone bill is $13, I eat out less than once per week, my gym is ""free"" through the school, I go out to drink less than once per month, I drink overall less than twice per month, etc.  I'm doing worlds better than a lot of my classmates.  
  
I'm not saying that my current car can't be good.  I have had it since last fall and this is the first issue, but the biggest perk to me about leasing is that, yes, i'm paying a little bit more per month than I would be if I took the purchase price of my current car over 36 months, but I have a lot of peace of mind that I'll never have a big repair bill to have to foot at my current interest rate of 6.8% (yep, thanks Feds)
  
Going to contact my insurance company to see how much my premiums would increase, but I'm definitely leaning more towards the lease than not right now.  I would trade my car in to preferably just get a lump sum for it or, less preferably, decrease my monthly payment (my thought is if it's decreased monthly payment, they're holding part of my value over the 36 months without paying me interest whereas my lump sum would prevent me from having to take out as many student loans and thus be better)

personalfinance,Tackling my debt once and for all,"I just got a promotion that is going to help substantially in terms of paying off debt and building my savings.

I currently have around $5,600 in collections, all from medical bills and I’m wanting to get these paid down as quickly as possible. I will be able to contribute $1,000 a month towards paying these off.

I’m looking for advice on plan I have come up with:

Take out a loan against my 401(k) for $2,700 at 5.25% with a $175 establishment fee for a 24 month term. This would put me at $54.75 per check to pay back.

I would take this and work with all the collectors to settle for as low as I can get as soon as possible with the loan and then each month put the $1,000 budgeted towards paying off the rest. The goal is to have this take 2-4 months. 3.5 months if I can’t settle on any of them.

Once all collections are paid off, I read somewhere that you can now petition to have medical related items removed from your record. I would then move the $1,000 budgeted to pay off my 401(k) loan within 2 and a half months.

From there, I would make an extra payment towards my car of $500 a month and then add an additional $500 into savings, increasing monthly savings from $300 to $800. The remaining balance on my car is $19,000 and the car is actually worth $13,000. The loan is currently at 18% interest. I’m 100% current with my car loan, but the fact that I have the 18% interest and barely touch principal, I want to get the principal at or under what the car is worth so I can be ahead a little.

I’m in the process of trying to refinance through my credit union where I don’t care if I reduce my $500/mo payment but I really would like to reduce my interest rate.

Once I’m ahead of my loan, I would then look at trading it in if I could get an even lower interest rate and monthly payment.

I’m going to be 30 next April and have been struggling with a lot of medical bills since I was 24 and finally at a point where I feel I can finally take care of all of this.

I can fix my 20 year old car with 120k miles for about $1000 and pay off my loans today but would have no assurance that the car will last me very long. In theory if I were to put about $1k into keeping my old car running until its next inspection or major failure, (it's a camry which I've only had a few issues with) I would be able to pay off my loans today and stop accruing interest on them, then save up for a year to by a used car in cash.

gaming,Tips for surviving Master difficulty in BOTW,"I posted this in the BOTW subreddit as well, but here are some of my tips for Master difficulty

1. Enemies regen health, FAST. I haven’t actually timed it but basically all enemies begin regaining health unless you follow up the combo IMMEDIATELY.

2. All enemies are one level stronger, meaning all red enemies in normal mode are now blue, and so on. This means they have a lot more health, so your weapons will be breaking more often as you’re using them more.

3. USE SNEAK ATTACKS. A sneak attack with a tree branch on a blue bokoblin has the power to damage it by about half of its health, saving time and weapon durability. To sneak press down the left stick and tilt the stick half way in the direction you want to move. You generally never want to move at full speed when sneaking unless you have all sheikah armor.

4. Pick your fights. Always before you fight make sure you have enough weapons/ammo to kill the enemies and always have a contingency plan, whether that be heals or escape.  I’ve found it takes about 1.5-2 boko clubs to kill a blue bokoblin, if that helps.

And finally,
5. ALWAYS BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS!!! This is by far the most important tip. Be aware of where you’re going and where you’ve been. Listen for audio cues. The thing I’ve found that best helps with this is to turn HUD mode to pro, because it forces you to listen and become aware instead of relying on a minimap. The world is now different.

5A. THERE ARE WHITE MANE LYNELS IN THE GREAT PLATEAU! An easy way to tell if a lynel is remotely nearby is to listen. Lynels roar. A lot. And their roar is very loud and extends past the range that they can hear. If you hear a roar, immediately begin scanning the area to make sure you don’t walk into a fight with a one-way ticket to hell.

6. Use Magnesis as a weapon. Blue bokos are no match for a giant metal box. A good hit and you can one shot a blue boko. This is good for when you have no weapons because a giant box will surely grab their attention.

u/snablis also added: ""Only got one tip: get those flying treasures! 

Weapons break fast when all the enemies are one level higher. This is compensated by giving high durability weapons and other neat buffs through those extra treasures. 

The buffed weapons are NOT in the normal treasures or the weapons used by the enemies.""

economy,Who Would Win - Universal Basic Income vs Universal Basic Math,"**hint: it's math**

So there are about 325 million people in the United States. Just to keep the math simple, let's call that 300 million. What would a good UBI be? Call it $10k? Well that's $3 trillion dollars. 

For those who don't keep track of such things, the total [federal budget](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/federal-receipt-and-outlay-summary) is about $3.7 trillion. Not including Social Security and Medicare, $700 billion is spent on [Welfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States#Congressional_funding). So, you'd increase the federal budget to $6 trillion. That's a 62% increase. 

That money has to come from somewhere. And even if you increased federal tax revenues by 62%, you'd still be increasing the federal deficit because [revenues are currently less than expenditures](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/federal-receipt-and-outlay-summary). So to stay deficit neutral, you'd have to increase federal taxes by 71%.

So clearly $10k per person is too much. So let's make it $5k. Well, that's a little more realistic. It's *only* $1.5 trillion. Once again deducting the savings of $700 billion and you're *only* adding $800 billion to expenditures. (To put that in perspective, free college would cost something like $200 billion.)

See, here's the problem: There are about [100 million Americans](http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/terence-p-jeffrey/354-percent-109631000-welfare) currently on Federal Welfare (not counting SS or Medicare). They currently receive about $700 billion in aid. So that comes out to about $7k per person. Even if we say, what the hell, $50 billion of that is spent on government overhead, which is crazy when you consider [education is $70 billion](https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/), but what the hell, I'll give you $50 billion in government overhead. That just knocks it down to $650 billion spread over 100 million which comes out to $6.5k per person. Still more than the $5k UBI. And $800 billion less expensive.

So here, let me some this up nicely for you: UBI would increase taxes dramatically and cut benefits to the poor. 

If there's something I'm missing, be sure to let me know in the comments --as rudely as humanly possible Im sure-- so I can correct my post. Cheers!",finance

I'm currently paying back $350 per month to the loan and aiming for $500 per month to the credit card, though I've fallen on a few difficult months recently ($2,000 in car repairs for example) which have made this hard and made the debt situation worse.

I currently earn $60,000 a year before tax (due to be raised to $65,000 a year in October), so I take home a bit under $4,000 a month.

Currently my rent is at $1160 a month (though I'm looking to get a roommate, at the latest that'll happen next year). 

Utilities and other bills are at:

$40 on mobile phone per month

$200 on electricity per month

$50 per quarter on water

$50 per month on internet

$120 on food per month

$220 per month car payments

$100 per month on petrol

My biggest expense at the moment is hockey, which I'm trying to drop the expenditure on. Frankly though, it's a vice and I've been depressed for a long time, so it's something that keeps me sane because my work life is miserable and I have no friends outside of hockey, so it's hard to consider giving up. This overshadows everything else and I spend around $600 a quarter on it. I can probably halve that though, and from reading the above, I should.

Currently just looking for any sort of advice that can be offered. I'm aware that this is going to take a long time to work myself out of, and sacrifice, I would just appreciate any assistance.

If I've missed any information that's important, let me know.

Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,"Getting $30k soon, not sure what to do with it","I am getting $30k via what is basically an inheritance soon, and I'm not exactly sure how to I should handle it. I can either almost pay off my vehicle, pay off my student loans in their entirety with the money, or I was thinking about paying ~20k on one of the debts and having the rest as an emergency fund. 

Details:  

I owe around 32k on my vehicle, and 30k on my student loans. If i dump it on the vehicle, I can pay it off completely 4 or 5 months afterwards. The student loan debt would be wiped clean. 
As far as dollars go, I come out better paying the loans off when you factor in interest and the length of each loan. But, the car payment is $200 higher than my loan payment, so paying the car off would provide me with a little more income flexibility for saving.

Another option I was thinking about is saving 10k for an emergency fund, paying off all of my student loans that are higher interest than the car's interest rate, then putting the rest down on the car. Or, i could just nuke the car's balance as much as possible and at least get a lower readjusted payment. My student loans are all through the same servicer, and are technically about 12 different smaller loans each with their own interest rate wrapped up into one payment. 

Right now I have about 1k left over each month after all of my bills, food and gas, but haven't been saving like I should.

personalfinance,Does it make sense to have my parents pay off my law school debt and subtract that amount from my inheritance?,"I will try to keep this away from legal as this isn't the /r/legaladvice, but I suspect basic gift tax stuff will be in play.

I owe approx. $197,000 in law school debt (170k principal + 27k interest). These are federal loans and I am currently paying $450/month on PAYE, with about 15 months of PSLF-qualifying payments under my belt. In the near future, my contract will be up, and it is not clear whether I will end up in the private sector or obtain another position where I can make PSLF-qualifying payments. At some point the burden and uncertainty of the debt load has started getting to me, so I've been playing around with the idea of having my parents pay off my law school debt and take it out of my inheritance. This would be particularly nice because it would free up money to start attacking my wife's student loans (which are not a part of this plan). Not sure it makes sense, so I wanted to throw around the idea here.

I have six federal loans, Stafford and Grad PLUS. The Stafford are:

* $23k at 5.16%
* $22k at 5.96%
* $25k at 6.55%

The Grad PLUS are:

* $35k at 6.16%
* $33k at 6.96%
* $32k at 7.65%

So a payoff date of 8/1/17 would be $198k and change.

Now there is no doubt that this deal is advantageous to me, as my parents would end up getting nothing out of it and would have to withdraw the money from a DROP. When we were spitballing the idea they thought that would take their tax bracket from 25% to 33%, but I would have to double-check those numbers because they were off the cuff. Second, they have retirement money saved up (they're actually retired now), but this would shortchange them $200k if healthcare expenses ended up way higher than they anticipate. Still, given that they're planning on giving me more than $200,000 as a part of their estate, it's a risk we're willing to take. We've also planned on creating a sort of kickback trust where I could start throwing money back into a trust for their use during their lifetimes (up to $200,000) that would come back to me after their deaths. Not looking for legal advice as to how to set that up; just mentioning it because it somewhat mitigates the problem of potential unexpected healthcare costs.

There are a couple things I don't know. I am not very familiar with the gift tax, so I don't know if they would end up paying taxes on the gifted amount above $28,000 (so $198,000 - $28,000 = somewhere around $170,000 above the annual gift tax exclusion amount) or if they'd only have to worry about pulling the money out of the DROP. Since I don't know my future employment, I also don't know the total amount I will end up paying with PAYE across the 20-year term. Looking at my exit counseling numbers and assuming I would remain at the same salary as I currently have, it looks like I would pay:

1. Interest of $121k and change in interest across 20 years because of payments at $500/month; plus

2. Additionally, whatever the tax bomb is on a projected loan forgiveness of approx. $300,000 (at 25% that's $75k for the tax bomb, but I don't know what the taxable rate will be).

That puts me at about $200,000 that I would pay across the 20 years. There are a couple more factors in play, however.

A. My current salary will probably increase. It will almost certainly increase if I have my parents pay off the debt, because it will take away my incentive to go after a government/non-profit position for PSLF. Because my salary will increase, I will end up making higher monthly payments.

B. My law school has a program that shoulders the burden of loans for up to 10 years. The amount the law school pays per month is based on the annual salary, with the law school taking 100% of the burden for a $50k salary and diminishing its aid until you get to $90k, where you're completely on your own. That means that the law school will pay my monthly payments for half of my debt period, reducing the $121k I will pay over the 20 years of the debt period. Again, no hard figure here because as I make more means the more I pay (obviously).

This has been a bit rambly, so if I can clear anything up, please ask. 

TL;DR My basic questions is whether it makes sense to get this debt knocked out now given the uncertainty of my future position (and, frankly, getting ahead of an uncertain student loan bubble). The counter-consideration is my parents drawing out that money now. Also, if anyone knows whether they'll have to pay on the gift tax *now* let me know. Don't really know how that works (note: assume they're not giving me anything near $5.xx million as a part of their estate).",finance
personalfinance,High Interest Auto Loan Options,"Hi all! I wanted to see what options I have for my high interest auto loan.
When I graduated college I got a job making a fair amount. The car I had been using through college finally died and I so with my increased income I thought my first post-college big purchase should be a car.    

I bought a new car for ~$25,000, but got skewered on the interest rate. Being fresh out of college and not having much of a credit history and a score that was poor (580, had a medical bill in collections for quite some time without knowing since the bill was sent to parents address as I was in college). I got slapped with 13.3% interest for 75moths. Being younger and less experienced in personal finance I thought this to be fine since I knew I could afford the monthly minimum ($495).  

I paid the monthly minimum and worked to pay off my student loans. Paid off two of those (@ ~7%) and was feeling accomplished until I started tracking the rest of my debt. I soon realized that at my high interest rate for my car loan I had barely made a dent in it.  

Coming up on two years in August I still owe ~19,000 on my car. I added the amount I was paying toward my paid off student loan to the car payment and at this rate I'll pay the car off in 3 years instead of 5. I've already lost a significant amount to interest and will lose ~$4,000 more by the end of the loan.  

At this point what options do I have ? 
 
Here are some of the thoughts I had:  

1) refinance the loan. This has seems to be an issue as my credit score is poor.  

2) sell the car. I thought this option to be the best but with a big caveat. The cars value is only at 15,000 which leaves me with still 4,000 owed. I could try to roll that into a short term lease or finance a used car, still giving me a vehicle to use, and would most likely decrease the total cost to me, but with a low credit score my monthly payment still may be high.  

3) stick out the loan and try to push more money to the loan to aggressively get rid of it.  

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. If you need anymore information let me know.  

Thanks!

EDIT: Updated option 2 to include financing a used card. Family friend's lease is up in Aug, buyout price is 12,000 and car has 50k on it. I could roll the excess of my loan into this and get a lower interest rate and pay it off in the same 36 month period to save money and still have a vehicle owned at the end. Or possibly do this with another vehicle that could be cheaper, just used family friend as an example.",finance

personalfinance,My Car Buying Story (Hope this will help someone in the future),"Hi /r/personalfinance, I just bought a car and I wanted to thank you all. The advice represented in this sub was invaluable, and I've been able to take the info here and disseminate it to my sister and brother-in-law who were also looking for new cars.

Here are the major points I applied that helped me buy a car:

1. Do your research

After receiving a check from Nationwide due to a total loss on my last car and taking $1000 from savings and receiving a $2000 gift from my wife's grandparents we had a $6000 down payment.

We knew we wanted a crossover SUV for our little family, and we set our budget at $10,000. But after shopping around we weren't able to find a car we could agree on for that amount of money, so we switched gears and looked at our budget and found out what we could afford. We adjusted our budget up a little bit and then found a car make and model we liked, and then started pricing.

This car, with trims and mileage and year averaged between $15,000 and $20,000 (older, more miles = cheaper, newer, less miles = more $$$). We opted for older and cheaper.

Here's what we found out at most dealerships that we went to: most dealerships are putting up ""No Hassle"" or ""No Haggle"" pricing. Especially CarMax. The guy we bought from said the only way to get a cheaper price was to work there.

Some places may still haggle. Just do research online, and don't only look at KBB.com, check out a few other places. Info is power, and the more ammo you have on the lot the less the seller will try to BS you.

2. Rebuilt Titles

Another way to get a cheaper price is to get a ""Rebuilt Title"". I'd advise against this. Rebuilt Titles typically cut 20-40% off the price. A 2016 Mazda CX-5 Touring with 3100 miles on it had flood damage and was priced just under $15k. With a clean title it would cost $22k-$25k. Your insurance company may not insure it, or worse, insure it and charge exorbitantly. 

I asked my insurance company (State Farm) and they said they'd insure it, but would suggest getting complete comprehensive coverage full package primo $$$ coverage. The upfront savings was offset by the monthly payments I'd make to insurance for the life of the car.

And in addition to walking on egg shells with insurance, good luck finding someone to finance it for you, besides the dealer (who will try to rip you a new one). I don't care how nice your dealer is, they have to make money too, so depend on getting a few extra % points added to that interest (even without a rebuilt title they'll try to do this). Which leads me to...

3. Outside Financing

Find on this subreddit how to get your credit score. You can do it for free once or twice a year I think. Then start going to banks, federal credit unions, and even dealerships. Tell them your credit score and ask them what kind of loan you can expect.

Ideally you wouldn't need a loan and you could pull from your immense wealth to pay cash up front and haggle price down, but Bob said the time's they are a changing.

Do your research and pit likewise competitors against each other. ""Well, Bank A said they'd give me X rate. Can you meet or beat that?""

Case in point: We decided to try to go to a federal credit union because we don't have fantastic credit. They have excellent investment programs for us and for our kids, we can get decent credit cards from them, and they typically give stellar loans with great rates to first time buyers.

We go in, they run our credit to make sure we aren't lying about our credit, and they can give us up to $16K for 60 months at 6.74%. We say, ""Okay, well, we were hoping for a lower interest rate. Maybe we'll check out the credit union across town. They typically give better rates. Remember Sally? She got like a sub 3% loan a month ago...""

They folded and promised us a 3.25% interest rate for the same loan. We kept shopping around and most other places were going to give us a similar 6-7% interest rate, but would only come down to a 5% interest rate.

4. Do not try to live outside your means

We picked our car because it fit our needs, and found out that in our budget, it fit a few of our wants. Most cars now a days have bluetooth handsfree capabilities. I don't want to pay extra for that, but it's included in most newer cars. Sometimes the things that used to be a luxury now come standard.

However, the more bells and whistles the less latitude you have every month. Every little thing is going to add up to a higher monthly payment because they increase the seller's value of the car. That's less money you have to put into retirement, 529's for your kids, savings, vacation funds, christmas clubs. This sounds like common sense, so that's why I'm saying it. When you sit in the car and the dealer turns up the stereo, says connect your phone, gee isn't that convenient? How does the car look? Open the moon roof! Hit the gas! Drive a windy road! Did you adjust the lumbar support?

Money affords convenience, but don't buy in to the seller's tactics of making you visualize your best life now in this car. That rebuilt title Mazda? I test-drove that car on a highway that dead ended into an incredibly nice neighborhood. Turns out that a ton of Nascar drivers live in this neighborhood, so every driveway had either huge tricked out trucks or nice sports cars. Nice manicured lawns, nice houses, and all I did was follow the directions from the seller because I didn't want to get lost in a new city. I was visualizing that my life could be better if I just had this car.

On the way back I realized how stupid I was and bid adieu to what could have been a great car, but was likely a bad deal with a bad title.

I've seen people argue not to worry about low monthly payments, just haggle down the price of the car. Maybe try to haggle down the price, but like I said above, most places are cutting that out. Start with your budget and see what you can cut, and see what you can afford in monthly payments.

Got a gym membership you don't use? Cut it out.
Eat a lot of fast food? Cut it out.
Do a lot of online shopping? Cut it out.
Got a new baby? Resale shops, and for Pete's sake get a food processor, not a baby food maker. They cost the same and you can use the food processor to make baby food AND nice pesto bases!!!

Your car payment will occupy a space on your financial pie chart; there's only so much room. Is having the nicer engine really worth not being able to go out with friends once a month?

5. Other stuff

A. Craigslist can be bad. But it can also be good! With the plethora of online pricing thingamabobs most people will try to sell you a car for retail value because ""that's what KBB said!"" They may haggle, they may not. Have some money set aside and ask to split the cost of a mechanic to do a full diagnostic on the car. If they say no, walk away. Be prepared if they say yes. Be sure to get estimates for everything that needs to be fixed. Also, be sure you trust the mechanic and know them.

B. Buyer's Orders. We bought our car thru Carmax, but are going to finance thru a FCU. So we put down our down payment, and financed thru Carmax. We'll take the Buyer's Order (a line by line explanation of what everything cost, from dealer's fees, tax, tag, and title, and other stuff) to our FCU, they'll review everything and then cut us a check to pay off Carmax.

Apparently this is standard operating procedure with outside financing, but it was news to me. So in hopes of educating someone else and alleviating any fears with making a big purchase - relax. This is standard operating procedure when buying a car.

C. Refinancing. If your loan has a bad interest rate because you have bad credit, go to a bank/federal credit union and see about getting a decent rewards credit card. Typically your lender will let you refinance in 6-12 months if you start to use another of their products - I mentioned the credit card because it will help you build credit; our lender said we could refinance if we opened up a christmas club account. Just make sure not to miss any payments ever, and soon you'll be on your way to refinancing.

personalfinance,In debt and clueless...,"I'm currently overwhelmed with debt. I'm going to try to include all information I think you guys would need for some good advice. This post might be long, but I like to be thorough so bear with me, and thank you in advance!

I'm in my mid 20's. I live in Ohio. I started out with one credit card with a low limit, and swore to never use it unless it was an emergency. Slowly within 3 years I managed to obtain about 7-8 credit cards all with limits of 2-4 thousand dollars, and my credit was at a glorious 740+... now my credit is about 540.

Shit started happening. I started losing hours at my job - would use the credit cards for groceries... car kept breaking down...would use the credit cards for repairs... I was forced into moving so a credit card was used for the moving truck, new furniture, all kinds of new house things I wasn't able to avoid or afford... and then I had a lot of ""unnecessary"" expenses.... Mcdonalds... ps4... etc things that just added up. Some cards are maxed out, some cards got high utilization and shut down/sent to collections... I have one card open that I'm paying down to keep open. 

I'm unsure of the total. I have a rough estimate of around $10,000-$13,000 in credit card debt.

I also went to a trade school within the past couple years and I believe I have about $8,000 in student loans that I have not reached that period I have to pay them.

So it seems I have a maximum of about $20,000 in debt all together.

I only just got started in my current career. I'm in week 3 - it seems this place is stable, but I don't want to just assume that - last place I was at booted me after 3 weeks for very illegitimate reasons so I'm not going to trust things to be concrete quite yet.

I make $13 an hour. There's an offer for benefits, I'm not taking them. I don't pay for health insurance outside of work. 

I'm in a situation where I only have to pay about half of all the bills - I have roommates but I'd like to branch off on my own eventually, once I get my money more stable. 

I'm behind on payments for most of my cards. I was out of work for a few months and when I had money, I either had to pay the electric/get food or put a payment on my credit card... I chose to keep my utilities up and feed myself.

Even at $13 an hour I feel I don't make enough to support my bills, and make payments on these cards/loans to rid them in decent time. Not with the interest rates and everything. Not with the possibility of losing ""the other half"" of the bills being paid at any given time. 

I'm currently working on the ""lowest card first"" situation... however as I get up to the 2k-5k cards, it's just going to take a very long time to pay off, and I won't be able to keep up with the interest. 

I've looked into the various cards ""Get back on track"" program, but it seems like they aren't going to help - they just get you back into the habit of paying on time, while your interest is still developing.

I have a couple cards in collections, and probably a couple on the way.

I fucked up. I'm really ashamed and overwhelmed, and it has taken me several months to come to this sub for advice.

my finances are OK: great credit score, no consumer debt, some federal student loan debt. retirement savings are in good shape, but i'm behind on cash savings (about $10K, essentially an emergency fund). my partner has good credit, zero debt, more savings than me. our combined household income is under $150K, which feels low relative to our peers and the cost of living here.

parents could help us with a down payment, but if we want to live in San Francisco or Oakland, we're still looking at the biggest loan that our current incomes can support.

it's kind of bewildering that we could conceivably buy a house with our current incomes (and parents' help). the idea of possibly doubling our current monthly outlay (after insurance, HOAs, taxes, etc.) seems completely insane to me. i don't know how that would work unless i put savings (including retirement savings) completely on hold until our incomes catch up.

my options, as i see them:
1. buy something in the near future and be ""house poor"" until our incomes catch up
2. try to be more frugal, save more systematically, wait for our incomes to rise, maybe buy when we're 40, and hope that we can remain in our current rental indefinitely
3. relocate someplace cheaper (i.e., outside of the bay area, and probably california altogether)

the questions i'm grappling with: if we wait, what are the pros/cons of taking on a home loan in our forties (which seems 'late' to me)? if we make a move sooner, how normal is it to push your net income to the breaking point for the sake of homeownership?",finance
personalfinance,24k car while making 85k?,"Hello everyone!

I need help budgeting for a car. I have been to a dealership and I was looking at a used 4 year old Lexus which is going to cost me about 23k. I want to put down about 6k and finance the rest at around 2% interest rate for 4 to 5 years. Lexus do hold their value pretty well and I always wanted to buy a Lexus (I don't need to). It will depend a lot on the answers I get here though.

I make 85k per year including taxes and live in the state of Illinois. My take home pay is $4650/month and I have around 24k saved up. Also to be noted is that I get W2 every year and I have NOT adjusted federal tax withholding to be just barely enough that I don't get a refund at the end of the year.

Here are my monthly expenses  
House Mortgage - $1500  
Bills and mandatory expenses - $800  
Leisure expenses - $500 to $1000 (It really varies)  
So that's a **total of $2800 to $3300** in my monthly expenses  

Is my decision right to buy a 23k car and pay it over 48 to 60 months? I want to be able to save something every month while enjoying my new car. I definitely do not want to be a hand to mouth kind of person. If that's not a good budget, then what kind of range my car should be in?

Please let me know what you guys think. Thanks!",finance

I went on SigFig and they suggested [something like this investment allocation](http://i.imgur.com/VYKg3CS.png). But having read thru the wiki on r/pf, the expense ratio looks high. 

Some potentially stupid questions:

* How much of a full house's value is it recommended you own (e.g. if the house is $1M, 250K? 500K minimum?) before you bid on it? Why?

* Is the ratio above generally good? How should I go about calculating how much I should save/contribute per month to get the minimum amount required for bidding on a condo (see question above)?

* Are Muni bonds worth looking into in California (and thus in the above mix)?

* Other than increasing my income through other revenue sources (already thinking about that, e.g. tutoring), anything else I should consider doing?",finance

personalfinance,Should I trade in my car for a plug in hybrid?,"I currently have a 2015 focus st. I have offers for 15.5k from a local dealer on it, I owe 16k and the car has 35,500 miles. When I went in for the appraisal I saw the Chevy Volt plug in hybrid and was wondering if it made financial sense. 

With the Volt I was told I would get a $7500 federal and $5000 state tax credit. The tax credit only applies to new purchases. That would take the total cost to under 20k for the base model. That's for a new car with significantly better gas mileage. 

Currently my monthly payment is $330 for my car (72mths 0% apt). I'm not sure if the potential gas savings offset the temporarily increased monthly until the tax credit kicks in. 

I'm torn because I currently have a pretty low payment but my car is expensive to operate (insurance, gas, tires) and I am sick of driving manual as I spend a lot of time in traffic. I don't want to get in over my head for the illusion of long term savings. Lastly, I really like the idea of a plug in hybrid with the tax credit.

personalfinance,"Reached $1 million. No windfalls, slow and steady wins the race.","I just wanted to say that everybody here on /r/personalfinance is really great.  I think the tips and advice given here really does help a lot of people from all walks of life.  This past weekend I roughly added up all my assets (minus liabilities) and was pleasantly surprised that my total net assets were well over a million.  I've always had the goal of getting to $1 million in my first 10 years of working.  Being a doctor kind of slows your younger years financial planning due to the decade-plus of higher education and training,... not to mention student loans.  Not sure why $1 million specifically was a goal,... other than the nice round number of it,... but it's reached.  My long term goal is $1 million into the retirement fund every decade which I think should be pretty easy at this point barring some disaster.

If anybody is interested I outlined some aspects of my life and philosophy that I think is responsible for this accomplishment.

*  Be goal oriented.

*  Work hard toward your goals.

*  Invest in yourself.  Education, reading, training, experience, networking, and hobbies.

*  Don't spend more than what you make/have.  This is true regardless of income.  I save roughly 50% of  my post tax income.  Even when I was in college I never spent more money than I had in my bank account.

*  Pay off your credit cards fully at the end of the month.

*  Hang around with smart people.  If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room.

*  Don't be (close) friends with people who are self destructive.  I think at a subconscious level the behavior of our peers does influence us to a certain degree.

*  Have hobbies outside of your line of work.  Continue to pick up new hobbies and skills.  Don't stagnate.

*  Like your job.  Doesn't mean you have to necessarily like going in every Monday morning.  But if you absolutely hate your work 100% time, you really need to rethink the career choice.

*  Be realistic.  Everyone says you should be optimistic,... but in all honesty I think a healthy dose of realism is the best.  You may like art, but unless you really have the talent of Da Vinci, getting that bachelors in Art is probably not going to pay off.

*  Be relatively healthy.  Take care of your body.  You don't have to be a health nut but try to eat healthy, a few hours of exercise per week, and don't do drugs (more on this below).

*  I know this is going to be controversial,... but I'm going to say it.  Don't do drugs (legal or otherwise).  Not because they are evil, ethically wrong, or some morality BS,... but rather because I have never seen drugs (which includes excessive alcohol) improve people's lives and I have seen it destroy many.  They are typically expensive ""hobbies"" that at best are neutral for your well-being and at worst can completely destroy your life both legally and from a health perspective.

*  Don't ""settle"" on your choice of a SO.  This may be the most important thing.  We all fall in love but look very hard at the potential faults of your SO.  If there are some big red flags, heavy drug use, dishonesty, violence,... move on.  There are other fish in the sea.  It's ok not to compromise on core values.  And no, you won't be able to ""fix them.""

*  Don't lie, cheat, be dishonest or vindictive.  It never helps you in the long term.

*  Buy things and spend money on things that make YOU happy.  Don't worry about what other people think as you can never ""keep up with the Jones's"".

*  Try to fix things yourself when when they break.  It's amazing how daunting it can be to try and fix a leaky toilet the first time.  But you watch a youtube video, by the $8 in parts, and spend 20 minutes doing the actual work.  You learn a new skill, save $200 on the plumber's fee, and won't panic the next time it breaks.

*  Care and try to help others (but not to the point where it will directly hurt you or your loved ones).  I think the act of giving is underrated.  I personally feel that directly helping others with tasks or advice is better than directly giving money.

*  Last, enjoy life.  Saving money is not the actual goal, it's about being free to do what you want in life.  I travel, buy ""toys"", fund my hobbies, build things myself, and generally spend on things make us happy.  Money = Freedom and peace of mind.

Well, sorry about the rant but I figured I share my experiences.  Best wishes to all my fellow /r/personalfinance friends.

**EDIT:**  I've had a lot of PM's asking why this was removed and if I can send them a copy of the original post.  I contacted the mods, they reviewed it and put it back up.  So it's back.  Thank you mods for re-evaluating the post.

I also wanted to clarify the intent of the post as it seems there has been some confusion about this.  It is NOT a instruction guide on ""how to make $1 million dollars in 10 years.""  The $1 million in 10 year time frame was a personal goal of mine based on my income, standard of living, fixed costs, and savings goals I thought I could meet.  Obviously if your income is different, costs of living higher or lower, etc... your goals will vary.  The point I was trying to make is that my general bullet points could be applied to most individuals.  The actual monetary goal and time frame would be variables that are different for everybody.

I will say one thing about people that claim that saving $1 million dollars for the average person is not doable.  It is the equivalent of saving $405 every month from age 25 to 65 (with a 7% interest rate presumption).  That's the equivalent of saving 10% of the average American household's income on a yearly basis.  Not saying that it can be done for everybody, but for the majority it can be a realistic goal.",finance
personalfinance,Loan Vs credit cards (UK),"Hi,

I haven't much details right now, and would like to do a more detailed post at a later point if it's needed, but I need some help.

I'm 23 with 3 credit cards.

One has around £200, one has £1300 and one has £2200 on. All from a holiday to Vegas and some car insurance that I just never get round to clearing up. 

Now it just occurred to me, I'm paying around £100 a month on these and it's about all I can afford for 18 months until I finish my apprenticeship and go from 18k, to 30+k

I want to be debt free, once clear I'm going to keep one cc for emergencies and that's it.

Looking at my statements, the amount owed isn't really going down at a steady rate, so I was thinking about a loan, and found one set for 3 years, @ 130pm which I can do, and allows early repayment. 

I was just wondering if I am thinking of this right, that if I stuck at paying these cc at that same rate it would take a lot longer to shift? I know it's hard to say without exact interest rates but the cards all seem to be around 19% Apr, Vs loan at 12%. 

Also, is either more likely to affect my credit score? The cards are basically full, would it look better to have a loan I'm making payments on instead?

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Help,"PF community I need your help!

My fiance is about to start her Physicians Assistant program and I have just discovered that her undergrad loans (she graduated a year ago) have very high interest rates.

Her:

The loans are coming from 4 different providers for a total current balance of $85k which includes accrued interest. The federal loans are low (4ish %), two of the providers are decent (5-8%) but the main problem is the Sallie Mae 11% loan. This loan currently has $31k in prinicpal and no interest. She has been making the minimum payments for a year. 

Currently they are in defferment so she does not have to make payments for the duration of her program (26 months). However, with the Sallie Mae rate being so high she is going to accrue almost $8k in interest by the time she is out (if no money is paid towards it). During her PA program she will not be able to work and therefore put up any cash towards her loans. We will be hit with $100k in loans after the program as well (woohoo!).

Me:

I recently graduated in May and still have a 5 month grace period before I have to start paying back my total undergrad loans of $32k with interest included. The loans are federal loans so the interest rates are low. I have accepted a job and currently rake in $2k in extra cash per month (yes I have already accounted for expenses and other paycheck deductions including 10% for 401k). Also, I have been saving ever since I was a kid and have a little over $20k in my mutual fund right now.

You:

What would be my best course of action in spending my extra cash per month to destroy these loans? Is there anyway to lower the ridiculous Sallie Mae 11% interest rate? Also, should I consider lowering my 401k contribution to 5% which is my companies max match percent?

financialindependence,Retire early and give up government benefits?,"Hi everyone, I've been struggling with the idea of FIRE knowing that doing so would mean I lose the retirement benefits I get at my job.

I am an air traffic controller and, similar to firefighters and policemen, I am able to get a full retirement after 25 years of federal service. That would put me at 47 years old and I'd get a pension, access to my TSP, and health insurance for life. My wife and I are both relatively high income earners, combined gross of about 300k/year. We are on track to pay off our primary residence in about 10 years and we have several rental properties, adding more every year. Once our house is paid off we will be FI and there in lies the conflict. 

I'll need to work for about 11 more years to get my retirement benefits but I can almost guarantee once we're FI, I probably won't want to keep working. 

EDIT: I should've explained better, I am 26 now, eligible to retire in 21 years. House will be paid off at 36yo and will have 11 years left of work at that point. My pension when I retire at 47 will likely be about 80k/year and I'm guessing I'll also have at least 800k invested in TSP. If I leave early (at 36 when house is paid off) my pension will probably be 20-30k/year if I even get one and my TSP will be about 400k.

Assume annual expenses are the same at 36 and 47, 50k/year

Right now rental income is net 36k/year. Based on my goals and current rate of acquiring houses, I'll be at 200k/year when I'm 36. At 47 who knows, maybe 400k if I stay on pace

personalfinance,Backdoor Roth confusion - does it make sense for me?,"Hello PF. So I’m in my mid/late 20’s and trying to get more serious about planning for retirement. I’ve read the wiki, I’ve surfed the NerdWallet and White Coat Investor articles, but I’m still finding it very hard to understand the intricacies involved in a backdoor Roth IRA. I’ve followed the obvious steps for saving and emergency funds, now I’m hoping to get some advice on how I should approach my retirement contributions based on my specific financial situation.

As I mentioned before, I’m in my mid/late 20’s. I’m making around $130,000/yr and maxing out my 401k and contributing $5500 to an IRA. I have a traditional IRA totaling around $70,000 from an old 401k rollover, as well as a brokerage account that I started contributing to in high school and early in my career.

I want to make sure I’m maximizing my savings. I think the main source of my confusion is that everything I read seems to favor Roth IRAs, and recommend a backdoor Roth if you no longer qualify. I understand that my existing Traditional IRA from the 401k rollover makes the backdoor conversion more complicated - if I understand the pro-rata rule correctly, if I were to contribute $5500 AFTER-TAX to my traditional IRA tomorrow then convert that after-tax $5500 to a Roth IRA, only ~8% (5500/70000) of that conversion would be tax free, and I’d be taxed again on the remaining 92% (~$5000) of that conversion.

My head is already spinning after just writing that out - does it seem like it still makes sense for me to pursue the backdoor Roth approach given my situation? My future spouse will be making ~$200,000/yr in a few years, so we’ll both be in higher tax brackets early on and looking to maximize our contributions going forward. Do these higher tax brackets early on make a difference? This circles back to me finding it hard to understand why everything I read seems to favor the Roth IRA either directly or via back door.

Any suggestions or insights would be very helpful! Thanks guys.",finance

Here are some relevant numbers just so you get a better picture of what I'm dealing with:
- 1$ = 7000VEF [via auction you can acquire US dollars at 3000VEF but it's a new system, more on that later]
- Credit Card interest 29%
- Consumer Credit Interest 24%

- Monthly maintenance fees in my apartment are low
- I have decent health insurance
- I don't own a car, partly because it was easy to foresee how expensive it would be to own one in 2017 (most Venezuelans are obsessed with car and home ownership, think the US 30 years ago)
- My salary is around 2,5-3,5 minimum wages (not counting for side hustles)
- My total debt is around 1.300.000 VEF (in context that still less than 200$).
- I have a stock option plan at work that would allow me to easily get rid of any debt if I wanted to exercise my option (but why would I do that?)
- I have an emergency fund of around 2000$ in case of unemployment or if I decide leave the country (I'd raise a lot more from all the stuff I'd have to sell)
- I rarely keep any spare cash in VEF and all my significant purchases are made in foreign currency
- Grad school is insanely cheap and my work pays for it 
- I'm quite frugal

Sorry for the long post, but I'm trying to paint a decent picture just so I can get a decent opinion and tips on how to deal with this kind of crisis. You really can't adhere to ""carry low debt"" when interest rates are lower than monthly inflation, what can you really do under these circumstances? 

I'm interested in reading your insight on how would you tackle this problem. Do you acquire tons of debt just because of cheap it is? Do you decide there's no point in living here and move abroad? Do you wait it out?

P.S. By no means I intend to be insensitive towards the huge crisis ruining my country where people line up for cheap bread during hours, while I just opt to eat something different.",finance
personalfinance,LF advice on killing off debt,"Hello,

Like the subject line says, I'm looking for advice on budget and debt. I'm going to lay out what's going on, and I'm open to any suggestions to do better, or any potential blind spots in my budget or in my plan to get right.

I net about 3200/month and have must-pays around 2500/month.

* I live alone and own a house. My mortgage, PMI, and homeowners insurance are about 1050/month. My mortgage is ~15 months old, with a principal of about 155K. The partner of my buyer's agent, who handles listings, recently told me the house is probably worth 190K-210K, and he's coming out later this week to give a better estimate. The housing market where I live is INSANELY favorable to sellers, and I would like to hold the house if possible, though I can certainly sell it. I also have a dog and two cats, so I really prefer the house &amp; yard to renting an apartment.
* I have a car loan and car insurance of about 425/month. Principal is about 21K, rate is around 4%.
* Electric, gas, water, and internet usually run about 275/month.
* Cell phone is about 100/month, and I am out of contract.
* I have a student loan of about 5k, monthly payment is about 130.
* I have two credit cards with combined balance of about 12K. The interest rates are 18.25% and 20.0%, minimum monthly payments add up to about 300.
* I usually spend a little over 300/month on food, and I know this is an area where I can cut back by 100 to 150/month.

Without counting stuff like a clothes budget, car maintenance, and actually chunking away at my credit cards, things are pretty tight. I am open to something like Uber or mowing lawns to earn extra cash. I am pretty hesitant to rent any parts of the house, out of safety/squatter concerns. I've thought about doing credit card balance transfers or getting a second mortgage to pay the cards off, but I don't know much about either option.

personalfinance,Figuring out rent &amp; savings vs. debt pay-down strategy for an introvert in a high COL area,"**TL;DR**:  I'm an introvert in a high COL area about to start a new job.  My introvert desire to return to solo living will have me saving only $24k yearly on a $150k base.  Am I blowing this?  See figures below to see if I'm blowing this.

&amp;nbsp;

**Longer story**: 
Over the last 3 years, I have lived with 2 roommates in a pretty crappy living space &amp; area to save money while in school.  Now, I'm ready to not.  One of the roommates dominated the common areas which resulted in me quarantining myself in my sad little room and generally feeling pretty miserable and low energy.  The meth heads routinely fighting in the street below did not help.  Sad! 

I don't want to repeat this, especially while working a demanding job, and unfortunately have no friends I would be roommate-compatible with in the area.  So, I'm looking at renting a 1BR, with the best options seeming to be in the ~$3100 range in an area where market is ~$2900. 

All my friends I talk about the situation with are like ""Yeah bro...live a little, you deserve it"" but none of them are exactly Dave Ramsay types (nor am I), so here I am for a 2nd opinion.

&amp;nbsp;

**Some info on me &amp; my broader financial picture:**

* Age - 27

**Income:**

* Gross base salary - $150k
* Forecast yearly bonus - $20k (firm median)

**Assets:**

* Savings account - $40k
* 401k - $40k

**Liabilities:**

* Grad school loans - $110k
* Signing bonus subject to clawback - ~$60k (I pay back any unearned amount if I leave prior to the end of the 2 year vesting period, linear vesting)

**Projected cash flows (monthly):**

* Base take-home income net of fed &amp; state tax:  ~$7850
* Apartment:  $3100 
* Utilities:  $200
* Minimum student loan payment:  $1245
* Accelerated s. loan principle pay-down (target):  $500
* Food:  $400
* Insurance &amp; Discretionary: $400 

**Net monthly savings:  ~$2k**

So, $24k / year in savings seems pretty terrible on $150k base.  Is it less terrible given the debt pay-down?

Am I completely blowing this by not manning up to get a roommate?  How have others thought through similar situations?  What are some things I can ask myself to make the decision more clear.

Any and all opinions / advice / words of wisdom appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Applying for rewards credit cards - odd things on credit reports,"tl;dr - My credit scores range from ""no score to report"" to 570 to 725. Want to apply for Capital One Venture and Chase Sapphire Preferred credit cards but do not wish to be declined due to the nature of my reports.  


This is a throwaway account due to my personal info being available on my regular.  


Some basics:  


Me: 37 years old. Live in NC. Own my home, 210k remaining on mortgage, about half of its' market rate price. Purchased in 2015, just refinanced 4/17 (home value doubled, we got a better interest rate and a cashout). One credit card through same credit union as my home mortgage, zero balance with 25k limit (started at 500 then steadily increased to this point). Married. Had horrific credit until 5 years ago. Perfection since. $15k liquid savings. 2 cars, both thru same credit union as above, 10k left on one, 14k on the other.


Now the questionable stuff:  

* Credit Score on Mint App - 696  
* FICO score listed on my bank's portal (will update again Aug 1) - 656  
* TransUnion credit score through CreditKarma - 570  
* Equifax credit score thru CreditKarma - 725  
* Experian - NO SCORE LISTED WHATSOEVER. I literally paid them to tell me I had no score.  

Called Experian and they have no record of anything except a collections account dated Dec 1 2011 from an energy company now reported by Interstate Credit Collections, and two closed credit cards from the early 2000s. Funny enough, Equifax shows that the exact collection dropped off my report sometime in the first six months of this year. Can I dispute this? If so, under what grounds?  


Transunion has a collection from ""Enhanced Recovery Solutions"" that I literally have no idea about, it was disputed Monday so I'm waiting for that to be reconciled. Neither TransUnion or Experian have a record of my home, cars, credit card, or anything that I've done to repair my credit.  


Questions:  

Can I dispute the ""Interstate"" collection account on Experian? Experian is the report that has nothing on it. I called them and my total report is now under investigation and I was instructed to call back Monday 7/10  

Should I have Transunion investigate so I can include home, credit cards, etc? And why aren't those on my report to begin with?  

I am applying for high end credit cards for the rewards (Capital One Venture and Chase Sapphire Preferred). How long should I wait before I do this? I honestly was under the impression my total credit score range was 700-725, but with this Transunion and Experian fiasco, I have no idea where I even stand.",finance

personalfinance,Santander Car Loan,"Hi all. I feel like a moron. Today I purchased a vehicle with a Santander loan. The car is $11,987 and the monthly payments are $315. For 72 months. The interest rate is 22%, and so that would bring my total payment to $22000. JESUS CHRIST. So I may be able to return the car tomorrow, but I live in Alabama and not sure if there are any laws here that allow that. 

My question is, I LOVE this car. Would it even be possible to refinance in 6 months or a year with my credit union? Can someone please tell me how this works? Would it be possible to refinance with the same loan company and possibly get a lower interest rate?

I am not sure what to do.

Thanks for all your advice.

Edited to add that I may be able to pay off the loan early, beating some of the interest, but JESUS. I am not sure what to do.

Update: talked to my credit union first thing this morning and got it refinanced for 9%, 2 year loan with lower payments. Yay! Whew.",finance
personalfinance,What are people's opinion on Discover Bank,"So I'm thinking about opening an online savings account with Discover Bank for their $100 promo and the 1.10% interest rate. I have never used an online bank before, so I'm a bit worried about this. 

I already have a credit card with Discover and I have had great experiences with them. What do people think about Discover Bank? I'm wondering about certain things

1. How long does it take to transfer money (ACH) from an external bank to Discover?
2. I'll probably be transferring a hefty chunk (like $50k-60k). Should I do this in several transactions or a whole? Is it safe to transfer this much amount in one transaction?
3. Is there any possibility that funds could get lost during the process?
4. How long does it take to get money to transfer out of the Discover savings account into an external bank's checking account if for some reason I need it?

If anyone familiar with their savings account could help with these questions then that would be great.

personalfinance,Not paying off debt but using it to invest,"I feel that most people in /r/personalfinance highly advice paying off debts first. However assuming that home loan interest rate is very low etc 2-3%, not credit cards with atrocious rates of 18%, wouldn't it be viable to not pay off your loans or drag it as long as possible?

Assuming I can complete my house mortgage in 10years but I take a 30year loan instead. With the excess money I would put it in my portfolio that would optimistically get me a return of 7-8%. This gives me 4-6% of additional return on my money that I would have otherwise lost to my paying back my house.

Of course I understand that the market could crash my portfolio could have a severe drawdown, but since my mortgage is split over 30years I would have enough time to ride it out.

Also having the money in a liquid portfolio allows me to take it out one day and refinance the house and pay it off in full - if interest rates rises to levels where my different in return may not make sense.

personalfinance,"Recent grad with 75k salary, 80k debt, looking for advice/budget critique","Hey everyone, 

I recently graduated and will be starting a position in September in Boston that pays $75,000 base salary, with a bonus up to 10%, 401k match of 4% of base salary, and stock shares currently worth around $11,000. My estimated tax rate will be around 30%, I believe. I haven't been great with managing money in the past, so I'm trying to change that through maintaining a budget. I'm fortunate enough to have secured a position that pays well, so I want to develop good habits now to become financially secure. 


I've graduated with nearly $80,000 in student loan debt, through three private loans and two federal loans. I'm going to look into refinancing the private loans, but I haven't done much research into that yet. 
Here's the loan breakdown:


Loan | Amount | Rate
---|---|----
Private 1 | $10,000 | 8%
Private 2 | $33,500 | 6%
Private 3 | $27,500 | 7.49%
Fed 1 | $4,500 | 4.66%
Fed 2 | $3,500 | 3.86%


Here is an estimate of my monthly expenses starting in September:



Expense | Amount | Notes
---|---|----
Rent | $1050 | none
401k | $250 | my monthly payment to take advantage of full match
Food | $300 | rough estimate, possibly high?
Car/Renters Insurance | $170 | still looking for lower rate for car
Utilities | $100 | rough estimate
Gas | $75 | rough estimate
Subway pass | $75 | none


That list is not exhaustive, but I think it is a decent estimate of my essential monthly expenses. I didn't include minimum student loan payments because my current plan is to pay above the minimum (more on that below). 


Assuming an after-tax take home pay of $4375, this leaves me with $2355 after expenses.


A few questions:


1.  Ideally, I would like to have these loans paid off within 5 years. How reasonable is this? 
2.  How large of an emergency fund should I start? Is it better to keep a smaller emergency fund and focus on the loans instead?
3.  My current budget has me paying the monthly minimum to max out my 401k contributions from work. Should I increase this? Or, since anything after 4% is unmatched, is it better to focus on loans?
4.  While I do have a fair amount of debt and do not plan on changing my standard of living much, I will be spending money on dates/going out/etc. Any guidance for what amount is reasonable for these non-essential expenses?
5.  Do you see anything that I've overlooked or not considered? 


Edit: 6.  I am in grace period for my loans until November. Should I begin payments right away, or should I use the grace period to focus on building an emergency fund and then begin payments once the grace period is over?



Thank you very much in advance - I greatly appreciate you taking the time to read through this and any words of advice you may have to offer.

This put me in a location where I couldn't find work in my field, and the work I could find was in food service making below the poverty line.

Last August I got a job at a state university making $30,000 a year plus benefits. This has qualified my loans for PSLF which will take another nine years, assuming Congress doesn't do anything to change it. I am also looking to go back to get my PhD so I can start teaching at the university level which would significantly increase my earning potential.

Outside of my student debt I have no other real debt. My car is paid off and I pay my credit card, which I only use for utility bills, statement every month. I am also in the process of building my emergency fund which should be completed before the end of the year.

My question is, do I contribute my post-emergency fund savings toward my student loans to bring down the balance more, or do I contribute to a retirement fund? And if I do a retirement fund should it be a Roth IRA to give me more control? Or the 457 plan offered by work which would have the added benefit of bringing down my MAGI which in turn would reduce my monthly payment toward the student loans?

personalfinance,Should I get a loan against a paid-for car to pay down high interest debt?,"My wife and I (me 23M, her 22F) are recent college grads and recently married with some debt. Currently we make about $4600/mo with $4200/mo expenses. We have ~$9500 in CC debt between 4 cards with APR's between 14%-20%. We also owe $1300 on a personal unsecured loan at 15%. We have 2 cars, one we owe $16,000 at 3.25% on and another we own free and clear (value of about $8000). We made some poor financial decisions and have recently embraced the teachings here at PF and are implementing them. We are following the flowchart with a budget and a plan to get out of debt. Only problem being with our net income it will take quite a while to become debt free, accumulating more interest than I'd like.

My question here is:
With our very high interest rates on some cards, is it a good idea to take out a loan against our paid-for car at a low rate and use that money to pay off the high interest stuff? I would aim to keep the payments about the same, so I figure we would borrow maybe $7k and repay over a couple years. Are there any potential drawbacks that I'm not seeing to doing this?

personalfinance,"About $9000 in CC Debt that I want to eliminate, but I have a plan. Tell me if this makes sense!","Hello All,  
  
I discovered this reddit a few months ago and have mostly been lurking and taking in the knowledge that is shared. It has been very refreshing and encouraging to say the least.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I wouldn’t say I am in crisis mode, but I really want to correct my ways and get on a more sustainable path for my future. After my annual raise hit on 7/1, I will be making $2,202 a month. Those earnings are after my pre-taxed health benefits, pre-taxed $200 contributed to my retirement fund, and all other fed and state taxes. My CC debt is currently $7,966 w/ BoA (monthly interest $96.26) and $1,089.37 with Barclaycard (monthly interest $16). Totaling $9,055.37. I am already at the point where I don’t really use either of my CC’s. The Barclay, was used only to purchase a laptop after mine died, and a few emergency purchases. The BoA account was used more, but no longer. My other debt is student loans, which is not really my focus right now as I have never missed a payment (intentionally). Student Loans total $39,495.15.  
&amp;nbsp;  
My monthly expenses are:  
Student Loans (Navient): $675  
Internet: $70  (centurylink)  
Netflix: $10  
Gas: $83 (Last month’s total)  
Car insurance: $0 (paid in full for the first time, thanks to tax refunds)  
BoA CC: $250 paid (min is about $200) APR 13.99%  
Barclaycard CC: $200 paid (min is about $50) APR 14.74%  
Groceries: $100  
Total expenses: $1,388  
You read that correct, I live rent free at the same place that I work. It’s a great incentive for a job I love.  
All said and done I have about $814 of wiggle room. This is probably my issue, as my girlfriend and I like to eat out. I have been making an effort to buy our groceries, but I also have a lot of opportunity to again, take advantage of my job, where I can essentially get a free meal most of the time (not always the most healthy option though).  
&amp;nbsp;  
Here is where my plan comes into play and I need to know if this make sense or if I should just suck it up and stop spending money on fun things. I mentioned my 403(b) account retirement fund earlier which currently has about $12,821 in it. I can borrow up to %50 of that (minus $50 which goes towards processing the loan) for a total of $6,360. I can borrow this, just about wipe away my CC debt, so instead of paying the interest to my CC company, I would pay it back to myself in my own retirement fund. Minimum payments would be more than manageable and I can determine my payback timeline, probably a 3-4 year payment, could go as low as 2 years probably. Especially if I finish off my CC debts this year, which is my goal.  
&amp;nbsp;  
So reddit, what do you think? Is this the correct path? Do I need to reevaluate? Do you need more information from me to offer advice?",finance

I've made $3271.28 gross/$3040.94 net at my W-2 CA job with 0 allowances, $11.50/hour paid biweekly (I no longer work here). I expect to make $7,000.00 at my NJ 1099 job, $12.50/hour paid biweekly. Last year, I made ~$9,700 with two W-2 CA jobs. I'm used to the relatively straightforward process of having my taxes automatically withheld and filing with an online free service. I don't mind crunching the numbers, but I'm a little confused as to how to start in terms of tax rates and quarterly payments. So I have the following questions:

* Looking at the 1040-ES, should I be using the $0 - $9,325 or the $9,325 - $37,950 tax rate to calculate my taxes, since the 1099 job will put my total income around $10k?
* If I am now at the next tax rate, would I potentially owe more federal/state tax in terms of my W-2 CA job?
* If my calculated federal tax is over $1,000, I will have to pay estimated tax quarterly, correct?
* If my NJ tax is over $400, I will also have to pay estimated tax quarterly as well, correct?
* I also imagine I won't owe quarterly tax payments to CA?
* Slightly off topic, but does my current situation jeopardize my California residency for in state tuition?

personalfinance,My bank offered me no fees and 0% APR on balance transfers. Help?,"I currently hold about $2500 in one card, card A, which has a credit limit around $10K, and $4300 in another card, card B, with a limit around $6K. Cards from different sources, both with rates over 14%. I got too spend-happy post-college when I got a full time job with a good salary. Borrowing from my future. Bad idea, but I'm working on fixing that. 

Card B lender sent me an offer of no fees on balance transfers by August 15, 2016, and 0% APR until November 2018. Sounds great. The rub is, I owe more on Card A than is available on Card B's credit limit at the moment. 

I have three courses of action in view at the moment:

1) I have about $2K in savings that I have been building. I deposit $300-$500 a month into that account, depending on how much bills and expenses leave after income. I could pull from that account to open enough available credit to apply for a complete balance transfer.

2) I could request a credit limit increase on Card B. I have decent credit (score a few points under 700) and am reasonably assured of a positive response (I have a good bank). I'm willing to take a small ding in credit score for that, even with another ding coming for requesting a balance transfer. I'm over 60% utilization on that card already, and am a little uncertain about the possibility of increasing that utilization at the moment, though. Score is less important than the amount of interest I'm paying, and if I can stop paying interest on $2500 for a while, that would be a huge boost (not to mention one card to pay on per month, instead of two). I don't want to irresponsibly ding my score, though - advice?

3) I do as I've been doing, but request only a partial balance transfer from Card A onto Card B. This is the more conservative path of action, and still leaves me making payments and interest on the balance on Card A, but doesn't involve credit limit increases or savings withdrawals.

Right now I'm leaning towards starting with #2. I can afford a lower credit score better than I can afford the interest rates on Card A. It also allows me to empty one card, and just leave that card home (I do better and spend less when I'm tracking fewer accounts and have a zero to maintain as opposed to a small balance that feels like it can float up and down, but mostly up). Am I missing any better options? Should I think about combining any of the above options? TIA for your comments!",finance

personalfinance,[32M/USA] Can't shake my $26k card debt after several tries... Regrouping for another attempt.,"First, please pardon my use of an alt account - I have enough personal info posted from my main that, combined with financial info, it could be a liability. So I'm posting from here. :)

So. I'm 32, and married. I live in the midwest USA.

I own a house, purchased for $100k in 2007, assessed at $88k today, and I owe about $79k on the mortgage as of now. My house payment is $900/mo.

(Edit to add: We put $100 down. (LOL. 2007. Like I said.) We've put about $20k into this house by way of HVAC and Roof replacements. By ""we"" I mean ""my wife's windfall inheritance when we were 22"".

I have a total of $26500 in credit card debt, which I've broken down below. I'm salaried and I get paid once a month - After all of my insurance, HSA, etc. are auto-deducted from my check, then a fixed $1100 deposits directly into a mutual bills account which is shared with my wife. The remainder of my paycheck deposits into my checking - That's usually around $1450/mo.

I haven't got any savings to speak of... I set up a Simple.com savings account 2 months ago, I've got like $120 in it so far... It's a start, but it's not anything to pat my back about yet.

I pay over the minimum due on every card, every month, to keep my credit looking *as good* as it can given the state of things... But I never make any real progress on my debts, and it feels like as soon as I strike one down, it pops up with a vengeance. And I know that the high interest rates are definitely part of the problem - But so is overspending, and relying on credit cards for 25 days out of the month. 

I have a 2005 SUV that is owned outright, but *I still owe my wife* the KBB value of the car to be paid back into her savings account ""someday"" - We used her savings to get me out of a very bad car loan (paying for a very lousy over-priced pickup truck) in 2013. She also owns a 2005 car, which is also paid in full.

My current cards &amp; rates are...

- $8335 @ 20.99% - limit $8800 - Discover card ... 1-5% cash back

- $6333 @ 7.65% - limit $6500 - local Credit Union card

- $5550 @ 23.15% - limit $5800 - Sam's Club store card

- $1914 @ 15.15% - limit $2000 - Capital One #1

- $1761 @ 22.49% - limit $1800 - Amazon.com store card ... 1-3% cash back

- $1656 @ 15.49% - limit $1800 - Capital One #2 ... 3% cash back

- $787 @ 23.24% - limit $900 - Chase Slate card

In addition to these, I also owe the paltry &amp; meager balance of $524 (YAY!) on my Student Loans, which is paid at $140/mo.

(Edit: I also owe my partner $2k which I borrowed for a vasectomy.)

I've refi'd a few times -- Early on, it was mostly in the form of re-financing my car loan every 12 months to extend the term, borrow against my collateral value, and chip away $1k on a card or something. Then eventually it grew into borrowing against my paid-off car to refi some cards. Then I bundled *that* car loan into buying a used-new truck in 2011. (Which went... poorly. As I mentioned above.)

For my most recent attempt to refi &amp; get things under control, in January 2015, I borrowed $10k via a personal bank loan which I used to pay off the Sam's Club and Discover cards above. (Yes. You read correctly. That means I've spent *well over* $14k back onto these two cards in only 30 months.) That bank loan was 36 months at 9.99% APR, and I voluntarily auto-paid $400/mo instead of the minimum ($310?, I forget) in order to pay off the balance as quickly as I could. This month (July 2017) was my last payment, and the loan is now paid off!! Beginning in August, I officially have $400/mo more to work with than previously... 

Since I have this money freeing up (and, effective this month, am also getting a decent bump at work, 4% increase) - I want to take this opportunity to regroup, re-assess the damage, and make a new plan going forward!!

I honestly don't know my ""total"" expenses or income, for years now I've only worked with the actual deposit into my checking account - Like I said, most of my ""regular"" bills (meaning not debt payments) are set up to auto-pay from our mutual bills account, so aside from making sure that there's enough in there before I go buy groceries, I really don't see or track what's going where from that account.

So right now, looking at only my checking account, personal expenses, and monthly card payments (In other words, setting aside all the communal married stuff like our mortgage, electric, gas, car insurance) - here is what I see each month:

Monthly Money In: $1450

- Student Loan ($140) - 4 more payments to go! Yay!

- Gasoline ($100) - If I spend over $100 on gas in a month, that part goes on credit cards. If I mess up &amp; wind up short a few bucks in checking, then it goes on cards too.

- Cell Phone ($170) - I have a personal &amp; a work phone - I get reimbursed for the 2nd line, that $ is part of the $1450/mo income. *YES*, I buy new phones every 2 years, but when you use it all day for work, every day, your battery tends to go to crap pretty early on. I absolutely agree that _if I were not in a monthly salary, on-call, expect-to-reach-you I.T. job_, I would need to cut this cost drastically. But it's simply not up for discussion, and I need to look elsewhere for savings.

- /r/trees ($100) - Ahem. Yes I know I could cut this out. Moving on.

What you AREN'T SEEING here...

- Medical bills. I'm lucky as shit, I have awesome insurance. $450 deductible, $1600 stop loss limit. This year I set up an HSA with $1200 in it (next year I'm maxing it!!) - so I only had to cover a few hundred bucks out of pocket this year. I have already hit the stop loss, so we're good to go until January 1st.

- Edit to add: Retirement. My workplace offers two tiers, I am on the higher one - 5.5% contribution with an 8.5% match. I've been contributing for something like 4-5 years now? and am at around $48k in my fund. It's a Fidelity Freedom 2055 target fund.

- ALCOHOL. I don't spend cash on beer - I always run it onto credit cards. I know, I know, that's freaking stupid, stop it already, etc. - But let's face the facts, I gotta own up to the fact that I spend at least $200/mo in taprooms and probably another $100/mo on packaged beer at the store. I *also* homebrew my own beer - which sounds great except that I love to stockpile &amp; hoard grain and hops for brews I'm going to make ""someday"" - but I also go out and drink / buy beer instead of drinking my own. This calls for DISCIPLINE above all else - I need to crack the whip and get my you-can-do-what-you-wanna tendencies under control, stat. The point is - I know this is a problem.

**So. Let's get down to nuts &amp; bolts - Here is what I really want to know....**

1. Right now I'm auto-depositing $50/mo into a savings account to pay off my SUV owed to my wife's savings. That's essentially a $3850, 0% apr loan - Should I be postponing that until I make some headway? (for 6 months? a year?) (edit: also the vasectomy loan)

2. Right now I'm auto-depositing $50/mo into my Simple account - I'll be 100% honest, this is mostly in a desperate attempt to build a cushion in case my wife decides to leave me, which she has considered doing. (No need to dig into this issue outside of /r/relationship_advice, but I just wanted to state this as a fact, as it's relevant.) - Should I be doing this, or should that $50 also go towards cards?

3. I'm familiar with both the snowball &amp; avalanche methods. I'm not sure there's a ""best"" one for my situation - As I understand choosing a method is more about your motivation / your morale / whether you need to ""see"" tangible results, than it is the actual dollars-and-cents of exactly how much snowball saves you vs. avalanche, right?? (Meaning - BOTH save you money - If one works for you, do it, and get out of the debt, don't sweat the small stuff - Right?)

4. As far as ""Where do I start"" - I think the answer is the Chase Slate card, right? Super low balance, low limit, sky-high APR... Pay it off in 7 more months, then move on to one of the other 20%++ cards, correct?

5. Do you have other suggestions? Now, I know, I hear you saying it already... ""Knock off the drinking &amp; smoking that (I) waste all my money on!!!"", that's a given... But beyond that... Any *MORE* tips to offer? 

TL;DR: I'm trying to wrap my head around the big picture, I'm not trying to implement &amp; execute perfectly... One day at a time... I'm trying to fix my health, my head, my job, and it literally can't all be done overnight. Or to put it another way - **My goal here is harm reduction, reducing the cash hemorrhage, and making a plan to get STARTED on fixing the issue.** After all, I didn't create this debt from thin air, it built up over many years.

**CC Debt** 
-  $9,800 @ 0% through July 2018
-  $1,200 @ 14.99% APR

**Personal Loan** 
-  $11,744 @ 19.43% APR. Monthly payment = $459

**Student Loans**
-  $29,000 in public loans, which are currently being paid by the State of New York under the Get On Your Feet Program
-  $24,000 in private loans @ 5.06% (weighted average). Monthly payment = $205

**Income**
After taxes, child support, etc, take home pay is roughly $2600/month. 

**Budget**
I don't have a formal budget put together, which is part of the problem. I started using Mint but haven't done much with it other than monitor my payment due dates and track my net worth. But I have no car payment, no rent payment, and very few recurring monthly payments. The only things I really *need* to buy are food and gas. My employer reimburses my phone and I get mileage for work (drive roughly 160 miles daily), which more than offsets the cost of gas. Conservatively speaking, my monthly expenses excluding payments on debt are probably $500 - $600. 

I have $13,000 in my 401k, and I'm 25 years old.

Now, Fidelity will allow me to borrow up to $6,400 from my 401k @ 4.25%. I know everyone always says you should never touch your 401k for anything until retirement, but I'm thinking it might make sense here to borrow the maximum $6,400 and pay down some of the personal loan for what's essentially a guaranteed return of 19.43%, which is greater than the return I earned on my 401k last year. Fidelity shows my personal rate of return was around 16% in 2016, but this is a geometric (money-weighted) average, whatever that means. 

Should I borrow from my 401k, or should I try to refinance the personal loan for a lower rate first? If I try to refinance, what should be my benchmark interest rate? Should I be comparing the refinance rate to the 6-7% average expected return on the market, or should I compare to the 16% I earned last year?

My thinking was if I stopped paying the account and they sent it to collections, they would get pennies on the dollar. My hope was to settle for more than that and close out the account. 

When I called them, they refused and said once an account is on a hardship plan, it cannot be changed. My only option would be to cancel my payments, let the account default and accumulate tons of late fees etc etc, and that after 120 days, they would send it to collections - and I could then try to settle it with collections.

I got addicted to gambling primarily sports betting where I gambled all of my income away plus credit cards. As of today I have gotten help with my gambling and that is no longer an issue. 


However due to my reckless behavior I have a lot of debt to payoff. My current credit cards (6 total) total up to $34,500 (avg. 15% APR), I have $5500 car loan (3.0% APR) and $3000 remaining on my student loan (1.5% APR). So total debt is $43,000. I'm not too worried about the car and student loans as the interest rates are low but the credit cards can get out of control fast.

- [My cabin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OUqFRtTUiU) is literally in the middle of a forest. Not in a forest clearing, but rather built between giant old trees in the rainforest near Olympia. There's a spot (LOC-A) about 15' away from the cabin and about 10' up in the air that gets direct sunlight more or less all day but seldom enough to illuminate an entire PV panel. The main shading trees here are maples, which will drop all their leaves in Oct-Nov and open up a lot of sky (albeit Olympia winter sky with solid cloud cover). There's another spot (LOC-B) about 60' away that's more of an actual clearing but which probably gets about as much light net as the LOC-A. After observing the two sites for three months now I don't feel like there's much advantage to moving the PV array to LOC-B.

My needs:

- Being deep in the rain forest the cabin itself is dark inside at times. I'm going to install about 25' of LED strip lights and a few other fixtures with LED bulbs (controlled via wall-switch) and a single household current outlet (probably one of the ones with a couple of USB charge slots built in). I'd like to run my juicer (1/3hp; 540 watts 110 volts 50/60 hz) for about :30s 5 days a week too, and maybe an immersion blender once a month or so.

The questions:

- I'm already in a low-insolation part of the country in a less-than-ideal arrangement. What strategies or technologies should I be considering to mitigate the challenges afforded by my shady location and cloudy bioregion?  
- Are there types of panels that perform better in lower-light or partially-shaded applications (e.g., bypass diodes)?

My thinking:

200w pole-mounted PV via a beefed-up charge controller into 2x35AH batteries + an inverter sufficient to handle the juicer's max load. The reason I'm considering a beefed-up charge controller is the possibility that I might want to augment my PV with a small gas-powered 12V inverter-generator maybe once a year if it's the deepest corner of winter and batteries are running lower than they should be.

personalfinance,What should my federal and NY (state and city) withholding a be?,"I currently live in New Jersey but work in New York City. I have 0 Federal exemptions, costing $608.24 every pay period. I have 0 NY state exemptions, costing $173.55; NYC also has 0 but it doesn't show I'm being deducted any at all. I have two kids under 2 and mine is the sole income used for a family of 4. I'm trying to get on top of our debt, and save up for a house, and I can't help but feel this is an inordinate amount of money to be taken out. Does anyone have any guidance or advice?

personalfinance,Paying taxes on gross instead of taxable income,"This year I expect to have about a thousand dollars in taxable income (will probably gross around 7.5k, minus standard deduction). However, on my pay stubs federal income tax is being withheld for the full amount, and at the wrong tax rate (13% instead of the 10% for my bracket). I've already filled out the maximum number of withholdings I can (only 1), is there anything else I can do on the W4 or some other form to get my tax withholding reduced to its proper amount or will I simply have to claim it as a refund come tax season?",finance
personalfinance,NAVIENT scam? Account reset?,"I called Navient using their number listed and I got transferred (from Navient) to another line. The man - who sounded like an eastern Asian - first asked for my social and full name. After giving it (angrily) he said he could not locate my account and then tried to redirect me to a loan locator line, and then I hung up then there (I actually asked to get transferred to someone who actually knows how to do their job - then hung up)

So I try to call again, I am redirected again and an american sounding man answered and was able to find my account just using my name (proceeded to expire my account so I could re-register). My question is - is it possible that I was transferred to a scam line?

Also, I only have $3200 left in student loans and I have like $30k in the bank, should I just pay it all off? I seriously hate Navient. They make Bank of America seem like gods in terms of customer service.

personalfinance,"21 and working at a brokerage firm, 30k debt, future direction?","Hi fellow Redditors,

I am a 21 year old Taiwanese-Canadian dual-citizen working at an independent brokerage firm in Toronto (since May of 2017). My position is a Client Solutions Specialist and my annual salary is $41,000 CAD + possible cash bonus of $50-$400 depending on performance.
I just recently graduated in April 2017 from the University of Toronto with High Distinctions (3.82 CGPA) in East Asian Studies and Religion. 
Personally, I think it's a miracle that I found decent employment in finance immediately following my graduation with such a crap and non-finance related degree. I think I was hired because I appeared mildly intellectual and I speak four languages fluently (English-Native, Mandarin-Native, Taiwanese-Native, Japanese-Conversational). Although I have a passion in academia and I am good at it, I obviously didn't think things through before I started university, otherwise I would've chosen a more lucrative field like Computer Engineering.

I have been told that I have a talent and that I should further pursue academia, but I simply cannot fathom taking on anymore student loan debt then I already have (30k CAD) and spending so many more years of my life studying to get a PhD, especially since the professorial field is heavily saturated as well.

I guess my main question is what should I do from here on out? 

1. I am young at 21 years old and I make decent money with a lot of potential for promotion since the company hires mainly internally, is expanding fast, and is fairly young (500 employees but with 5 billion+ in total assets). Should I stay and move up in the world of finance? Maybe get a CPH, CFA level 1, CSC, etc?

2. At the same time I cannot help think that perhaps I should pursue academia since I am good at it (3.82CGPA at a top university) and professors earn a decent wage. Added value of instinctual passion for East Asian culture and history. Although as a person in general I have broad interests including politics, finance, and governance, etc. Cons include more debt and years of my life.

3. Another path I have been considering is working in the Canadian government at a provincial or federal level. I think that these types of jobs tend to be fairly stable with great benefits, and I might be able to apply the cultural, political, and historical knowledge gained from university.

4. I also considered going back to school for a masters in something that would add a lot of value to my resume, such as policy analysis, public administration, Masters in Commerce/Business, etc. This would add to my debt, but it's worth it in my opinion.

5. The last consideration I made is to pick up and move to East Asia, I could work in Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Singapore, Malaysia, or Japan comfortably and probably make more since a UofT degree and North American job experience is highly valued over there. My family is in Asia as well, so this is an added incentive.

personalfinance,How do I check my credit score? I want to verify identity of a suspicious loan servicer who says I owe them money.,"I apologize for any formatting issues, this is my first time on this subreddit, my bf suggested I post here for advice. 

My mother has been getting mail for me from a company that says I owe them money for student loans. It seems like a legitimate company, no fraud alerts came up from a brief Google search, however my mother and I are suspicious of these notices. When we contacted them, they said they could not provide any proof of the loan and that it went directly through my school. 

I'm suspicious (among various other reasons like wording and lack of effort on their part to really get on me about these loans) because unlike the student loan provider I'm currently making payments through, I've gotten no official paperwork or notice (when I graduated I got an email from federal student loan agency telling me which company was directly handling my loans. I went back to double check and this company was not listed and the only loans I took out were from the government). 

I'm attempting to get in contact with my school to verify this company, in the meantime I would like to check my credit score since if this is legitimate it will have negatively impacted my score from being overdue. However, I don't know the best means to do this. I've been told you can check it once per year for free and now seems like a very good time to take advantage of that, but I don't want to get scammed into giving out information. 

Tldr: I've been getting suspicious loan notices from a company for payments I need to make with them, but I have no recollection of borrowing through them and they said they cannot provide any proof of the loan. How can I check my credit score to see if it has been negatively impacted by overdue payment to verify this company is legitimate?",finance
personalfinance,Private (100K)/Federal student loan debt (50k) - need advice for payoff,"Hi guys, 

So here is my situation... please be kind. I went to undergrad at a state school and got my first degree in Spanish. Long story short, I had a hard time finding a job coming out of school and worked a series of low paying jobs until I got a job at my university again. I worked full time and got free tuition while I went to school full time to get prerequisites for nursing school. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend nursing school at my university AND work full time because the nursing school wouldn't allow it - so I had to pay full tuition. 

My loans from my Spanish degree are Federal - 50K 

My loans from nursing school are Sallie Mae - 100K and cosigned by a family member. 

I am currently in a nurse residency program where I make ~20/hr. Unfortunately, TN has incredibly low pay for nurses. My take home pay is about $2200/month after health insurance, dental, 401K, and vision is taken out. I am living at home in order to save money, although I do help my parents out with food and some household bills when it comes up.

My Federal loans are currently being reviewed for the REPAYE program. While not in REPAYE, my monthly payments are: 

$167 - Great Lakes 

$50 - American Ed 

My Sallie Mae loans are currently deferred because I am in a residency program for nursing for a year. 

Monthly Sallie Mae payment while deferred - $113 (this will increase exponentially after my residency is up)  

I have already paid off one personal loan ($69/month) ($700 balance paid) 

I have one more personal loan ($86/month) with a balance of $725 to pay off, which I plan on paying off within two paycheck cycles by the end of this month. 

I have a car payment of $255/month with $5,450 left to pay. 

Other expenses:
 
Car insurance: $113/ month 

Phone: $90/month
 
Gas: $200 (I drive an hour to work)/month 

Gym: $25/month

No credit cards - no credit card debt

Credit score is good because I have not been late on payments. 

I also recently got a PRN job as an IV therapist where I can make 17/hr and it has a flexible schedule. I'm not against picking up OT at work, but I would like to limit it to one to two shifts a month so I don't get burned out. 

So far my plan is to pay off my personal loan this month, and then begin to aggressively pay down my car. I hope to have my car paid off by October (with my personal loans paid off and my car paid off I would have an extra $410/month). After I pay off my car, I plan on beginning to pay Sallie Mae loans off while they are in deferment so that I can start knocking the interest down and only have the principal to pay. I am hoping to pay about $800-$1000 a month on those depending on if I can get enough OT and shifts at the IV therapy clinic. 

I plan on leaving my Federal loans in REPAYE (if I get it) until I get my Sallie Mae loans paid off or my income increases. Hopefully my income will increase within the year since I AM a new nurse. I am also considering moving to a better paying state/job, but I can also stay with my parents for another year. I will definitely move if I get a job where they will repay my student loans (looking into the government entities that will do so right now). 

Does this seem like a good plan to start with? My original goal was to pay off my Sallie Mae loans in 5 years...but I think I'm going to have to up that to 7 unless I get a job where they will help with repayment. 

I also read somewhere that if you split your payments up into two payments per month it will decrease the amount of interest that accrues...is this true? 

I don't regret getting my Spanish degree because it has come in handy as a nurse, does anyone have any experience or know anyone who does medical translation? I have heard that I can do it on the side but I have no idea where to start. Hospitals in Tennessee will not pay extra for translation ability unless you are certified...and sometimes not even then.

personalfinance,Student Loans - an Insider's Guide to Forgiveness Programs,"This is meant to be a user-friendly, non-jargon explanation of student loan forgiveness programs - what is possible and what is not; who to trust and who to hang up on. 

**QUALIFICATIONS**: I work for a company under contract with the Department of Education to service Direct Loans (loans owned by the US Department of Education). It's one of the companies listed on this government site:

https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/servicers

 I've worked here for 5.5 years; 3 years in customer service, and 2.5 years in processing repayment plans. 


**DISCLAIMER**: *I do not speak for the US Department of Education, nor do I speak for any company servicing student loans; I just wanted to give a Public Service Announcement and share the knowledge I've accumulated by working in the industry for over 5 years now. All of this information is publicly available, but it is generally in a hard-to-understand format.*

**SOME USEFUL TERMS**

* Servicer: A servicer is a company that provides customer service, billing, and processing for student loans. They are the company you call when you have a question about your loan, and the company you submit your documents to. They do not own the loan, and do not make student loan regulations. They are the hands-on company that enforces the rules created by the lenders.

* Lender: A lender is the entity that provides the funds for a loan. Because they provide the funds and generate the contracts, they make the rules that borrowers and servicers must follow.

* Borrower: A borrower is the student (or parent, in the case of parent PLUS loans) who takes out the student loan.

* Third-Party Company: A third-party company is a company that is not your lender or your servicer. These companies often make cold calls or send unsolicited mail advising people that they can offer forgiveness for student loans. They typically require payments of hundreds of dollars in order to help borrowers complete paperwork (the same paperwork the servicers will help borrowers with for free). The forgiveness programs they offer are already in place based on the type of student loan you have, so they cannot offer any additional forgiveness options. Sometimes these companies also offer student loan management services; for example, they might ask for a monthly fee of $35.00 to remind you once a year to renew your repayment plan, although your servicer will send you reminders anyway for free. If you make enough money so that you are comfortable and don't mind paying hundreds of dollars for a small amount of convenience, these companies are fine to work with, but in the case of people who cannot afford to pay at all, it is certainly an extra expense I would advise against.

* Forgiveness: Forgiveness programs are programs that allow a certain portion of your balance, and occasionally the entire balance, to be written off. Sometimes this written-off amount is considered taxable, and sometimes not. Forgiveness programs typically are not an immediate type of program; you must meet certain qualifications for years while remaining in good standing on your loan to qualify for forgiveness. I will detail the forgiveness programs and how to apply below.

* Discharge: Discharge programs, unlike forgiveness programs, cause an entire loan balance to be written off immediately, assuming you meet certain criteria. Discharge programs apply when you are considered unable to pay off your loans due to circumstances outside your control.

* Subsidies: Subsidized student loans are loans that have their interest paid (subsidized) by the government while the loan is under certain conditions, like when you are attending school full time or when you are on a deferment. Unsubsidized loans do not have these benefits, except in one scenario (see REPAYE in the IDR PLANS section).

* Deferments: A deferment is a hold on your loan for a specific period of time. In order to qualify for a deferment, you must meet certain qualifications, and you will have to provide documentation for those qualifications. You will qualify for a deferment if you are unemployed and registered with an unemployment agency (not monster.com, but a state labor department), if you are attending school at least half time, if you are working full time and earning less than the poverty guideline for your household size, if you are receiving public assistance, and various other situations. Deferments are nice because subsidized student loans do not accrue interest while on deferment. Unfortunately, student loans only have a limited amount of deferment time available for each deferment type, typically 3 years.

* Forbearance: Like deferments, forbearances are holds placed on student loan accounts. Typically, it is easier to qualify for a forbearance than a deferment, and it is usually easier to apply because less documentation is required. The problem with forbearances is interest continues to build up on the loan each day (student loans are simple interest loans that accrue interest daily), and it is not covered by the government. Like deferments, there is a limited amount of forbearance time available for student loans.


**TYPES OF STUDENT LOANS**

* DIRECT LOANS: Most of you will have Direct Loans, or loans owned by the US Department of Education. All regular student loans taken out after June 30, 2010 are Direct loans. Direct loans have some benefits that other loan types do not have. 

* FEDERAL FAMILY EDUCATION LOAN PROGRAM (FFELP) LOANS: Some of you will have FFELP loans, which are owned by financing companies and banks, but which are federally backed in case of default. Some FFELP loans have been transferred and are now serviced by the same companies that service Direct loans. There are still federal benefits for these loans, but there are fewer programs available for FFELP loans than for Direct loans.

* PRIVATE LOANS: A few of you have private loans, which are not federally backed and do not qualify for any of the programs that will be listed here. Any loan benefits will be dependent on your lender, just like if you took out an unsecured installment loan at a bank. 

* PARENT PLUS LOANS: Parent PLUS loans are loans taken out by a parent or guardian for a student (not for themselves). These loans can be under the Direct loan program or the FFEL program. These loans are a bit different because they do not qualify for many of the programs available for other types of student loans. I will address parent PLUS loans separately in the forgiveness section.

* SPECIFIC LOAN CATEGORIES: STAFFORD LOANS are student loans taken out by a student for themselves. Stafford loans can be Direct or FFELP loans. They are usually taken out for undergraduate programs, but occasionally, if a student has not reached their Stafford loan limit (set by the US Department of Education), they can take out unsubsidized Stafford loans as a graduate student. GRADUATE PLUS LOANS are loans taken out by graduate students who have reached their Stafford loan limit. Graduate PLUS loans are always unsubsidized and have higher interest rates than Stafford loans do, but ***unlike parent PLUS loans***, graduate PLUS loans are eligible for any forgiveness plans available under their loan program, Direct or FFELP.

Now that we've got all of that terminology out of the way, let's get to the good stuff - 

**FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS**

DISCHARGE OPTIONS:

* **Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Discharge** (AVAILABLE FOR BOTH DIRECT AND FFELP LOANS): If you are totally and permanently disabled (i.e. if your doctor certifies that you have a medical condition that will prevent you from working for the next 5 years) you can have your loans discharged. Be aware that it can take several months for this process to be complete, so you may want to ask your loan servicer for a forbearance or deferment in the meantime. **How to apply:** It doesn't matter which servicer is in charge of your student loans, you will always apply for TPD through a company called **NELNET.** To apply for TPD, contact Nelnet either by visiting their discharge website at www.disabilitydischarge.com or by calling 888-303-7818. If you have taken out a parent PLUS loan or if you are a student whose parent has taken out a PLUS loan for you, the loan can be discharged if either the parent or the student is disabled. Be aware that the discharged amount can be considered taxable income. That means if you make $10K per year and you have a $50K loan discharged, the next year your income on your tax return might be $60K, and you would be required to pay taxes on that entire amount.

* Closed School Discharge: We're seeing more of these lately. If you are *attending* or on an *approved leave of absence* from a school that closes, you can have your loan discharged. You may decide to transfer your credits to another school instead, in which case you would not qualify. Be aware that you have to actually be attending the school when it closes, or you have to have stopped attending within 120 days of the school closing. If you already graduated or if you stopped attending more than 120 days before the school closed, you will not qualify. **HOW TO APPLY:** call or email your student loan servicer.

* **DEATH:** This one is sad and seems morbid, but more people than you might expect ask about this. If you have federal student loans, under the Direct or FFEL programs, your student loans will be discharged when you die. It is not possible for your loans to be transferred to anyone else's name, and your estate will not be billed for the balance. Once your servicer receives documentation, usually a death certificate and obituary, the balance is written off.

* **VARIOUS OTHER DISCHARGE TYPES:** The three types above are the most commonly requested discharge types, but student loans can also be discharged for fraud or if the school should not have allowed you to take out student loans because they have no reason to believe a degree would be useful to you (typically occurs when a student does not have a high school diploma or GED). If you think you might be a candidate for discharge, call or email your servicer. They'll be happy to look into it for you. 

FORGIVENESS OPTIONS:

* **PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS (PSLF):** This is the most talked-about forgiveness plan, and there are a lot of misconceptions about it. The PSLF program allows borrowers who work in public service (defined as working full time for a non-profit (501(c)(3)) company or a government agency) to pay their loans ***on a qualifying repayment plan*** (more on this in a minute) for ten years (120 payments). Once the borrower has made 120 ***qualifying*** payments, the rest of the balance will be forgiven, and will not be considered taxable. Here are a few important tips about the PSLF program: First, this program is only available for Direct loans. If you have a FFELP loan, ***your loan is not eligible for the PSLF program.*** You can consolidate your loan under the Direct Loan program, at which point your new consolidated loan would be eligible, but any payments you make prior to consolidating will not count toward forgiveness. Second, there are two main factors for eligibility for the PSLF program - your employment has to qualify, and while you're working for a qualifying employer, all of the 120 payments have to be made on a qualifying payment plan. This is where many people have trouble. I've spoken to borrowers who have paid for 7 years on a graduated repayment plan while working for a government agency, all the while assuming that they were going to have their loan forgiven. Unfortunately, the graduated plan is not an eligible plan for PSLF. Eligible plans are an IDR plan (more info below) or a Standard, 10-year plan. Do you see the problem with the Standard 10-year plan? If you pay your loans on a 10-year term, your loans will be paid in full by the time you qualify for forgiveness. In order to truly benefit from PSLF, you will need to switch your loans to an IDR plan. **A few more tips:** payments do not have to be consecutive. If you work for a government agency and take off a couple of years when you have a baby and then start working again, those qualifying payments will still count towards forgiveness, as long as you were paying on a qualifying plan and working for a qualifying employer. Payments are only qualifying payments if they are made no later than 15 days after the due date. If you perpetually pay your loan 30 days late, your payments will not count. If you accidentally pay 20 days one month, it's okay because payments do not have to be consecutive. It will take you an extra month, but you will not lose your previous qualifying payments. Also, loans forgiven under the PSLF program are not considered taxable, unlike loans forgiven under IDR plans (see below). **How to apply for PSLF:** you are not required to submit an application for PSLF until you have made 120 qualifying payments, but you can if you'd like. Just complete the form https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/public-service-employment-certification-form.pdf and submit it to **Fedloan Servicing**. Even if your loans are not currently serviced by Fedloan Servicing, the loans will be transferred there if your employment qualifies, and Fedloan Servicing will keep track of your forgiveness count. 

* **TEACHER LOAN FORGIVENESS (TLF):** If you are a teacher (not a counselor or librarian) and you have taught at a low-income (Title I) school for 5 years, you are eligible to have a certain amount forgiven. The amount is usually $5K, but if you are a special education teacher or if you teach math or science at a secondary school the forgiveness can be $17.5K. This program is available for both Direct and FFELP loans. The biggest thing to be aware of with this program is that only loans taken out **after October 1, 1998** will qualify. Congress created the plan at that time, and only authorized it for new loans that were taken out after. This is a good program, but be aware if you are also interested in the PSLF program that you cannot do both at the same time. You can qualify for both forgiveness programs, just for different time periods. For example, if you taught at a Title I school from 2005 - 2010 and had $5K forgiven, any payments you made during 2005 - 2010 would not be considered qualifying payments towards the PSLF program, but payments made after could be qualifying payments, you would just have to pay for another 10 years, at which point your total balance would be forgiven. **How to apply:** your servicer will have a TLF application on their website. You will need to complete part of the application yourself, and then an ""authorized official"" will need to complete and sign the rest of the form.

* **INCOME-DRIVEN REPAYMENT (IDR) PLAN FORGIVENESS:** IDR plans are plans that base your monthly payment on your income, as well as your household size and your student loan balance. In order to take advantage of the PSLF plan, you need to pay your loans under one of the IDR plans. These plans are a good option even if you don't qualify for the PSLF program, because after paying for 20 or 25 years (depending on which plan you are on; remember that on the PSLF plan your balance will be forgiven after 10 years, regardless of the forgiveness term of the IDR plan you are on ), your remaining loan balance will be forgiven. There are several IDR plans, which I will detail below, but first I will give some general information about these programs. IDR plans are meant to make your payments affordable. They are not intended to pay off your loan at a certain time. If you have the means to pay extra and you do not qualify for PSLF, an IDR plan is probably not for you, because by paying off your loans early you will save a lot of interest. If you cannot afford to pay, then IDR plans are a good option. The plans (except for ICR) offer interest benefits as well as making payments more affordable. Any interest that accrues that is not covered by your monthly payments will be paid by the government on your subsidized loans for the first three years you are on an IDR plan. For example, if your loan accrues $50.00 each month but your IDR payment is only $10.00 each month, the government will pay $40.00 in interest each month. Keep in mind that IDR plans are good for 12 months at a time. This means you will have to reapply every 12 months. The timeframe is based on when you originally apply, not on the tax or calendar year, so if you applied in September 2016, you would need to send in your paperwork to renew your plan in August or September 2017. Another notice to borrowers with FFELP loans: **Income-Based Repayment (IBR) is the only IDR plan available to FFELP borrowers.** If you consolidate your loans under the Direct loan program, you will be eligible for any of the IDR plans. On to the individual plan descriptions: **INCOME-CONTINGENT REPAYMENT (ICR):** ICR is the oldest IDR plan; it was developed in the '90s. ICR payments are calculated differently than other IDR plans, and the payments are typically higher. One exception is for borrowers with very small balances, usually under about $3K or so: ICR uses the lesser of a payment calculated based on your income or based on your loan balance, so if your loan balance is small, you may receive a low payment even if you have a decent salary. I've seen borrowers making upwards of $100k/year qualify for payments lower than $50/month on ICR. Balances are forgiven after paying on ICR for 25 years. **INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT (IBR):** IBR is one of the better-known IDR plans. It was created in 2009 and had a lot of publicity at the time. Payments are calculated based on 15% of your discretionary income (defined as any income you receive that is more than 150% of the poverty guidelines for your household size), unless all of your student loans were taken out on or after July 1, 2014, in which case payments are calculated based on 10% of your discretionary income. The remaining balance is forgiven after paying on the IBR plan for 25 years, unless all your loans were taken out on or after July 1, 2014, in which case the remaining balance is forgiven after paying on IBR for 20 years. One important point about IBR: *if you are on the IBR plan and you want to change to any other repayment plan (except for a Standard 10-year plan), you will have to make a special payment before you will be able to exit the plan.* The payment can be as low as $5.00, but you will need to let your servicer know that you are planning to pay to exit IBR. **PAY AS YOU EARN (PAYE):** PAYE was intended to be a plan that improved upon the IBR plan, but unfortunately the eligibility requirements were so stringent that not many people qualified. In order to qualify, you had to have had no student loans prior to October 1, 2007, and you also had to have student loans disbursed after October 1, 2011. While this is more common today, not many people qualified when PAYE was first released. The payment for PAYE is calculated based on 10% of your discretionary income and the balance is forgiven after paying on PAYE for 20 years. **REVISED PAY AS YOU EARN (REPAYE):** REPAYE is the newest IDR plan, and was released in December 2015. REPAYE is similar to the other IDR plan. Payments are based on 10% of your discretionary income. Forgiveness comes after 20 years if you only have undergraduate loans and 25 years if you took out any loans for graduate school (yes, it's not fair). If you have graduate loans and you qualify for PAYE even with its weird disbursement requirements, you're probably better off sticking with PAYE because of 20 year forgiveness. I'm planning on going to graduate school once I graduate nursing school (no, I'm not planning on working with student loans for the rest of my life), so I'm repaying my loans on PAYE. There are some great benefits to REPAYE though. Like IBR and PAYE, REPAYE has interest benefits, but the interest benefits are the best of all the plans. For the first three years, any interest accruing on subsidized loans that is not satisfied by your payments is paid by the government. Also, after three years, 50% of the interest not satisfied by your payments on your subsidized loans will be paid by the government. 50% of the unsubsidized interest that is not satisfied by your payments is paid by the government the entire time you are on REPAYE. This is the only plan where unsubsidized loans receive interest help. An important point to consider about REPAYE: *if you do not renew your REPAYE plan on time, then for the period you were not on REPAYE, your servicer will have to calculate your income and determine what your payment would have been if you had renewed on time. If you would have paid more had you renewed REPAYE, then the amount you would have paid more for the entire period you were not on REPAYE will be divided into payments for the remainder of the REPAYE term and added to your monthly payments.* Please renew on time! **How to apply for any IDR  plan:** If you have Direct loans, you can apply for any IDR plan electronically at www.studentloans.gov. Your servicer will also have forms available on their website. **An important addendum:** IDR forgiveness can be considered taxable income, meaning the amount forgiven will be included in your income and you will have to pay taxes on it the following year. Thanks to u/drvoltaselectricfish for pointing this out. 

**FOR PARENT PLUS BORROWERS:** Parent PLUS loans do not qualify for any IDR plan. If you consolidate your loans, you will be able to pay on the ICR plan. If you don't have any taxable income, then your monthly payment under the ICR plan will be $0.00. Please consider consolidating and paying under ICR if you have parent PLUS loans and you are struggling to make your payments.

**HOW DO I KNOW WHO MY SERVICER IS?** Go to www.nslds.ed.gov. You'll have to sign in with your FAFSA information, which you can reset if you can't remember it. Once you've reset everything, I recommend setting up mobile alerts if that's something you're comfortable with. Once you're logged in, click on ""financial aid review."" Then you can see each student loan you have. Just be aware that you might have different servicers for different loans. You can view individual loan information by clicking on the blue numbers on the left. Your loan servicer's information will be here as well.

**SHOULD I CONSOLIDATE? HOW DO I CONSOLIDATE?** If you have lots of student loans with multiple servicers, consolidation can be a convenient solution. Be aware that consolidation will not lower your interest rate. Your new, fixed, consolidation interest rate will be calculated by taking a weighted average of the interest rates for all of your existing loans, and rounding up to the nearest .125% (thanks to u/mentaldude95 for the correction). **To consolidate,** visit www.studentloans.gov. ***CONSOLIDATION IS FREE!! Never pay to consolidate your loans into a new federal consolidation loan!***


**BORROWER DEFENSE TO REPAYMENT:** Thanks to u/ecc10394 for bringing this up - if you are not eligible for loan discharge due to school closure, but you feel you were unfairly charged tuition by a school that didn't hold up their end of the educational bargain, you may qualify for Borrower Defense to Repayment. Quoting directly from www.studentaid.gov:

""Under the law, you may be eligible for borrower defense to repayment forgiveness of the federal student loans that you took out to attend a school if that school misled you, or engaged in other misconduct in violation of certain state laws. Specifically, you may assert borrower defense by demonstrating that the school, through an act or omission, violated state law directly related to your federal student loan or to the educational services for which the loan was provided. You may be eligible for borrower defense regardless of whether your school closed or you are otherwise eligible for loan forgiveness under other laws.""

Well, I'm sure I've missed a few things, but I'd be happy to answer questions. It's not possible to cover everything, but I wanted to make this guide easy to understand. Most of all, I just want people to be less stressed about student loans and to be more familiar with the options available to them, so that it's more difficult for predatory companies to charge hundreds of dollars to borrowers who already can't make their student loan payments when the same services are being offered for free. 

https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/ also has a lot of good, in-depth information about student loans. 

Hopefully there aren't a bunch of typos, and the formatting is tolerable.

personalfinance,Need advice on a car loan,"I'm currently paying on a loan for a 2013 Subaru Impreza, originally picked up from a dealer for 15k. Currently paid down to 10.9k since I got it in December. The interest rate is 8%.

The main reason I'm looking to get rid of this is so I can afford to go back to school. I'd need to switch to a part-time job because the program would take too much time for a full-time job. If I went back to school I wouldn't be able to afford my car payment along with rent and everything else.

So what would my best course of action be in this situation? One thing I've considered is private selling at the end of year and getting the loan low enough before then so that I can get enough from the sale to pay it off completely and have 5,000 or so left over for a different vehicle.

personalfinance,a bit overwhelmed with where to focus my money,"I'm just looking for some advice on my debt and money 'strategy'. I've made a lot of mistakes with money so far but in the last year ive worked really hard to fix them and get on track. I've made some stupid purchases, had too much credit card debt etc. but i think ive got the fundamentals down thanks to reading this sub, and now im a bit lost as to what to do next.


* 25 years old - not in the USA

**Debt**

* 0 credit card debt! (Finally)

* 40k debt to my very helpful parents that helped me get through school - no interest being charged but i dont want to leave it forever because it is out of their mortgage.
* 45k in school loans at 2.7% interest rate - a good deal i felt
* 30k in school loans at 4.3% - not as good a deal
* a mortgage - 310k at 4% - yes this is a big debt, in my defence the P&amp;I monthly repayments are only slightly more than what rent was, its pretty much a dream house in a dream location for me and i'm pretty good at fixing things etc to keep costs low.

**assets/income**

* i have an emergency fund (finally, thanks PF) that will cover 3 months living expenses easily - i also have a very secure job so im happy with 3 months expenses
* small casual jobs whilst studying. Made 65k first year out of school, making 75k this year, got a pay rise to make 85k next year. This number will continue to go up about 5k a year up to like 130k judging by the job market in my field
* I have a car worth 2k, which is starting to be unreliable but i really dont want to get rid of it yet if possible because cars are expensive :(

**Questions**

* now that ive got an emergency fund, paid off all my stupid credit card debt, started a budget which has helped me cut my spending significantly ( i still eat out way too much but im working on it) I'm just wondering where to go from here
* my tentative plan is pay off the 30k at 4.3% debt first
* After that I'm planning on slowly paying my parents back with a small chunk of cash each month. Theyre not in a huge hurry to get the money back but i want to at least start making a token effort.
* i'm totally oblivious when it comes to investing, i thought it was something only rich people do. I've read a bit about ETFs/vanguard etc here which seems cool. But should i get totally debt free before going into that sort of investing? 
* Paying off house vs investing in ETF's? I'm not totally financially literate yet (i've come a long way) but it seems to be people talk of like 6% return from ETF's and if my house is only 4% shouldnt it be better to buy stocks? I'm a bit confused about this, and the whole ETF thing seems daunting.

Going into 3rd year @ uni and I'm truly unsure of what to do with my money going into the future. I have no credit card debt, currently have credit score a little over 750, and live in an apartment at school. I have a few qualms with some future expenses that I may fall into, so I'm looking for advice on how to approach the final 2 years at school. I pull approx. $1.5k per month from full-time work (current internship) after taxes, but this job is ending soon. I plan on going back to my old job where I make $200-300 a week (no taxes), but that'll only be during August. From Sept. to May. I'll have a part-time where I'll be making a lil over $1000 a month on top of school. Now, I have around $6.5k in a very low interest checking account (0.125% annually), and 2 credit lines that I use for various cashback rewards / frequent flyer miles. 

I'm blessed with having my tuition &amp; room/board paid for the past 2 years, and I'm covered at least for 1 more. My main worry is that going into 4th year, I'll have to take out student loans totaling around $18k (when all is said and done).

Rent: $615
Electricity/Water: $50
Cable/Internet: $15
Food: $120
Individual Expenses (Gas, gifts, drinks): $100
Savings: $100+

Totaling: $1000+/month in planned expenditures.

Looking for answers to a few questions:

1. Does this preliminary budget seem accurate? I recently started using YNAB (free to students after 34 days if you flash them the student ID) and I manually put in expenses, but just started July 1st.

2. Recommendations for preparing to take out loans? Want to get the best possible deals, idk if Federal unsubsidized, or private loans should be the route taken.

3. Should I be investing my extraneous money into a savings account? I've read about Vanguard's Roth IRA investment account, and was wondering if I should dump $5.5k in there and leave it alone, OR if I should leave everything in the checking account to keep open and available for the next couple of years.

Lastly, I'm sitting with rather bland grades (a literal 3.001 GPA) and the reason I'm in this future loan situation is because I lost a scholarship freshman year (pulled a lackluster 2.5, been busting my ass ever since).

Just got above water financially in March.  The house has been listed for a year.  Showings but no offers.  Planning to keep it now, so the kids and I have stability.

I'm making two moves to increase my monthly income
(1) Mortgage Refi. Made payments for 2.5 years.  Best Loan offer details 
Underwriting &amp; Processing Fee: $ 900
FHA Fee: $ 3,500
Title: $ 1,400
Discount Point: $ 1,400
Total Settlement Charges (Rolled IN):  $  7,200
I get 0.5% lower interest rate, 2 months deferred payments and $200 more in the budget.   These deferred payments (IE no payments for 2 months so I can save that money) allow me to do step 2
(2) Buy 2nd vehicle for 100 mile commute for ~$1500.  Current vehicle is needed for family transportation.  Cannot afford to replace with smaller vehicle.   I need six seats for all passengers.  I can get a smaller 2nd vehicle for my commute  and for trips that do not require that 6 passengers go.  Current vehicle gets ~16 miles to gallon.  New vehicle gets ~50 miles to gallon
Car needs new battery and title and taxes paid.  
I commute 3 days a week.  200 miles round trip.  That's ~12.5 gallons in current vehicle.  New vehicle 4 gallons.  At $2.25 per gallon ($28.12-9=19.13) 
I drive that 3 days a week.  This will result in $229.5 in savings for gas per month.  I'll have insurance to add back in for the second vehicle.  I'll have other opportunities to drive the commuter so there will be more gas money saved.

Mortgage payment is currently ~$1800.  I'll spend that $3600 this way.
Estimate $2000 for car, $1000 for emergency fund, and $600 towards child cost fund.

I plan to use the extra $300-$400 a month to apply towards my debt snowball towards ~$15000 in credit card debt.  I estimate I'll have an additional $600-700 in my budget for this snowball.  My goal is to pay off the debt by the end of 2018.

personalfinance,Need options for repaying my student loan debt.,"I recently finished grad school and my student loans are due for repayment. The way all my loans were set up, I have 15 total with varying interest rates. My first instinct was to consolidate all of loans to get 1 payment and 1 interest rate that's a tad lower. I'm currently in an income based repayment plan--the initial payments were just too high with my other bills. 

On the other hand, I'm wondering if there are any *legitimate* 3rd party companies out there that consolidate my loans and lower the interest considerably. If I consolidate my loans through the government site, the interest only goes down to 6% on a 87k balance. 

Are there any options through the government student loan site for lowering interest rates beyond what consolidation offers?

I know that to make any considerable dent in my loans, I need to pay more than the minimum. I'm just trying to get a handle on the interest and find the best repayment options. I just bought a house last month. I have a car I'm making payments on and trying to sell to free up that cash. 

Just looking for any advice in general on the topic. Thanks in advance. 

Edit: additional info: I make about 55k/year. Having a baby this year. Car is to the point of making principal payments now (thank god). I share expenses with my SO so that burden isn't all on me.

Cell Phone - $100 (upgraded to a newer iphone early last year where they tacked on an extra $12/month to my bill for 2 years)

Food - $140 (I tend to spend more on Fridays when I pick my son up for the weekend buying the things he wants. I almost never eat out.)

Gas - $120 give or take

Child Support - $360 ($90/week. My son's mother and I never went through the courts. We decided on the child support amount and me getting him every weekend the moment that we split up 5 years ago).

Car - $265.00 (I have $661.00 left on the car. So that's two normal payments and a smaller third payment. I was hoping to be able to make two larger payments over the next two months and have it paid off one month early)

Car Insurance - $143.00

401K - $68.30 (I was automatically enrolled at a 3% rate). I know I never see this money in the paycheck, but would it be at all worthwhile to stop contributing at the moment and bank that money?
My car will be paid off in 2-3 months. When that happens I will have that $265.00 free as well as lowering my car insurance (as I wont have to carry full coverage any longer). I want to take care of my student loans. I want to put money in savings. I want to not have to work a second job any longer (as it tends to conflict with my son's practices and/or games). What do I lower my tax exemptions for federal and state down to (I ask because I have no idea how much the amount of money I get paid will change based on changing those exemptions in NY)? I've been a person that has always been horrible at paying bills because I have a fear of paying bills and then not having any money (stupid, right?). I always wait until the last possible moment, or even too long, to ensure that I have more than enough money to pay my bills. I pay my rent on time, every month, without issue. I've been in debt since I was probably 20 years old. I don't want to live that life anymore. I have a 6 year old that wants a father he can rely on. It's my job to provide for him for Christmas, his birthday, and everything in between. I grew up in a poor household where our Christmas gifts were delivered by a truck and labeled with stickers that said ""To: Boy"". I don't want my son to experience that life. I want to be able to afford a home in the not so distant future. Being broke and constantly anxious about it has put a huge damper on my life in general (social, dating, self confidence, etc...).

I don't know that anyone here can help me change my life around. But I've seen so many people thank this sub for helping them climb out of debt and live a life of no/less financial stress, and I'm realizing (better late than never) that I can use all of the help I can get right now if I'm ever going to right this sinking ship.
Thanks!

Under IRS, IRC Section 1031 provides an exception and allows you to postpone paying tax on the gain if you reinvest the proceeds in similar property as part of a qualifying like-kind exchange. Gain deferred in a like-kind exchange under IRC Section 1031 is tax-deferred, but it is not tax-free. Owners of investment and business property may qualify for a Section 1031 deferral. Individuals, C corporations, S corporations, partnerships (general or limited), limited liability companies, trusts and any other taxpaying entity may set up an exchange of business or investment properties for business or investment properties under Section 1031.

What are the different structures of a Section 1031 Exchange?
To accomplish a Section 1031 exchange, there must be an exchange of properties.  The simplest type of Section 1031 exchange is a simultaneous swap of one property for another. 
Deferred exchanges are more complex but allow flexibility.  They allow you to dispose of property and subsequently acquire one or more other like-kind replacement properties. 
To qualify as a Section 1031 exchange, a deferred exchange must be distinguished from the case of a taxpayer simply selling one property and using the proceeds to purchase another property (which is a taxable transaction).  Rather, in a deferred exchange, the disposition of the relinquished property and acquisition of the replacement property must be mutually dependent parts of an integrated transaction constituting an exchange of property.  Taxpayers engaging in deferred exchanges generally use exchange facilitators under exchange agreements pursuant to rules provided in the Income Tax Regulations.

Q-1: How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes?
A-1: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax
principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual
currency. 

LOOPHOLE 1.
You can use cryptocurrencies to buy property, and TAX DEFER that property so long as it is a business or investment property. Personal homes does not apply but an office full of mining rigs... does? 

LOOPHOLE 2.
Provided you do not cash out of an exchange into your personal bank account, your activity is all long term investments. Yay! This means that long term capital gains tax comes into play, and that is substantially lower than short term capital gains which are taxed at normal rates.

LOOPHOLE 3. 
Mining. If you mine the currency, and record the date you received each payout, and its fair market value, and the price goes up... you don't have to pay taxes on the gains from when you mined to when you sold.",cryptocurrency

Long time lurker, first time poster. Throw away account for obvious reasons. I've been pretty nervous about posting here due to my ridiculously embarrassing amount of student debt, but I'm trying to stop taking the ostrich approach when it comes to my f-ed up finances! Looking for advice regarding savings, loan repayment and retirement. Constructive advice only please, I know how dumb it was to take out crazy amounts of student loans and constantly question all of my life choices, so spare me the guilt as I beat myself up enough over it. :P


I'm just shy of 29 years old. Finished graduate school last year and started working in the fall. Immediately put all of my efforts into paying off about 15k in credit card debt, so that is all behind me (credit score is actually decent, sitting in the 760s). This is the current picture:


* 86k salary (I work in a medical field but do not anticipate salary ever being more than 110k). My current job does not offer a 401k or any retirement plan at all. Take home pay is about $5150/month after taxes and benefits.

* 410k student debt (I know. No really, I KNOW.) Began paying $551/month in December 2016 in a REPAYE program. I consolidated, and everything is at 7% interest.

* Living with my parents for the foreseeable future, paying them $400 a month towards housing costs, cell phone, and food. I probably spend an additional $100 per month on entertainment. I would like to move out early next year, but I'm not in a huge hurry for it.

* $273/month car payment. My commute is extremely short, and I probably only fill up my gas tank once every 2 months.


Those are all of my set payments. I've recently begun contributing to some savings accounts through Ally and trying to save for retirement:

* $330 biweekly to a Roth IRA so I can max it out before end of year. Will reduce this to approx. $210 biweekly to max out in 2018.

* $300 biweekly to an emergency fund (currently sitting at $1600; would like this to be at 10k). May increase contributions to attempt to meet goal by end of year.

* $100 biweekly to a travel fund (currently at $500). Taking 1 international trip per year is hugely important to me, so I consider this a priority. I do rely on points for the majority of airfare costs.


After the emergency fund is set, I plan on establishing a savings or investment account to pay towards the loan forgiveness tax situation. This is my main concern. I was thinking I would match my current monthly loan payment (roughly $550/month) to save towards paying off the taxes on the amount forgiven after 25 years. I admittedly am completely clueless on how to project how much will be forgiven and how much I will owe in taxes for this come end of 2041, and this is a major stressor for me. 


Also, aside from the Roth IRA, what's the best way for me to be preparing for retirement without a 401k? HSA? 


Sorry for the novella, and for being a noob. Much thanks for any insights, or for pointing out holes in my current plan.",finance

personalfinance,Refinance question - Should I do it now?,"QL has been calling me trying to get me to refinance. It seems a little high pressure but I refinanced with them 2 years ago and it did save me some money. Anyway, here are my details.

**Current Loan**

- Original Balance - $277,100
- 30yr fixed, 30 months in
- 4.18%
- Monthly payments with HO insurance $1706(No PMI)
- Principal Balance - $261,367
- Make 1 extra payment per year for principal only

**Proposed Loans**

- 15yr fixed
- 3.5%
- Closing costs $3200, rolled into loan
- New payment $2259/month
- ""saves"" $110k

or

- 20yr fixed
- 3.875%
- Closing costs $4600 rolled into loan
- new payment $1957/month
- ""saves"" $65k

I asked for a 30 year but the guys said ""it wouldn't be worth it"".

As rates go up, now might be a good time to refinance. But I'll have larger payments. Which I *can* afford, would prefer not to.

Thoughts? Advice? Words of wisdom?

EDIT: News to note, it is possible interest rates are about to jump. I should have started this process like 3 or 4 weeks ago. Is now the time?! WTF is going to happen tot he rates market?!

UPDATE: So I called a bankrate bank and they offered me 3.125% with $2200 in closing costs. I took that to back to QL and they pretty much said nothing and continued to pressure me into taking their loan. I told them I would get a loan estimate document and get back to them. Meanwhile, I got an email from CapitalOne saying that they can beat any rate and closing costs or they'll send me $250. Worth a try right? I send them the loan estimate from the small bank and, even though it took them 3 days, they get back to me me with 3% and $1064 in closing costs. I've sent this to QL to see if they are willing to beat that to keep my business. 

So I played the banks off eachother and in the end am going to save myself like $85 a month compared to the original 15 yr offer. I feel like going from 3.5% to 3% AND lowering the closing costs by $2k would have had a bigger impact but...saving money is saving money I guess. Thanks to everyone who gave me some advice. If there is any further advice based on this update I would surely love to hear it. I haven't locked in anything and am waiting to hear back from QL to see if they can beat the CapOne estimate.",finance

personalfinance,New Married Couple Looking for Financial Advice,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

We are a 27 year old recently married couple looking for financial advice. Here is a breakdown of our current situation. I recently graduated form medical school and just started as a resident and she works journalist. We've never really budgeted and are looking to see how we should be allocating our money to get the best ROI and save money for (a hopefully early) retirement. 

We currently live in a large metro area in the South. COL is reasonable. Next year we will be moving to a large Midwest city which will be more expensive

Salary: ~110k combined. Will probably remain somewhat stable over the next 5-6 years or so, maybe increasing to 150k or so in an ideal situation. After that we expect our salary to be 300k-500k depending on the local we decide to live in. 

Debt: ~$230,000 in student loans. Interest rate varies from 4-7.5%. No credit card debt.

Assets: ~$55,000 in checking and savings accounts. $25,000 in stocks. 

Expenses: ~$1500/month in rent/utilities/cable/internet. We eat out a good amount and probably spend &gt;90%tile money on groceries/eating out. If i had to guess i'd say $500/month. Maybe more? As you can see we don't really budget. We probably spend another $200-300 dollars a month on non-essential shopping and goods. We also spend a significant amount of money on travel. Flights/hotels/etc. Hard to put an actual number on it but we usually also go on one ""real"" vacation a year. We are not very frugal during these trips either. We also travel/fly to visit family and friends a fair good amount. Not counting the other 3-5 or so weekend trips a year driving to nearby places cities

How much money should we be allocating each month to pay of our debt? Should we continue to rent once we move next year? We will remain in that location for 4 years. We may or may not remain that location long term. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",finance

From reading a bit on here I know that companies like SoFi will only do but so much depending on what your income is. Since I'm on IBR for the Fedloan I was thinking of consolidating/refi both private loans. The payments are manageable at the moment but the interest rates are ridiculous (10.5 Navient, 8 AES).

Would it be a good idea to get another credit card or reopen the Care Credit to increase this again? My current card doesn't offer any benefits so I'm about to pay it off and always keep it low.

financialindependence,Anyone collect social insurance from 2 countries (or more)?,"This may be a bit of a niche topic, but I'll bet there are enough expats subscribed to this sub to get a discussion going. I'm a dual-national living in the US and have just about qualified for Social Security benefits. If I keep working here in the US, my future benefits will increase, but at a reduced accumulation rate (u/rootofgoodblog has a blog entry on this: http://rootofgood.com/early-retirement-social-security/). Alternatively, I could move back to my ""home"" country and work to meet its social insurance eligibility requirements, which may provide a better return than continuing to contribute to US Social Security. Then, starting in my 60s, I could collect two government pensions. I wonder if anyone has written about this? Obviously there are other factors at play, most notably the potential differences in COL and compensation between the two countries, but there are likely non-monetary factors at play that may offset these. 

In my own case, I have Canadian citizenship and have several years of (very low) earned income during high school and university, so I believe I may qualify for minimum Canada Pension Plan payments. But I wonder if it would be worth it to move back sooner rather than later to shore up that future income stream.

***********

**Update**: Here is what I've gleaned from the SSA website. The Windfall Elimination Provision can result in a reduced Social Security benefit for those with foreign government pensions. 

However, you are exempt from the provision if you meet any of 5 criteria. The only two criteria that would seem likely to apply to expats are 1) You're a federal worker hired after 1983 (I assume that means US government) and 2) You have 30 years of *substantial* earnings in the US, where substantial means you must meet a minimum earning threshold (currently $23,625 in 2017). 

How much is the benefit reduced by? Well, first we need to understand how SS is calculated. It is based on your Average Monthly Earnings (AME; equal to your highest 35 years earnings, adjusted for inflation, divided by 420). You receive 90% of the first $885 of AME, 32% of the next $4451, and then 15% of the remainder. If you collect a foreign pension and are not exempt from the Windfall Elimination Provision, the 90% multiplier in the SS formula is reduced. Reduced by how much? That depends on how many years of substantial earnings you have in the US. The maximum reduction can be levied on anyone with 20 years of substantial earnings or fewer. In this case, the 90% multiplier can drop to 40%, which would reduce monthly benefits by $442.50 and lifetime benefits by $159,300 (assuming 30 years of SS benefits).

But wait, it's not all bad news. According to the SSA website:
&gt;The law protects you if you get a low pension. We won’t reduce your Social Security benefit more than half of your pension for earnings after 1956 on which you didn’t pay Social Security taxes.

In other words, the maximum reduction is 1/2 your foreign pension. So if the foreign pension is large and your SS benefit is small, you could lose the entire SS benefit. But if your SS benefit is large and your foreign pension is small, you should come out ahead (by 50% of the foreign pension value). 

So it would seem that you can draw SS and a foreign pension, but there will be a penalty if that pension is based on income/taxes paid. However, if you collect a foreign pension based on only residency (e.g., Canadian Old Age Security, which is available to any Canadian abroad who has lived in Canada for 20 years after turning 18), your SS benefits will not be affected. 

Consider this geographic arbitrage scenario: If you have American and Canadian Citizenship but have only ever lived in worked in America, you could retire at 45 and move to Canada. Your medical costs should be much lower since they are covered by taxes and your Canadian income tax should be low (assuming you live modestly and apply foreign income tax credits). And by the time you are 65, you would be eligible for Old Age Security benefits that would not affect your SS. At this point, you could move back to the US and maintain the Old Age Security benefit. Or stay and enjoy the balmy Canadian weather brought about by climate change.",finance

Thank you to all of you finance experts. I'm inspired by those of you that have become debt free and I'm on my way!

I'm not a CU employee as I work in IT, but I found out about this CU one day after reading and researching why credit unions are better options than scumbag big banks that screwed the world in 2008, 1980s, 1929-1933 etc.
 
I'd like to offer a bit of crumbs that I've recently discovered;

I recently closed my bank account from a big bank drawing .1% for both checking and savings and opened an account with Consumers Credit Union in Chicago drawing 3.33%-4.33% interest on checking up to $20k with some conditions that are somewhat easy to meet depending on your situation. The best part is anyone can join this credit union without being a member of the nearby communities or some exclusive organization as I don't live in Chicago or IL for that matter.

ATM fees are returned and their lending products are pretty cool (If you have assets like cash you can borrow against it for a very low interest rate and unlike 99% of banks I can use my motorcycles as collateral and sometimes combine them with a car to get a secured loan with low interest). Unfortunately their savings is only 1% interest. The only other downside is I don't have a local branch to deposit rolled coins or keep a safety deposit box for my important documents.

However, I recommend it to anyone that has a few to several thousand dollars in emergency/rainy day money to move your cash to their checking so you can draw interest on your cash at that incredible rate. I moved all my assets there, refinanced my car at a lower rate for the same time I currently have left on the loan and effectively lowered my monthly payment (they also let me skip payments twice a year), I also consolidated my credit card debt with them and paying less than 10% interest.
In 3 years my only debts will be my house and student loan.

Sidebar:: In the process of getting my finances straightened out (and by some form of slut magic) I renegotiated $40k student loan from 4% to 0% interest from RBS bank and they tried to back out but it was too late 6 months later when they noticed they weren't making money. This was my biggest win in the process and it's all thanks to you guys in this sub that always encourage to negotiate the terms. Hence, anything is possible, never take no for a first answer and always look out for your own interests and bottom line. Fight for what is yours to the death.

I need a small amount of $70K and am having trouble finding loans that make sense to me. I'm not a huge advocate of taking loans out for things so I am trying to do this in the smartest way possible.  There's car loans, mortgage loans, and ""personal loans,"" which carry super high APRs, low loan amount, and very short pay-off terms. ""Construction Loans,"" also do not work as they seem to be curated to release funds to general contractors, whereas I am owner-builder.  Also, super high % rates.  The closest thing to do-able I have found so far is called a ""Home Improvement Loan"" but I do not know if they would consider construction ""home improvement.""  These would allow me between 5-15 years to pay off, with interest rates between 5.5%-6.7% which I think is pretty fair, so long as they don't charge me the interest for early loan pay off.

&amp;nbsp;

I have no debt, my credit score is 791, and I own the land the home is being built on that I could use for collateral on a secured loan.  Ideally I would like at least a 10 year pay off term, but could easily have the loan paid off in 3-5 years using the property's rental income.",finance

personalfinance,"I think we're doing great, but what should be our next move?","Hi all,

I'd like your thoughts on our current financial situation and plan.  My husband and I have made a lot of great progress in the past couple of years, and I feel like we are really well set up for our future.  I am trying to figure out what we should do next - let me know what you think.

Here's some info about us - let me know if you have any questions.

28 years old.  No kids yet but probably in about 4-5 years.

Household income: ~$205,000.  

Retirement: We have about $120,000 in our retirement accounts.  We have recently become really serious about retirement savings.  I wish I had been more serious a few years ago, but you live, you learn.  We will max out our 401Ks and Roth IRAs this year.  This is the first year we have maxed the 401Ks.  Including employer contributions, we'll be contributing about 25% of our gross pay to retirement accounts, which surely seems like a lot.  I'm wondering at what point we need to create a brokerage account for additional retirement savings.  We are also thinking about contributing to our HSA (we have a HDHP).  We have not made any contributions in the past, but my husband's employer makes contributions into his account.  I'd like any of your thoughts about contributing to the HSA.

Mortgage: We bought our house in 2016.  Put 10% down. 
 Our interest rate is 4.125%, no PMI (our interest rate was a bit higher to basically blend the PMI through the entire mortgage period).  $490,000 left on the mortgage, house is worth ~$570,000.  Monthly payment, including taxes and insurance, is $3,000.  We have not made any additional principal payments, but I wonder when we should start doing that.  I expect that we will be in our house for another 5-7 years or so, could be longer, but I don't think this will be our forever home.

Car loan: $7,000 left on the loan, 0%.  Monthly payments are only $250.  We are very debt averse, but honestly the monthly payments are so small and the car is worth probably around $12,000 so I can't really see the value in paying it off.  Please give me a reality check if I need one.

No more student loans.  Paid down $70,000 at the beginning of this year.  That was an awesome feeling!!

No other debt and never intend to have any debt other than a mortgage again.

We have an emergency fund of a little over 3 months expenses ($20,000).  We cut it in half to pay off the last of the student loans a few months ago and just got this back to being fully funded.

At the end of each month, after all of our expenses and retirement contributions, we have about $2,500 that is not budgeted so what should we be doing with that money now that we have paid off all our student loans and are maxing our retirement accounts?  Ideas:

- Should we be making additional mortgage principal payments?

- Should we contribute to our HSA?

- Should we get started saving in a 529?  No kids yet but we do intend to have children and want to fully pay for their college education.

- Should we set up a brokerage account for additional retirement savings?

- We'd like to buy new cars and do some home improvements and could be saving up for those.  Not sure if it's appropriate to put that much money towards this goal though.

- Should we pay off the car loan? 

- Anything else we should be thinking about?

Thank you so much for your help!  I appreciate any advice/pointers/information that you can share!",finance
personalfinance,"What are my chances at getting a mortgage? If I'm approved, how bad will the interest rate be? Who to approach for a mortgage? How much will I need to put down?","My credit is currently pretty poor (my score is 579, my wife has a score of 602) a legal issue, medical problems and, an IRS lien hit my wife and I pretty hard about 5 years ago.  Since then everything but one item (credit card debt) has since been resolved.


My current situation:

I made around $57k last year, my work is considered recession proof and I have never had a problem finding a job.  I know for a fact I can make more (I have made a lot more) but I want to devote more of my time to family.  I do side work on a regular basis, for the past two years I've hidden 1/2 the profit from it on an American Express Serve card that I never use, the balance is around $13k.  My ""regular"" savings is around $4k, not including retirement.  I won't touch my retirement Roth IRA and nobody can make me, the amount there makes no difference until I can no longer work; treat this as a zero, I won't touch my meager retirement.

My wife is unemployed due to a disability (MS, she is also a MODY diabetic) but she has her SSDI hearing this month and everyone involved believes she will receive disability (doctors, PT, her lawyer), we expect an initial payout of $16k after attorneys fees and around $1000/month once she is approved.  

My bills:

$950/ month rent in a very nice area, I pay less than 95% of other renters in the area, the other 5% rents from their parents.  

$520/month utilities (gas, electric, internet), I pay a lower rent because I live in a house that is a hunk of shit that looks OK in a very nice area.  I did a ton of work as a deposit before moving in before the house could be habitable.  Nothing involving insulation or HVAC has been done to this home unless it has been absolutely necessary. 

$410/month on a horrible auto loan at $24.99% APR for the next 40 months.  I know for a fact that a lot of of people reading this will be disgusted my choice; but, I just need to make sure I have a reliable vehicle to get to work and to my wife doctors appointments.  I have been paying an extra $20/month and an extra payment in December since I indentured myself towards the car.

$570/month medical insurance, decent plan.

$240/month insurance (renters, auto, life), I'm technically overinsured but $70 of that goes towards extra investment on my life insurance policy.  I can go into why I'm overinsured, it involves an awkward accident with someone in a Mazerati that wasn't my fault, my wife is a pretty crappy driver as well.

$110/month for my wife's MS and diabetes meds/copays/deductible.  

We eat/ live a pretty humble existence.



I was offered a solid home from between $50-60k from an in law, I helped restore the home and know it was done right and can pass any inspection and would appraise for more than the sale price; my utilities bills would be cut in half.  I know I can comfortably put down 10% with enough money to cover closing costs/expenses.  I've been scraping by trying to cover rent in order to make sure my kids went to good schools, I'm just looking to find a place I can call home and build off of.


This would be the first time I bought a home.


Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,"$110,000 in student debt. Want opinions and advice on my situation.","Hi r/personalfinance. As the title says I have a lot of student debt. After a few months of being in a funk with that number over my head I'm starting to feel like I can tackle my loans within the next 5 years. Problem is I've been the only one looking it looking over and want some opinions and advice from other more experienced people. I'll list the details below. Let me know what you think.

- Private Loans: $81,000 @ 6.4%
- Federal Loans: $28,000 @ 5%
- Salary: $72,000

I'm refining my expenses, but here is what I have so far. My rent is $375/month with estimated utilities of $75/month. I spend about $250/month on food. Matching 401k costs about $275/month. I spend about $200/month on insurance. Then various other expenses rounded to $100/month.

So after taxes and expenses I estimate I can put about $3000/month towards my loans. My conservative estimate is 5 years to pay off the loans, my stretch goal is around 3. I'm looking into some ways to make that 3 years happen; part time job, some company stock options, cutting expenses etc. Like I said earlier, I haven't really talked with anyone about my loans and a 2nd or 3rd opinion would help me feel better about my position.

A credit card with the highest interest, balance or utilization?","I have 4 cards and I'm about to get a $5000 deposit into my checking account to next week after selling off some stocks and I'm looking to pay down some of my cc debt with that money. 

However, I'm having trouble decided which card to pay down first. According to  most so-called expert advice, they recommend paying down the card with the highest interest rate. 

In my case, I'm not sure if that's the right thing to do since 2 of my other cards carry a higher balance and one is at 100% utilization. 

For those of you that actually have been in this situation or you're a professional in the field of finance, what would be your recommendation on how to handle this?

EDIT:  Forgot to add the balances and interest rates.

* Card #1 (100% utilization): $5000 limit with a 12% APR
* Card #2 (70% utilization): $10,000 limit with 18% APR
* Card #3 (70 % utilization) $3000 limit with 21% APR
* Card #4: (60% utilization) $5000 limit with 0% APR until July 2018. After that it goes to 17% APR.",finance

personalfinance,When is debt consolidation a good option? Who can you trust? What if you don't need full term?,"Hiya money-savvy folks! First sorry for username, former redditor, recreated account and accidentally hit next :/ welp!

So I'm 27 and for the past two years I've been a little lax with my spending- send the wolves! I've definitely reached a point where I need to pump the breaks and get out of credit card debt. It's a little tricky though because I recently took a new job with a significant pay cut and without benefits so my pay is down and expenses increased- send the dragons! Sounds super dumb but I do believe it's temporary on income front. Also I am getting some assistance from a generous parent on health front. Those baby boomers and their trust funds! Also I do contract work and babysitting regularly.

So, here are the deets. 

Employment monthly income- $2336 + $100 stipend

Monthly contract and babysitting income- $100-$500

Help with insurance- $200

Expenses:

Rent- $775 (planning on moving in Feb when lease is up)

Car- $218 (~$8.5k remaining)

Car insurance- $162

Student loans- $154 (income based repayments for  ~$12k federal loans)

Health insurance- $487 (COBRA, can't go to marketplace, only one plan that requires $7500 out of pocket before benefits kick in)

Cell phone- $36

Internet- $40

Pets- $50

Utilities- $60

Contacts- $30

Prescription- $50

Gas- $45

Netflix-$10 

Food/entertainment- $150 (I'm an extrovert, so staying in is hard but I realize I can do better)

Didn't include shopping, dry cleaning, alterations, car repair, doc visits (I have autoimmune disease), vet visits + meds, laundry because I've been avoiding them all! Or finding for free, laundry and food are really the only things I can get though. Looking for assistance elsewhere (pets, dental) but get turned away for income. They don't know me!

Debt (err, whyyy soo stupid)

AMEX $7019/ $7800 limit (13%)- $192 minimum 
I stopped using this several months ago so the balance is down $600ish

US Bank REI MC $5455/ $5600 limit (18%)- $127 minimum. 

Credit Union VISA $816.70/ $1k limit (13%) - $25 minimum 

I pay more than the minimum when I can but sometimes that leaves me with no cash towards pay day and the cycle continues. All on me of course... Bad budgeting. I've stopped using all of these since June 15th but have depleted my savings (flat tire, ACA application fee, nonprofit contributions- serve on board) and some money set aside for insurance/medical expenses. 

I'm trying to decide if I should take out a personal loan, or consolidate somehow, seems like that's a popular option, but I am hesitant for two reasons. I think I can pay off the debt on quicker terms than offered (36 mos) because I anticipate pay increases (if not at current job in next year, can jump ship), so I don't want to get penalized for that. Also, that crazy money guy with the three steps thing, he says that loans are bad because you're just taking out more borrowed money essentially, so the behavior won't change. Two, I cannot tell who to trust! So many companies seem like predatory operations I'm afraid to contact anyone or provide any info. 

I'd prefer a zero interest credit card to transfer it to but am afraid I've harmed my credit too severely, ~~648~~ 684 :(( and to think my car loan is at 1.9%... Shame, boat loads of shame. 

HALP

Would appreciate any hand holding/guidance. Having a hard time navigating Google, although I tried, and again, afraid to contract any credit counseling agency because of scan reports.

Much appreciated!

personalfinance,Paying off credit card: Mortgage a possible solution?,"I'm trying to manage my finances for the first time. I read the wiki page and know my #1 priority is to pay the credit card off, and I know that the most popular advice on this matter is to transfer the balance to a 0% APR for 1 year with $0 balance transfer fee card. We currently have almost $7k on a card with a 24% interest rate. 

My husband and I bought and renovated a house this year, and we used my husband's father's line of credit to do so. We've been paying back $1000/ month. The balance on the line of credit is $111,204 at 3.85%. 

My husband has talked about getting a mortgage to achieve 3 goals: pay back his father, pay off the credit card, and finish the remodel (we still need a new roof and maybe siding). I'm not sure if this is relevant, but my husband is a carpenter so he's done all the renovations himself. We only plan to stay in this house for about 5-7 years; it's kind of like a long term flip that he's planning to profit from. 

Do any of you have an opinion on getting a mortgage? I don't know what a monthly payment or interest rate would be, or if using it to pay off the credit card and do more projects would hurt us in the long run. 

If the mortgage seems like a bad plan, I'd do the credit card balance transfer, continue to pay back my husband's father as we have been, and then save up for the roof.",finance

personalfinance,Will start first real job in August and looking for a critique of my financial plans,"So I'm about to turn 25 this month and I just graduated in May. I will start a job in August for about 70k a year. I live with my parents and plan on living with them for about 2-3 years before moving out to take care of student loans.

I took out about 100k total. 18k is through the government FAFSA.
82k is from a home equity loan my parents took on for me. Today the home equity loan is at about 74k.
My grandma gave tens of thousands to my parents for my school loans, but I think they used most of it for the house mortgage because the interest rate for the mortgage is higher, like above 7%, I believe. I'm not that pissed, they offered to handle over 50k debt themselves.
My dad says that the 74K is not all my loans, but I don't know how much of it IS mine, and I'd rather have it gone.

Half of my 18k has interest rate of 3.8%
The other half has interest rate of 4.3%
The 74k loan has about 5.6%

My parents said they want me to take care of the 18K loans through the government, and that they would take care of the 74K. I THINK they can do it. My mom is a software engineer (we all are), and she's launching an app during the winter. She has made no income for 2.5 years. If it makes tons of money, great. If not, she said that she would go back to the workforce, where she can probably make 100k easily due to her vast experience.

My dad makes 100k, but my parents go into debt quite easily, which I am concerned about. We are house poor.

I plan on living with my parents to see if my mom's app pans out. If it does, I'll probably move out in a couple months after my 26th birthday. If not, then perhaps longer.

We live in DTLA, so rent isn't exactly cheap, although I'm not opposed to living in a dump temporarily.

My mom isn't using her car much, so she said that I could use hers, and that she would just uber everywhere. I just have to take care of the gas and maintenence.

I screwed up my spine working out last year, but it was minor enough to not require surgery, and I just got an epidural injection. I went to a chiropractor, and he said I should be fine in about 3 months of intensive therapy. After that monthly visits should suffice. I'm planning on paying for all of that. Easily hundreds of dollars a month.

I have about 1500 saved in the bank.

My parents said that I didn't have to pay rent even though I offered like 200 a month so that I could save money. I was planning on maxing out my 401k and Roth IRA, leave a couple hundred for gas and other essentials, and then throw the rest at the student loan debt. I should be able to pay off the 18K in like 10 months with this plan I believe. Then if my parents are struggling with the 74k, then I'll simply lower my contributions to the match my company gives and throw like 85% of my take home pay at the home equity loan.

As for romance, I never really had luck in the first place, and this is more important to me than women right now. I'm talking to a couple girls online or through apps, but nothing serious at all. Never had a gf.

Any suggestions, or do you think my plan is solid?

personalfinance,Question for those with experience/trying to tackle student loan debt,"So a little background:
98k private @6.8%
About 20k left federal with interest rates between 4-6% (bunch of smaller loans that I've added together for simplicity) 

Not eligible for student loan forgiveness on federal and make 80k a year before night differentials and premium pay (25% on Sundays/overtime). Currently contributing 10% to retirement with 5% matching which I know I can lower to just the 5%while repaying but would prefer not to if it can be avoided.

EDIT: as a follow up question I have about 18k currently in my retirement fund... would it be worth taking a loan out of the retirement to pay off a student loan?

personalfinance,Considering a car lease.. help?,"Hi everyone,

I'm considering turning in my vehicle that I am currently financing becuase the monthly payments and interest are too high. I financed this vehicle at a time when I didn't have much credit or income. I now have a credit score in the 700's and am considering leasing for 36 months and for lower monthly payments. Anybody have any advice? I've looked up info online and I know not to put down more than $1,000 on the car, but I'm hoping I can maybe cut my current car payment in half with lower interest. I currently pay $400 a month with about 9% interest for my car that I'm financing. I know it was stupid, but I was young and naive and really needed a car after mine broke down and I'm trying to get a better car deal now. Can you guys tell me what a good interest rate would be? Or if leasing is a good option?Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,"401(k) early withdrawal, when is 10% penalty applied?","I had $6,475.73 sitting in a state 401k plan that I had with a university job a few years ago and decided to withdraw it to pay some debts. I know, terrible idea. I didn't come here to ask for advice, and it's already done, so let's just skip that part.

The question I have is about the taxes and penalties withheld. My deposit ended up being $4856.79, with $1,295.15 (20%) federal tax withheld, and $323.79 state (5%), but that's it.

I'm assuming I'll owe the 10% penalty later, probably at tax time next year? I was hoping it would all be taken out at once, so I wouldn't have to worry about saving till next year to cover the extra tax.

EDIT: thinking about it more, if it is part of income tax filing next year, it will probably just be deducted from whatever return I end up with...right?",finance
personalfinance,Needing some help planning some near-future decisions.,"I've been doing a lot of search the past month about finance, student loans, and career choices but I'm needing some advice for my situation.

**Basic Information**
22M, just graduated from a private liberal arts college in the Midwest, BA in Religion (Yes, I know. They sold me well on the ""just get a degree doing what interests you""). $47.4K in student loans (All federal, minimum 10yr monthly = ~$500). No other debt. I have worked for the college's IT Dept. all four years and while not doing much I have done basic installations and data entry for inventory. Outside of that I have helped teach martial arts to kids (ages 4-15) and adults for ~6 years as well as teach general P.E. to friends and relatives (programming, nutrition, form, etc.).

**Next Year**
I am moving to Madrid, Spain to teach English from Oct.-June. Pay is enough to live like a student but not really save up anything significant. I have the option to do a renewal after my first year. I am semi-fluent in Spanish right now and am planning on being fully fluent by the end of the first year.

**Future Time**
After that program my plan is to teach English in China because the benefits are great and COL so low that I can throw $1000-2000 a month towards my student loans while living a fairly middle-class lifestyle. The thing is to completely pay off my loans it would take anywhere from 2-4 years. In that time there is a possibility for me to move up to a middle management position in schools (recruiting/training teachers, making schedules, coordinating between Chinese and foreign teachers)
This means that I will essentially be out of the job market for 4-6 years will minimal experience outside of Spanish and/or Mandarin Chinese and some foreign management skills.

**Questions**
I have a lot.
1. Is it wiser for my career prospects to do 1 or 2 years in Spain and then return to the US to start entering into the workforce?  
2.  From everything that I've seen teaching English abroad is seen as a joke by employers for anything more than 2 years postgrad. How would doing that for essentially 2-6 years look to employers? I don't really want to be a guy close to 30 working entry level because I've been ""bumming it"" across the world.  
3. Would it be better to go to Spain, return home and work a real job for a couple years, and then go to Asia to pay off significant chunks of my debt?  
4. I would ideally like to move to a larger city than where I am now (~225,000 pop.). I know first jobs suck but how could I leverage my skills to make, let's say, $45K salary after 2-3 years? I don't have an interest in learning coding/programming. 

**Last Part**
Any help is appreciated. Really, my only expectations out of my career is to give me a comfortable salary to save for retirement and allow me to live my generally frugal life.

After I graduated, all I found was an inconsistent part-time job in my field so I was living paycheck to paycheck. So when it was time to start paying the loans, I could not and just ignored them. Yay for responsibility!

Anyways, I also am very unorganized and do not know anything about the loans. I think I probably lost all the paperwork when I graduated. Now I have a full-time position and have been saving up a good chunk of money. These loans are at least a few years overdue. So here are my questions. 

I went to ITT Tech, which is now gone because they were doing bad things with federal funds. Is there a way I could get student loan forgiveness or only pay a % of the loans?

If I go to a debt consolidator, as there are multiple loans and I have a few other outstanding debts, could they find out everything that I owe and get it situated so I can start paying it back?

Any other advice is also appreciated. Thank you all who help! Please don't shame me, I know I am very irresponsible and I want to start getting things in order. The first step is asking for help.

Now it is not so we are only going to own one car as on Monday we will both be working at the same company and in August are moving to an apartment 3 miles away from that company. So we need a car, for when we go one town over to visit family, emergencies, and because public transportation is abysmal. But we want it to be a car that lasts forever.

I recently used what was to be the down payment on my car purchase and paid off my husband's car loan that was at a 3.9% interest rate. Our current loan that I have is 1.9% and there is a $48,000.00 balance. 65 months left on the loan. This is our only other debt besides our mortgage.

I am torn on if I should go ahead and pay it off with my excess cash or if I should put it towards our mortgage or perhaps invest.

We do have the desire to move into a larger home within the next 3 to 5 years. We will likely have, after all fees associated with selling our home approx. $90 to 100K in home equity. Prices for homes in our area that will meet what we want long-term are $600-900K range. 

Our mortgage has a $164K balance at a 4.55% interest rate.

personalfinance,(CAN) Outstanding Tuition Balance Preventing me from Enrolling and Finishing my Degree,"I have an outstanding tuition balance of $5200.  That means I registered for and attended courses that I did not cover out of pocket or through student loans.  I was not denied student loans, I just stupidly let the window for application pass.  I got a letter saying that this debt will be referred to a collection agency on July 18th, in a little over a week.  This debt will prevent me from enrolling in courses in September and undertaking the final year of my bachelor's degree.  

I *also* have student loan debt from previous semesters: $9200 federal and $8700 provincial.  I'm not entirely sure why, but these loans have been ""in repayment"" since November 2016, meaning that together they have been taking $200 from my bank account monthly for the last eight months.  These loans should not be in repayment yet, as I was registered in and attending classes through this past academic year.  I never sent proof of enrollment, and so presumably they started collecting.  

Ten minutes ago I ""confirmed my enrollment"" from this past year.  The school must also confirm my enrollment. Unfortunately, because of the outstanding tuition balance, they may refuse to do any paperwork for me.  So it may not be possible for me to confirm that enrollment, and I will not be able to defer its repayment.  I would like to defer its repayment until after I have repaid more demanding debt, and ideally until I have finished my degree and have access to improved income.  

I also have $700 of credit card debt.  My credit limit on this card is $2200.  I've had this credit card a long time and never really been in the red with it.  I have been using it to pay expenses.

Had I simply managed my student loans correctly:

* The outstanding tuition balance would rather be student loan debt, and so would not have been accruing interest or be preventing me from finishing my degree.

* The student loan debt itself would not be ""in repayment"" and not be accruing interest, and not be draining my bank account until after I have my degree. 

* As a result I would have had no credit card debt, and be in the green on my bank account.

I understand the magnitude of my failure.  I was willfully ignorant of my financial situation, and so let this happen.  

I just started a job with full time hours and low pay.  Do you think I should try to get a second job?  My expenses are quite low, since I live at home rent-free and can walk to work.  My phone bill is $7.  I would like to renew my gym membership, and I need to buy a shirt for a wedding.  I was invited to New York in August, only cost being the plane ticket.  I will tell them no.

**Summary**

* Outstanding tuition balance: $5200 (to be referred to a collection agency on July 18th, and will prevent finishing degree)

* Federal Student Loan debt: $9200 (""in repayment"" meaning they are taking money direct from my bank account monthly)

* Provincial Student Loan debt: $8700 (""in repayment"" meaning they are taking money direct from my bank account monthly)

* Credit Card Debt: $700

personalfinance,What Should Be My Next Move (Los Angeles Resident)?,"Howdy all.  So to give a brief rundown of my finances.

**I live in the San Fernando Valley:**

* Credit Score = 760
* Savings = $15k
* Assets = $4k motorcycle (I know, not much)
* Income = $65k (contract-to-hire position as IT analyst)
* Debt = -$6,100 Car lease (will probably do a lease-to-buy)
           -$3,400 Student loan (Not too worried about this, I always attend junior college classes for the deferment and tax break. Plus I genuinely like to learn)

**Monthly Bills**

* $1,500 rent (large 1 bedroom apartment)
* $450 utilities (phone, internet, gas, electricity)
* $125 memberships (gym, yoga) 
* $450 car/motorcycle (lease/own, insurance, gas)
* $600+ food (don't cook too much, want to)
* $50-$100 miscellaneous (leisure - rough est.)

**Monthly Savings** = I probably save about **$250-$500** a month depending on how much I spend on food/leisure.

**Education** = Two AAs (one in Computer Networking, the other in Psychology). I was attending a university to get my BA in Psychology, but decided to hold off and change degrees because I found out **my employer offers full reimbursement**.  I've since changed my degree to something IT related and have hold off attending any further school at the university level, at least **not yet until I'm hired on as full time.**

So recently I've been hit with a travel bug and have set aside some money to travel, but I'm choosing inexpensive places to start off (such as Thailand).  I figured my budget can sustain that... for now.

**So my dilemma is this**: I'm not sure where to go from here.  **I've really been wanting to purchase property as an investment and rent out properties.**  I'm not too interested in owning a piece of property I'm going to live in for the rest of my life for now, and I'd prefer having some type of residual income.  The problem is that I don't have enough for a down payment and don't make enough money.

**Here's some options that come to mind:**

* **Continue education** (I'm relying heavily on my work to hire me next year).  I'll probably end up doing this no matter what - it's just a matter when.  It's a little disheartening it's taking this long for my BS, but whatever.
* **Move in with a roommate somewhere:** It'll save me money in the long run assuming I won't go crazy.
* **Buy a property now and start my property investments:** I really have been wanting to buy for a while now.  Specifically, renting out and having someone else pay the mortgage.  Especially with how interest rates are supposed to be going up.  I feel the quicker I can get some residual income, the better
* **Invest in IT certifications/training:** Certifications directly translate to more money in the IT world. I can always invest my time, but the quickest past is training seminars. Because I'm taking a break from school, I wonder if it would be in my best interest to spend the extra cash for these intense trainings that don't come cheap ($1,500+) while I still have free time before I go back to school.
* **Keep saving, budget better, pay off all my debt:** Do I really need to go to yoga and eat out all the time?  No, I'm just  Do I absolutely travel? Nah, but I really want to.
* **Take up a part-time job:** I'm open to anything.

Any advice would be great.  Hopefully something a little more than just paying off my small debt that I have (which I'm using to build up my credit anyways).",finance
personalfinance,Options for paying off student loan,"I have a student loan I've paid down aggressively the past few years and it's almost done.  I technically have the cash to pay it off (~$20K liquid cash reserve), but also just did my yearly Roth contribution and finished a vacation, so I'm reluctant to dip into my reserve.

Student loan has a balance of $3,500 and I'd really like to just be done with it.  Couple options.

1. Pay around $700 a month and be done with the loan before the end of the year.  This would be fine and easy enough, but I also would just like to knock it out for good now.

2. I have a 401K with $90k in it.  Student loan interest rate is 5.375%.  401K loan interest rate is 5.25%, and I understand I pay the interest back to myself.  Is the interest paid to myself a nice way to sneak some extra money into the 401K above the yearly contribution max, which I will hit this year?  I realize I would be missing out on potential growth, but if it lets me sock extra money into the 401K above and beyond the yearly limit, might that be worth it?  Yeah, it won't be much more money.

As I type it out it seems to be making more sense to just make a $700 payment each month and then be done with it instead of making it more complicated.  I guess my question is, would anyone recommend option 2 in these circumstances?",finance

What should I do?","TLDR; was in bad accident, hospital bill went to law firm that reps hospital but law firm doesn't own the debt, the hospital does. Need written payment agreement from law firm for home loan, law firm won't provide it.  What can I do?

In 2010 I was in a bad accident and incapacitated for a pretty long time.  I broke my entire face and was mostly blind and was bed-ridden for 6 months with my jaw wired shut for 9 months.  During this time I had very limited access to anyone who could help me do things like check my mail, and during this time I received a notice that my hospital bill was going to go to collections.  I found out it was in collections when I got the call from the agency barking for payment.  

I called the hospital and they said this happens with traumatic cases all the time and to come in and file an appeal and get it taken out of collections, so I waited until I was well enough to be able to speak and see decently and I had someone drive me to the business office of the hospital to present an appeal.  My appeal was denied.  The man's exact response when I asked why I was being denied when my situation seemed like the exact type that would grant an appeal was: ""Because I don't want to do it"".  OK, whatever, I was glad to be alive and didn't have the energy in me to fight it.

So, ever since, I've been making payments towards the balance.  Well, I recently applied for a special kind of home loan that says any medical debt in collections disqualifies me unless the collections agency will provide a copy of the written agreement.

I called the collections agency and requested a copy of my payment agreement but they said we never had one.  I asked to have one drafted but they refused.  I also asked if they owned the debt and they said ""No, we just represent the hospital"".  

So, my problem is that the mortgage loan officer has told me, in his exact words, ""Without a settlement agreement that says you pay $X per month and have been paying that amount for at least 12 months, we cannot approve you"".

Is there any kind of request I can put in with the collections agency to better negotiate to get a written payment agreement?

Edit:  Well, it's attorney time.  The hospital has no record of me ever being a patient, and the law firm that has been collecting on the creditors behalf was recently found to be in major violation by the CFPB.  From the news headline (Jan 2017):

So I call my bank to be sure ... and I talk to someone new and there actually WAS special insns (ie have to wire to a different bank name, account number, etc then specify my personal checking info after).

I have looked at banks on campus such as Chase and Wells Fargo who will toss the checking account fee by starting a debit card.

Saying this I should also clarify that I have seen other reviews of people complaining about customer service and a lack of communication. While this does scare me somewhat I would just like a comfortable bank that I can stick with ideally the rest of my life (let me know if that's dumb) and it seems with the perks of high interest rates of online banking it's smarter.

After I graduated undergrad I placed my federal loans into a Income based repayment plan.  At the time I had no job so my payments are $0 dollars.  After this was done I landed a job! Woo! I have not updated my lender so my payments have continued to be 0 dollars for the last 6 months.

I start grad school in the fall so when they ask for updated information JAN 1 2018 I will again tell them I have no job as I am in school. 

My question is, is this legal? I obviously have never lied on any forms and can't find anywhere where it says I have a duty to inform outside of JAN every year.

personalfinance,Advice paying back a relatively small amount of student loans?,"So I always see advice for paying back huge amounts of student loan debt, but not as much for a relatively small amount like my situation.  I'll get to the point:


&amp;nbsp;


I have ~$16,500 across 5 student loans.  4 of them are subsidized, 1 is unsubsidized, but I am finished school so this should be irrelevant if I understand the differences correctly.  Loan details:


&amp;nbsp;


* $2300 @ 3.86%
* $4500 @ 4.66%
* $5500 @ 4.29%
* $3000 @ 3.76%
* $1100 @ 3.76%


&amp;nbsp;


I can lower each loan's interest rate by 0.25% by setting up direct deposit, which I plan to take advantage of.  The general adage is aggressively pay off anything over 4%, but is almost half a percent over 4% on a $4500 loan really worth aggressively paying down?  I currently make 60K/yr, and put 30% into my 401K in order to max it.  I put ~$500/mth into an emergency fund, and another $500/mth towards a new car i plan on buying in the near future (6-18months).


&amp;nbsp;


If I followed a 10 year plan, I'd pay ~3600 in interest.  Surely I'd make more by putting the the $500/mth into an IRA after my Emergency fund is in a good spot (currently at $2500, so pretty close to a good spot) as opposed to aggressively paying off?

personalfinance,Feel like too much tax being withheld,"Hello PF,

I'm a bit puzzled here.  Long story short, I hold 2 jobs as a student (one is summer only).  While playing around with the IRS withholding calculator, it said I should be claiming 1 allowance for each.

On 1 job, around 15% is being withheld altogether (FICA+FED+MEDI).  No state is being withheld here, I presume because I am below a certain amount?

On the other one, around 25% is being withheld, (includes state as well).  

I believe I will be receiving a large refund next year which I want to avoid at all costs.  Should revisiting the W4 be the first step?

Thx!

personalfinance,24M Recent college grad new to the real world looking for advice,"Hey /r/personalfinance !
Using a throwaway here because I don't want my financial information on my main account.
Backstory: Bounced around a few schools, took me 6 years in total to graduate. Last month I graduated with my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from a reputable school. I began working two weeks ago in TX after moving from PA. My starting salary is $75,000/yr. My loans are as follows:  
**Federal**  

* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford $8,562.66 6.800%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford $6,224.46 3.860%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford $5,500.00 4.660%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford $2,225.20 4.660%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford $4,598.00 4.290%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford $3,078.56 4.290%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford $2,666.00 3.760%  

Interest rates on these aren't that bad imo. On the 10 year payment plan, I will be making payments of ~$350/mo. I plan on going to the 25 year plan which makes my payments ~$192/mo, and just paying extra each month. My rationale behind this being that I will have more room for my private loans, which are in pretty rough shape and as follows:  
**Private**  

* $26,080 6.74 %
* $17,350 6.49 %
* $27,275 7.99% (!!!)  

**Current Situation:**  
I got my first paycheck today, after taxes it was $2,165. I get paid biweekly, which puts my monthly income at around $4,330 after taxes.   
 
**Living expenses**  

* Rent, trash, and water: $950/mo  
* Auto and renter's insurance: $180/mo  
* Electricity: ~$50/mo, I am expecting this to go down after the summer, and now that I am not running the AC all day it will drop as well  
* Transportation: I drive 90 miles a day for work, and a tank of gas is about $25, so I am spending about $200-$250/mo on gas  
* Internet: $40/mo
* Groceries/beer: $250/mo
* Gym membership: $20/mo  

**Savings**  

* $7,000 emergency fund
* $3,300 in checking currently (rent is paid for this month)

personalfinance,"Father borrowed some money to repair business after Hurricane Sandy, paid some of it off for past 5 years, but all of a sudden hit with a bill of same originally borrowed amount. HELP!","Hello. I just want to write a disclaimer that my parents hardly speak English, and it is quite difficult to grasp the whole situation because of this language barrier. I am also not well versed in the business association or have much knowledge of any financial situation. I'm sure there will be many details missing and lots of misuse of terminology, but I will try my best to explain what I know. I apologize in advance.


So, my father is a small business owner and we live in Long Island, NY. We were hit by Hurricane Sandy, and as a result, my father's store was flooded and damaged. He filed for a loan from the Loan Obligors, Small Business Administration (I believe part of the U.S. Dept of Treasury or something, definitely the U.S. Govt) for $17,000 at a 4% interest rate. Besides all the troubles of bad business, he paid, according to him, around $150/mo for the past 5 years or so.


However, this is where details get kind of shoddy. So during these 5 years or so since Sandy, he says that there would be times where he would pay 1 month, so $150, but there would be other periods of time where he would pay every 2 months, so $300 or so, and others even 3 months. However, he would just pay it, and that would be it. I don't really understand how this works, but according to him, he said for the past couple months, they did not send him a bill or any form to be able to pay. I do not know if that's the reason he couldn't pay, but as a result, this past week, the Dept. of Treasury sent him a bill for basically the same amount that he borrowed originally. They have given us a number to call for us to pay, a Treasury Case Number, Agency Debt Number, and a payment coupon attached at the bottom. What my father wants to know is if it would be possible to call the agent and ask for the remaining principal on the loan, how much the penalty is, if there is any, and if it would be possible to pay it off in small increments, such as he was doing previously.


My father would like me to speak for him to the agent and try to figure out a way to solve this issue. I'm here today to ask for advice in what I can do next, or any steps I can take because in all honesty, I really don't know what to do. Thanks so much for reading.",finance
personalfinance,"22, recent college grad 27K in federal student loans, 139k from Parent PLUS, must help my mother","Reddit Personal Finance,

I have been a long time lurker on this thread, however have never had the need to post anything to Reddit until recently, so it was time to make an account. I apologize in advance if I mess up anything in posting.

I was raised by a single mother who did a phenomenal job, but doesn't manage money all that well. Growing up, things were very tough for her, but she never let us kids know. My brother passed away when I was young followed by my father. Then my grandmother moved in with us to help raise the kids while my mom worked, but began developing Alzheimer's Disease. My mother took it upon herself to take care of my grandmother while working full-time for 7 years straight. This took a toll on everyone, but we were glad to do it. As a kid/teen, I had everything I could hope for, she never let money troubles affect her children, even after a bankruptcy in 2008 and losing our house. 

At the time, she made ~$60,000/year, and contributed moderately into her 401(k). She was a widow for a long time and never dated or anything, only focusing on her kids. Eventually, she met a guy across the country and got married, but she cashed in her 401(k) to move us across country, to a place where her same job only makes ~$40,000/year, but she was finally happy and focused on herself, something we (her kids) supported 100%. I began going to a four year, public university to become a professional pilot shortly after that. I applied to many scholarships, but ended up only getting ~$10,000, for a notoriously expensive degree. I worked full time along with school, but my extra-curricular activities and flying classes meant I did not make enough money at my job to cover anything but food and earn mild college spending cash. I knew student loans were required, and asked her to apply to them for me, but I thought they were all in MY name. Come to find out, only a handful are in my name, of which she says I ""couldn't get any more money in your name"", and had to do a parent PLUS loan. I was fine with this, but knew I didn't want her paying back any of it.

I just logged in to her account after 4 years and just about passed out, despite following PF all the time, I don't know what to do. Please see below:

Recently I got a job in my field, making $40,000/year base pay + between $20,000-$30,000 additional depending on how busy we are flying, but figure around $65,000/year.

Because I read PF all the time, I sometimes tell my parents about what I read, like that rule of thumb for saving for retirement. I asked them how much they had saved, and my step dad has about $50,000 my mom less than $5,000. They are 50 and 51 years old. They live in the moment, each owning nicer cars and motorcycles. They enjoy life, but I am worried of course. I told my mom about my concerns and she says ""I'm not worried, I know I can't retire, I'll work until I'm 80, but I love working anyway."" 

I can't change how they live their life of course, but I do NOT want them to have to pay anything back on these loans. They've offered, but they need to focus on their lives. They could never pay this off anyway.

I have a 740 credit score, should I transfer my mom's loans into my name? Like through SoFi for example? Or should I just pay them the money and have them pay under their name?

Also, should I follow the PF flowchart, which is the plan, or does Reddit recommend a different course of action? Moreover, what other options do I have to pay these off that I may not know about? I plan on living as cheaply as possible.

TL;DR How should I pay for these loans so that my parents are unaffected?

personalfinance,Maximizing my chances at future student loans?,"I've been a pharmacy technician for 8 years now and have been wanting to go to pharmacy school for several years. The only thing stopping me is being able to pay for it. I've treated my credit like garbage in the past. I've been trying to fix it for about a year and a half. 

I'm starting at the community college in the fall for the pharmacy prerequisites. I'll be receiving $0 in financial aid (Thanks!) but I can afford a payment plan on the tuition without any issues. 

But assuming I get into pharmacy school, the tuition will be around $25k a year. Also, since it requires only two years of prerequisites, the first two years are ineligible for graduate federal loans (even though you’re paying a graduate school price), so you can only borrow $12.5k those first two years. So I'll need to borrow another $10k+ to pay for just the tuition. 

So let’s get to my credit problems. I have four credit cards with balances that I’m currently whittling away at. They’ll be at $0 by the end of the year. I had three collections on my credit reports. I tried to get them to agree to a pay-for-delete, but none of them would play ball. Not even when I finally agreed to pay the entire balance. I then tried disputing them and all of them were removed from my TransUnion, but not Equifax. Now Equifax just says the collector verified the debt. I still don’t understand why it was removed from one but not the other. These collections are about 2-3 years old, and will not fall off until around 2022 and by then I’ll be 33. I’d really rather not wait until then to go to college. 

My credit history is still kind of young, and the simulator tools estimate my TransUnion score to only be at 650 after lowering my credit balances to 0 and with no collections. 

To wrap up, I do NOT have access to a cosigner. My parent’s credit is garbage as well. 

What can I do to maximize my chances at getting private loans to pay for this damn education two years from now? It would suck to get accepted and then not be able to even pay for it.

investing,My napkin theory on next market crash.,"Been a lurker of this sub for a while and finally have the gut to post my napkin theory about current inflation and whether we will see a market crash soon.

What is the reason so such a low inflation? Housing market...

http://nypost.com/2017/05/30/us-housing-prices-are-rising-twice-as-fast-as-wages/

Housing market has been pretty crazy for the last few years. Unlike last housing bubble, this time the cause is the lack of supply, not because people are flipping like crazy. The result of this practice is also very different. House value is artificially inflated, home owner has to pay more on property tax. Renter has to pay more for rent. Which leads to less money to spend on other things. Who really makes money? Only those with house for rent. Flippers don’t make that much money anymore because they simply can’t find enough house to flip.

Next clue, people are talking about how Amazon is killing retails. I think it might be only true with other retail stores (furniture, electronics, households, etc.) With clothing companies, it is completely different. I observe the behavior from my friends. It is true that they don’t go to the mall for clothes shopping anymore. Instead, they go to online store of traditional brands such as Macy’s, Nordstrom, The Limited, etc. So they were pretty shocked when they learned that The Limited went bankruptcy. And from all the people that I know, not many shops for clothes from Amazon. I think there are more to the story of clothing stores going bankrupt than just the war between online vs brick and mortar stores.

What I am seeing is the current rate of inflation is very dangerous. Adding on top of that is Fed is raising interest rate. Ya, they are playing it cool to not disturb the market but I am pretty sure the economy is going to implode soon. Probably before year end. Let me know what you think.",finance

personalfinance,Should I take out a loan to pay off my credit card debt? (~$30k),"I have an account with Navy Federal Credit Union, so my loan rates would be relatively low. All combined, my total debt right now is around $30k. I'm 28, my job salary is $36k (but I make bonus commission each month which would bring my actual salary to about $40k give or take). My housing is $837/mo plus electric, washer/dryer usage, so we can round that to $1k. In my city that's on the low end, the average rent is typically well over $1k.

I've acknowledged my debt in the last year, and worked hard to nip problems in the bud. In the last few months I've worked on structuring my budget, and putting aside small amounts into savings and Robinhood (buying index funds, etc., by putting $50 or so per paycheck into the market), while focusing on paying down my debt - but at this point I think it might be best to stall on the investing until I have more of my debt paid off. In fact I'm probably going to sell off about $1k from my stock market portfolio and put it towards my debt next week. I've read some Dave Ramsey books and Tony Robbins' ""Money: Master the Game,"" so I think I'm prepared to re-structure my spending habits (and already have), but it does become discouraging seeing all the debt spread across different accounts. The reason I'm considering taking out a loan is because I do think it will help me feel more structured, and to see a finish line in sight. Having debt spread across multiple cards creates the feeling of drowning. I have 18k on my NFCU card (low APR, under 7 percent), which was racked up when I got out of college and didn't have a job where I could make ends meet. In retrospect it was a series of bad decisions, but I wasn't able to live at home for free, and I struggled to find a decent job for about a year, and all my basics - from groceries to gas to ""fun"" things like going out to the bars on weekends - was put on my credit card. Then I simply ran into many unforeseen expenses in the past couple years - medical (a large portion not covered by insurance for shoulder injury), major auto maintenance bill, etc. - that caused me to rack up another $10k on a Citi card with much higher interest (I think around 13.99%). It was ""backup"" card that suddenly had a huge balance.

If I took out a loan through NFCU I could get it for around 13%, so I'd be paying higher interest than I am with the NFCU credit card, but the benefit would be knowing I can just put $500 or more towards the balance each month and seeing it decrease, rather than feeling like I'm sinking.

What do you guys think? Should I just focus on getting the Citi card paid off and make minimum payments on the NFCU card, or should I take out a loan to consolidate and pay off all my credit cards at once?

I do think I have a good headstart now on structuring my finances in a better way, and budgeting and knowing better than to pay for things I cannot afford no matter what - but one of the things steering me towards taking out a loan and paying off the cards is knowing that I'll be able to just cut them all up and start spending cash and budgeting properly without feeling weighted down.",finance
investing,"With bond yields rising, I have concluded that the best investment right now is short-term bonds or a high yield savings account.","The equity market overvalued. Bonds are mostly overvalued. Gold is tumbling. 

In an environment where interest rates are due to rise, all three of these asset classes will surely see a day of reckoning to come - and that's without a recession in the cards. Central banks are going to be unwinding their balance sheets and I believe they are very serious about it this time around. 

If I were investing new cash today, I personally would put cash into either short-term bonds, a high-yield savings account, a short-term CD, a money market fund, or any mix of the above. I believe that the bull market in both equities and bonds cannot keep going because many central banks have made it clear that the era of easy money is soon coming to a close, which will impact all three of the major asset classes I have cited.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Strategy,"Hey r/personalfinance! 

I'll be finishing up my masters degree this fall and am starting to look at the best way of tackling my student loans. When its all said and done I'll have approximately 50K in federal loans (no private).

I am fortunate to have a job paying 52K a year and should have no problem making the payments on a flat 10 year repayment plan (~$565 per month). However, my loans range from 3.5%-6.8%, and about half of them are over 5% interest. So, I have a strategy that makes sense to me but want to run through you guys.

If I take the 10 year graduated repayment plan option, then my payments would start at $319 for the first two years and grow in steps every 2 years until it reaches ~$954 for years 9 and 10, this plan would result in paying an extra $2,500 in interest over the 10 year repayment term.

However, if I took the 10 year graduated repayment plan but paid $565 every month (the same amount I would be paying under the standard repayment term), then I could apply my extra payments directly to the highest interest rate loans that I have and I believe should reduce the total amount of interest I will be paying over the 10 year term.

In my head this makes a lot of sense but I wanted to make sure I am not missing anything here on downsides to doing this.

currently no other debt, however car is on the end of its life, looking at options but would not be incurring more than 10K for a car loan

personalfinance,I recently moved from VA to MD to begin a new job. My HR guy said I have to pay taxes to MD and VA. Should I change my residency?,"I started a job through the federal government and I am paid on a ""taxable grant"". The fed doesn't withhold taxes from my monthly paycheck, so I have to manage my money over the year in order to pay taxes when it's time. 

I recently moved from VA to MD, but am only registered as a resident in VA. When I started my job, my HR director said I would have to pay taxes in both states, since I will be living in MD for the next two years at least.

financialindependence,Federal Couple on FIRE?,"Good afternoon, all. 

I believe my wife and I (36 and 37, respectively) are well on our way to a comfortable early retirement. 

The question remains, how soon will one or both of us be able to retire and, as a dual federal couple, what considerations should play an important role in that decision.

Based upon the information below, is there anything you might tweak?

Our current net worth is ~ $1,100,000.

- Checking Account (Big Bank): ~ $3,000

- Money Market Savings Account (Big Bank): ~ $124,000 (Emergency fund; also used for contributions to my wife’s and my annual “Backdoor” Roth IRAs, annual contributions to our children's 529 plans, and for use toward the down payment on a home –- in a year or two)

- Taxable Investments (Vanguard): ~ $310,000 (50% TSM, 50% ITTE Bond)

- Nevada/Vanguard 529 Plan: ~ $55,000 (65% TSM, 35% TBM)

- Nevada/Vanguard 529 Plan: ~ $16,500 (65% TSM, 35% TBM)

- Roth IRAs (Vanguard): ~ $158,500 combined (100% TSM)

- Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Accounts: ~ $457,000 combined (35% C, 35% S, 20% G, and 10% F = 70/30)

Combined Annual Income: ~ $220,000

Federal Tax Bracket: 28% (Married filing jointly)

State: Missouri

Monthly Take-Home Pay: ~ $8,300 (after taxes, maximum TSP contributions, Dependent Care FSA contributions, Health Care FSA contributions, etc.)

Monthly Expenses: ~ $6,500 (Mostly rent (~ $1,900) and daycare (~ $2,700))

Debt: None

Our children are 3.5 years old child and 6 months old. And we're all done! ;)

Currently, my wife and I both maximize our annual Traditional TSP contributions ($18,000 each) and fully fund our “Backdoor” Roth IRAs ($5,500 each/year). We are also contributing $16,000/year to our younger child's 529 plan, the maximum for state tax deduction purposes.

What I cannot seem to figure out is how the (retirement) benefits of being federal government employees (with FERS pensions and TSP accounts) can/should/does affect the approximate savings amount at which we will reach financial independence and/or the year in which one or both of us can/should consider retiring.

My wife has almost 11 years in the system with an annual salary of ~ $120,000 (plus a small bonus). 

I have approximately 7.5 years in the system with an annual salary of ~ $95,000.

Our retirement funds will come from our FERS pensions, TSPs, Roth IRAs, social security, and taxable investments.

I cannot imagine we would need more than $75,000/year to live comfortably during retirement.

personalfinance,(US) I have not been paying my taxes.,"I'm hoping someone can shed some light on how I can make the situation work for the best.

personalfinance,How to Avoid Health Insurance Denials,"I've noticed a couple of threads here on PF from insured people who end up stuck with a huge hospital bill. I am a claims analyst for a major hospital in the United States, so I thought I might offer some advice.

Every major insurance company (Blue Cross, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, Humana, and Aetna are the top 5) has a contract with a hospital. This contract details the rates at which certain claims are paid and the administrative guidelines a hospital must follow in order to get claims paid.

Approximately 95% of a hospital's claims will get paid correctly or without any *major* denials. The remaining 5% are more or less avoidable because they involve certain breaches to said contracts (whether it's from the hospital or insurance company itself)

What are the major reasons your insurance will refuse to pay your hospital bill?

**The hospital didn't get authorization for your treatment.** 

All this means is that nobody at the hospital called your insurance company asking if it's okay to treat you (as determined by your eligibility, medical necessity, etc.). Once an insurance company approves of such treatment, they will give your hospital an authorization number that is to be printed on the bill. 

As a patient/consumer, you can call your insurance company before a major procedure is scheduled at any hospital/clinic and request to know if authorization was obtained. Be sure to give them the EXACT date you're supposed to be treated. If they don't have authorization on file, do not hesitate to contact the hospital and let them know.

Sometimes authorization can be tricky. For example, most insurance companies require that authorization be obtained within 48hrs of an ER visit. Not every patient is going to have their insurance card on them, so another precaution is making sure you know your insurance ID or having the card handy at all times.

**You didn't update your Coordination of Benefits datasheet.**

Nearly every insurance company requires that you tell them about other insurance coverage you may have. This is called your Coordination of Benefits (COB). As a rule of thumb, it's always good to update it yearly--some insurance companies even require this (lookin' at you, Cigna). Even if it's just to say ""I have no other insurance but this one,"" it could result in you not being stuck with a hospital bill.

Hospitals are often forced to eat the costs of expensive treatment if insurance companies don't hear from a patient. That's why it's always important to read why a hospital may be pursuing you for what it most likely going to be Bad Debt. Hospitals don't want you to pay either (they know you can't), so if you're stuck with a huge bill simply because your insurance company said you didn't inform them of other insurance, more likely than not, you can simply update them over the phone and have the claim reprocessed.

**You Received Treatment You're not Eligible For**

You don't typically see this as often because hospitals are pretty good about confirming your eligibility. But as an extra precaution, always check your Member Policy to see if you're covered to (A) go to a certain hospital, it must be in-network and (B) receive whatever treatment you're getting.

For example, I've had several claims from ACA Blue Cross Exchange insurance plans deny for being non-emergent. Why? Because those plans are strict about their members using only in-network hospitals except for emergency treatment. However, Blue Cross is the only insurance company that I know of that denies out of network claims because they're deemed ""non-emergent.""

Always make sure you know which healthcare providers in your area or outside of your area if you travel a lot is actually IN-network. 
_____________

Now let's say you end up being stuck with a huge bill because your insurance company deems your treatment not medically necessary. You as a consumer have the **right to appeal**. What that means is that you can send a letter to your insurance company detailing why their denial is unfair.

Your hospital will also dispute denials. So if you don't personally want to appeal, you can request that your hospital appeal on your behalf. This is a better option because the hospital will understand why it chose to give you a certain treatment or bill it in a certain way more than you do. Plus, your hospital can send medical records for review by clinicians staffed at your insurance company.

The most important note about appeals is that **you must submit them timely**. Every insurance company has what's called ""Timely Filing Adjudication."" That means you must dispute denials within a certain timeframe. Know what your time frame is. The lowest I've seen is 180 days (Aetna/Cigna) up to a full year (UHC/Humana). Blue Cross is tricky because it varies state to state. But all of it should be mentioned in your member policy.

This information is the first to come to mind when it comes to insurance denials. Please let me know if you have any questions! :)",finance

My family also owns a small business which I work at during the summer and have finally made a budget and stuck to it, so I have been working 45-50 hour weeks so pay has been super nice. 
So as of the end of the summer I will have 1,400 in checking (food and spending money), 600-650 in a separate checking account that is for my student loan interest payments for the year, and 4,700 ish in a discover savings account, I also have 100 in a local savings account making .01% a year. 
My expenses for the year will be as followed
 + Rent with utilities – 330 (this is the most it could be)
 + Food – 150-200
 + Spending cash and dates – 50-60
Which would be 590 tops a month.

I am looking to work during the year as I did last year and should make 9-11 dollars an hour and work 15-20 hours a week.
 + Work – 460.38 – 736.38 (varies because of hours and pay)
 + Parents – 150 (help me with food)

I have roughly £12k of savings which I'm looking to invest. Here in the UK current accounts actually offer the best interest rates going. So far I have opened several current bank accounts which offer high interest rates up to a certain amount (two accounts offering 2% upto £5000, and one offering 5% upto £2500).

My plan is to max out these 3 current accounts and let my money grow this way.

I've calculated I'd get about £253 interest over a year using this method.

I don't want to lock it away for any more than a year as i plan to use this for a House deposit in the next 6-12 months.

Is there a more efficient way of saving this money for maximum growth?",finance

Her WF credit card has $16,500 balance on it &amp; she also has a care credit (medical credit card) that has $2,400 balance.

Her APR is floating on her WF CC but is at 16% now, the problem is she took out cash advances over the years of $6,000 with a 24% interest rate.

personalfinance,Investing vs Student Loans,"Hi all. I'm faced with a financial decision and hoping you can help with it. My significant other is starting university in the fall. He has about 3 years left before graduating. His tuition will be cheap enough that I could help cover it and he can avoid taking out loans. We are both debt-free, and it would be nice to stay that way.

I'm wondering if we are missing out on an opportunity here though. He could take out a subsidized loan with 0% interest until he graduates in three years, and I could invest or place in a CD the money that I would have spent on helping him through school. Then I could withdraw/liquidate the funds and pay off his loan right before he graduates, and keep the interest earned. Does this make sense to do? I know that short term investing has a lot of votality, and in this case I'm somewhat risk averse, so a CD may be a better option. But how much would the principle and interest rate have to be to make this ordeal worth it? Does anyone have resources for me to read or formulas I can use to calculate potential returns?

Thanks for your help!",finance

personalfinance,Untaxed Paychecks,"I've been working at the gym on my university's campus for about 4 months now. I'm hired as a part-time worker, and have an S2 filing status. 

Recently I've been talking to some of my fellow coworkers about our hours and paychecks. One of them mentioned how having his paycheck taxed was inconveniencing him in paying his rent on time, buying groceries, etc. 

After looking at my direct deposit pay stubs and doing the math with the hours I was scheduled, it seems like my checks haven't been taxed. I haven't seen any amounts on my pay stubs being deducted for any sort of tax like my friends have, and my deposit amounts are always (hours x wage). 

Is my employer doing something wrong? Do university jobs not have to tax their hourly employees? Or am I just getting lucky?

Edit for more detail: my employer let me know that there are three classifications for part-time workers: hourly, FWS (Federal Work Study), and APS (Academic Placement Scholarship). FWS employees' wages equal out to the amount that is deducted from their tuition fees, and APS employees have no hourly wage. 

UPDATE: I filled out a new W-4 form and told my parents about the situation. My mother said she was in this situation once and had to take out a loan to pay back the expenses. Is there a way that I can calculate how much I'll owe for the checks that haven't been taxed correctly?",finance
personalfinance,Pros/Cons of Refinancing to pay off crippling debt,"Hi! I'm considering refinancing a low-interest mortgage to cash out part of my equity to pay off school loan debt, which I'm struggling to afford monthly.

4 years ago I bought a condo for $125,000 in downtown Denver that I estimate to be worth $190,000 today. I owe $110,000. I'm currently renting it out. 

2 years ago I decided I was unhappy with my career, quit my job and went back to school, taking out student loans. I worked HARD and I happily beat out a few other more experienced candidates to land a broadcasting gig in a small market my last week of school! yay! :)

BUT since I'm in a highly competitive field and need to work my up, I had to move across country to a small town where I'm being paid MUCH less than I was in my big city sales job 4 years ago. Now my student loans for this 'dream job' are entering repayment at about $800 a month and they are high compared to my current salary of $25,000. 

A friend suggested that even if my interest rate went up on my mortgage, considering a refinance so that I can pay off the schools loans w my equity cash out could take away the current burden of the student loans might be a good idea. What are your thoughts?


Cons:

-Real estate prices could plummet ala 2008 and I'd owe more than my place is worth. 

-My mortgage is 3.5% with no PMI and current interest rates are higher. 

-I've had my mortgage for 4.5 years and understand my amortization schedule will reset. 

-Over the span of my lifetime, doing this will cost me more money to relieve the pressure of these payments that I feel right now. 



Pros:

-I can cash out just SOME of my equity to pay off ALL of my 40k school loans. 

-Not live in an anxiety ridden paycheck-to-paycheck state right now. 

-I have an excellent credit score, so I shouldn't have to struggle to find a decent loan.

-In theory, as I advance in my career and my salary increases in this field, I will be at a better place financially later compared to where I am now as entry-level.

TL;DR:

MY SALARY&lt;SCHOOL LOAN PAYMENTS 
EQUITY&gt;SCHOOL LOANS 


Are there any cons that I'm missing that could make me reconsider this decision and do you have any suggestions on where the best place for me to start with talking to lenders about refinancing would be?

Thank you!

personalfinance,EU-&gt;USA Green card. Need help setting shop in the USA,"Recent Green Card diversity lottery winner. Have to arrive in the USA in a matter of few months (otherwise the visa expires).

From the moment I land I'll be a permanent resident, that means all the obligations of citizens but not exactly all the rights.

I have a SSN card that states (not valid for work unless with INS authorization, paraphrasing) but from the moment I land I am legally entitled to work on almost anything (bar government security clearance and maybe public service)

My plan is, land in the USA, finalize the process, stay a few months, get back, sell my house and then physically relocate permanently.

* What's the easiest way to get a bank account in the USA? I have lived there some 20 years ago, had an account but closed it after 1 year, when I left.

* Can  I open a bank account with a mail-forward address?

* Is it possible that I have a credit history? How could I check that (preferably for free)? I had a debit card when I lived there and have never had any credit problem, USA or elsewhere.

* If I don't have a credit history, what's the best way to establish one? I don't mind outrageous interest rates on credit cards since I always pay in full each month. The pay in full possibility is a must.

* What are the best ways for me to transfer my money (and should I)? When I left I transferred my money back and it was a mess. It almost got lost and got to my banking branch with only my (partial) name and no account number information.

* I have bank accounts in Europe (both my country of residence and another country). All are legal and I pay tax on the entire thing. After moving to the USA, do I need to change my addresses on those?

* I know I have to declare those accounts and balance amounts [FBAR](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar). Will I get into trouble if I declare them but haven't updated the address with the bank?

I'll try to make is as tl;dr as possible.

I make 45k/yr and my SO makes 38k. We live together and split bills down the line as much as possible. I've got about 5k saved up, dunno about him. I've got about 50k in student debt (14 small loans with different interest rates), he's got zero.

I'll be honest, I don't know what our monthly bills total. I think he has a better idea than I do but so far our strategy has been that if we are able to pay bills and not feel stressed then we are fine. At this point though I feel like we aren't being efficient with our money and I want to improve our situation, especially because we need the ability and income to pick up and move to a different city. 

In conclusion, I am looking for advice on how to better manage our household finances and perhaps on how to form/stick to financial goals.

personalfinance,Just had my first baby and want to change my Life Insurance.,"I have a ""builder"" Indexed Universal Life policy (after doing some research, I realize that this was probably a mistake). My current IUL has a 50k death benefit, plus an accumulation value of ~5k. I've had the policy for about 5 years. I pay $131 per month, and my surrender value is ~4,100. Fixed Account Interest rate 3.75%.

Just had my first kid, and I am currently married. I am a very healthy 34yo. I'd like at least enough of a policy to pay off my ~250k mortgage and enough to sustain my wife and daughter for a period of time. Will probably get a policy for my wife as well (same situation). 

I believe based on my research that I need a Term Life policy. 

My questions are as follows: Am I correct in that I need a Term Life Policy? Does it make sense to close/cancel the account, take the surrender value and switch to a term life insurance policy? How much life insurance do I need? How should I go about looking for the Life policy? Should I find a broker?

So, I'm looking to move my emergency funds to a bank that pays interest.  Some sites have led me to believe I can get 1.3%, but reading reviews of these banks like UFBdirect and Ally and others, I'm nervous to sign up as it sounds like service is awful and the process is not smooth.

Anyone have a good experience finding a higher interest rate?  Any suggestions on the balance between security, convenience, customer services and interest rates?

personalfinance,Looking for Excel spreadsheet template to evaluate ROI on rental properties (CAN),"I'm thinking of buying a multi-unit rental property, living in one of the suites and renting out the rest.

- purchase price
- downpayment
- size of mortgage (purchase price minus downpayment)
- monthly rental income 
- monthly mortgage payments (after inputting for interest rate, term, amortization period, etc)

Some background- we recently purchased our first home with a conventional mortgage. We used a large chunk of our savings as a down payment, and to buy down our interest rate. My husband would like to place the entire 20k into our savings to help replenish it, while I would prefer to use a portion of it (4k) to pay off our high interest CC, and then put the rest toward savings and our emergency account.

personalfinance,"Trying to decide how to become a Stay at Home wife, here are our options. Any advice appreciated!","Hello everyone, this is my first Reddit post ever, and I am using my phone, so I'm not sure how this will all look in the end, my apologies in advance if it looks terrible. 

I'm looking for some financial advice. My husband (21) and I (20) are looking at several different financial paths to take and I'd appreciate some feedback on what seems the best choice. 

First and foremost, right now, we would both like for me to be a stay at home wife. I'm going back to my fall classes in a few weeks after a year long break, and once I get accepted into my program, I'll be in a hospital from 8-5 anyway, so we would like for me to go ahead and ease out of working. My income is not particularly substantial, I work to pay for my car payment ($350/month) and car insurance ($135/month) along with my credit card ($50/month, $800 debt total, used for our wedding purchases). I make $8/hr working 40 hour weeks, he makes around $650-700/week depending on overtime. Based on our current bills, he could easily take over the car insurance, the only real issue is my car payment. I got suckered in to a bad deal (my dad ""negotiated"" the finance for me, but didn't do a great job), so my interest rate is 16%.

That being said, in some time (hopefully in around 2 months, but we have no solid date at all), I should be getting around $6,000 back from a lawsuit. We are trying to decide if we should:

A) take the $6,000 and pay it toward my car and continue payments

B) Take the $6,000 and take it toward a down payment on getting refinanced

C) Take the $6,000, and trade in for a different car with cheaper payments. (I currently drive a Lexus, we are looking at KIAs).

D) Put the $6,000 in a savings account when it comes and go ahead and trade in my car for a cheaper payment without the down payment. (I owe $9,000 on my car, without interest). 

We both have decent credit, both of us have over a 700.

Morally, it feels wrong for me to continue working for my company and let them continue to rely on me more and more if I'm going to leave in 6 months anyway (I work with family and friends). We also just really like the idea of me staying home, we have two dogs we want to spend more time with, and we are doing several home renovations I could be working on during  the day. Not to mention, I'll be in several difficult classes come August, and I'll need all the study time I can get. Push comes to shove, I could keep working, but neither of us want that. 

I know this is a lot of information, but I would appreciate any help! My parents are horrible at financial choices, and his dad has a lot on his plate, so we don't really have anyone to turn to for advice.",finance

I was wondering if someone would mind taking a quick look at my company's 401k plan and suggest any changes if necessary.

FL, both 54yo","Okay, I did some readjusting and I think we can live on $3,000/monthly very comfortably with a $20,000 annual fund set aside for all insurances, property taxes, federal taxes, HOA fee, and anything farm related  (also, setting aside rental income of $900 monthly for rental house for our annual vacation fund).

We are in FL, both of us age 54, and my husband will be going to 3 days a week work, which will be so much better for both of us.  He will bring in approximately $1000 a month and I will contribute up to $2000 a month.  Our main monthly bills are:
electric/water/cable -  $450
Gas for cars - $200
Groceries - $300
Eating out - $300
All lawn maintenance/garb = $105
Phones $80
Cash $800  (we believe in high mad money, unaccountable)
The rest is for misc expenses, clothes, repairs, household, i.e.

My $20000 fund pays for:
Prop taxes on a farm $9000
Farm Insurance $3000
Farm Electricity $2000
HOA $1000
Home Owners Insurance $1500
Property Tax on our home  $2500
Fed taxes (no state, live in FL) $5000 (not sure yet really)
Health Insurance $5000
Car Insurance  $1350

So, I am over budget here, not sure about my taxes yet, first year to do this since inheriting farm, but overage can come from my $5000 annual house payment (from Divorce agreement), and also from vacation fund too.

I think we can do pretty good actually.....oh the passive income I will get was $40,000 this year and hopefully will contract for $60000 next year.  That's the hope and goal.    I have an emergency fund of $50,000 right now, so we are covered for over a year really if we didn't work at all.  

It's just a start, and trying hard to figure out how we can still work a little (we are only 54), and I might get a little small part time job too, but not necessary, just might like to do it on same days my husband is working.  

Does the plan look doable for FIRE?  I think it looks good and we have quite a bit of wiggle room, so that's always a plus.  I have some extra accounts that are sort of emergency funds also, so total, have about $100,000, which is probably too much liquid, but need to keep it fairly liquid for emergencies.  PS - We own our home worth $200,000 and we have no debt.

We are only short $12,000 when he actually retires also, so that's not too big of a change, and we might make that up eventually with Social Security down the road.  It won't be a lot, but between us $1000 a month for sure!!

personalfinance,Sadly finally got hit my identify theft at the worst time.,"Hello everybody. So this past weekend has been quite a hard weekend for me. Let me share some info. Don't worry I summed it up on the bottom. 

So everything in my life was going very well. Working two jobs (Apple and military-navy) and I have a long term girlfriend. Well there was a bit of talking of future plans and we both agreed on the idea of getting married. So on Friday, I asked my parents on what they thought and they loved the idea. I asked her parents and I got the their blessings as well. Great! Then I decided, alright! I wanna get a small personal loan thru my bank to get this nice ring. Was planning on ring shopping during the weekend. My bank (Navy Federal Credit Union) approved the loan instantly and put the amount of $5,500 in my savings. I then went to military work (I work nights in the navy) and got off at 5:30am on Saturday, came home, and went to sleep. 

A few hours later, I woke up to two missed calls and a voicemail from navy federal asking if I could call them at my earliest convince. I call and proceed to ask them if something is wrong, thinking it had something to do with the loan. They ask me ""did make a transaction in Colorado Springs by chance?"" ""No I live in WA. I am currently at home still in bed"" Now at this point she proceeds to explain to me that my account has been compromised. She closed my checking and savings and made new ones. I started asking questions like what happened and what lead to this series of events. 

They explained (according to the account notes) that someone earlier in the morning called in posing as me, explaining how their wife cheated on them and wanted to change the pin to their debit card (which is really my debit card). They gave them my personal info such as social, address, birthday, etc and doing so got them past the account verification part. Now having full access, they changed the debit card pin and telephone number connected to the account. Then requested a transfer of $2750 from my savings to checking (a good chunk of my loan). Next with a copy of my debit card and the new pin, they went to the USPS in Colorado springs and got a cashiers check for $2700. Now at this point, the fraud detection went off due a large amount in a location I haven't visited. It locked the account until I called. I called shortly after this happened. 

It's scary to know it was that easy for someone to do all that. I can't buy a ring until my bank ensures it was fraud which could take up to 10 business days, then they reimburse me the lost money. I was going to come on this sub and ask about engagement ring buying advice but now I am asking about identify theft and what I should do or tips/tricks to prevent it. My co worker recommends life lock.


tl;dr :
Wanted to get the girlfriend a engagement ring, got a loan for $5500. shortly after someone stole my information and called my bank. They changed the pin on my debit card. Using a copy of my debit card with the new pin, they went a USPS and requested a cashiers check for 2700. Fraud detection went off and locked my account.

personalfinance,I have no idea how to refinance my home.,"I believe I have an FHA loan, because I know I didn't put 20% down. We bought the house at $242,000 in oct 2010 but I believe its worth $275,000-$300,000 now. Mortgage remaining is $197,000. I believe my interest rate is 4 or 4.1% 30 year.

I should know better, but any help would be greatly appreciated.
Great-grandparent left the little one full ride for college so 529 plan is covered in full.

Another factor, someone I know wants me to go in on purchasing a house to rent. My contribution would be $40k, can I feasibly even attempt this? Is draining part of my safety net and stock worth it? We'd split all expenses and earnings. Monthly 'take home' would be $500 each after all expenses and taxes, but that be immediately invested in a trust to cover future home maintenance or back into the home mortgage.

personalfinance,Cousin has cancer and a poor prognosis. Her only income is a small pension. Do you have any recommendations for her?,"My cousin was recently diagnosed with breast cancer that has spread to her lymph nodes and possibly elsewhere. She just started chemo and radiation. Doctors are still performing biopsies and determining whether surgery is an option, but there is a very low probability based on what they know so far that treatment will succeed. They may shift to palliative care soon, pending the results of biopsies. She's 50 years old, and I will call her Tracy.

Tracy is on Medicaid and has a partial pension from a former job that is not sufficient to pay her bills. She is not married, and her sons are both adults who have moved out. I don't know her exact pension income, but it's definitely less than $1000 per month. She owns a home in a small town in New York state where the real estate market is poor, and between her mortgage and a home equity loan, she owes more than the house is worth. A few years ago, she divided it into a two units, a downstairs apartment where she lives and an upstairs apartment where a renter lives. His rent is $350/month, which is in line with the average where they live, so at least she's making some money from the house. Her payments on the house total around $850/month. She also has upward of $10,000 in credit card debt, since she has been living off of them since she was laid off from her last job. No investments (she cashed out a small 401k already), although she does have around $50,000 in life insurance with her sons listed as beneficiaries.

According to an aunt (who lives around 40 minutes from Tracy is the nearest family member), Tracy is struggling to buy basic necessities like food, clothing (she's lost a lot of weight recently because of her health), and toiletries. She is also having difficulty doing laundry, keeping the house clean, cooking, etc. On a recent visit, there was nothing but a can of ground coffee in the kitchen. She's gotten some financial assistance from relatives but has exhausted that option, since nobody can afford to do more than pitch in for groceries any longer.

Tracy has recently begun working on a will but does not have an attorney advising her. We are seeing if we can get relatives to each contribute a small amount toward a consultation with one.

I have a few specific questions:

* I believe that Tracy is eligible for SNAP, and I'm working with her on the application. She already has Medicaid. Are there any other state or federal programs she might be qualified for that could help here? Any Medicaid benefits you're aware of that she might not be using? So far, she's just using it for cancer-related medical procedures and medication.

* She applied for Social Security disability benefits but was denied. I understand that this is common with first time applications and am encouraging her to appeal the decision. Can anyone provide advice or recommend a free or low cost resource for assistance with this process?

* She is concerned about collectors pursuing payment on her debts from her sons (who haven't cosigned anything) or seizing her life insurance payout if she passes away. This is an issue she needs to discuss with an attorney if we can get money together for a consultation, but is there any advice I can give her in the meantime?

* She has been talking about debt consolidation programs, refinancing her CC debt, etc. I'm wary of this, since what she's describing comes with a significant administrative cost and fees, and it's unclear whether doing so will actually reduce what she owes on a monthly basis. My instinct was that she should continue to make minimum monthly payments on her cards instead, but I think her goal is to free up her credit lines in case she doesn't have enough cash to pay her bills. Any suggestions on this?

personalfinance,"Father diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, what to do?","Hey everyone, I thought this is the right place to post this thread but if it isn't please direct me to the best place. 

First, I wish anyone of you that smokes please consider how it affects the loved ones around you. I'm an advocate of free choice, but these last couple weeks have been very hard. My father has smoked for 50+ years. He is now 65 and has been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes. Our family is not taking it well, but we are trying to be optimistic at this point. He has about a 5-10% chance of survival with treatment, and is expected to live another 8 - 15 months. 

Morbid things aside, I am at a loss for what to do when the inevitable happens. Both of my parents are retired so they receive pensions from their teacher federation, have a decent amount of savings, and are mostly debt free. There are only my mother, brother and father in our family unit. My father is the money guy in the family and my mother does not know how to do anything. She is tehnologically inept and can barely navigate Facebook. 

So the question is - what do I do? I'm assuming I will have to take over as head of the family and manage my parents finances, but I'm not sure how to do this. My mother is in failing health as well and will be unable to take care of her house when my father is gone, so how do I convince her to move to the city that my brother and I live in? She has a 3000+ square foot house that will require a lot of maintenance if she keeps it. She will be unable to do things for herself around the house such as lawn care and snow removal, and the house is located 1.5 hours from the city that my brother lives in. 

Is there a checklist or guidelines that I can show my father to put into place before he passes? Such as bank info, how to pay the mortgage, etc? How do I approach my parents about future plans when the inevitable happens? What steps do I need to take so that I can minimize problems after he passes? I live in Canada if that is any help. 

Sorry for the scatter brained post, it's been a long weekend and I'm trying to gather all of my thoughts in one place. I appreciate any help.",finance

personalfinance,Best High-Yield Savings Account? Ally vs. Live Oak vs. GS vs. Barclays.,"I know there have been a ton of discussions about high-yield savings accounts on this sub, but several banks just upped their interest rate so I think it warrants another look. Plus, I haven't found *anything* about Live Oak Bank on this sub and could use some opinions on it.

**Current Interest Rates:**

**Live Oak Bank = 1.35%**

**Goldman Sachs = 1.2%**

**Ally = 1.15%**

**Barclays = 1.15%**

I want to open up a high-yield savings account to stick my emergency and vacation and car funds into (~$10,000, none of which I need immediate access to) because my current rate of 0.01% is just terrible. 

I'd like to do Live Oak because it has by far the best rate, but I can't find much online about it. Does anyone have any experience with this bank?

Between Ally, GS, and Barclays, do you think it's likely that they'll all keep raising their interest rate? Does one of them have a better history of being a rate leader?",finance

personalfinance,Drowning in credit card and student loan debt and need help,"Hi PF,
 
As stated in the title, I feel like my boyfriend and I are drowning in credit card and student loan debt and it is primarily my fault.  At this point I am scared and feel like I’m not sure what to do.
 
I am 26 and he is 23.  Within the last year we picked up and moved across the country to be closer to my family as a loved one was/is having health problems and needed help.  He was able to transfer with his job and has been with them for 5 years. I was unable to transfer since my company was concentrated in the area that we moved from.  I got a job in the same industry making a tiny bit more than I was there, but found work within a week of moving here.  When we moved here we were fine at first because I was on a payment plan for my Federal student loans that had a very low payment.  I also have private loans that I am on a payment plan on.  Since then I had to resubmit for the income driven repayment plan that I was on and they wanted to increase my payments almost $300/month.  They told me that my only real option was to consolidate my loans to get a lower monthly payment so I did.  My Federal student loan payment is now about $160/month and my private loan payment is $220/month, but increases every 6 months.
 
We also have two credit cards, one joint and one that is only mine.  The balances on them are both around $5,500.   The one that we have that is joint has payments that are about $250/month. The one that is only under my name was done with a balance transfer so I am currently not paying any interest, but the payments are around $105/month.
 
Our current monthly household income is around $3,800/month.  When we moved we decided to only keep one car since our work schedules are opposite of each other and the payment on the car is $285/month and we have about 31 payments ($8631) left on the life of the loan.  Our insurance for that car is $115/month.
Our utilities (power, water, etc.) total out to around $200/month, our groceries cost about $300-400/month and our rent is $850/month.  We have little to no savings in case of emergencies. 
 
I have done a little bit of research on debt consolidation or other options but I don’t feel educated on it enough to make a good decision.  I feel like my decision to go to college and move us closer to family has hurt us so much and I feel so disappointed, overwhelmed, and guilty to have put us in such a terrible situation.  Any help or advice would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,18 months into parenthood - here is the cost breakdown of the financial impact for our family!,"UPDATE: There is an article on CNBC about this post! Check it out: [CNBC Article](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/11/one-mom-calculated-that-her-18-month-old-has-cost-her-20000.html)

So I was inspired by a previous post from a dog owner who broke down the cost of his/her first year of dog ownership. I wondered to myself if I could show the same for the first 1.5 years of parenthood. So here you have it!


Some comments: 

* This is based on our specific situation, income level and parenting choices. If you plan to make different choices or are in a different situation, your numbers will be different.

* I included parental leave as a cost, but to be more accurate it would really be considered a loss. This was not something we had to pay, but something we had to account for in our budget. We live below our means, so we were more than prepared to go without some income for a short period of time. This would not have been possible without job security/FMLA which many people do not qualify for. 

* We make an effort to limit our spending on unnecessary items and make specific requests to family for birthday/shower/Christmas gifts. For example, our son received a convertible car seat and a few books from my parents on his first birthday at our request. he enjoyed the books and we didn't have to buy a new car seat. We actually have to push back on a lot of the gift giving they want to do so we can avoid an over abundance of ""stuff"" in our home. Instead we focus their generosity on things we actually need - it works well for everyone involved. 


Item | Cost | Frequency | Total Cost (First 18 months) | Comment | 
----- | ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------- |   
Parental Leave - Mom | $5,500.00 | One time | $5,500.00 | Used PTO (a little over 2 weeks) and short term disability (70% up to 6 weeks after 1 week - 5 weeks total) to bring in some income. The rest of the time off (14 weeks total) ended up being unpaid. It would have been 12 weeks, but I got a new/better job at the end of my leave and took another few weeks off before starting that. | 
Parental Leave - Dad | $2,346.00 | One time | $2,346.00 | He used some paid time off, but it was largely unpaid. Essentially resulted in 1 month lost income for 6 weeks of leave. | 
Daycare | $150.00 | Weekly | $9,900.00 | We paid/pay a stay-at-home mom to watch our child during the week. We have relatively flexible jobs which makes this arrangement possible. We do all the driving, provide all diapers and food. | 
Health Costs - Mom | $25.00 | One time | $25.00 | We have Tricare and the cost of all prenatal, labor, deliver and postnatal care was covered with a single $25 copayment. | 
Health Costs - Baby | $0.00 |  | $0.00 | Under Tricare our monthly costs do not go up when you add a child to the family (Sponsor+Family) plan. We have also been lucky enough to only need preventative care for our son which is covered 100%. | 
Food (pre-weaning) | $0.00 |  | $0.00 | Exclusively breastfed until around 8 months - free! All pump costs were covered by insurance. |
Food (post-weaning)  | $25.00 | Weekly | $1,250.00 | This is a high estimate on how much more we spend on food now we have 3 mouths to feed. |
New Baby Stuff | $400.00 | One time | $400.00 | We received most of the necessities through generous family and friends via the baby shower. Our registry was targeted at NEEDS and not cutesy or unnecessary items. After the shower we went out and purchased the remaining items. | 
Diapers | $600.00 | One time | $600.00 | We decided to cloth diaper and bought all the diapers used off a local BST group. We have about 20 newborn diapers, 15 small pockets, 15 medium pockets and 25 All-in-Ones. The additional laundry cost is negligible. | 
Clothing | $10.00 | Monthly | $180.00 | We hardly ever buy clothes for our son. He gets gifts from family members and we buy used 90% of the time. He does not have a lot of clothing and we like it that way. | 
Other | $30.00 | Monthly | $540.00 | This is a high estimate on what we spend doing things with our son that we did not do before (museum visits, outings etc…). It also includes any additional costs. We don't buy toys or really anything else for him - he has survived happily! |
 |  | TOTAL | $20,741.00 | 

As you can see the majority of our costs come from taking time off for the birth of our child and childcare. For most families in the US I think this will be the case plus additional healthcare costs - most families in the US are not as lucky as we are with healthcare. If a parent decides to stay home with their child(ren) instead of work and pay for childcare they would have to factor in the ""cost"" of losing an income and benefits instead of the cost of childcare. 

The choice to have children should not be completely financial, but it is good to be prepared and know what costs you will need to consider. If anyone out there looks at this and says ""I could never afford that!"" then I completely understand, but remember to alter these numbers to your own situation. Also remember this is over 18 months (not 1 year). If you annualized the numbers above you get an annual cost of around $14,000, but that includes the one time costs. 

And finally, YES! These costs have been more than worth it for us. We are welcoming a second child any day now and look forward to doing it all again. FYI: Our costs for the second child have been even lower since we are able to reuse things from our first (gender neutral FTW).",finance
personalfinance,Budgeting cost of living while in grad school,"I am about to start a 3 year grad program this fall (continuous-no summers off.) I met with financial counseling and my federal loan amount covers just enough for tuition (and nothing for books...). I received a scholarship for $6,500 but it didn't really help me in that they just subtracted what I could have gotten from my loan amount. (I'm not getting the money directly.) 

I have the option to take out a ""grad plus direct loan"" for an additional 8K at only a slightly higher interest rate than the federal loan (somewhere around 7%) but after that, I'm on my own. I'm thinking books for the year will be around $1,000 for 3 semesters. 

How do I live on 7K??? 

I do have about 15k in savings but that won't get me through 3 years. I live comfortably (and frugally) on about 19.5K a year, but with getting rid of everything I can, I can only cut it down to $18,750 a year. I have no debt. 

Breakdown of my expenses:  
 Rent $4,500  
 Gas $480  
 Food $1,920  
 Internet and Utilities $420  
 Gym membership: $744 (CANCELLING)

However, I have talked to 3 1st years who strongly recommended not working- as the program is extremely intensive. 

I am worried I will eventually need to live in my car to make ends meet. If I can't work, I don't know where my next meal will come from when my money runs out. I do not have any family to lean on for support.

personalfinance,"Extra money ($12,000): Pay down mortgage or invest?","This year I've saved way beyond what I need in terms of planned and emergency expenses (my emergency fund is actually probably too high).

I have no experience investing apart from my retirement contributions, and after several calls to Vanguard, I'm still not certain how advantageous it would be to invest in something like the VTSAX or VBTLX.

I am 23 and have recently graduated college. Upon the date of my graduation I was given a job offer for a full time position. I have a company paid benefits plan, and a pension plan for which I pay 5% and is matched by the company for 10% annually. My salary is $40,000/yr. 

I currently owe $8150.00 in student loan debt and my grace period for that debt ends in November of this year and I am currently accruing 0.43$ in interest per day. Other than that the only debt I have is for $700 on a visa credit card with a 19.99% interest rate. 


Currently my expenses include $70 per month phone bill,  $20 per month on nicotine fluid (although this is the first expense I would like to cut), $20 per month on pet related expenses, and approx $80 month in gas. I am still figuring out what my food expenses are in terms of meal preparation so I am currently spending $1.70 per day on coffee. My car insurance is currently being paid by my parents but is $90 a month, they have offered to cover this expense for me until I move out. 


I do not plan to rent, I would like to buy a small home within the next 2 years. 



I've always thought about my financial situation going through school but it has always been stressful being broke and dependent. I am extremely happy to have obtained this job and would like to put myself into the best financial situation possible.

I have a cashback rewards card right now and the only other card I could get would be a variable interest rate card starting at 15%. I would also appreciate any advice on a credit card with variable interest.

personalfinance,Am I missing something? Question about using a penalty free IRA withdrawal and repaying over the next year.,"EDIT: My wording was unclear - I'm not actually talking about ""borrowing"" from the Roth and massively paying that back. I mean withdrawing the money and then building the balance back up using new contributions. I would put a max of $5500 this year and the rest next year to ""replace"" what I took. The balance would be back to current levels in 12 months. 


Howdy Everyone - I have a question about ROTH IRA withdrawals and what might be better.


Here’s my situation:


I have approximately $10,000 worth of CC debt from some bad habits.  I’ve since trimmed the fat from my spending, made a budget and I’ve been sticking to it. In addition to paying all my bills/expenses and putting $500/month back into my emergency fund (which is close to wiped out), I can afford to put $1000/month towards the CC debt.  Along with that, I discovered that I’ll be paying about $1250 in interest if I pay it off at that rate (including a couple hundred I’ve already paid). 


I also have a ROTH IRA and I *could* withdrawal $8000 from tax- and penalty-free, because I’ve had the account over 5 years and the $8000 is my initial contributions, not profit.  I have not yet contributed to my IRA this year, and in fact haven’t contributed in several years because (1) I’m stupid and (2) my employer-matched retirement account became the focus of my retirement plans and I haven’t really paid attention to my IRA in several years. 


Over the past few years, I have averaged about 8.5% growth in my IRA.  My CC APR is 14%. It seems to me like I would be better off financially if I took the $8000 out and paid off the CC in two months ($8000 lump sum + two $1000 payments, this month and next) and then return the money to the IRA $1000/month rather than paying off the CC slowly (yes, I would have to divide the contributions between this year and next, but that’ll only mean I have to hold the December payment until January).  


So, pretending that I have perfect discipline over the next year or so:


Am I better off taking out a penalty-free chunk of cash from my Roth IRA (earning about 8.5%) to pay off my CC (with 14% interest) and then rebuilding the Roth balance over the next year ($1000/month), or should I simply pay off my CC and not touch the Roth (paying $1000/month on the CC for the next year)? Again, I know that discipline is always a concern when people make a post like this, but I’d respectfully prefer to keep the discussion geared towards dollars and cents rather than discipline and sense :P Is there something that I’m missing?


The other consideration I can think of is the improvement in my credit score from carrying too high of a balance; my credit score is currently just under the line but when my CC is paid off, I’ll be able to knock 2.5% off my car loan interest rate, which a back of the envelope calculation shows about $500 savings between lowering the interest rate now vs. a year from now (payment will remain the same but the loan will shorten in duration).  


Thanks everyone!


PS - for those of you concerned that I’d never pay back the IRA and would spend irresponsibly: the debt came after a house fire wiped me out. Insurance and a generous community covered most of my stuff, but I lost my partner in the fire and so I got pretty depressed for a bit and went off the deep end with some bad habits. Prior to this I’d never carried so much as a $50 balance on my CC at the end of the month and I had significant savings for someone my age (mid-twenties, if that matters).  I’m pretty darn close to being back to who I was as a person pre-fire and the debt is one of the last thing to tackle - I know everyone says this, but I will maintain discipline and the IRA will be paid back in full within a year if I take out the balance.",finance

personalfinance,Tips and Advice for a guy in a serious financial/life rut.,"This is my first post here, so any help would do me a solid. So, I'm really struggling with something right now, and I feel really embarrassed to be, given that I feel I should be old enough to not be dealing with this kind of stuff. I'm 29 and I have about $35k of student loan debt (I know, kill me now...) A film degree that I haven't used from college 8 years ago now because of circumstances, if I wanna call it that. 

I just moved to Orlando about two months ago and stupidly didn't have a job before I had planned to move. Well, I had been working for a credit union (hilarious, right?) but it's not something I wanted to continue doing. Just something I fell into because I couldn't find something in my field and needed to make money. Well I also got a job as fast as possible in Orlando for a credit union as well, but it pays JUST under enough for me to pay all of my bills which include a car and car insurance, 3 credit cards, a cell phone and rent plus it's normal utilities of water and electric. No cable because of Netflix and Hulu. But I took it because I needed SOMETHING. I also had to use up the savings that I had, plus a line of credit I had as well and most of my credit cards to furnish the place and pay rent and what not until I found a job, which didn't take long after I moved in.

I'm not sure if I should give the amounts of all of those bills, but if so, I can. My problem, along with not being able to pay everything (and I've been able to pay everything on time and not be late until moving but I couldn't live at home anymore) is that I'm about to turn 30 and just feel like I have nothing to show for my life except debt, debt, and more debt. I don't want to work in finance and want to more towards something creative. The problems with that is the pay. I haven't really had experience in anything to really get paid enough to receive a decent income from something film or entertainment telated and its seeming like I'm just going to be stuck going from shit job I don't want to shit job I don't want in order to make ends meet. It's taking a toll on me.

I know that isn't strictly about personal finance but it does tie into it for sure. I've thought about wiping out my past jobs 401k's to throw towards my car since there isn't much left to pay, but I just feel like this all my life will be from here on out. Just full of debt and unfulfilling employment. Any suggestions on this on what I can do or where I should start with my debt? 

I feel like the simplest answer is to find a new job that pays more, but Im seriously sick of working at places that I don't care about and that aren't going me any closer to what I really want to do. It just feels like I'm wasting my life away. I really just wanted my next job to be something creative and something I actually enjoy.

REALLY dumb move, but I got caught up in the idea of it because I've always wanted one. It's not here yet though because they are still baby puppies, so I won't have to figure them in till August.

investing,Opinions of betting on currency?,"I just wanted people’s opinion on betting currency.  Canadian interest rates are supposed to rise and let’s say that does in fact appreciate the currency.  As a Canadian, how would I be able to make money off that?

I can only see that if a foreigner buys Canadian dollars now, then when interest rates rise, they sell, they make profit.

personalfinance,Student loan repayment options,"I owe about $187,000 in student loans - $122,000 federal and $65,000 private. For the federal loans, I'm doing the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) repayment plan, which is 10% of my income x20 years, after which the rest is ""forgiven"", but considered taxable income. My options are to switch to the standard repayment plan and pay extra each month in order to pay the whole thing off and not be taxed on the rest. My other option is Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which is 120 monthly payments/10 years of income-based repayment, after which everything is supposedly forgiven and tax-free. I currently work in health care, so if I could get a job in a non-profit hospital, I'd be eligible for this type of forgiveness. My only concern about it is - is there a catch? And if Trump decides to get rid of it, will I be screwed? I feel that paying as much as I can per month would be the safest route, but it would also be a big chunk out of my paycheck, especially on top of my other loan.

For the private loan, I was previously paying the minimum (~$500/month), which was mostly just interest. I just started paying double that (~$1,000/month) so I can pay more of the principal. I'm also in the process of refinancing this loan with SoFi in order to get the interest rate down.

So has anyone had any experience with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness plan, and is it legit? Should I just pay as much as I can on both loans in order to start paying more on the principal rather than just interest? I've already started looking for a second job, but how can I get rid of this debt faster?",finance
investing,Bond ETF Investing,"Hi there. I'm a new millenial investor trying to understand the bond market, and beginning to establish my bond exposure.

When I learn about how individual bonds operate, it seems like if interest rates go up/down, the corresponding bond price goes down/up in step to offset and keep the bonds marketable to investors in terms of expected return. However, does this mean that it is always the best time to get into bonds, as opposed to stocks, where you could be buying in at a high point that deviates from fundamental vale and eventually it reverts?

For example, I look at this ticker I was planning on investing in, either XSB.TO or ZAG.TO and the price have both been dropping significantly ahead of a predicted BoC interest rate hike. Is this then a good time to get into bonds, or is it an equivalent state to when prices are high, because the price is compensating for a future higher interest rate and thus coupon? Not sure if my question makes any sense but ya :D

Appreciate any clarifications",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on student loan settlement option,"I have a private student loan for 22,000 at a 9.85 interest rate. I found a company that claims they can settle with my loan company to get them to go down to 13,000. Here are the options they give me:

*  2 year payment plan, paying about $560 per month. This is strictly a payment plan, and so there will be no more interest with this option.

* 5 year refinance, paying $265 per month. This involves a new loan that you will pay on. There is interest on that new loan.
* 7 year refinance, paying $222 per month. This involves a new loan that you will pay on. There is interest on that new loan.
* 10 year refinance, paying $185 per month. This involves a new loan that you will pay on. There is interest on that new loan.

stocks,"Question about described Futures ""strategy""","I was reading this: http://www.dummies.com/personal-finance/investing/day-trading/fixed-income-arbitrage-as-a-day-trading-strategy/ 

And this part doesn't make sense to me: **How would such a trade work? Think of a day trader monitoring interest rates on U.S. government securities. He notices that two-year treasury notes are trading at a lower yield than expected — especially relative to five-year treasury notes.

He sells futures on the two-year treasury notes and then buys futures on the five-year treasury notes. When the difference between the two rates falls back where it should be, the futures trade will turn a profit.**

In this scenario wouldn't the 2-year treasury notes go up and the 5-year go down and thus the trade would be a loss? Am I missing something?",finance
personalfinance,"19 and hurting $, how to budget?","Hello Personal Finance, I am a 19yr old female who is financially hurting. 

I am on mobile so please be kind about formatting. 

I need help budgetting, I suck at following them and making them. Heres the basic info:

My job: I make $10/hr with 25-35 hours a week paid biweekly. Average paycheck $460

My bills:

- Medical (direct withdrawal): $192/mo on the 21st
- Internet (contract till december): $45/mo
- Gas: I spend about $30/mo
- Automotive CC: $20/mo
- Regular CC: $40/mo
- Car: $50-100/mo

My debts (total)

- Medical: somewhere in the realm of 2700 I believe. Its $192 for the next 12 months before its paid off. 
- Internet: contract ends in december
- Gas is as needed
- Automotive CC: has a 24% interest rate at $470 left on it. 
- Regular CC: no interest for the next 8 months. Owe $450
- Car: bought from a friend, owe $850 left. 


The problem is, once i pay my bills, I blow everything. I'm never late on payments. Now 3 unexpected bills have come up. Totalling around $350. I can't afford them. I'm selling possessions to get by this time. But I can't afford for this to happen again.  How can I budget myself? Hiding my card doesn't seem to work and if I just withdraw the cash, I spend it in a day and end up starving till payday. 

TLdR: 19yr old doesn't know how to budget.

personalfinance,Future College Student with Questions...,"I am heading off the my State University this fall (only a month away!) and I have some questions about money. 

I have never been an amazing saver, but here is the low-down:

$500 from childhood saving 

~$3k from Grad gifts 

$3.5k in scholarships (first year only)

The cost for 1 year (2 semesters) is around $20k. My parents (my mom mainly) have been doing all the money aspects and she has done the math and says that with the MAX $5.5k federal unsubsidized loans I will still be left with about $6k-8k.

*side note, unrelated* My grandparents gave me $5k for a new car as I need a new one (old one has 200k miles and is starting to show it) Found a couple good cars in my area, just have to go look at them!

I want to be able to leave college with as little debt as possible, but I know that I most likely will have some. 

Here are some options that I've thought of:

1: I have a part time job at a local grocery chain, and I am looking to transfer up to the city where I'm going to school. Pay is okay at about $8.5/hr, but I have no idea how many hours I will get as it's a different store. (Even if I get hired up there)

2: The local city bus service is taking applications in the city where I'm going to school. I would say I'm a good driver, and haven't had an accident or ticket *knock-on-wood*. Pay is about $14/hr plus benefits(dont really need them as I'm on my parents insurance) (My mom doesnt like this idea, she doesnt want me to get hurt, but the money is good and there is paid training to get your CDL)

3: I'm going into Computer Engineering, and there is a job offer in the college for 'tech support' for $10/hr. 

I dont know where to go. Im mom says that the 6k-8k will wipe their savings out and I don't want to see everything they have worked for, go away. 

TLDR: Parents left with $6k per year, minimum, from my college schooling. Could use a little help and guidance. 

Any advice would be helpful!

personalfinance,Private student loan advice.,"To try to keep this short, I have about $90k in private student loans that I took out through Sallie Mae and are now owned by Navient (which I believe is just another part of the same company). I originally took out $48k for an associate's degree and due to variable interest rates of 8% and 13% which hit as high as 19% in '06 or '07. I had made headway into paying the down, but loss of income and other personal problems wiped out any progress I had made and I have since doubled the loan amount. Jumping ahead I have been married and have a family that I have been able to provide for but have never been able to plan for the future (17 year old graduating from high school next year and I would like to be able to help). I have also declared chapter 7 once in the past and am currently in a chapter 13 due to medical issues. 

I am finally in a steady job with fairly good pay and hopefully my wife will be improving her income soon also. 

My questions are

1. Do I have any hope of paying this off when the smallest setback can ruin everything? 

2. Are there any ways to negotiate with a private loan company?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Found out Dad secretly has $40k in credit card debt, again.","**Background:** my dad (69) was a taxi driver and my mom is a maid. My mom (59) takes home about $30k a year, we're not sure what my dad made but around $20k a year is what he reports.

Me and my brother just graduated college and will be entering the work force. My mom is still working and my dad just retired.

**Problem** 8 years ago my mom learned that my dad had $50k in credit card debt. My mom was devastated, so we had to refinance our mortgage to get a lower interest rate. As of today, we still have $250k on our mortgage left with 3.5% interest.

Now today we just found out my dad opened more credit cards and is now $40k in debt. We're not sure what to do. I want my mom to retire at a reasonable age, but I also don't want to cripple myself financially making big monthly payments. 

What is the best way to go about this? We haven't confronted our dad about finding out yet, because he will only yell and be non-responsive. He's also in the hospital now recovering from a heart surgery, so we don't want to have the conversation in the hospital.




**Edit:** Many of you asked why I keep saying **we** opposed to **them**. That's because I want my mom to retire when she's 66 because she's been working hard her entire life and has been good with her own finances. This means that I'll probably have to pick up her mortgage later down the road.

I'm thinking about having my father file for chapter 7 bankruptcy. With his condition, it doesn't seem at all possible for him to reenter the work force (his health is and has been deteriorating).

The IRA has a relatively small amount (less than US$2,000) and has had steady returns of only 1% in a money market account. I'm in my twenties, and I can probably make that grow faster with any other investment.

personalfinance,Plan For Paying Off Student Loans,"Hi Everyone,

I am a recent graduate who has racked up a decent amount in student loans and I would like gather some information from this community on how I should go about paying them off. I will provide a lot of information about my situation below and I would love to hear your opinions.

**Student Loans** (All loans have a due date of 1/04/2018)

Group|Interest Rate|Outstanding Balance
:--|:--|:--   
A|6.8%|$7,262.21
B|3.860%|$4,529.00
C|4.660%|$4,500.00
D|4.660%|$2,253.75
E|4.290%|$5,500.00
F|4.290%|$2,146.92
G|3.860%|$2,287.23
H|3.760%|$5,000.00

Some of these loans have already started to accrue some interest, but they are all going to kick up here soon.

**Personal Information**

Income: $35,000

Monthly Expenses: Around $600

Current Savings/Emergency Fund: $5000

**Questions**

1. Which loans should I attack first? Seems like Group A should be my first priority correct?

2. I have $5000 in savings right now. Should I make a large payment?

3. How much should I be paying per month on these loans? What do you think I should be able to afford?

Let me know if I can provide any further information that will help you provide me with some quality feedback. I appreciate anything and everything you can offer.",finance

personalfinance,Student loan refinance?,"I currently own my car and have no debt other than my mortgage (135k) and  graduated with 130k in student debt about 5 years ago. I make a good 90k a yr. I have paid my student loan debt down to 75k now and my loans are all federal and through a company called Navient. I have 10 loans totally 75 as I previously stated with fixed interest rates varying from 4-7.8%. I have been doing the dave ramsey snowball method paying off the lowest amount regardless of interest so far but I am wondering if I should be paying off the loans with the highest interest  (7.8%) first, consolidate,  or refi them?

Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Will my investments in crypto currencies hurt my ability to qualify for a mortgage loan?,"A friend of mine that works in the industry (USAA mortgage loans dept) said that the loan department look at the last two months of your bank account when applying for the loan. He also said that any large deposits/withdrawals need to be sourced. The thing is, I have several LARGE deposits/withdrawals from crypto because I'm pretty active in the market. Will a Bank think that it's too suspect? Or will they be able to see that they're from Coinbase? My friend suggested that I make a new bank account, put the money for the down payment in there, and let it sit for two months, then apply for the loan and give them that account instead of my regular one. The problem is, there's a house I'm wanting to buy, and it may not be available two months from now. So, will I be okay if I stick with my current situation? FWIW, I'm looking to get a loan through a small, local federal credit union that I opened a savings account with a few days ago.",finance
personalfinance,"Took debt of $88k to under $40k in 2.5 years, thanks in part to this forum (Thanks!)","Started seriously trying to get my debt under control in February 2015, at which point I created a spreadsheet of all my debt to track monthly (suggestion from forum) and found I had $88,392.72 in debt.  This was split between ~$39k in credit card, ~$36k in student loans, and ~$14k in car loan.  The credit card debt was a combination of some unexpected/unfortunate circumstances, and bad decisions.

I started by consolidating my credit into a consolidated loan with lower interest (suggestion from here).  I then prioritized loans based on interest rates (suggestion from here also).   I reduced expenses (got rid of TV service, downgraded phone plan, got a lower rent apartment, didn't travel as much, ate out much less, started doing meal prep, etc - also suggestions from here), and made some extra cash where I could.

Now, I'm at:
Credit card: paid off monthly, $0 balance!
Consolidated loan: ~$18k;
Student loans: ~$20k;
Car loan: ~$1.5k;
(So a total of a little under $40k, as mentioned above.)

I do fall into a somewhat higher income bracket, but getting to this point did require sacrifice - I decided not to buy a home at this time to focus on debt, and reduced expenses as per above, among other things.

I haven't managed to put as much into savings as I would like, and am starting to focus on that more now that I have the debt more under control.  I should note though that during the same period I did increase my retirement savings by about +80% through employer &amp; my contributions, plus an upturn in the economy.

Looking forward to hopefully being debt free in about 1.5 years, or less!

Edit: I'd rather not give my exact income for privacy reasons, but since people keep asking, I would estimate I was putting in the area of 40% of my take-home pay toward debt reduction.",finance

I will be getting a bonus of 12-14k (after taxes) in January 2018.

Should I take this loan and pay off my car? My student loans? Should I take it and put it into my Roth IRA/Mutual funds?",finance

Most of you probably know me from my [acting career](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTQnarzmTOc) (yep, that’s me, the security guard in the beginning), but I’m also a political economist and Professor at [Duke University](https://polisci.duke.edu/people/michael-c-munger), where I teach political science, public policy, and economics.
 
I chaired of the Department of Political Science here at Duke for 10 years, and now serve as Director of Undergraduate Studies for the department. Prior to my time at Duke, I spent time as a staff economist at the US Federal Trade Commission, and taught at Dartmouth College, University of Texas—Austin, and University of North Carolina—Chapel Hill. I’m co-editor of [*The Independent Review*](http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=946), and I’ve also served as President of the Public Choice Society and editor of the journal [*Public Choice*](https://link.springer.com/journal/11127). I’ve authored or co-authored 7 books and written over 200 scholarly articles. My current research looks at the promise and problems of the sharing economy, examining the changes being caused by a new entrepreneurial focus on selling reductions in transactions costs (think Uber, AirBnB, etc). Some of my past research interests include comparative politics, legislative institutions, electoral politics, campaign finance reform, the evolution of the ideology racism in the antebellum South, and the pros and cons of a basic income guarantee or “universal basic income.”
 
In 2008, I [ran for governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Munger#Gubernatorial_campaign) of North Carolina as a Libertarian, to give voters a choice outside of the two-party duopoly. I podcast with [*EconTalk*](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/_featuring/mike_munger/) and I blog with [*Bleeding Heart Libertarians*](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/author/mike-munger/) and [*Learn Liberty*](http://www.learnliberty.org/speakers/michael-munger/)—who I’ve also partnered with to create several educational videos on politics and economics.

Do the panels + solar battery need to say they're waterproofed? Or is that assumed, given it's the outdoors?

I have no idea what I need in terms of power rating, or what to watch out for. 

Would these batteries work with a solar panel, or should I stick with traditional solar batteries/inverters? https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dmobile&amp;field-keywords=External+laptop+battery+pack

personalfinance,"[DEBT]I'm ready to tackle my debt in a logical and efficient manner, need some input though","Hmm, so this is likely going to be longer than I intend it to be. I am 27 years old and finally making moves to move out of my mom's house in the suburbs and into New York City (the outer boroughs, I'm not crazy enough to think I can live in Manhattan). 

I was prompted to finally check my credit score this evening, because while I'm searching for room share situations that sometimes don't require a credit check, I know this is an important aspect of understanding your finances and a pretty big deal. I'm finally taking charge.

All of the numbers mentioned in this post are in USD. I've lived under the assumption that I'm wrecked due to my student loans. (Mostly private funded, school was 40k a year, finished in four years.)
I used CreditKarma to check for a credit score estimate. Equifax was a 613, TransUnion 620. Which I recognize isn't top notch, but it's still not the 300 I was expecting. 

I was figuring my credit would be worse, because my student loans went to debt collections. So I thought (maybe incorrectly) that my collections accounts would appear on my credit report, and I have been mighty delinquent with them (I've improved over the past year, I swear). To my surprise, the debt collection agency does not show up.

CreditKarma reports 7 open accounts: 1 Wells Fargo credit card, 6 Navient student loans. 5 closed accounts: 4 New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority ([HESSA] private student loans), 1 Sallie Mae (which became Navient). 

My NJ HESSA loans I believed, were sold to Solomon &amp; Solomon PC, a collections agency that I didn't acknowledge, and eventually served me with papers. They've served my sister as well (because of her loans), and my mom (cosigner for 4 of sister's loans, and one of mine [dad cosigned the others and passed away]). I didn't read the papers with scrutiny, just figured 'oh wow, this is real, what am I going to do?' I was really naive and depressed when all of this occurred. I'm on my way to getting better now, and determined to right this ship, even if it kills me. 

I got on board with Solomon &amp; Solomon and worked out payments with them for the enormous amounts of debt they are expecting me to pay. 
I have three files with them (two school years were combined). Two are around 46k, and one is 88k. 180k total. The interest rates of these three files is ~$7.60/day each. 

What my plan has been, and what I've failed to make happen is consolidating this loan with a local credit union. I'd like to make one monthly payment with one interest rate. I recognize the interest rate of S&amp;S is just -insane-. After some brief lurking, I realize I should probably get a verification of the debt from S&amp;S.

So, this leads me to a few questions:
Will my credit report from annualcreditreport.com reveal more accounts, like S&amp;S? I have not pulled this information due to the fact that I should have been sleeping 20 minutes ago.

Am I crazy for thinking a credit union will buy 180k worth of debt?

CreditKarma reports $15,705 in total open balances. Am I less screwed than I thought?

But really, if I do still need to source a consolidation loan for this S&amp;S situation, any tips on how to approach the local credit union? My mom has been a customer for awhile.

I have a husband and three kids- he makes like 60-65/year as a truck driver. His income pays for mortgage, utilities, and car payment, etc. I pay health insurance, child care, groceries...

personalfinance,"(ZA) I have a property I'm letting, but it doesn't seem to be a good investment, advice appreciated.","Good morning,

I'm currently between tenants on my property which I initially bought to let, but I'm starting to feel that it might be better to sell it and invest the money elsewhere, please allow me to elaborate a little:

I didn't buy the property cash, I had to take out a mortgage for it, and the rental income barely covers the mortgage installments. On top of that, the estate it is situated in imposes double levies, and then there is the taxes imposed by the municipality on top of that. This is more or less what the figures look like:

I purchased the property for R835,000.00 in 2014. I was able to put down a R80,000.00 deposit, and my legal fee's were R25,000.00. My mortgage installments came out to R7,328.00 per month (which is what I currently pay). (The interest rate on the mortgage is 10.8%, linked to prime) The levies are R1,385.37 and R653.00 per month (there are 2 levies, as mentioned) and the property taxes are R589.49 per month. My projected rental income, as soon as I can find a tenant, is expected to be around R7300 - R7600 per month (after deducting the monthly rental agent fee's). I have also paid some lump sum deposits into the mortgage, to try and reduce the interest charged, but cant really see a noticeable difference yet.

I tried calculating the yield, but I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around exactly how it is done, and what it means. I'm by no stretch of the imagination a ""numbers"" person, and don't have anyone I could ask for advice, except of course seeing a financial advisor - but in all honesty, I don't trust them.

Is there perhaps someone who could provide me with their opinion on how to handle this situation?

personalfinance,Examining the Numbers for a Plug-in Hybrid,"I currently do not own a car, but a recent job change is causing me to move to Los Angeles, and a vehicle will be a necessity. Initially I intended to purchase some sort of econobox, something like a Toyota Corolla. Due to the fact that I was not expecting to require a vehicle so soon, I don't feel like I have a strong down payment, only about $3,000.

For the sake of determining what the ceiling of the car's price would be, I looked at a 2017 Toyota Corolla. They go for about $18,000 - and on a 60-month auto loan I'm looking at paying $15,840 over the life of the loan. In that same time period, I'm estimating (with my commute) that I would spend some $18,000 on gas. This seemed crazy to me. I didn't intend on purchasing a 2017 vehicle, but this gas bill puts everything into a new perspective. What about an electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid?

A Toyota Prius Prime has a base price of about $27,100 - so I'd need to finance about $24,000. Between gas and home charging, I'd be looking at about $5,400 in fuel charges over the first five years of owning the vehicle. This already looks cheaper than the Corolla! On top of this, there are also a total of about ~$6500 worth of state, local, and federal incentives/tax rebates, bringing a total cost of ownership to about $24,000 over the first five years, nearly $10,000 cheaper than the Corolla econobox!

I always told myself that I would never buy a brand-new car, but honestly it's hard to make the numbers make sense any other way if I go with the Prius. To compete on price, I'd have to find something with similar gas mileage that would cost under $6000. I'm hard-pressed to imagine that I can find something in short order at that price that will be certain to pass emissions in California and be reliable in the long-term. Any thoughts on this? Is there something I'm forgetting to include in my cost calculations?

$9,900 federal through American education not enrolled in IBR bc it is lower than my IBR would be

Current total loan payments are only $300 bc half my pay is through housing and meal stipends for travel which are not federally taxed. I make about $60k/year after taxes. 

I've considered;

just paying off the $9,900 and the other large sum just making IBR payments for the next 19 1/2 years 

Trying to pay off everything aggressively, I'm a bit of a minimalist, currently single, and I am stressed about having a large sum of money and paying the taxes once it's forgiven (the principle is increasing heavily prob 6.5% average interest)

Consolidating with another loan service like great lakes to have all loans together under one income based plan.

Right now I've been saving some money up but I don't know if the IBR is a good decision since I may take a full time contract somewhere adding more taxable income, getting married and file jointly within he next 5-10 years. I've also thought the IBR is good in case a more debt relief option comes available (is that possible?)

personalfinance,My first Milestone,"Let me preface this with saying it's not toward FIRE. 

But yesterday after years of hard work my credit finally bumped up to the mid 700s. 

I am 30, and since I was 20 I've been struggling to achieve better than a 550. I was really horrible with finances when I was younger. I got a credit card, maxed it and didn't pay. Got another, maxed that one, and didn't pay. Didn't even attempt to make the monthly payments and just let them go into default. I also graduated from college with an AS with almost 40k in student debt. I didn't pay attention to my student loans as they went into default for me not differing. So to make a long story short I quickly was in really bad shape and started the long trek toward recovering my credit and fixing my financial woes. 

I wont go into detail but I will highlight some of the things that I did to help get me where I am today, and I will finish with a question to PF. 

So first thing I did was pay off all debt collections. 
Next I had about 8 different student loan lenders I was paying on and was having a hard time keeping up with who was paid when. So I decided to consolidate. They were mixed interest rates from 6.5-8%. Consolidating brought them all to 6.5. This paid off all the individual loans and erased a lot of the negative history associated with my report. 

Next I had two credit cards in my name that I was making payments on. 

I had a car loan in my name that I ended up trading in for my wife to get a new vehicle that was only in her name. Her score is in the high 7s low 8s. 

The biggest push I just had was paying off both of the cards about 14k. 

So now we start the long track of saving for our emergency fund, paying off my student loans, paying off her vehicle, some medical bills, and another small loan for furniture, while saving for a house. 

I know to most of you this isn't huge. But for the first time in my adult life I finally feel in control of my finances and going in a really good direction financially. 

I want to ask though, since I am now in the 7s. What can I do to push me in to the 8s? The only debt I have in my name now is the 24k student loans. The rest is in my wife's name as her credit is great. We are saving and paying everything off as aggressively as we can.

personalfinance,Co-signed for loans but sister isn't paying. How can I help my parents?,"Hello Personal Finance! Long time lurker, and just want to say thanks for all of the thoughtful responses and helpful information in this sub. The sad situation is this: My Dad had started a new job, and the bank wouldn't let him co-sign for my sister's student loans (they wanted him to have at least a year in that position). It turned out that I was the only one in my family that had been in my job long enough to co-sign the loan. I received about $3,000 a year from my parents for college, but they were unable to help my younger sister. I agreed to sign the loan, which if I recall, was for about $8,000 all told. I know that you all advise against co-signing for loans, but I just couldn't refuse my parents because they've done so much for me. I know it's inadvisable, believe me, but that's water under the bridge now.

Fast forward to last week. My sister decided about 8 months ago to ""live her own life"" which means leaving her very kind (and now distraught) husband. She is mostly estranged from my family due to various issues related to her irresponsibility. Her husband has been wonderful, and has continued to pay her loans as much as he can. However, their divorce comes through this week, and he will no longer pay. My parents co-signed for I think around $40,000 of loans, and those loans are already behind and my Dad is getting stressed out by calls from the bank. Dad and Mom are both working and taking care of my elderly grandmother, but can barely make ends meet. If creditors come after them, it would ruin them completely. They have very little saved for retirement, but are trying hard. My Dad is great with money and taught me well, but definitely knows he made a mistake in trusting my sister. 

My questions are as follows:

1. What can I do to get out in front of this student debt train heading towards us? I'm assuming my sister will just let us take the fall for the loans.

2. My sister has moved and I don't think the bank has her new address. Is there any way I can get this to them without giving them my information? I don't want to get phone calls. 

3. If debt collectors call, are there clear resources or a checklist of steps I can give to my parents to help them know what to do? They are very responsible with money which is why they have stayed afloat with not much income, but they have no idea how to deal with debt collections / creditors.

4. Any idea of timeline for a loan to be sold to debt collectors? Just trying to figure out how much time we have before this all starts. 

5. Would refinancing her loans remove our names from the debt? Sister has very little income so I'm guessing that would be an issue, as well as how behind the payments are for the large loan. My loan is less, and payments are more current so could that be one avenue to explore? I'd want all of the details in order before I try to contact her, but I'd talk to her if it was a possibility.

6. Maybe a bit off the wall, but I now work for the federal government (3+ years). I already paid off my own student loans, but could these loans be eligible for forgiveness since they are technically my loans too?

Thank you for all of your help, and please let me know if there's anything I didn't ask but should have asked. I'm sad about the broken relationships, but devastated that my sister can't seem to see what she's doing to my parent's finances. My Dad turns 60 this year and at this point, will never be able to retire.

TL;DR Parents and I co-signed for sister's loans and she is not paying. What can we do? More specifically, what steps can I take to help my parents?

All I can really see is that there is the ""hassle"" (is it really a hassle in 2017) of having the two accounts instead of just the one. I'm not sure if there would be any delay in pulling money out on an Ally account (or transferring to my PNC account) when an emergency were to happen, hence keeping the $1000 in PNC that I could access at any time (can access from ATM).

I know this seems like a simple question, just don't have a lot of financially literate folks around me.",finance

personalfinance,"With the change to our current household income... should we pay off our car loan now, or wait?","Hello /r/personalfinance!

My husband and I currently have approximately $10K in our joint checking account and $10K in our joint savings account. I have a car loan that was taken out in 2016 with a current balance of $8,496.00 and an interest rate of 3.94%. Our minimum monthly payments are $253.70.

Here's the issue - I'm starting graduate school in the fall full-time and I will be unable to continue employment. Previously, we were bringing in over $6K per month so we're going to be tightening our finances quite drastically to just over $3K per month. Fortunately, I have the cost of graduate school covered already and will not be dipping into our income for that reason.

What we want to know is... does it make good financial sense if we pay off my car loan now? If our interest rate was lower, of course, I wouldn't be hesitant about waiting to pay it off. 

We're open to any and all suggestions! Thank you in advanced!",finance
personalfinance,Was supposed to get a raise at my job but boss never did anything about it. Do I get back pay? if so how do i go about that?,"m 18 years old and ive worked at a restaurant for over a year now. i started in July 2016 as a host (seating people, bussing tables, etc.). I was then asked to work in the kitchen because they were short staffed. As a host my wage was $7.50/hr and kitchen wage is $9.00/hr. My old boss was a lazy prick who lied left and right about doing shit around the restaurant and never told me I was going to get a raise by moving to the kitchen. So since about February ive been working 4-5 shifts a week, closing during the week while i was in school, not getting home till 1 am. And the whole time ive been making $7.50/hr. We start off paying kitchen people $9.00/hr like thats required. And recently ive trained people in the kitchen who have had virtually no kitchen experience and they are making more than me! i found out Yesterday when one of my managers came up to me and told me. I had forgotten to clock out the night before and when she went to adjust my hours that morning she saw that my pay rate was $7.50. She immediately changed it to $9.00 because my old boss (who got fired a month ago) told her months ago that he was going to give me the raise to kitchen pay but never did. I talked to my parents about it last night and they said something about back pay. So I would like to know if they legally have to pay me for the hours that i shouldve had $9.00/hr or if i get anything out of this other than my next check. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,(CAN) Having trouble securing good finance rates despite great/excellent credit rating,"This is just as much as rant as it is seeking advice.  Scroll down to TL:DR if you don't want the details.

I am a 32 single guy (has a GF but not married), live on my own, in Burnaby, Canada.

My family was poor growing up to the point where when I told my Dad I wanted to go to university to pursue a undergraduate degree in Computer Science, he literally started crying because they had no way to support me and he told me that I would have to fund it myself. I was the first person in my family to achieve an undergraduate degree.

I went to school full time, took out a $10, 000 student line of credit at 6.5% financing that my grandparents co-signed for (interest rates were high at the time, this was before the crash in 2008) and started my university stint.

Part way through University I went into Cooperative education (think paid internship for course credit) which gave me enough experience and made an impression on my employer that I achieved the means of finding good full time employment while attending school. My school has full and part time flexibility. I was able to work at a $50k year job and attend school in the evenings part time at this point.

It took me 9.5 years to get my Bachelors degree. However, I was living on my own, graduated with over 5 years experience in my field and with less than 12k of debt (I acquired a 1500 limit Visa during my studies).

While I was at school, since both my Visa and Credit Line where classified as ""student"" credit, I was only obligated to pay the interest rates until I graduated and doing so did not effect my rating or impacted my rates. My visa was switched over to a normal one and pay-back plan was setup on the line of credit 6 months after I graduated.

That was over 3 years ago. Last year, I needed a new car badly. I had a Jeep YJ that was mainly a hobby vehicle that I worked on and a commuter 1995 Honda Civic that was on its last legs. Called my bank and they said that since my credit history was young, they could give me a line of credit for 50k at 10.1%. Through desperation I took the rate and bought a 2007 Honda Accord for $5000 and paid off the balance on my line of credit within a year.

In the last six years, I have never been behind on any bills or credit that I have on my accounts. I normally pay my credit card off each month or transfer the balance from my CC to my credit line (19% vs 10.1%) if I couldn't manage to pay it off in full.

Right now, I am sitting with zero balance on all my accounts with exception to my student line of credit which is under 5k now where I made monthly fixed payments on. I have been at my new job for nearly 3 years and make roughly $65 000 salary plus bonuses. I moved closer to work to save commuting time and money. My rent (I don't own) is $1037 per month plus bills which is exceptional in my area (average is about $1400)

I usually put away $500-700 easily into savings without making any changes to lifestyle.

I recently thought about consolidating my Vehicles by selling my Accord and YJ and buying a new or used (2012+) vehicle that fits my lifestyle and future life goals with my girlfriend. I wanted a vehicle that could last me 6 or so years at least and have enough capacity to support a possible family and still allow me to get away on the weekends.

I spent months researching how to prepare to get good finance rates, did my homework with strategies on dealer tactics. Before setting foot on a dealership lot, I wanted to come with a financing offer from my bank. I subscribed to the two big credit reporters in Canada (equifax and transunion). I am sitting at 855 with Equifax and 803 with Transunion so I would have ammo to negotiate.

I contacted my bank. They offered a reduction to my 50k credit line from 10.1% to 7.45% with interest only payment option. They said that my credit was excellent and that this was a great deal (maybe for a credit line but the dealer was quoting me 5.5% even before I set foot on the lot and allowed them to check my credit). I asked about an auto loan and the man said that the best that could probably do given my credit history was 6.69% but they would have to know the exact vehicle I was looking to buy (which neuters my ability to negotiate rates with the dealer). I expressed my displeasure and mentioned the quoted rate from the dealer and he said that if I owned my home, I could use my equity to get better rates (usually prime plus 1%, prime is 2.7% right now). He also said that the dealer can use a vehicle as a lean and therefore offer a lower rate.

Vancouver has the worst housing market. Condos here are going for 500k+ for single bedroom dwellings built in 1985. Houses are easily over 2 Million for run down shacks that require renovations.

When I talk to colleagues and friends. They all seem to be able to get good rates despite being in student, credit debt. Some of them leverage multiple finance payments with vehicles, homes, toys, CCs, etc. Does Pandora's box literally open when you own a home? Hell many don't even own a home.

I feel like I am being dicked around here and wondering if there is anything I can do to get better rates? Am I crazy to think I could get a rate that is less than 5%? 

TL:DR - I feel like I have been the poster child when it comes to handling my personal finances yet I am getting, what I think, is terrible finance rates despite great/excellent credit ratings with less than 5k+ debt to my name and the ability to put away $700 a month into savings. Am I doing something wrong?",finance
personalfinance,Thought I was in deferment and now I have 19 late payments on my credit report from student loans. If I pay off the account will the late payments be removed from my credit report?,"Called FedLoan in June 2016 and asked to defer my loan payments as I was in-between jobs.

I also need to consolidate the two credits card and im wanting to move banks (currently with us bank, and i havent been a fan of them). I cant make payments on all of it.

personalfinance,Paying on FHA mortgage less than a year. Mortgage company keeps calling me to refinance. What's the catch?,"We built a mobile home on small acreage that we own(ed) (we signed the property to the mortgage co. instead of paying cash closing costs). Total construction costs setup and the whole thing was ~120k. When we started paying the mortgage amount was around 100k. 

Six months in we start getting these fairly aggresive calls from my mortgage company about a streamline refinance. They claim they can take the interest rate down (4.5% currently) and 'probably' cut down our monthly payment by 80 bucks or so if we refinance. They claim we won't have to pay closing costs like a traditional refinance, you just do some paperwork and sign some stuff and it's all taken care of.

So what's the catch? I've looked up these FHA refinance rules and  each site I read says something different. Some say that they just roll the closing costs into your new loan so you really are paying it, or that it resets the payoff period - you are paying less but you've just extended your payments another 6 months. I've also looked up that this may increase the amount we pay in mortgage insurance which is pretty ridiculous already IMO.

I'm already skeptical of this especially since they seem really pushy about this. I don't want to miss out on an opportunity to lower that interest rate though.",finance

The appraisal came back 285k, actually over the purchase price.

The home was in disrepair and required extensive work.  I've put about $5,000 into it in just materials, plus many hours of sweat equity.  The housing market in my area is *very hot* with homes going under contract within 48 hours of listing.

According to Zillow, which I take with a huge grain of salt, my current home value is 331k.

Is it ridiculous to be thinking of a refi now to eliminate the PMI?  I've made a total of one measly payment on my current loan.  Credit score is around 750.  I think the home will appraise for at least 80% LTV on the refi considering all the factors:

1. Extremely hot market with prices trending up
2. Original appraisal came in over original asking price
3. Extensive repairs made by myself

Last August I started a full time job making 51k/year and I started paying off my loans in February when the payments began. I'm currently paying the minimum of about $1300/month and while it is doable I would like to figure out how to lower the interest and pay it off ASAP.

Now for the details. I have 12 separate payments on loans each month through Nelnet. 8 of these loans are Stafford (4 subbed and 4 unsubbed) and 4 are Parent Plus loans. The interest rates on these vary from 3.4%-7.9% (yikes!). The Stafford and Parent Plus loans are on 2 separate accounts (2 grouped payments of about $300 and $1000 respectively).

Before I had to start making payments I managed to save quite a bit and I'm still saving now. My current monthly income after all expenses is in the ballpark of $500. I've now got about 8k in the bank which I'm not really sure what to do with. I feel like I should probably put a good chunk of this money towards my highest interest loan. However I will likely be moving next year, and getting a higher paying job, and I may need some extra money for housing and what not.

What is my best plan of action? Should I look into consolidating/refinancing? Should I just pay a little more towards my highest interest loan each month?

personalfinance,To PLOC or not to PLOC?,"My wife and I are considering whether to roll our non-mortgage debt into our personal line of credit. We're having our first kid in a month, and she's going to stop working for the foreseeable future, so we're trying to set up our finances as best as possible. The PLOC is for $30, we have a $0 balance, no fees, and a 2-year term that is renewable. More details (as of 9/1 or so):

Salary: $160k
Credit card debt: $0 (paid off monthly)
EF: $5500
Combined 401k: $145k
PLOC limit ($0 balance): $30k
PLOC rate: 6.25% (floating)
Wife's consumer loan balance/monthly minimum: $4600/$220
Consumer loan rate: 8.25%
Car loan balance/minimum: $8400/$930
Car loan rate: 3%

The plan is to pay off both the car loan and consumer loan (combined ~$13k) by drawing from the PLOC. Our reasoning is that the PLOC gives us 1) more month-by-month flexibility, as opposed to the fixed monthly minimum for the loans ($1120), and 2) at a slightly higher combined interest rate (I think it would amount to about $150/year in extra interest).

As I see it, our low EF is pretty glaring given our monthly expenses. So I need to build up EF/savings a good bit more while continuing to chip away at the debt - hence the desire to have more flexible monthly payments. We'd like to get to $10k as soon as possible, which would entail slow rolling the PLOC payments for 4-5 months.

Before this I never budgeted and had no real financial discipline. I'm just now trying to get my finances in order.


In college, I took out 6 student loans. Four of those loans are federal subsidized and the other 2 are unsubsidized, all totaling around $32K. Two of the six loans are unsubsidized and started to accumulate interest. The rates for all 6 of these loans vary from 3.76% to 4.66%.

I have $1400 in CC debt that I recently accumulated from moving expenses but it is on a 0% APR for 12 months so I plan on being able to pay that off before the introductory period ends.

I know that I should have a 6 month emergency fund for this very reason but even if I trim my expenses to achieve that $24K in savings, I would have to cut back on my student loan payments which would also set me back financially.

personalfinance,Is it better to get a higher-interest loan and pay it off sooner or be locked into a low-interest loan?,"Hello /r/personalfinance!

I am looking for this subreddit's opinion about what is a wiser choice when looking at types of loans

If you had to borrow $20,000 and had a choice between a five-year fixed-rate loan at 8.49% and a variable-rate loan starting at 13.90% that you could pay off sooner with no added fees, which loan would be the smarter choice?

By making much higher repayments on the variable loan, you could have it paid off in three years and would have paid the same amount of interest in three years as you would have paid on the five year fixed rate loan.

I guess I'm asking for both a personal finance point of view and also an emotional point of view. Is it a better idea to go with the 'riskier' variable interest rate loan or stick with the longer loan where you know exactly how much you'll be paying but will have no opportunity to pay the loan down sooner without incurring fees?",finance
personalfinance,'Closed' account in collections still logging late payments. Looking for help/advice,"In June of 2014 I signed up for laser hair removal and received a treatment after my consultation. I realized later on I had signed a contract for a package deal that ultimately adds up to a couple thousand dollars. Though the consultant misrepresented the contract I signed, I am at fault for not thoroughly reading what I signed. 

At the time I was not able to afford this contract and the payment went to a collection agency called Fortiva Financial LL. I had never received any notices and only noticed that I had multiple late payments being logged when I recently downloaded the app Mint. The account is labeled ""closed"" with a balance of roughly $600 (looks like they only charged me for the first few treatments) and has been logging late payments since June of 2014. I believe this is causing my credit score to stay around 640-670 and not allowing me to improve as the rest of my credit history is spotless. 

After researching online, I am conflicted as to what to do. I'm afraid to contact the company out of fear they will come after me hard. I've also read that this collection will affect my credit score for 7 years anyways, which makes me feel like there is no point in paying it off if it won't improve my score. I'm nervous about these late payments too - how long will they keep logging late payments? And will this ""7 year"" clock start when the late payments end? Or did it start when this balance went to collections? Does the $600 balance only reflect one payment and they'll be wanting more?

In this post I'll share with you most of the info I acquired about the PlayStation 5 in the previous 2 months. It took a lot of effort and time, but I think it was worth it. Also, you don't need to believe any word you read here. It won't make my day better or worse and it won't change the fact that these information are valid/true. Also it's possible that I made some mistakes and or I forget to mention something, but this post took long enough to write anyway. So maybe I'll add more clarifications and info to the post in the upcoming hours / days. Okay then. Are you ready? Let's get started. It will be a long read.

---

**[RELEASE DATE]**

---

**The new PlayStation(s) will release in the first quarter (not financial quarter) of 2019.**

* There are several simple reasons behind this. Sony needs time to finalize the hardware, finish and polish the games, properly market them, and build enough consoles that will satisfy the players' needs. Also, they don't want to release it too early because it can damage their brand (PS4 Pro just released not too long ago). To put it simply, early 2019 seems the best to them from every logical standpoint. If everything goes right, it will be a worldwide release.

---

**[HARDWARE / TECHNICAL INFORMATIONS]**

---

**There will be two console variants at launch. A normal version, simply called PlayStation 5, and a version with expanded feature-set and modified hardware, called PlayStation 5 Pro.**

* Sony doesn't believe in mid-gen refreshes. They think that half-gen consoles can negatively effect the console industry's health. PS4Pro was a necessary step because 7th gen consoles (including PS4) turned out to be too weak and obsolote. 

* Sony needed to take a step to try to keep players from moving to PC. They don't think about Xbox as a competition, they rather fear from PC. The point is that in the PS5's lifecycle there won't be any mid-gen refreshes, but there will be a superior version of the console available at launch.

**Both systems will be built from the ground up.**

* What that means is  - at least in Sony's console(s) – there won't be any AMD parts for example. It will be a totally unique system with it's own architecture. There's a very strong reason behind this firstly questionable decision. By sticking to the AMD parts / PC architecture, Sony would not have been able to make/sell a console that is capable of running games as they wanted – at least for a reasonable price.

**4K at 60-120FPS will be the new standard in console gaming (at least on Sony's side), as well as native ultrawide support.**

* I think it's kinda expected and unsurprising that next gen consoles will have proper UHD (3840x2160) support. The new Xbox One X already hits native 4K resolution in a lot of games and till the release of PS5 there are still 1,5 years left. What is more interesting though however is the new standard in framerate and the support of 21:9 aspect ratio.

* That's one of the key reasons why Sony decided to build a system from the ground up. By sticking to the PC architecture, the PS5 would have been just as much stronger than PS4Pro as PS4Pro is stronger than the base PS4. It would not have been a significant leap and there would not have been any worthy increase in simulation complexity in games. Also in this case, game would have been run at only 30 FPS (while some games at 60 FPS).

* By creating a very powerful, uniquely designed console though, it's possible to deliver true 4K at 60 FPS in all games for a quite reasonable price. In fact, Sony won't allow games to be released on PS5 that don't hit at least 60 FPS. Basically the types of games that run at 30 on PS4 will run at 60 on PS5, and the types of games that run at 60 on PS4 will run at 120 on PS5. All VR games will run at 120 FPS.

* The ultrawide support will be mandatory for all games, so it seems like we are going to see a similar change when we switched from PS2 to PS3 (UWD TVs by Sony are coming, more about them later). It won't be 2K ultrawide (3440x1440), it will be proper 4K at ultrawide (so higher resolution than normal 4K).

---

**[PERIPHERIALS AND OTHER HARDWARE]**

---

**The base controller (that you get with your system) will be highly customizable.**

* You will be able to easily take it apart, and change the things you don’t like about it (thumbsticks, triggers, etc.), or you can even add extra buttons or a differently colored touchpad for example to it. 

**PSVR will be compatible with PlayStation 5, but there will be a newer version if it.**

* The newer version of PSVR will have a higher FOV and higher resolution amongst many other things, but you won’t need to switch to it, if you don’t want to. You will be able to use the first VR goggles too in every PS5 VR game.

**There will be an offical mouse &amp; keyboard bundle by Sony.**

* Mouse and keyboard will be officially supported, and every game will be optimized for them too. In multiplayer games, you’ll be able to choose if you want to get matched against keyboard &amp; mouse users or not if you are using a controller.

* It’s not yet decided if you can use normal PC peripherials or not, but there’s a high chance these won’t be allowed. Aside from Sony, three major companies are working on a dedicated PS5 mouse &amp; keyboard right now.

**Sony plans to release their affordable 4K ultrawide TVs before Christmas in 2018.**

* Just when they tried to sell PS2 consoles for it’s DVD playback function, or when they tried to sell PS3 consoles for it’s Blu Ray playback function, they’ll try to do something similar this time too.

* Sony will try to sell their ultrawide televisions, and the PS5 consoles with UWD support will be a big help in this. The TVs will be affordable and will have low input lag and real 120Hz display. That’s all I know right now.

---

**[PRICING]**

---

**PlayStation 5 will be 450-500$, while PlayStation 5 Pro will be 600-650$.**

* These prices are estimates by Sony, and while they seem very high to ask for consoles, read further, and you'll understand that these are totally justified. I have no information yet about european pricing.

**The new PS VR (possibly called PS VR Pro) will be 400$.**

* As I already pointed out, it will offer higher resolution and FOV, while games will run at 120 FPS, but aside from these I don’t have any worthy information about the hardware itself.

---

**[BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY]**

---

**There will be backward compatiblity, but the base PS5 won’t be able to play PS4 games.**

* That’s possibly one of the biggest reasons why the Pro version is more expensive. PlayStation 5 games will run the same way on it as on normal PS5, but the heavily modifed (and added plus) hardware will allow it to run games from 7th gen that the base modell couldn’t simply handle.

* Sony had to make this step, because Xbox has the backward compatiblity (as well as PC, of course), so there is a high pressure on them. The unique architecture of the base PS5 however doesn’t make it possible to run PS4 games, or at least it would be way too complicated / time-consuming to recode them to run on the system. 

* So what basically the PS5 Pro does is it includes a PS4 in itself in a way – it’s not the best way to phrase it, but the point is that’s how it becomes possible to run games on it from 7th gen flawlessly, even from a disc.

* PS1, PS2, and PS3 games will work without a problem though on both systems, you just need to insert the disc to the console, while PSP and PS Vita games will only be available digitally to purchase.

**You will be able to play two games on your  PS5 Pro at once.**

* In house at Sony they refer to it as dual play, but the final name of this function will probably be something different. The Pro version will have 2 HDMI ports so you can hook up the console to two displays at once, allowing you to run two games on the console at the same time.

* This will be a great option to family members and friends who want to play at the same time. It will only work though with PS1, PS2, PS3, PSP, and PS Vita games. This means that you can run two PS2 games at the same time for example, but you can’t run two PS4, or two PS5 games (obviously). What you can do though is to run a PS5 game on one screen and a PS2 game on the other one.

* You’ll also be able to play PS2, PS3, PSP, and PS Vita games online with your friend, meaning that the system will simulate the online play, but in reality the two of you will play together offline. This was a crucial step from Sony and it was made to preserve the games’ legacy and keep them alive for future players. So even if a game’s servers are offline, you’ll be able to play it locally with it’s simulated online method with someone else.

---

**[SOFTWARE INFORMATIONS]**

---

**Releasing a demo / trial to a game will be mandatory.**

* Yes. You read that right. Demos are coming back. In fact, from the launch of PS5, developers can only release their game, if they release a demo or a time-locked trial one week before it. This way consumers can try out the products before they decide to buy them.

* If a developer won’t release a demo in time, retail copies (Blu-Ray) of that game won’t be playable until one week has passed since the demo’s release. Basically PS5 will receive mini-updates very frequently (in the background) that are used to unlock games.

* What is important to mention is that the demo / trial should be representative of the final product (should contain a sequence from the game), so things like Platinum demo for Final Fantasy XV won’t be eligible for this purpose.

**There will be a new in-house engine that will be available to use by every developer freely.**

* Sony is developing a graphics/physics engine simultaneously with PS5’s hardware. It will completely utilize the power and unique aspects of PS5 and it will be available to every developer for free. They want it to become popular so more and more devs will use it, this way making much more engaging and complex games. They want it to be used by 60% of the developers by the end of 2021. 

---

**[SMALLER INFORMATIONS]**

---

* There won’t be any region lock.
* The screens/menus will be more customizable.
* All major video, audio, and picture formats will be supported at launch by the system (so you will be able to watch MKV movies with DTS sound).
* Adjustable FOV will be a common thing in PS5 games.
* The system will be localized to every country’s language where the console launches.
* There will be a built-in 3D support in the system. Basically you’ll be able to play every game in 3D.

---

**[THE FUTURE OF PLAYSTATION]**

---

* There were some changes in the management of PlayStation brand, and there are some new faces at the top of Sony who would like to make some changes regarding PS. This only affects PS5 (and probably everything forward), not the PS4.

* They want to bring console gaming much closer to PCs, this way motivating PC players to join the PlayStation family and also create a more healthier, more user-friendly, and much bigger PlayStation community / playerbase. There are some key points they want to achieve to fulfill this vision.

* They also think that while the price will be higher, they expect a lot of PC players to switch to PS5 thanks to their efforts. So all in all, they’ll expect even better sales than they had with PS4.

* The customizable menus, the 60 FPS (and 120 FPS probably in competitive games), the backward compatibility, the adjustable FOV, the keyboard &amp; mouse support, the ultrawide support (and many others) were made to ensure that PC players will be satisfied enough with the system that they consider switching to it, while the core PS players will remain loyal to Sony.

---

**[GAMES]**

---

**Blade Runner: [Working Title]**

* Rockstar Games and Sony made a deal roughly 10 years ago about an exclusive game, which was codenamed Agent. It was never cancelled, but the technological limitations of the PS3 and the PS4 made it impossible to fulfill the creators' vision of the game. What is a little bit more interesting though is that it's actually an open-world game set in the Blade Runner universe.

* Flying cars, streets with full of neon lights, you name it. It's a story about someone who got killed and his consciousness got transferred to a replicant, but he lost most of his memories, including how he died. The goal of the player is to unfold the events that happened before.

* I don’t want to give too much away, the game will be shown at 2017’s PSX anyway (and at then end of the reveal they won’t name any platforms, because the console will only be revealed at next year’s E3).

* All I can say though is what I’ve seen so far is possibly on of the best things I’ve ever saw in my life. I saw the opening of the game (first half hour) that is more adrenalin-pumping than MGS V’s first hour and it’s more cathartic and emotionally touching than The Last of Us’s intro.

* This is the demo that will be shown at PSX as far as I know. It starts similarly to 1998’s Dark City (a naked man with basically no memories) and people want to kill him.

* There were some very disturbing scenes... when the guy stepped in a room full of dead replicants cut into little pieces... his face... the face he made really got me. I don’t know who is responsible of the motion capture, but it’s fucking lifelike. I got so invested.

* All of the demo takes place inside buildings, and the demo ends with our nameless hero finally steps outside and got rescued by a team who seems like knows what happened to him. Our protagonist climbs into the vertibird (you know, something like you could see in Fallout 4), while the camera still pans the main protagonist’s frightened and terrified face... then the vertbird starts to rise and the camera starts to move further and further away from our protagonist’s face, revealing the huge smoke and neon filled city down under... and the Blade Runner them kicks in, then the screen turns black, and all you can see is the Blade Runner logo. I’ve got chills everywhere after I watched it. I still can’t comprehend all of the things I saw.

* To talk a little about the gameplay too, it will be very grounded and realistic. There will be The Witcher III level of quality side missions, and the game will be playable in both third and first person (in the demo they showed both). But I think it’s enough for now, you guys will see it soon anyway.

**Project Euphoria**

* Telltale Games is working on a timed exclusive for PS5. The game will hit other platforms (PC, and possibly the next Xbox Helios) one year after the release on Sony's platform. 

* It will be a story-driven game, but with more interactivity as you might expect from the studio (Until Dawn is a good reference), and it will heavily center around the underground trance music culture of the '90s. The game is mainly inspired by movies such as Trainspotting, Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road, and The Breakfast Club, so expect something in the vein of these movies (road movie feeling, moral problems of young people and growing up, etc.).

* The game won't have an official title yet, but what is given is that it will be an episodic title, like previous games by the developers. Also it will be a completely new IP, not another licensed product. The game is still in early development, but Telltale already hired a writer who worked on critically acclaimed movies in the past and he has almost 100% control over the game's story.

**Project Neon**

* A newly established first party studio by industry veterans is working on a racing title that focuses on illegal street racing and underground car culture (yeah, I know, first underground music culture, and now this). The game don't have an official title, only a project name (Neon), and it's expected to hit shelves at the launch of PS5.:

* What you need to know is there will be a very, very deep level of customization. This is the number #1 goal of the team. You will be able to change everything on your car, and it won't be like in other games in which you have only one or two options per category. There will be plenty.

* There won't be day and night cycles. You will only able to play/drive at night. The game will be open-world though.

* There will be cockpit view (along with full interior customization).

* Staying true to the underground car culture, there won't be any supercars in the game, just regular cars that you can see in everyday's life (but you will be able to make top tier cars out of them).

* The controls will fall between Race Driver: Grid's and Forza Horizon 3's controls. It will be a simcade game basically. Easy to learn, but difficult to master.

* The cars will be able to get damaged in a meaningful way. A whole separate team is working on the damage model alone.

* There will be pedestrians.

* There will be a story, and you will be able to to play the entire game with other people.

* To cut the story short, there are two reasons why Sony decided a game like this needs to happen. First, they wanted a racing game for PS5's launch, and based on the current circumstances, GT7 is still years and years away. Second, they wanted to fill the empty void in the world of racing games. Sony saw that there's a huge demand and market for a game like this, still, no studio attempted to do anything like this (well, except EA with 2015's NFS, but that was a disappointment for most people).

**Silent Hill: The Definitive Collection / The Essential Collection**

* Sony plans to re-release at least one classic game (or trilogy) every year. We’ve seen it this year in the form of the Crash trilogy (although it’s a game in Activision’s hands), and next year we’ll se a Shadow of the Colussus remake. 2019 will be the year of Silent Hill’s revival.

* The thing is Sony is in heavy talks with Konami because they want to acquire the licenses of their key franchises, namely Metal Gear, Castlevania, and of course, Silent Hill. The talks are ongoing, but they managed to get the rights to do a remake of the old games (the first three ones). If they succeed, that could mean we will finally see the game that Kojima and Del Toro envisioned – but only after Death Stranding released.

* I saw some early prototypes from these games. A lot of original creators are involved in the making of this project. There will be expanded scenes and new story elements in each game, new voice acting, and players will be able to go from one place to another seamleslly without the game having to load.

**Project Freedom**

* There’s a new IP that can be played in VR too (it will be a 120 FPS title). It’s a very clean and stylish game that borrows elements from some of the best games (Superhot, Portal, Mirror’s Edge, Titanfall, Q.U.B.E. – The Director’s Cut) to create a truly unique and fascinating experience.

* It’s a high-octane first person puzzle platformer and shooter with a heavy emphasis on movement, speed, and style. The soundtrack of it is fucking awesome and the gameplay is INSANE! This will be available on PS4 too, but the PS5 version will have some extra features.",technology

personalfinance,"About six months out from buying my first car. Should I take out a modest loan, or sell some investments and pay for it in cash?","Background: I'm in my early 20s, in graduate school, working on my PhD. I have a fellowship that covers my tuition and pays me a stipend of ~$32k/year (after taxes). In about six months, I will be relocating to a rather suburban area for a significant period of time. I will need a car. I expect to have $6k already saved for a downpayment by the time I move.

My plan was that I would look for a used car in the $10-12k range, pay $6k down, and take out a loan to cover the other $5k or so.

However... I also have ~$10k in a taxable investment account. Probably more like $13k by the time I move. I could sell $4-6k worth of this and pay for the car upfront, in cash.

Why do I have a pile of money sitting in a taxable investment account, you ask? Because of the way my institution treats my fellowship, my stipend isn't ""taxable compensation"" under the IRS definition of the phrase and therefore I'm not eligible to contribute to an IRA. That taxable investment account is my retirement savings. Obviously, I'd want to replenish what I sell off, but I could easily do that with the money that would otherwise be going into making monthly loan payments.

Does it make more sense to take out a loan, or to sell some of my investments and pay for the car up front? My intuition is that it's better to take out the loan because I'd expect higher returns in the stock market (5-7%, maybe more) than the interest rate on the loan (hopefully about 3%, maybe less). However, I'm sure there's factors that should go into this decision that I don't really understand (capital gains taxes, for one) and/or don't know about. I'm hoping you guys can help me figure out what those are and what the best decision is.

Other financial details: $12k in an emergency fund in a savings account. ~$4.5k in a Roth IRA from a job I had the summer between undergrad and grad school, when my income was ""taxable compensation"" and I was allowed to contribute to one.

personalfinance,Low FICO Score,"My wife and I got a mortgage about 2 years ago, and we put it in her name because the interest rate was lower using only her credit. I kept thinking my credit score would keep going up over time until they were equal. Fast forward to today and my FICO score is still only 615 which is about the same, or slightly lower than 2 years ago.

Here's what is on my credit report.

1. No negative accounts.

2. 5 separate student loans totaling over $35,000 all paid in full.

3. A $17,000 auto loan paid in full.

4. A $2,000 retail\furniture loan paid in full. I have read that this type of credit account can register as negative, even when paid. Since only a moron would turn down an interest-free loan I don't quite follow the logic. 

5. A single revolving credit card with a $5000 limit that never carries a substantial balance.

So the bottom line is that my FICO score hasn't gone up in over 2 years and despite having an established on-time payment history and no negative accounts. Since I don't carry a lot of debt, I feel like I am the most creditworthy guy on the planet and yet, the credit bureau seems to disagree. Why is my FICO score still just barely scraping by as ""fair"".

Should I open another credit card? Close this credit card? Raise the credit limit? Try to get the retail account removed? Call a lawyer and have them dispute the entire FICO score as inaccurate reporting?

**EDIT: I've learned that closing an account can counter-intuitively lower your FICO score, even if it's closed because it was paid in full and on-time. Most people seem to agree that the reason the score is low is that I have only one revolving credit account open. Sounds like I need to find a good credit card and open another account.

financialindependence,How to handle a big increase in pay?,"Hi all, classic long time lurker and first time poster here. First, thanks to all the people who contribute to this subreddit! 

Before we get in to the specifics, let me just say that I am not necessarily aiming for an early retirement as soon as possible. I am only just entering the adult workforce at 27 after studying for six years, and I have just secured a job that is highly interesting to me. Of course that might change, and while I don't have a specific RE goal in mind, I already do my best with savings and intent to continue doing so. Since I am not from the US I have roughly translated from my currency to USD for the specifics below. 

I've just graduated from university and secured my first full-time position. As the title says, this comes with not just all the wonderful responsibilities of being a grown-up working for real, but also with quite a lot more money than I've ever had before - I'm based in the EU but will be going from about 1500 USD / month to 7200 USD / month. Also, I live with my gf of 8 years who will graduate her studies next year. She currently makes about 1500 USD / month and this will go up to about 5000 USD / month next year. 

This is a substantial increase in pay that I am honestly unsure how to handle. I would love to hear advice from people who have experienced substantial increases in their income on how they have managed to retain their earnings and avoid lifestyle creep. Also, I don't really know how to manage an income like this. Since I am in the EU, the rules are different than those in the US, but some of the same principles still apply.  

Some details regarding the current situation: 

Student loans: 55.000 (50/50 split between my and my gf) Interest rate is variable but low (1-3% depending on when payments begin)

Housing: 200.000 USD 30 year loan with an interest of 3.7% (currently payed down about 10.000)

Private savings account: 5% interest rate on cash deposits up to 10.000 (currently about 5.000 in cash sitting there)

I will be entering into a corporate pension scheme (my employer will contribute 3 % of may monthly salary, and I am free to pay as much as I would like) All payments towards pension are made before tax which is applied upon payout somewhere down the road. Paying 20-30% of my monthly salary would put me below the upper limit for taxation (base tax is close to 50%, marginal taxes of up to 65% applied on every dollar made beyond a certain point). 

I do not currently have any investments, only my home and the savings account. The housing is perhaps an odd system, since it's part of a system based on a public appraisal, which is very stable over time. It's therefore somewhat insensitive to markets swings, but also offers a low degree of ROI compared to 100% private ownership.

My immediate plan is to fill the cash savings account all the way to the limit, since that offers the best guaranteed return. From there, I really don't know. I am strongly considering putting about 20% of my monthly salary before taxes towards pensions. This would leave about 3.500-4.000 monthly. From these, another 1200 would go towards covering costs of living, i.e. rent, mortgage, food, etc.. 

I know myself well enough that I have to have a plan for how to allocate the rest - or I will end up spending it on stupid things. But I also don't think that just throwing it into additional pension savings is the way to go, since I am unsure about the returns (expected 3-6% annual, but it varies). I will be increasing my payments on the housing, but I will probably not be paying more than the minimum on the student loans due to the low interest. 

I would really love any advice on how to best manage this. I have some thoughts, but it's really not much of a plan at the moment - so I'm sorry the rambling! I'm especially interested in hearing from people who have had a similar transition going from low-income to a substantial increase in pay almost overnight. How did you manage your new income? I am worried that, without a proper plan, I will just increase my spending and slowly bleed money. 

Anyway, this has been a wall of text, so thanks for reading :) 

Edit: This attracted more attention than I had thought. Thanks for all the thoughtful replies. You guys have given me a lot of solid points to think on!",finance

personalfinance,Read before you get the American Express Blue Cash Everyday card.,"Hello PF. I would just like to share my experience with American Express and hopefully save you some of the he headaches I've endured. 


About 6 months ago, I signed up for the American Express Blue Cash Everyday rewards card because I didn't want to be restricted to what I could and couldn't do with points. Basically, they restrict how you can use your cash back so that you can't really use it. They've also shorted me at least $20 in cash back, but it doesn't matter because I can't really use it anyway. Essentially, the only way you can use your cash back is in the form of a statement credit, and you have to use it in increments of $25. Have $60 cash back? Too bad, you can only use $50. Have $24? Sucks to suck man. 


They also gave me a limit that's equal to more than 2/3 of my income, which is just unethical because if I was fiscally illiterate I could *easily* dig a HUGE hole for myself. My interest rate is also like 24%, compared to 17% on my other card. For what it's worth, Discover has by far been a dream to deal with and their cash back system is amazing.",finance

personalfinance,Mother's basement floods a week after retiring.,"Not sure if you've all heard of some of the flooding going on in Illinois but sadly my basement took a hit last night and we ended up with about a foot of water in our basement. Insurance said it could cover 10k of the damages. I don't know my mother's financial situation too well but she kept repeating things like ""I can't afford this!"" through the night. The water is drained today and damage done, What I was wondering if anyone has been through this before that could throw some life advice my way. Google says a drywall job for something this scale costs MINIMUM 10K and upwards of like 20K. This seems rediculous to me but I'm just 21. Is the 10K our insurance quoted us on non negotiable? They didn't even care to ask for pictures of what was destroyed like I usually hear about. Do websites like gofundme actually work in situations like this? Should I pick up an extra job so my mom doesn't use up her retirement savings trying to repair the basement?  Hope everyone is staying dry out there, thanks for reading this mess.
Edit: a co-worker told me that when her basement flooded she got a federal grant for 5K because her area was deemed a natural disaster area. Will look into this as well",finance
personalfinance,"Interest rate on refi changed, seeking advice","Doing a refi and the loan value changed (got cheaper than estimated) and so the interest rate went up by 0.05%. 

I ran the numbers and while the interest rate went up, since I'm borrowing around 4K less, the total interest costs still went down. 

However, the lender offered to keep the original interest rate by increasing the loan amount enough to get the loan-to-value to where it has to be to keep that interest rate. The extra would be rolled into escrow. 

How do I gauge what's the best course?  It'd about $1,000 cheaper, over the term, with the higher interest rate but lower loan amount, but I was thinking... our escrow in the past has been short from time to time and our monthly has gone up as insurance goes up and such. With such a relatively low interest rate difference of 0.05, maybe it makes more sense to borrow more to cover the inevitable insurance increases. 

Any advice?",finance

personalfinance,"[UK] New Job At £40k, Can't Decide If I Should Rent My Own Flat, Buy Or House Share Again","So yes, my current job brings in about £1800 a month for me, and this new permanent job will bring in about £2350 or so after taxes.  

My rent last year was £650 a month for a double room (incl. bills), met my girlfriend, and our current flat is costing us £695 a month after bills each.

We've broken up a few days ago (boo hoo) and have about 1.5 months left on our contract, ends at the end of August.  It's not awkward, it's a clean breakup and we're great friends.

My current job ends next week and my new one starts at the start of August, so I have a week off.

My projected expenses based on experience pcm:

* Phone - £20
* Food - £120-150
* Fuel - £30 a month due to living so close to work.  
* Rent - £695

* Typical saving per month - £400-700, sometimes barely anything depending on what I was doing that month.

I have two credit cards, one has 0% APR for 2 years that I got about 6 months ago, with about £500 on it.  My other one is paid off in full every month from Tesco and only ever has food and fuel charges put on it.

So I basically have no debt outside of my student loan which is paid automatically.

My savings currently sit at £17k, and I'm 30 years old.  £17k is too low I feel but hey, holidays arent cheap, nor were certain things I've bought in the past.

-------------------------------------------------------

**So, TLDR:**

* At £2350 a month income, what should my rent budget be for living alone?  Or should I consider a flatshare/roommate and spend £500-600 (incl. bills) instead of £800-1000 (excl. bills).  I would prefer my own place.
* If I stay where I am, my commute is about an hour and my fuel bill would be £150-200 a month.
* I am getting a new car upgrade (used) that is worth £8k, as my 2004 isn't doing so great any more and is worth maybe £1.2k.  I am taking out a £6k loan so I can keep £8k of my own money in savings at a higher rate than the interest rate of the loan, paying off £250 a month for 2 years.  Dad has said he will lend my the money if things go wrong, so no debt worries.  Loan of £6k over 2 years would cost me about £200 in interest.

Should I live by myself?  Can I financially?  Or should I find a room to rent and have a roommate and save more?  I want to live alone as roommates CAN be a pain in the ass to have around, and I like my own time alone, but having a roommate can be so much cheaper.

I'm not desperate for a house or flat of my own, but I know that would be ""cheaper"" each month.  My dad has said he would double whatever deposit for a place I have.  I dont want that burden of a place right now though.",finance

personalfinance,Locked mortgage interest rate now being increased at last minute by lender - help!,"Hi everyone - frequent lurker but haven't posted much so far. I am in the process of obtaining a mortgage (30 yr, fixed) from Quicken, and have a document from the lender that locked in my interest rate at just under 4%. 

There were two conditions for this lock:
1) I send them all the documents they asked for by 10th July. 2) I not change my loan in any way.

Re 1) They sent me the list of documents they needed only on the 7th. I had sent them all the docs by the 8th, except for a contact info for new homeowners insurance (the insurance guys needed more time to process). 

Re 2) I have not changed my loan in any way. My credit is exactly he same, and I have not made any major decisions or changes.

Other potentially salient factors: they appraised the home from their side, and it came to 5% below our purchase price. (But property value is still far above the value of the loan we are getting). The house is in Houston, TX.

I had two questions:
- what makes lenders change rates like this in spite of a lock?
- what options do I have for recourse with the current lender, besides abandoning and seeking another lender?",finance
personalfinance,Is there any rational reason I shouldn't pay off my car in full?,"I recently purchased a new car, but did not pay cash in full due to moving around the same time and didn't want to lower my e-fund past a comfortable level.

I'm now in a better position and ready to pay it off. The current balance is around ~23-24k. I believe my interest rate is around 2.9%. 

Now I'm just debating on if there's better ways to use the cash than dumping a large sum to pay off the loan. I'm maxing out my Roth IRA. Will be contributing 10%(not max) to the 401k at my new job once I'm eligible, and I have the option of contributing to a HSA (but not sure if I see reason to do this before maxing out my 401k).

Is there anything else that I'm not thinking of? I think I'd feel better about paying off the car loan completely and taking that monthly payment towards saving for a house / future wedding, but if there's ways I could make my cash work better for me and still accomplish that, I'm open to ideas.

personalfinance,Almost $6000 short to pay for school this semester...,"I'm going into my final year of college for my undergraduate degree. I was not able to accept the Federal Parent Plus Loan as my parents have recently filed for bankruptcy.

Last year I was given $4380 in grant money for the year which allowed me to dip into whatever I had in savings (investment account/savings account) to pay off the remaining balance on my fee bill.

Fast forward a bit and that grant money was taken away. I met with the financial aid department at school and they told me what changes I needed to make to my FAFSA comparing it to my application from the year before (as nothing had changed but I made a mistake in filling out this years application). I have made those changes and they need to review them and ask for something to substantiate my amendments. I'm planning on receiving grant money eventually though they did say that there are currently no funds available.

So with the grant out of the picture right now. I am $5,699 short for the semester. I don't have enough in savings to pay this for the semester let alone the spring semester.

I contacted my uncle yesterday and I told him my situation. I told him I needed to borrow a certain amount of money to pay for school this year and I know he would let me borrow the money interest free which is 1000x a better deal than cosigning a private loan.

With his money I can pay for the year. I'm thinking I leave whatever I have in my investment and saving accounts. So if the market stays the way it is I can at least be making some money through it, and then when I graduate at the end of the year I can use it to start paying my uncle back.

I wanted to post and ask for any advice or alternative options that I haven't thought about. I already have a work-study position for the school year which helps me pay for groceries at school, not my actual fee bill. I've never received any scholarships and it's kind of too late to apply for those.

TL;DR: I asked my uncle if I can borrow money interest-free to pay for college this year. He agreed. Are there any other options for me so I don't have to borrow as much?",finance

personalfinance,Would it be beneficial to consolidate a portion of student loans to get lower interest rate and start paying while deferring other loans until finished with grad school?,"Good morning /r/personalfinance!

I graduated from undergrad a year ago with a little over $100k in loans, ~$80k in private loans and ~$20k in direct subsidized/unsubsidized loans. I have a panic attack every time I think about it.

My husband and I both have great jobs. I am a contract C# developer, and I maintain a monthly income of between $4k and $3k. Usually, I bring in closer to $4k. My husband just started a salary job with incredible benefits. He will be bringing in around $3k a month. We have been working on building up an emergency fund, but it was recently drained a bit from unexpected bills. It's currently down to $2k. I usually strive to add at least $500 a month to our savings.

Our bills is $2500 minimally. However, I pay extra on the loan payment for my vehicle, so we usually pay around $3k a month for bills.

Our current debt beside my students loans is $6k for my vehicle. We have been blessed with my husband having no debt at all. My goal is to have the auto loan paid off by February. We have credit cards for building credit, but those are only used to pay some bills. I pay the bill with the credit card and immediately deposit the money from our bank account into a special account that I use the next month to pay the credit card bill. 

Currently, I attend grad school part-time, which has allowed me to defer all my current student loans. I am not taking any new loans for grad school, as we are being able to pay it off as we go. (Hallelujah!)

Now, to pick your brains about an idea for starting to pay off the looming student loans! Since we are paying up front for my grad school, I want to be able to pay down on some of my student loans without trying to kill us financially. I have looked in to loan consolidation, and I have formulated the following plan.

First off, I want to consolidate three of my largest loans, around $60k, right before we finish the car loan. These loans have 10% interest rate. I talked to a few consolidation companies, and it is looking as though I can at least get the interest rate down to 7%. The payments for this consolidation loan are looking like I can just roll over what I currently pay for my car loan. Hence, I want to get to where I have the car loan paid off so I can just roll that payment over to the consolidation loan.

Secondly, this will leave me with about $20k still in private loans. There are three reasons I want to exempt them from this consolidation loan. 

1. I want to keep the consolidation loan payments close to the car payment.
2. Their interest rates are all around 7%.
3. In addition to waiting to when I have better credit, I can consolidate the loans with the same company for a lower interest rate. Sofi, the one I plan to use, states that they will give me a .125% break. Although it's not alot, it still helps!

My federal loans are going to be the last ones I worry about, as they have 3% interest max. I am more focused on taking care of the private loans.

Is this a solid plan?

EDIT:
Here is the break down of all **Private Loans** (Total estimated payment = $1115):

1. **$22,929** - 10% - $303 estimated payment
2. **$21,809** - 10% - $288 estimated payment
3. **$16,751** - 10% - $221 estimated payment
4. $15,243 - 9.125% - $194 estimated payment
5. $5,396 - 7.5% - $64 estimated payment
6. $3,786 - 7.5% - $45 estimated payment

I have been pre-approved for the consolidation loan from Sofi for the first three loans (total $61,489) at an interest rate of 6.125. The estimated monthly payment will be $523, versus the current $812.

The auto loan with my parents is $5,755 at an interest rate of 2.5% I believe. The payments are $279 a month. Although I regularly pay around $500, we are going to bump it up to $800 since my husband has the new job.

I am in the process of trying to transfer to a better grad program that is much cheaper than where I am now. Since I am taking my time, I think I probably have another two years.",finance
politics,Meta Thread July 2017,"Hello, /r/politics community! Welcome to our monthly meta thread. The purpose of this thread is to discuss the overall state of the subreddit, including recent rule revisions, recent and upcoming changes, and suggestions you have for improving the sub. The June 2017 metathread can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6eum4g/june_2017_meta_thread/)

##Change to Submission Procedure - ""Bot Approve"" and ""Bot Remove"" have been disabled.

If you've ever submitted to our subreddit in the past, it's possible that you've seen the flair ""Bot approved/removed"" in use. This was an automatic queue cleanup process that approved posts with low numbers of reports, and removed posts with very low scores after a duration of time had passed without our review. Due to changes in how we are handling submissions, we have turned off this automation. This should not have any substantial impact on how r/politics/new behaves, as this process only effected posts that had been buried far into the queue. 

##IRC - Soliciting Feedback 

Did you know that r/politics has a live chat channel? It's true - our generous hosts at Snoonet provide [a space for IRC live chat](http://webchat.snoonet.org/politics) discussions for our community. The excellent reddit based [Orangechat](https://orangechat.io/) is [also available](https://app.orangechat.io/r/politics), and connected directly to the #politics IRC channel - either method of connecting will work.  Unfortunately it's been a while since we've given the channel any attention, so we'd like to take this time to solicit input on ways that we can improve the quality of discussion in that medium. Rule change requests? Bot requests? Overthrow the ops through political revolution? Let us hear it. Do **not** call out specific users by name - please discuss channel issues in generalized terms only. 

##What we're talking about

There are some persistent themes that have been brought up in the last several meta discussions that we've definitely been talking about behind the scenes. Here are a few answers to common questions:

**Q: What's the deal with *X* source? Why don't you allow it?**

There are many reasons that we may have blacklisted a particular domain. Usually it's due to the content within containing a majority of content that violates our rules. For example, sites that have a **hard** paywall (which do not allow visitors to view the content without paying under any circumstance) will not be accessible by the majority of our users. User submitted content platforms that can't be distinguished from edited / staffed news articles are barred for violation of our 'No personal blog / vlog' rules. Domains affiliated with state propaganda sources are banned under our rules against 'State sponsored propaganda.' If you have concerns about a specific domain, feel free to discuss it below. If you've received an answer concerning the domain from us in the past... you can still ask us about it but chances are that our response will be the same. 

**Q: What's the deal with *Y* source? Why don't you ban it?** 

There are a few sites that users often request we ban - either because it is believed that they are too partisan or because they are affiliated with organizations that users may believe should be banned from participation. The fact is, the moderator team are *not* editors - we use the submission rules to determine if a domain is breaking our rules. If they aren't, then we don't have an objective measure by which to ban which would introduce bias on our part. The rules as they are written are designed with the goal of reducing moderator bias as much as possible. If you have a specific complaint about a domain, don't just tell us that you don't like it. Tell us what rule you think we should be enforcing that we aren't - and thoroughly consider whether that rule can be enforced by an objective standard. 

**Q: I'm noticing too many spammers / trolls / people I disagree with.**

That's not a question. But the mod team hears complaints about this frequently. 

*Young accounts* - We are always looking at ways to mitigate spammers and genuine troll accounts. We are shortly going to introduce some tools that will prevent very young accounts from submitting posts to the sub, and limit the frequency at which younger accounts will be permitted to post. This has been frequently requested. Spam, SEO manipulation and other malicious behavior is a major concern for us. 

*Anti-spam / whitelist* - With the depreciation of some of reddit's anti-spam reporting tools, we are *considering* (though no action will yet be taken) moving to a **whitelist domain submission model**. We'd love to hear the community's feedback - positive or negative - on whether this would be a good direction to take link submissions. This change could potentially also be undertaken in conjunction with other proposals for things like a domain notability requirement, and distinguishing flair for editorial content. 

*Reddiquette* - Disagreement and debate are a healthy part of the political process - we ask that you please do not report or downvote users and comments with which you disagree. Only rule breaking behavior should be reported to us, and only off topic and unsuitable content should be downvoted.

personalfinance,$130k in student loans. Where to start with refinancing?,"Edit - For clarity these loans are my SOs.

$131k in student loans. Loans were taken while in college obviously with little to no credit. Since then credit has improved due to on time car, credit card, and loan payments for 3+ years. The interest rates seem really really high. Hopefully I gave enough relevant info in the the table below.

Which of these could I possibly refinance? I've read that refinancing a government loan could lead to losing protections. I'm not sure I'd qualify for any loan forgiveness since I don't do any public service. I wouldn't want to lose any death forgiveness benefits though as I am soon to be married.

Combined income will be $130k once married. One thing we are worried about is the income based repayment skyrocketing. Would married filing separately on taxes help prevent that?

I'd like to refinance before deciding if we'd want to do snowfall or avalanche. Unless it seems obvious already which route to go. Some of these were labeled FFEL, but I can't get back in right now to see which if that matters.

Edit - I have $65k between my Roth 401k and Roth IRA. At any point is it a smart choice to cash that in and put it towards the student loans? Again for clarity these loans are my SOs. That is why I have so much money in retirement and the loan is still so high.

personalfinance,Looking to refinance my car loan. Where should I be looking for the best rates? Online services? Local credit unions?,"Towards the end of last summer I purchased a used 2015 Mazda 3. I received a loan of around $12,000 (estimated) last September with an interest rate of 6.72%. At the time, my credit score was in the 650-670 range, iirc.

Over the past year I have boosted my credit score up to 746, and was hoping to refinance my auto loan to give me more flexibility in terms of paying it down, and focusing on my student loans with higher interest rates.

Amount left on the loan is around $10,350. 51 months remaining at an interest rate of 6.72%, $233 monthly min payments.

I just ran a quick inquiry on MyAutoLoan, and the lowest offer I received was from RateGenius for a 3.24% annual rate on a 54 month term.

Previously, I was saving at a minimum $700 a month in my savings (plus all leftovers from my paycheck). $500 a month in my IRA and $200 in my 401k.  I want to pay off my loans as quickly as possible but I'm trying to determine if I should stop saving and contributing to my Roth IRA and put it all towards loans.  I'm hesitant to stop contributing to my Roth IRA because we only get $5.5k a year in tax benefits that I won't be getting back if I stop.  
  
Should I stop saving in a savings account and stop contributing to my IRA and put everything towards loans?  The thought of not saving anything in my savings account really does scare me. Is it advisable to withdraw my Roth IRA to pay off my student loans?  Also, does it make sense for me to refinance my grad plus loan which would cause me to lose the safety net benefits provided by the federal government in case something happened to my job?",finance

personalfinance,23 year old just started putting away for retirement - no clue what I'm doing,"I started a new job back in March that pays 45k a year before tax. I've been heavily saving (33% of my net salary) and paying about $365/month on low interest rate government loans (minimum payment $215). My employer offers a retirement plan through TIAA-CREF, and after one full year of employment they will contribute 10% of my salary to a retirement fund no matter what I choose to do. This month I contributed for the first time and set up a Retirement Annuity Account, Flat Dollar Election for $150 a paycheck. It automatically signed me up for the Lifecycle 2060 Fund.

personalfinance,Is my partner saving enough for retirement?,"My partner and I each make about $84,000 annually. I'm 29, she's just turned 32. I have no debt and save roughly 22 percent of my income for retirement across a Roth IRA and a 401(k), a figure that includes my 1 percent (😧) employer match. My partner has quite a bit of student debt (in the six figures) but no other debt, and recently increased her employer plan contributions up to the match cap of 6 percent. She hadn't really been saving much for retirement before this point. 

The Prime Directive suggests that she should hold off on setting aside any more for retirement until she's substantially paid off her student debt. But with the principal as big as it is, the fact that she got a late start on retirement saving, and because she's only putting away 6 percent to begin with, should she start putting some money into an IRA *anyway*? If she doesn't, should I begin to think of my retirement savings as the primary (or the only) source of income for us both in old age? If that's the case, how much more do I need to try to save in order to compensate?

One mitigating factor is that she has applied for (and will soon receive a decision from) a federal debt forgiveness program that could pay off as much as 85 percent of her outstanding balance over the next three years. But I obviously can't count on that happening, so I want to be as prepared as possible if her ability to save is more limited.

personalfinance,(CAN) High interest car financing,"Hello,

I began financing a car about 2 years ago. At this time I was still a college student and quite young, so I had slim pickings of companies that would finance me. I ended up getting financed by a company with extremely high interest rates. I still owe over $9,000 dollars with 3 years left.

Would it be a better move on my part to open a $10,000 line of credit through my bank, pay off my car loan in full, then begin paying off my line of credit? Or should I continue my bi-weekly payments, and make larger payments when I have the money.

personalfinance,When to use a co-signer?,"This may be a stupid question, so forgive me if it is. I'm going to apply for a private student loan soon, and I know often using a co-signer will give you a better chance of being approved, as well as lower interest rates. My father's credit score is worse than mine and is in a lot of debt, but he earns a lot each year (about 200k). My mother's credit score about the same as mine, but she hasn't really worked in a long time. (She just got a job last month though). My credit score is currently 731 and I'm 22 years old. I have worked steadily the last few years, but the highest I've been paid is %13/hr. Would it benefit me to have one of them co-sign, or would it harm me since my dad's credit score is worse, or do nothing since my mom's is basically the same? 

Also, should I apply to multiple different private loans to see who will offer me the lowest interest rates? Or will they all offer about the same rate? I read that if I apply to multiple loans in a short time frame my credit score will only take one hit instead of several. Is this true? 

Any advice in private student loans would be great.

personalfinance,Pay off HELOC or student loan first?,"I'm struggling with the right order to pay these debts down.

My student loans are on a graduated increase plan where every 2 years the payment goes up (scheduled competition date is 2022) the minimum payment right now is $213. 

The HELOC is variable rate and the minimum is about $140

personalfinance,Recently unemployed and want to run my own business. What should I do?,"Hey personalfinance,

I didn't know where else to post this so I thought this would be the best place:

I recently became laid off and unemployed after working for an agency for 4 years and want to transition into self employment as an independent contractor. I'm a 'creative technologist' (fancy word for graphic artist that dabbles in code) with a few years of experience as a project lead (which really means starting and completing projects ~95% of the work required on my own) and had done small jobs on the side for some extra cash while employed, but I was never offered anything substantial enough to let me leave my job.

I've done a bit of research on the subject of the life of an independent contractor while setting up for unemployment, which will thankfully support me for a little bit as I decide which path to take. I've always been a lurker on /r/personalfinance and have always thought it was a great resource. I wanted to share my insight in the hopes that I could hear from y'all!

As a prelude and nod to /r/personalfinance it would be sound of me to talk a bit about my current state of finances:

I've got student debt, but very little of it left (only about 4k I believe) and only pay ~$70 a month for it. I'm really not worried about it.
I have a little bit of credit card debt (~$8k -_-) that has a pretty safe interest rate. I'd like to switch it over to a 0% interest card but want to wait a few more months before applying to keep my credit safe.
I'd like to say I keep the debt to stay under 25% of my total allocation to continue to build credit, but the truth is that I'm not the best at saving money. I don't feel like I overspend too much (okay maybe a little bit) but I look good on paper, so at least I have that going for me.
That being said, I don't have much in terms of savings. Like, anything, really. Let's just say less than $1000.

Back to the situation in question:

According to the 'rules' of receiving unemployment (I'm in Colorado), I can work independent contracting jobs while getting unemployment without deductions per request so long as I make less than 25% of my allowance. Anything more and they start offsetting the allowance in proportion to the income. 

So far I've tried to go with the 'safe' approach with establishing any sort of business by filing a sole proprietorship with the state and separating my business and personal finances, taking out certifications, basically doing everything I needed to have *a business* in place for when I take independent contracting work (my dad's retired now, but has 40 years of experience with the IRS working in their small business department and runs his own business as a drum teacher, so I've got at least some good reference for the right steps to take, at least I'd like to think). I luckily won't have any major expenses and can run a business without having to make any drastic financial decisions (all I need is the tech I already have) so I can pretty much hit the ground running.

My current ""plan"" is to live off of unemployment as I try to build a book of business. On my good months, I won't make any unemployment, but I'll at least have something to live off of. In the meantime I've already taken on clients that could provide me with just around the same amount of income as unemployment with good, guaranteed work later in the year and into 2018 -- and feel pretty good about the little amount of momentum I have already. I'm not sure what to do if I get into contact with a potential employer - will I find an opportunity that will, at least for now, be better than being self employed? If I find any job that wants me and gives me an offer, do I *have* to accept it, or can I turn it down, keep building my business, etc (and will my girlfriend be okay with it ;P)?

That being said, I could take a *much* more drastic approach, forgetting about unemployment benefits at all and take out a small loan (50,000), change my business to something like an s-corp and invest and employ myself for a year. This seems like a *much* riskier route than where I'm at now, but I can't help but think it would be best to invest in my personal security (health insurance, 401k, etc) while I take a year to build a diverse business portfolio (other than only take on client work, to keep the dream alive and find opportunities for passive income).

Am I on the right track by using unemployment as a stepping stone, or is it wiser to take the leap and take the loan? Is there any hurdles or loopholes that I'm missing out on? Should I just stay unemployed and pinch every penny until I find a full time position? Do you guys think I'm overthinking this? Who is Heisenberg?

Side note: My buddy, who is in the same situation as me, thinks he can collect unemployment while stashing away earnings for his own business into his s-corp and pivot into that income as a means to get some capital for when he is no longer eligible, so he can get the most out of both. I don't think this is possible, as the unemployment rules clearly state what you *can* make as income and how it affects your allowance, but like I asked before, *loopholes*?

CryptoCurrency,Black Swans and Cryptocurrency,"# Introduction

I recently re-read the notes that I took on the book The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb, which can be found [here](https://github.com/christopherdurr/booknotes/blob/master/blackswan.md). When I first read The Black Swan, it completely changed my viewpoint on how systems work and function. Rereading my notes, I immediately realized that many of the principles from The Black Swan could be applied to the space of cryptocurrency today.  In this post, I will use ideas from The Black Swan to analyze cryptocurrencies as a whole and hopefully allow you, the readers, to gain some more insight into systems not only behind cryptocurrency but also in systems in general. 

Please note that in this article, when I use the word cryptocurrency I am also including blockchain technology within that definition. 

# Our Illusion of Understanding

As humans, we suffer from various mental biases that cause us to believe things that are not in fact true, especially when it comes to looking back at history. These three mental biases are:

1. The illusion of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize
2. The retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only after the fact, as if they were in a rearview mirror
3. The overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people

I believe that points one and two are the most salient for this discussion when it comes to cryptocurrency. The first point applies to when we believe we understand how the world works when in reality we do not. I find this especially prevalent when I attempt to explain to others how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work to other family-members and friends. To them, they believe digital currencies cannot have any value because it is artificial. They believe they understand how money works, when in reality they suffer from the illusion of understanding.

That's not to say that those that understand the value of cryptocurrencies don't also suffer from this mental bias.  I am sure that I too have only an illusory understanding of cryptocurrency, and that in 10/20 years cryptocurrencies will be able to accomplish things that I had never even thought of before. Take Amazon, as an example, which when it started out only sold books. Now you can buy practically anything on Amazon with the mere click of a button. It would've been difficult in the late 90's to predict that Amazon would go that route, and yet here we are. The same principle applies to cryptocurrency as well. 

The second point,  regarding retrospective distortion, is also important because that's what gives us the ""I knew it all along"" attitude. Nassim Taleb explains retrospective distortion by stating ""Much of what took place would have been deemed completely crazy with respect to the past. Yet it did not seem that crazy after the events."" I believe that this will be the case for cryptocurrency as well. In 10/20 years, the same people who dismissed or did not understand cryptocurrencies will see it as an inevitability which was bound to happen. Of course, when it comes to cryptocurrency the growth and adoption will become exponential. As Taleb states -- *""History and societies do not crawl. They jump"".* I truly believe cryptocurrency will be that next jump in our society. 

# The Turkey Fallacy

I believe that the Turkey Fallacy is the perfect example of our illusory understanding of the world. Here is the story behind the fallacy:

A turkey is selected by a family to be the turkey for Thanksgiving. In order to prepare the turkey for the feast, the family begins to give the turkey extra food months before Thanksgiving to make it extra plump. Now, in the turkey's view, he has it pretty good. He is consistently being fed more and more food. In fact, if the turkey assumes this will continue forever he'll have a pretty good life. Finally, on the day of Thanksgiving, the family takes the turkey and kills it immediately to feast on it. 

The Turkey Fallacy is essentially this: Things work until they don't. What we learn from the past turns out to be either irrelevant or completely false, and at worst looking at the past as an example of the future can be incredibly misleading. This was no doubt the case with the turkey, and this will also be the case with cryptocurrency as well. A cryptocurrency in the top 20 marketcap, for example, may have a fatal security flaw and suddenly it becomes worthless. The best way to prevent this type of event from affecting you is by diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio.   

That unexpected event is what Taleb calls a black swan, and it comes from the fact that explorers in the 14th century believed all swans were white. One day, however, they came upon a black swan and that worldview was shattered. 

Black swans can be both positive and negative, but a key point to remember is that positive black swans take time to show their effect while negative black swans can happen very rapidly. This can no doubt be seen with cryptocurrencies as well. Negative black swans, such as The DAO hack, happened very rapidly and caused the price of Ethereum to crater very quickly. Meanwhile positive black swans, such as applications that can be built on Ethereum, will generally take much longer to show their effects because it takes time for those positive events to occur.

# Confirming our Worldview

The major reason that people do not become aware of black swans is because people more often than not wish to confirm what they already believe, instead of what the truth actually is. If you look hard enough, it is easy to find sources that confirm what you believe to be true. 

Unfortunately, this is the wrong way to view things. You should look at the evidence and then reach a hypothesis, instead of the other way around. As soon as you formulate a hypothesis, you should immediately try to find evidence to the contrary of your hypothesis to test it. Ask yourself, ""what evidence would prove me wrong?"" If you find evidence that goes against the validity of your hypothesis, then readjust your hypothesis. This type of thinking allows you to formulate well-structured, thorough hypotheses on things. This is especially important when it comes to cryptocurrency, as the field tends to learn towards complex hypotheses as opposed to simple ones. The world lends itself more to shades of grey as opposed to simple black-and-white viewpoints, which usually only serve as naive simplifications of complex issues.

# Why we can't predict black swans

A key component of black swans is that they are highly asymmetrical in terms of consequences. If you look at Bitcoin, for example, you will see what I mean. The rise in value of one Bitcoin in the past 7 years was massive and, even for people who understood what Bitcoin was capable of, would be nearly impossible to predict. Other black swans, such as the DAO hack, caused an extremely negative outlook for Ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole. 

One can see why it would be useful to be able to predict a black swan -- after all, if we can see it coming then we can avoid its effects entirely. Unfortunately, predicting black swans is nearly impossible. Why? Because we have an innate bias to think we know more than we actually do. This is also known as *epistemic arrogance*, which is hubris concerning the limits of our own knowledge. 

The issue, too, is that people may acknowledge this fact but believe that experts in a field are somehow more capable of predicting these types of things than normal people. In fact, the more we view ourselves as an ""expert"" in a field the more our estimations become inaccurate in other fields: Janitors and cabdrivers were able to make more significantly accurate predictions in random facts like the height of a building than Harvard MBAs. 

Studies have shown that people who professionally make forecasts are especially prone to this type of mental bias. Public price predictions of Bitcoin that predict the price will reach [$100,000 in 10 years](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/bitcoin-price-forecast-hit-100000-in-10-years.html) or even [$1 billion](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/fox-business-speculates-bitcoin-price-reach-1-billion/) are more based on making sensational headlines and news stories than being based in reality. People who publicly state price predictions are usually incentivized to make outlandish claims because:

1. It makes for a good headline
2. It gives them the ""knew it all along"" if they turn out to be right. These people will be heralded as geniuses or market ""wizards""
3. If they're wrong, they can simply deflect questioning. Most likely, the price prediction will be forgotten quickly anyway. 

When you perform incorrect predictions, you usually deflect in three ways:

1. You tell yourself that you were playing a different game entirely. 
2. You invoke the outlier. i.e. ""that event was one in a million so there was no way to predict it!""
3. You use the ""almost right"" defense: You focus on the parts you got right, not the ones you got wrong. 

It's also important to remember that sophisticated or complex methods of predicting events does not necessarily lead to more accurate forecasts than simpler methods. 

# Tools and Toys

The most important advances we have in society are also the least predictable. Bitcoin is a clear example of this. Almost all advances in society are the direct result of a tool that was built. These tools can lead to unexpected effects and outcomes, which themselves can lead to even more unexpected outcomes. Whatever tools lead to, they rarely are used exactly for what they were first intended for. Facebook was originally exclusively for Harvard students.  Taking a more outlandish example, Play-Doh was originally created because Kroger wanted a product that could clean coal residue from wallpaper. 

""We build toys. Some of those toys change the world"". 

The best way to get maximal exposure to positive black swans is to continue researching and gathering potential opportunities. It is important, however, that we do not use the past too often as a reference for what the future will be. Too often, when we think of tomorrow we project it as just another yesterday. As the common saying goes, ""Past performance is not indicative of future results."" Even if the past were somehow an indication of what is to come, we do not truly know much about the past either. 

It's also important to distinguish between chaotic and random systems. Random systems are completely random and do not have any predictable properties. Chaotic systems, on the other hand, have predictable properties but are difficult to understand and know. Lottery numbers are random, the price of a cryptocurrency is chaotic. Being able to tell the difference between the two is key in discovering areas where you can find black swans. 

# How to maximize the effect of (positive) black swans

Now that you understand what black swans are and how difficult they are to detect, what can you do in order to increase the likelihood that you effected by a black swan? You must maximize your serendipity. Serendipity is defined as ""the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way"". To maximize your serendipity, you must find instances where there are highly asymmetrical positive payouts (e.g. Bitcoin, other altcoins, etc.) and increase your exposure to these instances as much as possible. 

When exposing yourself to these highly asymmetrical opportunities, you must do it in a number of different fields or areas in order to diversify serendipity while limiting your downside but maximizing your upside potential. Let's use another field besides cryptocurrency as an example of this: venture capital. Let's say that a venture capitalist invests $25k into 10 various startups one year after their founding, all of which could  potentially have positive black swans. Let's say that 8/10 of those companies experience negative black swans and those go bankrupt. Out of the two companies that's left, one of them happens to break even and you make your money back but that's it. Unfortunately, you're still $200k down. But what about the last company? What if that last company you invested in were Uber, or Facebook?  Suddenly that $25k could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, more than making up for your other losses. The same principle applies with investing in cryptocurrency: You probably won't be able to pick exactly the next big winner, but you could probably diversify among 10 different coins that could have positive black swans in the future. 

It is usually futile to exactly predict black swans, as usually what occurs is reading the signal as the noise and over-interpreting data. Instead, it is recommended that you instead spend your time looking for areas where there is a strong possibility a positive black swan could exist, even if you don't know exactly what it is yet. Seize anything that looks like an opportunity, because they are much, much rarer than you think. Remember that to feel the effects of positive black swans, you must be exposed to them first. 

Lastly, remember that usually there will be periods of calm and stability punctuated with massive change (for better or for worse) concentrated from a small number of black swans. Those black swans are the ones to look out for, and the ones you least expect.",cryptocurrency

Yet it did not seem that crazy after the events."" I believe that this will be the case for cryptocurrency as well. In 10/20 years, the same people who dismissed or did not understand cryptocurrencies will see it as an inevitability which was bound to happen. Of course, when it comes to cryptocurrency the growth and adoption will become exponential. As Taleb states -- *""History and societies do not crawl. They jump"".* I truly believe cryptocurrency will be that next jump in our society. 

# The Turkey Fallacy

I believe that the Turkey Fallacy is the perfect example of our illusory understanding of the world. Here is the story behind the fallacy:

A turkey is selected by a family to be the turkey for Thanksgiving. In order to prepare the turkey for the feast, the family begins to give the turkey extra food months before Thanksgiving to make it extra plump. Now, in the turkey's view, he has it pretty good. He is consistently being fed more and more food. In fact, if the turkey assumes this will continue forever he'll have a pretty good life. Finally, on the day of Thanksgiving, the family takes the turkey and kills it immediately to feast on it. 

The Turkey Fallacy is essentially this: Things work until they don't. What we learn from the past turns out to be either irrelevant or completely false, and at worst looking at the past as an example of the future can be incredibly misleading. This was no doubt the case with the turkey, and this will also be the case with cryptocurrency as well. A cryptocurrency in the top 20 marketcap, for example, may have a fatal security flaw and suddenly it becomes worthless. The best way to prevent this type of event from affecting you is by diversifying your cryptocurrency portfolio.   

That unexpected event is what Taleb calls a black swan, and it comes from the fact that explorers in the 14th century believed all swans were white. One day, however, they came upon a black swan and that worldview was shattered. 

Black swans can be both positive and negative, but a key point to remember is that positive black swans take time to show their effect while negative black swans can happen very rapidly. This can no doubt be seen with cryptocurrencies as well. Negative black swans, such as The DAO hack, happened very rapidly and caused the price of Ethereum to crater very quickly. Meanwhile positive black swans, such as applications that can be built on Ethereum, will generally take much longer to show their effects because it takes time for those positive events to occur.

# Confirming our Worldview

The major reason that people do not become aware of black swans is because people more often than not wish to confirm what they already believe, instead of what the truth actually is. If you look hard enough, it is easy to find sources that confirm what you believe to be true. 

Unfortunately, this is the wrong way to view things. You should look at the evidence and then reach a hypothesis, instead of the other way around. As soon as you formulate a hypothesis, you should immediately try to find evidence to the contrary of your hypothesis to test it. Ask yourself, ""what evidence would prove me wrong?"" If you find evidence that goes against the validity of your hypothesis, then readjust your hypothesis. This type of thinking allows you to formulate well-structured, thorough hypotheses on things. This is especially important when it comes to cryptocurrency, as the field tends to learn towards complex hypotheses as opposed to simple ones. The world lends itself more to shades of grey as opposed to simple black-and-white viewpoints, which usually only serve as naive simplifications of complex issues.

# Why we can't predict black swans

A key component of black swans is that they are highly asymmetrical in terms of consequences. If you look at Bitcoin, for example, you will see what I mean. The rise in value of one Bitcoin in the past 7 years was massive and, even for people who understood what Bitcoin was capable of, would be nearly impossible to predict. Other black swans, such as the DAO hack, caused an extremely negative outlook for Ethereum and cryptocurrency as a whole. 

One can see why it would be useful to be able to predict a black swan -- after all, if we can see it coming then we can avoid its effects entirely. Unfortunately, predicting black swans is nearly impossible. Why? Because we have an innate bias to think we know more than we actually do. This is also known as *epistemic arrogance*, which is hubris concerning the limits of our own knowledge. 

The issue, too, is that people may acknowledge this fact but believe that experts in a field are somehow more capable of predicting these types of things than normal people. In fact, the more we view ourselves as an ""expert"" in a field the more our estimations become inaccurate in other fields: Janitors and cabdrivers were able to make more significantly accurate predictions in random facts like the height of a building than Harvard MBAs. 

Studies have shown that people who professionally make forecasts are especially prone to this type of mental bias. Public price predictions of Bitcoin that predict the price will reach [$100,000 in 10 years](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/bitcoin-price-forecast-hit-100000-in-10-years.html) or even [$1 billion](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/fox-business-speculates-bitcoin-price-reach-1-billion/) are more based on making sensational headlines and news stories than being based in reality. People who publicly state price predictions are usually incentivized to make outlandish claims because:

1. It makes for a good headline
2. It gives them the ""knew it all along"" if they turn out to be right. These people will be heralded as geniuses or market ""wizards""
3. If they're wrong, they can simply deflect questioning. Most likely, the price prediction will be forgotten quickly anyway. 

When you perform incorrect predictions, you usually deflect in three ways:

1. You tell yourself that you were playing a different game entirely. 
2. You invoke the outlier. i.e. ""that event was one in a million so there was no way to predict it!""
3. You use the ""almost right"" defense: You focus on the parts you got right, not the ones you got wrong. 

It's also important to remember that sophisticated or complex methods of predicting events does not necessarily lead to more accurate forecasts than simpler methods. 

# Tools and Toys

The most important advances we have in society are also the least predictable. Bitcoin is a clear example of this. Almost all advances in society are the direct result of a tool that was built. These tools can lead to unexpected effects and outcomes, which themselves can lead to even more unexpected outcomes. Whatever tools lead to, they rarely are used exactly for what they were first intended for. Facebook was originally exclusively for Harvard students.  Taking a more outlandish example, Play-Doh was originally created because Kroger wanted a product that could clean coal residue from wallpaper. 

""We build toys. Some of those toys change the world"". 

The best way to get maximal exposure to positive black swans is to continue researching and gathering potential opportunities. It is important, however, that we do not use the past too often as a reference for what the future will be. Too often, when we think of tomorrow we project it as just another yesterday. As the common saying goes, ""Past performance is not indicative of future results."" Even if the past were somehow an indication of what is to come, we do not truly know much about the past either. 

It's also important to distinguish between chaotic and random systems. Random systems are completely random and do not have any predictable properties. Chaotic systems, on the other hand, have predictable properties but are difficult to understand and know. Lottery numbers are random, the price of a cryptocurrency is chaotic. Being able to tell the difference between the two is key in discovering areas where you can find black swans. 

# How to maximize the effect of (positive) black swans

Now that you understand what black swans are and how difficult they are to detect, what can you do in order to increase the likelihood that you effected by a black swan? You must maximize your serendipity. Serendipity is defined as ""the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way"". To maximize your serendipity, you must find instances where there are highly asymmetrical positive payouts (e.g. Bitcoin, other altcoins, etc.) and increase your exposure to these instances as much as possible. 

When exposing yourself to these highly asymmetrical opportunities, you must do it in a number of different fields or areas in order to diversify serendipity while limiting your downside but maximizing your upside potential. Let's use another field besides cryptocurrency as an example of this: venture capital. Let's say that a venture capitalist invests $25k into 10 various startups one year after their founding, all of which could  potentially have positive black swans. Let's say that 8/10 of those companies experience negative black swans and those go bankrupt. Out of the two companies that's left, one of them happens to break even and you make your money back but that's it. Unfortunately, you're still $200k down. But what about the last company? What if that last company you invested in were Uber, or Facebook?  Suddenly that $25k could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, more than making up for your other losses. The same principle applies with investing in cryptocurrency: You probably won't be able to pick exactly the next big winner, but you could probably diversify among 10 different coins that could have positive black swans in the future. 

It is usually futile to exactly predict black swans, as usually what occurs is reading the signal as the noise and over-interpreting data. Instead, it is recommended that you instead spend your time looking for areas where there is a strong possibility a positive black swan could exist, even if you don't know exactly what it is yet. Seize anything that looks like an opportunity, because they are much, much rarer than you think. Remember that to feel the effects of positive black swans, you must be exposed to them first. 

Lastly, remember that usually there will be periods of calm and stability punctuated with massive change (for better or for worse) concentrated from a small number of black swans. Those black swans are the ones to look out for, and the ones you least expect.",cryptocurrency
btc,"Black Swans, Bitcoin, and Cryptocurrency","# Introduction

I recently re-read the notes that I took on the book The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb, which can be found [here](https://github.com/christopherdurr/booknotes/blob/master/blackswan.md). When I first read The Black Swan, it completely changed my viewpoint on how systems work and function. Rereading my notes, I immediately realized that many of the principles from The Black Swan could be applied to the space of cryptocurrency today.  In this post, I will use ideas from The Black Swan to analyze cryptocurrencies as a whole and hopefully allow you, the readers, to gain some more insight into systems not only behind cryptocurrency but also in systems in general. 

Please note that in this article, when I use the word cryptocurrency I am also including blockchain technology within that definition. 

# Our Illusion of Understanding

As humans, we suffer from various mental biases that cause us to believe things that are not in fact true, especially when it comes to looking back at history. These three mental biases are:

1. The illusion of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize
2. The retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only after the fact, as if they were in a rearview mirror
3. The overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people

I believe that points one and two are the most salient for this discussion when it comes to cryptocurrency. The first point applies to when we believe we understand how the world works when in reality we do not. I find this especially prevalent when I attempt to explain to others how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies work to other family-members and friends. To them, they believe digital currencies cannot have any value because it is artificial. They believe they understand how money works, when in reality they suffer from the illusion of understanding.

That's not to say that those that understand the value of cryptocurrencies don't also suffer from this mental bias.  I am sure that I too have only an illusory understanding of cryptocurrency, and that in 10/20 years cryptocurrencies will be able to accomplish things that I had never even thought of before. Take Amazon, as an example, which when it started out only sold books. Now you can buy practically anything on Amazon with the mere click of a button. It would've been difficult in the late 90's to predict that Amazon would go that route, and yet here we are. The same principle applies to cryptocurrency as well. 

The second point,  regarding retrospective distortion, is also important because that's what gives us the ""I knew it all along"" attitude. Nassim Taleb explains retrospective distortion by stating ""Much of what took place would have been deemed completely crazy with respect to the past. Yet it did not seem that crazy after the events."" I believe that this will be the case for cryptocurrency as well. In 10/20 years, the same people who dismissed or did not understand cryptocurrencies will see it as an inevitability which was bound to happen. Of course, when it comes to cryptocurrency the growth and adoption will become exponential. As Taleb states -- *""History and societies do not crawl.

I am skeptical about this so call ""help"" but I need to know if this could be a way to settle my debt. 

They are saying for example if I have debt of $44,000 (thankfully I don't though) they will give me interest rate of 5.49% and my monthly payment to them would be $627. Now comparing to credit card company I checked by their interest rate I will actually save some money. But again I am skeptical about this could be a scam or not. 

Next question I have is how do this company work? Will they contact my credit card companies and make a third party deal with them and pay off the debt at once and I pay this company. Or they will hand me the money to make minimum payments and in future I will pay them back? 

And lastly if I do end up using them to settle my debt, will I be any chance be in legal trouble or any kind.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on how to approach credit card debt...,"So, due to a variety of factors - including a lack of financial discipline - I have roughly 20k of debt (out of 40k worth of possible credit) scattered over 5 credit cards (technically 4 now, but I will get into that).


I had an epiphany and now know I need to remedy the situation.  Here are some of the details:


My credit score is 624.


My debt is laid out as follows:

Capital One Venture Card: 5k (out of a possible 15k)

Chase Sapphire Preferred:10k (out of a possible 15k)

Chase Slate: 1.7k (Maxed, but has zero interest)

Discover It: 3k (Maxed, but has zero interest)  

Dell Card: 0 (out of a possible 6k - I got it to buy a laptop and have now paid it off completely) 


So the Discover card and the Slate card are maxed but have no interest, which is good. I would like to increase those limits so I can move more debt over to those through balance transfers so to mitigate interest payments, but they don't want to increase the limits. Anyway this leads to my first question:


Is there a way I can take out a loan or something that has a lower interest rate than the two big cards (Sapphire and Venture), pay them off, and then just pay back the loan?


And my second question:


Now that I have paid off my Dell card, is there any reason to keep it, or should I just cancel it? I know that losing 6k worth of credit might affect my score, but I am not sure how drastically. 


Any help would be greatly appreciated thanks.",finance

Basic stuff if you don't want to read all the prior posts:

Male, 51, married (F51), no kids, live in low cost of living area.

Own 3 houses: primary residence, 1 MIL lives in, and condo near my parents/family. Total value &lt;$600K, about $250K in mortgages.

Financial assets at retirement: $4.3 million

Current financial assets: $4.8 million

Annual budget: $150K

2017 healthcare costs: $11,400 insurance through exchange, $9500 deductible included in budget

Feel free to ask any financial questions you're interested in. I've just included the information I most often get asked for.

On to the more interesting stuff:

Vacations: We didn't really travel in 2016, but in 2017 we drove to Arizona to visit my aunt and uncle in late January/early February with some stops along the way. In late February/early March we took a cruise from Rome to Barcelona with my sister and brother-in-law. At the end of March we drove to California and visited my wife's cousin and spent a week wine tasting. That was too much. By the time we returned from CA, I was tired of traveling and just wanted to hang around home. We won't schedule travel so close together anymore.

In August we are visiting friends in Massachusetts and probably spending a couple of days wine tasting in the Finger Lakes. I feel like I'm ready to travel again, so I'm actually looking forward to it.

Spending: Early on I was having trouble feeling comfortable with spending money after retirement. While working, spending money was easy because I could always rationalize that any excess spending could be made up by working a few extra days. After retirement, I felt like I was spending down a non-renewable resource, and that bothered me. It took a few months to get over that feeling. Of course it was easier to get over the feeling when the market was up strong. I fear I may have a relapse in a down market, but we haven't seen that yet.

How do we spend our time? Well, it seems to be easy for us to fill our days. Of course when we're traveling, there is a lot to do, but when we're home it still has proven pretty easy to fill the time and avoid boredom.

Each morning we walk 4-6 miles depending on weather and schedule for the day. I lift weights sporadically although I really should get more disciplined about it. We have taken an interest in baking and cooking which uses up from 0 to 6 hours a day depending on what we decide to take on. We spend probably 3-4 hours per day gaming and another hour or two watching videos of one kind or another.

When we are at our condo near my family, we spend at least 2 evenings per week playing cards or whatever with family. When at our primary residence, we have dinner with my MIL every night.

We both still volunteer some, but it has proven more difficult to find meaningful things to volunteer for when we are gone so much with a not very predictable schedule. This kind of bothers me and will doubtless continue to be something I need to work on.

I'm taking over running my parents' finances. They are 78/79 and it's just getting harder for them to understand and keep track of it all. Fortunately they have always been frugal and have had some good luck in their financial lives despite never being high income, so they have enough income to meet their needs and enough assets (most likely) if they need some kind of ongoing care.

Upcoming things:

My wife wants to do some significant work on our condo, replacing virtually all of the flooring, countertops in the kitchen, and painting  the kitchen. She is handling the planning, but I think it's going to be a $20K project. I told her she better have it done now while the market is up and I'm not too worried about money.

My parents are aging. My mother has the beginnings of some kind of dementia although she refuses to get diagnosed. My father got diagnosed with Parkinsons a little over a year ago. So far he is doing OK, but it's a degenerative thing and not fun to have in the future. I suspect dealing with my parents issues is going to take a larger and larger part of my attention.

I've mentioned that I'm interested in writing in past posts, but I've had a hard time getting started. At six months a few people suggested just writing 500 or 1,000 words per day to get some discipline. That didn't work out so well for me since right after those helpful suggestions we started our rather busy travel schedule.

Lately I've been doing better. I'm about 25,000 words in to my book. Unfortunately I delete a good 75% of what I write. Also, I still find it hard to write every day. Another thing I have to work on.

I had an interesting experience a few days ago. I woke up in the middle of the night and for some reason I was thinking about work. Not stressing or anything, just thinking about the people. I could not come up with my old boss's name, nor could I come up with the name of the guy that replaced me, even though I trained him for like 4 weeks before I left. I have since recalled both their names, but it was interesting to me. I worked at my job for 25ish years, worked for my last boss for 2 years. Now weeks go by where I don't even think about my old job or about working.

Along the same lines, for the first six months or so, my wife and I would sit around grinning at each other like fools because we didn't have to go to work. Now most days I don't even think about not going to work. It's just a part of my life.

One other thing I should mention are income taxes in 2016. We retired right about half way through the year and got 2 weeks of vacation pay beyond that. Our bonuses were paid in March, so our incomes for the year were roughly 3/4 of our 2015 income. Anyway, we didn't change our withholding, and withholding is calculated assuming that you have constant income throughout the year (other than bonuses which are withheld at a higher rate). Well, since we only had 2/3 - 3/4 of the annual income the withholding was based on, we got a $17K tax refund. I had known we would get a big refund, but the size of it really surprised me since I hadn't really thought that hard about it. Also, when calculating our estimated taxes for 2017, I was surprised at how low our tax liability is going to be.

I'm estimating our 2017 AGI at around $100K. After taking deductions and stuff in to account, I estimated our Federal tax liability at around $4k (state is going to be about the same as federal). I was pleasantly surprised how little we are going to be paying in taxes.

Summary: I love not working. I often feel as though I should be doing better or more with my life, but the idea of taking anything like a regular job is repugnant to me. The money part of my life is going great, but that happens when the market is up.",finance

Is this the right subreddit to post this? - If not I am sorry, I will remove it and post elsewhere recommended. 

Are there programs that help with these sort of things? I feel bad I have to use some of these, but at the same time I need them and hate asking if there's other ones I should be apart of. I just don't know.

I gotta wait to pay off my phone bill, should I apply for one of those free phones until I start work, would it even matter in your opinions?

If I had to buy food, which is most likely.. is Aldi's a place to shop for budgeters?  I honestly see myself needing to here in a while.

If yes, would rice and a simple protein be a good route to go? 

What would you do if you were in my shoes? 


Note: I really hope this gets a few answers because my left eye keeps twitching and this is all I'm thinking about! Also, thank you in advance if anything.

personalfinance,What's the best strategy to tackle wife's student loans?,"Hi all, longtime lurker, first time poster.  I (33m) recently married my wife (29F) after 5 years together (yay me).  I am a corporate lawyer and my wife is a doctor (finished residency but now in fellowship (basically second residency for those that don't know)).  I managed to pay off my student loans years ago, but my wife has $207k in loans outstanding at a 7% interest rate.  Residents/fellows also are not very well paid and we live in NYC, thus, she has been on an income based repayment plan for years, but her payments don't even cover the interest.  Now that we are married I'm committed to helping her to pay these off because by the time she finishes fellowship the numbers will be even crazier.  I am a very high earner, but I am not sure what the best path is to pay this off quickly.  After paying rent/bills/expenses, etc at the end of every month I typically have about $10k left over.  My standard practice through the years has been to just dump it all into passive mutual funds and let it ride.  As such, I have about $700k in investments (about $500k of which is liquid).   I'm considering three alternate paths for paying down this debt, but I'm not sure which is the best one forward:

- Option 1 - take my $10k in excess every month and just dump it all into her loans
- Option 2 - take my $10k in excess every month and put $5k into her loans and $5k into my usual investments
- Option 3 - sell a portion of my current investments and just kill the whole loan right now

I can see different benefits/downsides to all 3 strategies, but was hoping the PF community might be able to point out some considerations I had not previously thought of.  Thanks!

TL;DR Wife has $207k in loans at a high interest rate.  I have the means to help her pay it off quickly, but am unsure of the best strategy.",finance

The San Francisco-based bank, which is recovering from the fallout of its sham accounts scandal last year, reported a 5% growth in earnings for Q2 2017, while the revenue remained flat at $22.2 bln.
NII grew 6%, helped partly by the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike for the second time this year in June.
The bank's provision for credit losses fell 48% from a year ago primarily due to improvement in the oil and gas portfolio.

Bitcoin,Suspicious: Yellen loves bitcoin?,"Love bitcoin. But I do find it odd that Janet Yellen seems fairly pro-bitcoin and fairly anti-regulation, seeing as she's the face of the vampire squid. I can't puzzle out why, either, as she seems to have a good understanding of the broad implications: 

Back in 2014, Yellen said this: 

In a letter this week to Yellen and other top U.S. regulators, Manchin said Bitcoin ""has allowed users to participate in illicit activity, while also being highly unstable and disruptive to our economy.""

Yellen told Manchin that Congress could get involved ""and set up a supervisory regime"" to oversee the currency. She added, ""I think it's not so easy to regulate Bitcoin because there's no central issuer or network operator to regulate.""
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told senators Thursday that the central bank can't regulate troubled digital currency Bitcoin because it operates outside the banking system.

""I think it's important to understand that this is a payment innovation that's taking place entirely outside the banking industry,"" Yellen told Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. ""The Federal Reserve simply does not have the authority to supervise or regulate Bitcoin in any way.""

And, in another talk, she said this about blockchain: 
""[Blockchain] is a very important, new technology that could have implications for the way in which transactions are handled throughout the financial system. We're looking at it in terms of its promise in some of the technologies we use ourselves and many financial institutions are looking at it. It could make a big difference to the way in which transactions are cleared and settled in the global economy.""",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Debating domestic partnership to avoid healthcare costs, but confused by tax/filing needs. Advice?","Not sure if this is best suited for /r/personalfinance or /r/relationshipadvice but thought I might start here for a more fiscally-minded answer. 

My partner and I have been together for 1.5 years, and recently moved in together in June. We are both in our early 30's, live in NYC, are both financially sound with solid careers. We're very serious about one another and plan on getting married, though neither of us is in any particular rush while we enjoy this new phase in our relationship and focus on our careers and just living our lives. 

The issue is around health insurance. I work at an extremely progressive company with an amazing healthcare plan that would also extend to family dependents if I were claiming any. My partner's employer is decidedly less woke, and his personal contribution for his healthcare is several hundred dollars a month, and scheduled to go up even more. 

We are starting to plan our lives long term, and the thought of paying $500+ a month for his insurance when he could join mine for free feels absurd. But the thought of rushing into marriage because it saves us money also doesn't sit well with me, as I'd rather let our relationship naturally progress on its own. 

I've looked into domestic partnerships, but I've been seriously confused by the details on how this might change our tax filings at state vs federal levels, etc. Anyone have any insight? Or general advice for this situation?

personalfinance,Time to Face the Music - 88k in debt,"I have been using YNAB for the last 6 months and have begun to make some progress on budgeting better. Over the 4th of July my fiancee asked me to help out her sister with a plan to reduce debt. She wanted to take out a 401k loan and I got her all signed up for YNAB and ran the numbers on a debt snowball vs. avalanche vs. 401k loan. We found out that with very little pain she can get rid of about 11k in debt in 2 years using the snowball vs. paying a 401k loan over 3-5 years. This inspired me to face the truth of my debt. Here is a listing of my debts:

Credit Card Debt (6 cards): $3,656.20 
Personal Loan: $8,266.97
Car Loan: $20,803.68
Student Loans: $55,677.25
Grand Total: $88,404.10!

I have been ignoring this total for a long time. Paying down my cards when I can, paying minimums on car loans, personal loans, and student loans. I would get all motivated and budget unreasonable amounts, only to fail a few months later.

Using YNAB to know what my true expenses are has helped me create a realistic budget to pay this beast off. My budget includes some fun money and things like tv, going out to eat, etc. My hope is that as I begin to knock these debts out one by one I will be more determined to make more cuts to finish quicker. Under the debt snowball here is what my schedule looks like:

* Credit Card 1: $236.69 balance paid off in 1 month
* Credit Card 2: $346.44 balance paid off in 2 months
* Credit Card 3: $366.70 balance paid off in 3 months
* Credit Card 4: $397.17 balance paid off in 4 months
* Credit Card 5: $499.61 balance paid off in 5 months
* Student Loan 1: $1,549.53 balance paid off in 7 months
* Final Credit Card: $1,809.59 balance paid off in 10 months
* Personal Loan: $8,266.97 balance paid off in 21 months
* Car Loan: $20,803.68 balance paid off in 31 months
* Federal Student Loan: $54,127.72 balance paid off in 65 months

I ran the numbers snowball vs. avalanche and found out the avalanche would only save $486 over $88,000 of debt. Also I wouldn't pay off my second debt for 15 months! My hope is that this will be a realistic plan and I will finally get out of debt for good. While $88,000 is an insane, sickening number. The fact that I could be out of debt (minus the house) in 5 1/2 years (not including any future raises, etc.) is pretty amazing. For reference my fiancee and I make around a total of 70k a year, and I am sure I could pay these things off sooner with more cuts to our budget, but 5 years is where I am comfortable enough at this time.",finance

I've been working on budgeting but it just seems to be at a stalemate. Basically I've had around $9k worth of debt over the year that I first put it on. Made bad choices. These are my expenses for the month vs income.

Car ~$550
Car insurance ~$200 

Right off the bat, it's ridiculous how much I'm paying for my car out of a $37k loan with 75 months on it with an interest rate of 3.25%

Then my debt.. 

I have a total of 11 accounts or so varying in balances. I have completely left my cards at home aside from my debit and 1 credit card for emergencies if my bank account balance won't cover it. 

I have a total of $1.3k in the bank, and another $400 in investment accounts. $5k in an IRA and $6k in a safety deposit that is going towards a downpayment for a home. 

My income ranges from $1100 - $1600 per paycheck depending on how much I work. My 2 week schedule can be 80 hours - 120 hours depending on what's going on. 

Is it a good idea to balance transfer or just get a loan? I will need to move out within a year as well. So I'm trying to save on top of all of this.

On the surface it appears that the higher interest debt would be the wiser choice (student loan). However, graduates in my field occasionally get jobs with tuition reimbursement upon graduation.

My brother is actually the one with the problem here. He's in a bad financial place due to this and I want to see if anyone can give us advice about how to best handle this situation. 

To start off, our uncle consigned for my brother's school loans at U of Wisconsin Riverfalls a few years back. Neither of my parents would have been able to qualify. Brother completed three years of college and was one year away from completing his bachelor's when my uncle lost his job and decided to pull his support (which I wasn't aware you could do before this point). My brother had one federal loan and a Stafford loan that he is now paying the minimum payments on (as far as I'm aware). At this point, the university demanded that all room &amp; board costs be paid in full before they would release his transcripts and allow him to finish his degree. The bill was for about $8,000 originally. He is not allowed to enroll in classes despite being on the Dean's list and having good standing at this college. 

He dropped out due to this, and has been working ever since in an attempt to pay this off so he can finish his degree. Unfortunately he's barely able to keep up with his student loans and his life expenses since he is also working to support our disabled mother. I help as much as I can while not living at home, but there's no way he can pay this off and keep the roof over his head at the same time in order to go back to college in a timely manner. I want to help him succeed but I don't know the best way to handle it. 

Some options I've thought of:

1. Possibly get another loan (private?) to pay off the room/board debt and finish school.  

2. His partner/fiancee has fairly good credit and may be willing to cosign for a loan. I know this could be risky but I'm pretty confident she wouldn't back out the way our uncle did. 

I don't know if either is possible, so let me know what options are available. Thank you for your help.

personalfinance,Trying to lower monthly expenses. Recently acquired small chunk of money. Pay enough of mortgage to drop PMI?,"We have a good emergency fund established. A 12 month CD ladder. Each CD matures at the beginning of each month and has $2,000 each in it. Plus a savings account with about $4,000 for an ""I need it right now"" situation. I learned my lesson after losing my job in 2009 and having to do a short sale on my home. Right now, I also contribute 4% to my work 403B to get their matching 3%. My wife contributes 8% to get her matching 4%. I max out my Roth IRA with auto-payments on the same days as my paychecks.

So right now my wife and I combined make a decent amount of money. About $75k after taxes. We just had our first child and my wife wants to quit her job. We can technically afford to do that, but we would have to eliminate practically all savings. My income will cover mortgage, all bills, utilities, food, gas, etc and leave a few hundred dollars each month for various things I'm sure will come up.

So we're trying to figure out ways to make it work so we can still contribute into the IRA. We've owned our home for a little over a year. We owned a property that was gifted by my wife's grandparents (split 4 ways between family members) that recently sold and our 25% netted us about $52,000. We've set aside $20,000 for a few big purchases we know will come up in the next 5 years (New car and residing the house mostly). 

Because we only paid 5% down towards our house we had to get PMI. Right now, $158 each month of my house payment goes towards PMI. I consider this wasted money. Doesn't go towards interest or principle and is not useful to me at all. We can drop the PMI if we get the loan balance down to less than 80% of the value of the home, which I calculate to be roughly a $31,000 payment. I am considering doing this since most of it would go to principle and would reduce the term of the loan by 9 years (2046 to 2037). I might not get an immediate benefit, but this would be a long term investment. I have no other debts that need to be paid off.  Oh, and the interest rate on my mortgage is 4.25%.

I've read about the importance of starting early when it comes to investing, but am uncertain where to start exactly and if it is the right thing for me to do at this point in time.

technology,Californian Congress woman Mimi Walters cares about those poor ISPs,"This is the form letter she sent me, it sounds good at first...

Thank you for contacting me with your thoughts on net neutrality. Hearing from my constituents is important to me and I appreciate the time you took to share your views.
 
I fully support a free and open Internet that treats all online content equally and protects consumer privacy, principles commonly called “net neutrality.”
 
I strongly support the following principles:
• Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should not be able to throttle traffic based on the source, destination, or content.
• ISPs should not block access to lawful Internet content, applications, or services.
• ISPs should not prioritize certain Internet traffic over others.
• ISPs must also be transparent with consumers and disclose their network management practices.
 
It is important to note that these principles are not the same thing as Title II classification.
 
As you may know, in February 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 3-2, along party lines, to implement a new net neutrality rule. The rule designates ISPs, including wireless data providers, as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. This reclassification means that ISPs are now subject to a set of overly restrictive regulations originally developed in the 1930s. While I support net neutrality, I have concerns that the FCC’s 2015 common carrier designation rule stifles innovation, which ultimately harms the consumer.
 
The FCC recently began the process of reviewing its decision to reclassify ISPs. It is important to note that should the FCC reverse its 2015 decision, nothing would prevent the implementation of alternative approaches to ensure a free and open Internet. I believe legislation in this area is necessary to enshrine net neutrality principles in law. Should Congress consider any bills related to net neutrality, please be assured that I will keep your specific thoughts in mind.
 
Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. I appreciate having the opportunity to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives. Please feel free to visit my website (www.walters.house.gov) to sign up for my newsletter or contact me with any other concerns you may have.

personalfinance,"Pay private student loans, or have a bigger down payment on a house?","Hello all,

My wife and I recently got back from teaching English overseas for a few years and are getting ready to settle in back in the United States. My wife saved around $8K and I have around $27k. She paid down most of her debts, but I have been making minimum payments so that I could decide how to use the money when I got home. We are both now working, making around $25k a year each (keep in mind that we live in upstate NY, which is economically depressed and a decent home can be had for 50k-60k). We'd like to buy a house, but are torn about how to do it. Should I pay off my private student loans (about $27k in debt @ at around 4%-5% interest) or use that money instead toward a down payment on a house in order to have a smaller mortgage and more equity in the home? I'm leaning toward paying my private debt off, since doing that would free up the $250 per month I currently pay toward it. Is there any substantial benefit in not going down that path? Also, we have a significant amount of federal student loan debt between the two of us (around 100K) but we are both on IBR and both have good to excellent credit scores. We both work at nonprofit orgs and are operating under the assumption that we can have our federal debt forgiven under the public service forgiveness program in 10 years (with the understanding that it may be taxable income when its forgiven).

personalfinance,Newlyweds with new life plans. How can we get from here to there?,"I (24F) recently married 25M and am trying to give our finances some direction. All advice welcome. I used to think I was financially savvy but somehow starting our new life together has me second guessing my plans like crazy. 

Dream situation/goals: 

* **Education.** I am 90% certain I will attend graduate school program starting fall of 2018 or 2019. The most expensive program I looked at is $65,000, and it would increase my earning potential significantly. I'm expecting to move from $40k to $75k with potential to eventually  max out at $100k.   

* **Even more education.** My husband is also about 50% set on doing a pricey law program for around $180k when he exits the military in 2020. He won't be eligible for the GI Bill so I know we will need loans. But due to his military commitment he has gone his whole adult life without ever doing anything for himself. So I don't terribly mind going in the hole for that one or being the breadwinner while he explores his options. Maybe that's silly? 

* **Other.** Babies maybe 2020-2023. Eh. 


Current income/liquid assets: 

* **Income.** Our household is currently sitting at $88k but will move up to ~$128k in 2018. As I mentioned my husband is military and makes the equivalent of $77k. I am currently doing an AmeriCorps program for $11k, but expect to move up to ~$40k at our next duty station which has more career options for me. So we will have an extra $30k if we don't adjust our quality of life too much. 

* **Emergency fund.** We have $20k sitting in checking and savings. I would like to maintain our emergency fund at $12k so I want to put other $8k somewhere. 

Other considerations: 

* **Debts!** We have a $36k USAA loan that's currently down to $15k and on track to be paid off in August 2019. Interest rate is 0.75% so we have not been in a hurry. Should we be?  

* **Retirement.** Currently we have 21k total between my Roth IRA and his Roth TSP. I have bad retirement options and also worked overseas for a stretch in 2015-2016 so I am all maxed out on everything. For his (new-ish) TSP we are contributing about $10k in 2017, expected $13k in 2018 and expected $13k in 2019. The cap is $18k per year so we have not hit the ceiling on that. He does not have a Roth IRA outside of that. Should we open one? I know you can withdraw without penalty for school. 

* **Aversion to real estate.** We were considering purchasing a house or condo using good VA loan rates but it would have to be turned over to a property management company after we move in 23 months. We hate the area and would likely never return. So that all seems like a headache and I tabled it. But I could be persuaded to research it more.

TL;DR: 
We live comfortably in our mid 20s but at least one of us will be starting graduate school within the next 3 years. Do we keep our cash on hand, open a second Roth IRA, open a 529 savings plan, otherwise invest, or maybe not even worry about it while we pay off a loan with a very low interest rate?",finance
personalfinance,Aggressive Debt Pay-Down BEFORE Emergency Fund?,"Picked up an old (1998) book called Debt-Free &amp; Prosperous Living. Very similar advice to leveraging money freed up by paying off debts in order to get out of debt fast...FAST is his keyword.

Basically, he runs the math to show how paying minimum payments on debt while trying to save an emergency fund can end up delaying the time you become debt free and have an emergency fund, because of the way compound interest fights against you. His premise is that ""investing"" your dollars in a savings account gives you a very low ROI, whereas ""investing"" in debt Pay-Down gives you a much higher ROI as you're fighting back against interest rates that are higher than what a savings account yields. 

Obviously, the prime directive is the safest approach, but I was wondering if someone was interested in corroborating or clarifying how this math works out with today's rates, etc?",finance

personalfinance,Looking to refinance my vehicle loan and I'd like some advice on doing so without negatively impacting already poor credit.,"As the title states, my credit is currently fairly poor (although improving). I purchased a new vehicle about a year and a half ago, and my interest rate is quite high. I'd like to refinance my vehicle via my credit union, however my credit is fairly bad (almost exclusively due to student loans). I'm concerned that if I get denied, this will negatively impact the work I've done to improve my credit over the last year or so. I've included what I hope is all relevant information.


Total original loan - 6 year @ $13,669.38 ($500 down)

Current remaining balance - $11,589.72 

Current interest rate - ~12.37% 

Credit unions advertised interest rate - 2.5%-3%

Current credit scores - 686/691 (Credit Karma), 640 (Credit Union provided score)

Last years credit score - 604 (Credit Union, CK doesn't show me this far back)

Missed/late payments - 0


Is there any way for me to know how likely I am to get approved for this? Are there any other factors I'm not considering? I've attempted to use the credit calculator on CK but it always throws an error.

As a final note, if I were to get this approved and my credit score took a small ding, I would be 100% OK with that. My biggest concern is getting denied, and having my credit score impacted.

personalfinance,Refinancing an auto loan,"Okay, so I'm sure that this is a common inquiry but I also think that the dollar amounts and interest percentages are case by case.

Currently I owe 26,425 to Bank A. My interest rate is 5.01%, and it is my first large car loan. My payment is $450/mo. 


I am looking to refinance because the interest rate is higher than I would like. I am fine with the payment itself, but if it could be lower- why not? I aim to overpay each month anyhow. 

I recently threw my name into the lendingtree hat and have had a few offers. 

So far I've got Bank B, where I would drop from 68 payments to 66, and pay $440.

Then there is Bank C, who wants 68 payments at $440,  but will include Gap as well ( which I currently don't have) 

Bank D will be 3.24%, drop to 63 payments, and the payment will be $460/mo without Gap or 469 with. 

I do not have the exact interest percentages for bank B and C at this moment, but both said they were somewhere in the 3.25% range, I believe. 

Bank D sounds the best to me, as i am  dropping 4 payments, even if it's a few dollars more per month, but my knowledge in this subject is not the best. Is there a catch? Something I'm missing? What questions should I ask to make this decision? Also I understand that after a year of payments I may be open to better interest rates- that will be in approximately 3 months.

Banking,[US] [Question] Wire To Dealership Failed Because Wrong Info Given,"Hi,

I recently purchased a used car (in cash) and agreed to pay by wiring the money to the dealership. I'm new to the area, so I used a federal credit union account back in my old state to wire the money. They only accept outgoing wire requests on paper forms, so I had a relative submit it on my behalf (the relative is an authorized user on the account).

The wire info provided by the dealership included the Financial Institution (FI) name, FI address, routing number, and account number. The paper form also required a 'Credit to' section. I called up the dealership when my relative asked what they should put there and the Finance Manager (FM) told me 'I think it's XYZ'.
I double checked with the FM before having my relative submit the form ... and then the wire failed because ""Name mismatched, Unable to Apply Wire"". 

My credit union charged me $45 because the wire failed ... should I be responsible for this fee or is there any recourse I can take with the dealership since it seems they gave me the wrong info? I plan to try to ACH the money out of my CU into an ALLY bank account and wire it from there because it doesn't require the 'Credit to' field and it'll be a lot cheaper if it fails there...

personalfinance,I'm on the recommended flow chart path but could use some further help.,"Hello all,
I'm going to try and start from the ground up on how I got here which might explain why I am asking for some help. I'll also put a space in between this section and the part I actually ask for help if you just feel like skipping to that. I graduated college in Spring 2016 and got a job offer with one of my preferred companies that same day (it was great timing). It's been a year now and I love it but I'm trying to look over my finances a bit more to see what exactly I should be doing for the best ""bang for my buck"". I have my own apartment and it is a little bit more than the 30% of your income rule (it's 32% I believe to be specific) however I am within walking distance of my office so I will only drive the 3/4 of a mile if necessary due to inclement weather or I sleep in WAYYY too much. Out of the gross income from my employer, I selected options for life insurance, medical, dental, and short term/long term disability. I am also contributing 10% of my paycheck into their 401k which they are matching 50% of the first 6%. I also am putting $50 of each paycheck into an account for their stock purchase plan and then at the end of the quarter it purchases the stock with a 10% discount of the current price. After all expenses from my net income (rent &amp; utilities, internet, phone, food, gas), I have around $500 remaining each month. Which I have been putting into my savings account. Out of this savings account, each month I pay $80 towards my student loans that are left. I used some of the money that I saved up from working while in school to pay these down a lot and also consolidated them as well for a great rate with the same company (these are all federal loans and I have no private loans). Currently, I owe a little less than $5,000 in loans and the APR is at 3.5%. If you haven't seen the flowchart before (https://i.imgur.com/CcEVQAV.png) I've been pretty steady but now I'll ask for the advice...

My accountant recommended this year after seeing my income increase, that I open a Roth IRA for retirement. Should I keep my 401k amount to 10% of my paycheck and then say put $300 of the $500 going into my savings for the Roth IRA (would be $3,600/year). Or, should I move my 401k contribution to only 6% so I will still get the full benefit of my employer's match but then be more suited to max the Roth IRA contribution at $5,500/year). 

The other part that I am also questioning is getting a newer car and when. Note that when I saw newer that is because I would either be buying used or a CPO, lets say 2012 or newer. I'm not trying to be one of the people who graduate and buy a new Mercedes but I think there might be a long term financial benefit to me buying a newer car. My current car is a 2004 SUV and gets about 16mpg city and 21 mpg highway if I'm lucky. Since I'm so close to my work and all shopping centers, parks, etc.. all of my driving is local/city miles. The other thing worth mentioning is that almost every time I take my car in for service now it has been needing something. A standard lube/oil/filter will become a $600 repair because I need rear brakes and there's also a sensor that needs to be replaced. Since I'm not putting that many miles on the car I don't have to do these repairs every other month, but the two or maybe three times a year does seem to add up quickly. I also have Full tort + collision on the car since it is still worth about $3k but that insurance is $900 every six months (I'm also on my own policy and I had one ticket 4-5 years ago). I was reading on the young adult wiki (sorry but I don't know how to link sub reddits yet) that with a newer car at around $15k, with a $10k loan, it is approximately $220/month for four years. Side note, my credit score is in the mid-upper 700's. With newer cars getting 20 - 30 mpg in city driving, I think it might be beneficial for me to consider buying one. I know the money that I would be saving in gas and possibly in insurance wouldn't be greater than the car payment itself but I'm not sure in the long term if that is the best way to go. 

Any advice will be immensely appreciated and I will try and answer any questions that you might have to better your response.

personalfinance,Managing Grad School Loans,"Just trying to make sure I have a firm understanding of grad student loans.

During the month of May and into early June, we believed she was being paid using her accrued vacation /personal / sick time. She had gone to HR prior to her being told she would be canned saying her manager had driven her to the brink of crazy. During May/June, she went to a therapist, I think 6 times, who eventually diagnosed her with major depression. 

My wife had her check,  since she started over 8 years ago, deposited into her credit union account. It made it easier to pay her credit card because their web site blows. 

She logged into her amount this week to get hey payment due, and there was a full months deposit made at the end of June, like a regular pay cycle. We're not sure if they (state university hospital) paid her last expected check - again it was FMLA, so it was supposed to be unpaid - as regular salary and this was her vacation pay out, or if it was a severance, or what is going on.

What do we do with this? I told her I wanted to ignore it in case it's a mistake - pretend it's our ""emergency emergency fund."" 

If it's legit her money, do we keep it as emergency money, or pay a bill in full? We have an untouched HELOC of a giant expense comes up, and we only have a small fund of $3000 right now. I'd like the fund to be closer to $10k. The extra check will pay off a credit card or her student loan in full. Her loan has a small interest rate, and we can snowball one of them, leading into a snowball post situation with the rest of the cards. Paying off either one would be an extra couple hundred each month we can either pay to others or fill the emergency fund.",finance

Like I said, maybe a totally dumb question but from my rudimentary electric knowledge I can't figure out any way one source would gain precedence over the other... and if, let's say I'm consuming 20Kw, and my solar is producing 18Kw... why wouldn't the utility try to provide all of it... or most of it... from my understanding, there isn't any limiting device in the path of the utility to the panel.",energy

A $23,000 scholarship nearly 50% of my university's tuition (with about an additional 7K from state and federal grants)

7K+ rising loans (all federal) 

Being able to schedule classes whenever and having my work schedule around it. 

Also would there be any unattended consequences as a result of me accepting the full time position?

personalfinance,Hold onto savings or pay off part of student loans to save more $ a month?,"Hi,
I've been lurking these forums for a while specifically looking at the great advice people have been giving regarding student loans and now I may need a little advice from you experts.
 
I graduated with roughly 130k in student loans getting a BFA in animation (yeah I know I was a dumb young man). That was back in 2007. 
Since then I've been paying roughly $1110 a month in minimum payments and by the grace of Cthulhu (as well as some major spending cuts) I've been fortunate enough to keep my head above water and not miss a single payment.  Currently I have around $63,000 left to pay off. I have 5 separate loans. 1 Federal and 4 private.


Federal (consolidated)   $11,000 at 5.25% fixed interest

Private Loan 1                $12,500 at 4.25% variable interest

Private Loan 2                $17,600 at 9.25% variable interest

Private Loan 3                $14,000 at 10.25% variable interest

Private Loan 4                $10,700 at 5.5% variable interest



My current working situation is pretty touch and go at the moment. I currently work a temporary job that just barely pays the minimum monthly payment for these loans and my rent ($450 a month).

I have around $20,000 in savings (after taxes) from a well paying job I was laid off from a few months ago and around $30,000 in my 401k from when was contributing during steady work. 

So I'm not in dire straits at the moment and only have around 5 years left to pay off the private loans, but I'm starting to feel that my debt is making the pursuit of my desired profession difficult. Specifically because all of the jobs are across country where it is expensive to live. I'm also terrified of falling behind on payments someday and seeing my balance balloon uncontrollably. 

So basically my dilemma is should I keep taking this steady pace and hold onto my savings for emergencies or should I be more aggressive and spend my saving to paying off one of these loans? 

Honestly the thought of just killing off one of the higher interest rate private loans at the sacrifice of my savings is tempting, just because that would give me back over $300 a month, which I could use to rebuild my savings. Yet I know I could be screwing myself over at a later date if I fall into hardship or can't find more work. 

I want to make sure I approach this logically, so any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,A rental situation that sounds a little to good to be true,"So for the past couple days I have been emailing this guy from an ad off craigslist.

personalfinance,What should I do with my raise?,"I recently got a promotion at work which came with a raise. Net difference to my take-home pay is about $800 per month. My expenses have not changed so this is basically extra money. What would be the smartest thing to do with it?

Some basics:

- I am already contributing to my 401k at the maximum amount that my employer will match.
- I also max out an annual Roth IRA contribution.
- I have no credit card debt, but I do have two mortgages (two separate properties) and I use one as a rental property. The rental income pays the mortgage so I break even there.
- I have a car loan which is my highest interest debt.
- Because I don't always have a tenant in the rental property, my budget is set up to afford both house payments without a tenant. When I do have a tenant, the rental income goes directly into savings. (I currently have a tenant)

Some possible choices for the money:

- Increase the amount I am paying on the car loan to pay down the principal faster
- Increase the payments on the mortgages, also to pay down the principal faster (if I do this, do I split it between them equally or focus on one first? The interest rate is the same but should I pay down the smaller principal first? Or the higher one?)
- Increase my 401k contribution (I won't get any additional employer match, but I will reduce my taxable income. Relevant because this raise may push me over the line between getting a tax refund and owing taxes each year)
- Put it into savings (I do already have about 6 months of expenses in savings)
- Invest in some other way? I'm comfortable with a moderately aggressive market investment but my Roth and 401k are already invested that way

Any advice or suggestions are appreciated - thanks!",finance

I made an Excel sheet to calculate payoff times based on payments and interest rate and all that good stuff, but then I noticed that the credit card statement itself has a section where they do a calculation for you about how long it will take to pay off your balance by only making the minimums (I assume because of some government regulation, since I doubt they would volunteer this). I noticed, though, that the two calculations don't match. 

Here's the details:
Balance: $7,633.98
Interest: 15.24%
Minimum Payment: $236

When I do the NPER calculation in Excel, I get about 3.5 years to payoff, and this is confirmed by an online calculator I found. The credit card statement, however, says that by only paying the minimum, the balance will take 18 years to pay off.

I did poorly in my second year of college which brought down by GPA to a 2.4. My school sent me a letter this summer saying that my GPA was too low for them to renew my scholarship. Shortly after I received an email from HESAA informing me that I had not completed my application for financial aid. So I check it out and it appears that I left out my dad's income tax information and I fill it out. Today I just received another letter from my college which indicated all the financial aid that I have for the academic school year. The only financial aid I am getting is $5500 of federalized direct subsidized loan and $2000 of federalized direct unsubsidized loan. I am no longer getting government grants and scholarships. I have been previously using $10,000 of Sallie Mae loans every year to pay off the remainder of my school bill but it looks like this year that's not going to be enough to cut it. I know most people here say that I should go to a state school to save money but there are a few problems with that. Fairleigh Dickinson was the only college near me that even accepted me into its engineering program and now that my GPA has dropped I fear that it's only going to be harder to transfer to another state college.

personalfinance,"Moving on from high interest debts, should moderate interest always come before unmatched retirement?","Hi PF. 

I found this forum early last year and had been considering consolidating $40,000+ of CCs into my mortgage. Y'all talked me out of that and convinced me to have some discipline with paying off my debts. In the last year I've dropped my CC debt from $52,000+ to under $27,000 (68%-&gt;34% utilization) and just eliminated the last credit card balance that has an active interest rate. I concede, starting on a project at work where I get an extra ~$1,000/month for travel/not-at-home time has been the largest reason for my progress, but the old me would've been spending every dime while making minimum payments. I didn't grow up financially secure and never learned good spending habits or how to handle money. My debt leaving college had been so intensive that it had affected relationships and caused me to alter my life (not having kids or getting married) to avoid allowing my problems to become someone else's. 

The worst of my debt is going to be gone soon, but for now here's the details of my budget. Note that with $6,000-$10,000 directly reimbursed travel expenses per month my discretionary spending is difficult to nail down without spending a lot more time on finances that I feel is reasonable.

**Me:** 
27, no kids, IT Consultant

**Savings / Emergency Fund:** $5,000


**Income:** 

* Monthly Pay (After Taxes): $5077
* Monthly Travel Per Diem: $600-1200 (expected to last another 4-8 months)
* Renting second room: $750
* Bonuses: $15,000-20,000/year (30:70 June:Dec)



**Credit Cards:** $377/month for minimums + $1,000-2,000/month extra (snowball + leftover budget)

Account | Balance | Interest | Minimum Payment
---|---|----|----
CC1 | $5,463 | 0% until 04/18 | $110
CC2 | $19,282 | 0% until 10/18 |  $194
CC3 | $1,991 | 0% until 10/19 |  $73

CC4, 5, 6 , 7, 8, 9: Either completely unused or paid off monthly for bonus programs. 


**Student Loans:** $512/month

Type | Balance | Interest | Minimum Payment
---|---|----|----
Unsubsidized | $29,126 | 6.55% | $316
Private | $24,539 | 5.75% |  $196


**Committed budget:** $2,425/month

Bill | Amount 
---|---

Car Loan | $406   (2.06%)

Car Insurance:     $114 ($687 every 6 months, lines up with bonuses)
 

**Flexible Budget:**

Category | Budget
---|---
Food | $500-750* 
Gas | $100
Pet | $150
Fun | $500-750*

*See: Work travel, avg 15+ nights away from home per month

This budget has held for roughly a year and had the next steps as a distant decision that wasn't a current consideration.

With the recent passing of a grandparent, I'm going to receive $28,000 in the next few months that will eliminate the last of my credit card balances. I could try to work that money a little before the 0% expires, but I want to put CC debt in my rearview mirror. My credit cards are going to be paid off *at least* a year earlier than I expected and I don't know what my next move should be. Yes, I've read the prime directive many times but I feel that my situation falls close to the cutoff for a yes/no decision.

My student loans aren't crippling, but they feel monolithic. Dealing with my other debts I just set them to minimum and effectively ignored them. I've looked into refinancing them and I don't seem to be able to get the interest below 4.9% with a 5 year term that has 2-3x higher minimums. Is that a good option? Would I be well served to commit more on top of the new minimum? My job is relatively secure, but increasing my minimum payment by $1,000+ seems ill-advised and costs me a lot of flexibility.

When I laid the numbers bare, I recognized that before Thanksgiving I'm going to have at least $2,000/month that has been committed to debt that's flexible. I've been living with so much debt that seeing the clouds part is actively causing me anxiety. I haven't had good options in a long time.

I know step one from here is rebuild my emergency fund to at least 3 months ($15,000). My EOY bonus should allow me to do that and I'll move $10,000 to a 1+% APY savings to keep it accessible with $5,000 immediately available. I don't think 6 months is necessary for me, 3 should be more than comfortable until I have dependents. 

**What's step two?** 

The prime directive suggests that I push everything to student loans and continue the snowball for another 2+ years. Is that really the best course? (If so, why?)

Should I break up the snowball and do other things? Max out an IRA (Traditional or Roth) first? Would the tax advantages outweigh that money going into paying a 6.55% loan (2017 taxable income estimate: $110k)? My employer has a 401k with no matching, do I start pushing into that? Is there a better option than an unmatched 401k?

I got so used to overbearing debt that I don't know what to do now that I am going to hit the biggest milestone. I've seen enough of the ""paid off debts and then got back into bad habits"" threads/comments here to know that I need to have a plan. While I still have a long ways to get to debt free, for the first time I've got a clear path to it and honestly don't know how to handle money once I get there. 

TL;DR: High interest debt is about to be gone for the first time in my life. Why should 6% student loans go before retirement contributions but under 4% wouldn't?",finance

personalfinance,How Am I Doing Financially With Student Loan Debt So Far,"Hello Reddit,

I'm currently a transfer student who got admitted into GA Tech studying Electrical Engineering, which has one of the best programs in the U.S. In my first year at my previous college, I got a $5,500 unsubsidized federal student loan and my dad got a $10,000+ parent PLUS loan. This year for GA Tech, I have approximately $20,000 in loans that have to borrowed in order for me to go to GA Tech. $7,500 will be an unsubsidized federal student loan and $13,000 will be in a parent plus loan. However, because of my dad's poor financial decisions in the past year, I'm 90% certain he won't get a plus loan again this year. As a result, I'm responsible for that $13,000 in Wells Fargo private loans as well (might be less because I can get additional Stafford loans and I can get a $2,000 refund because my housing option is cheaper than the allowed amount in the cost of attendance).

I went ahead and considered the remaining semesters; my final loan amount will be, at most, around $63,500 without interest (around half will be in private loans with Wells Fargo). I say at most because I plan on doing a co-op for 5 semesters. By the time I graduate, I should be able to pay $20,000 towards student loans, bringing the total down to $43,500. I may also be eligible for the Pell Grant next year, which will bring that loan amount to the mid $30,000's.

With the average salary of an electrical engineer being $65,000 out of graduation for GA Tech, I was wondering the following:

1. Is the loan amount I mentioned reasonable for my college education and that I won't be pulling my hair paying for student loans after graduating?

2. Am I under or overestimating that $20,000 amount coming out of my co-op (assuming the co-op will be in Atlanta) to pay for my student loans?

3. How much can I expect to payback to my student loans for a 3 term co-op instead since that's an option at GA Tech as well.",finance

personalfinance,Expat &amp; U.S. home owner:How to secure a loan from home equity while living abroad. Financial advice requested.(Peru),"Hola,

Long time lurker and first-time poster. As the title says I live abroad. I own a property in a large U.S. City. We put down nearly 40% on it when we closed and we have owned it for 5 years at a great interest rate. Currently we rent it out and it provides us with an income while living out of the country. We are both employed down here as well. 
We want to take a loan on the equity in our U.S. property so we can build down here. Taking a loan from a bank in Peru comes with a 12-15% interest rate....no thank you. However, without U.S. verifiable income we are having difficulty getting a loan from a U.S. bank. What are our options?",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my home with my brother as a co-signer?,"I live in Japan, but I have had a home in Southern California (about 2 miles from the coast) for the last 16 years or so.

I got my first mortgage as a 5-yr ARM in 2001 when stated income loans were all the rage.
Bought the home for $360,000 with a variable monthly income of less than $2000.
Immediately looked for renters to help cover costs and managed to keep afloat (although I've never been able to do much in the way of savings).
Moved to Japan to eat sushi for a year in 2005 (and get a nicer paycheck of more than $3000/month) and then came back to re-finance to a 30-year FRM at around 6.8%, iirc. Luckily got that done before the crash at the height of predatory lending.
My girlfriend from Japan decided to stalk me by visiting a few times a year, and in combination with dead-end jobs and a growing discomfort with my housemate, decided to move back to Japan in 2009 to assist them with their population problems.
I continue to get back home every year to check in on things and do landlord-y stuff (have gotten a new roof and done other renovations from afar with the help of a new housemate who had me kick out the first housemate of about 10 years because he also found the guy unbearable to live with)
I'm now about 11 years into that mortgage, still owe around $280,000 and the house has grown in value to be around maybe $600,000 (never had an appraisal, but it is fixed up pretty well now and in a nice neighborhood).

My half-brother came out to live in the house about a year and a half ago, angering my second main housemate who had grown accustomed to living alone (I've actually had about 4-5 other housemates for small amounts of time, too... My goal was always to have 3 folks living in the house, but 2 was the usual number... typically a renter and myself).
Housemate 2 moved out, leaving just my brother there for a while until I got another family friend to move in (have yet to see rent from him, but that is another story altogether). So now I'm getting $2000/month in rent (supposedly... not really) and still covering almost $600/month from afar.

After the crash, I tried really hard to refinance again, having heard of a number of government programs that were supposed to help folks out, but since I have never actually missed payments and have maintained equity greater than a certain percentage of blahblahblah... I either never qualified or was run through so many hoops that refinancing was too difficult to accomplish. Particularly from Japan (with an income situation that most lenders don't want to deal with) or while home for only a couple weeks at a time.

Okay... if you made it through that helluvalong premise, thanks for sticking with me.
Here comes the part I'm having the current issue with.

My brother recently made it known that he would be interested in co-signing on a new loan with me. He has a pretty darn decent job (I don't know all the details, but I'm thinking around $50,000 salary... quite possibly more) that would hopefully not be a major problem to qualify for a loan with me (again... my Japanese income has turned off lenders I've contacted before, so I don't know for sure if this would even work).

Obviously, with his help, getting into a nicer mortgage (maybe a 20-year or even a 15-year loan?) with a lower interest rate and even more manageable monthly payment might finally be a real possibility. It would be a really great thing to do... kind of a dream of mine for the last 7 years or so.

So my questions are:

1. Should I even do this? I mean, I've survived this long. Assuming my renters keep/start kicking down their $2000/month, I can cover the rest without a major issue. I have 19 years left, and if all goes well I'll pay it off soon after I turn 60 and could then have a very nice home in California to either use as a rental property, or live in after retiring (more recently the wife and I have been discussing Hawaii as a better retirement locale, but I still love Cali and don't see the harm in keeping a house there. If for no other reason, it will help my kids - now 7, 3, and 2 years old - qualify for in-state tuition at some of the finest public universities in the world). It does seem appealing to have even more accountable ""help"" dealing with everything for once after over 15 years of struggling to keep my head above water on the house.

2. If I do choose to re-fi with my brother as a co-signer, what sort of unforeseen down-the-road situations do I need to be aware of and what steps should I take in order to potentially prevent problems? For example, if we decide to sell the house (slowly becoming more of a possibility after many years of firmly believing I never would - college education is pricey, I don't have a good savings account right now, and we may end up retiring elsewhere), how do I value what ""share"" of the house would be mine vs. his? I suppose the reverse is also a concern, if my brother decides he doesn't want to be attached to the property anymore. I could see this being an issue at some point, but I don't really know if it would be (my brother and I are **super-duper-tight**, but money problems can sometimes create weird situations). Are there other concerns besides potential ""buy-outs"" that I need to worry about, too?

So yeah, any advice you have on those 2 questions would be awesome... Thanks!

A little extra information that probably doesn't matter, but may help explain my situation or answer questions you have...
The house was originally a retirement home for my mother and step-father bought in the early 90's since it was in the same city my grandmother lived in. She died soon after, and it got filled up with all of my grandparents' possessions - memories of my childhood dating back to the 70s. 
I moved in a year and a half after graduating University (late '97) in a care-taker role since it was cheap (basically utilities).
My mom died a few years later, and since she was the Cali girl and my step-father had no interest in moving out to the left coast (""land of fruits and nuts""), he decided to cash out on what he was viewing as an investment.
I had extreme sentimental attachments to it as it was where I spent the last couple years of happy times with my mom in it during her vacation visits and it was in a town I had been visiting since I was knee high to a grasshopper and filled with old-school memories.
I bought it from him (no appraisal, but no family discounts, either) with the intention of keeping it forever, but now that I have lived away from it for 8 years and have my own family with things going well, I don't have as strong an attachment as I once did.
But at this point, it just seems like too good an investment to bail on... Our family  *LOVES*  getting back there and the renter situation is the best it has ever been (once I hopefully start seeing all the rent coming in) as the people living in it are also the people I most want to visit with when I go back to the States.

Well, almost midnight here.
If you have questions for me, it will take a while to answer them, but anything you might be able to suggest to me about how to proceed would be nice.",finance
personalfinance,Drowning in debt due to reduced income... stop paying a large debt to pay off smaller?,"Long story short... my income has decreased over 60% the last 2 years and I am struggling with my debt. I am actually paying much more than I am earning each month and have no savings. I spoke with an ACCC counselor (non-profit credit agency) who came up with a budget and plan that would reduce my current credit card debt from $900+ payments to $465 through reduced interest rates. I would still pay all credit cards in full and on time but they would be closed which will affect my credit score (which I dont really care at this point).  Even with this plan I am going to be in the hole each month and still without savings.  
  
Income: 
  
$5600 net after taxes (this could be as low as $4800 if my bonus changes)  
  
Expenses:  
  
Mortgage: 1625  
Cars:  850 
Lending Club:  1100  
Avant: 350  
Credit Cards Pre-ACCC: 925 (465 if I do the plan)(Total Balance: 20,000)
IRS Debt: 125  
Student Loans: 200
Car Insurance: 235 (was only 65 before my kid turned 16 a few months ago)  
Utilities (phone, cable, internet): 280  
Electric: 400  
Total before groceries etc:  $6090  
  
With 4 kids our grocery bill runs $400+ per month.  
  
So even with the credit card plan reducing my payment to $465, I am still in a hole that I can't get out of (at least $500+ short every single month).  I have cut out our wireless plan with ATT to get on a no contract plan and changed cable/internet to drop my bills lower (actually reduced those from $500 to $275). We have cut out all spending on eating out, etc.  
  
So I am considering stopping payments on the personal loans (Lending Club and Avant) in order to pay off the other debts faster and accumulate some savings because as of right now, if our car needed a major repair or some other financial disaster were to strike, we have nothing to use. I have less than $1000 in the bank currently.  I don't care what happens to my credit score over the next 5 years, this isn't just an inconvenience at this point, it is a financial emergency to get on track. Sure I will be taking on collections and calls etc from Lending Club and Avant but they cant get money when I dont have money.  My goal would be to pay off the credit card debt much more quickly than the plan would call for (since I would have an extra $1400 per month from not paying the personal loans) and save some money for emergencies... then settle for less on the personal loan debts down the road. Paying an extra $400 per month to my credit card debt would take my 48 month payment plan to just 22 months.  
  
Is this a dumb route to take?  Please give your insight!",finance
personalfinance,"I have some debt (credit card, student loan, and personal loan) plus I have my first steady income. I have read the wiki, but I have some short term loans that I am curious about how to pay off.","Hello! I have read the wiki, but I have some questions about my debt still. Let's just go ahead and get that out of the way:

Student Loans:

$3,500.00 3.86%  
$4,500.00 4.66%  
$2,200.04 4.66%  
$5,500.00 4.29%  
$2,007.27 4.29%  
$5,500.00 3.76%  
$2,022.99 3.76%  
$1,800.00 3.76%  

Total: ~$27,085

Credit Cards:

Amazon: $1,574 19.99%  
Wells Fargo: $1,518 19.99%  
Discover: $505 19.99%  

Total: ~$3,597

(These are all maxed out, I have paid them off multiple times and then things have come up where I need to use them. Have had this balance since November.)

Personal Loans:

$2,173.44 36.00%  
$784 0% interest but short term loan needs to be paid in entirety by Sept. 3, 2017  

I also owe my brother $1000 which he needs for school this upcoming September. So even though I have a really high interest personal loan, I have to tackle the two short term loans first. I have $0 in savings, which is why I took out the large personal loan in the first place. I will be making a steady income at least until January, and then I'll hopefully have a salary job. I just graduated so January is when I'll have student loan payments due.

I also have all other bills taken care of, so besides paying my debt off I only have to worry about monthly expenses, such as food, gas, and other little things. My next paycheck will be small, as I just started my temp job, but after that I have estimated that $800-$900 every two weeks will be available. Here's my plan for August:

10th:

$500 to brother  
$300 to short term loan  
$100 to credit card minimum payments  

25th:

$500 to brother  
$400 to short term loan (can possibly swing the $84 if I really push it.)  

So the short term loans would be paid off and I would only have the one personal loan with high interest.

September/October:

$500 personal loan  
$100 to each ccard  

$600 personal loan  
$200 student loans  

The personal loan should then be paid off. Even if I put all my funds towards it, it will still be paid off in November. I want to pay on the other debt mostly because it will ease my anxiety. In November I can also start paying on my credit cards.

10th:

$300 to pay off smallest one  
$250 on each larger one  

25th:

$400 to each ccard  

December:

10th:

$400 on each ccard  

25th:

$300 on each ccard  
$200 savings  

So that's my plan. By the time my temporary employment ends, I should have all my debt paid off plus a little head start on my student loans and a little head start on my savings. Now, we all know things don't always work out this smoothly, what with life's expenses randomly popping up sometimes, and I have no money in savings, however, my mom said she will help me out if anything does come up so I can tackle this debt and have a clear slate otherwise before I need to start repaying my student loans. My partner also will be contributing to our combined savings account so that we can have a cushion. I didn't think it was fair to count their income when figuring out my debt repayment plan.

Also, to cover all my bases I looked into a personal loan for debt consolidation and the interest rate for it was 28%. That would be the amount just for my credit cards and their interest rate is lower so that doesn't seem like a good option for me. 

Thanks for reading! Please let me know what you guys think of my plan and if I should change anything. :)

personalfinance,Am I getting too big of a mortgage?,"Recently signed a purchase agreement for a house, which is honestly too big for me (single living alone) but not an unreasonable price for a 3 bed/3 bath in a good area. A 2 bed/2 bath in the same area would be about $13k less and likely be a townhouse with a shared wall.

My take home income after taxes, health, and 401k is $3,371/month

The mortgage payment with PITI/PMI/HOA $1,360/month.

Car payment is $388/month (a little under 3 years left before it's paid off)

Student loans are paid off, and I pay my credit card balance every month so no real credit card debt (mostly just use it for monthly bills to get points).

I'll be putting about $12k down for a $180k house (fixed 30yr @ 3.875%), and I'll have a few thousand in the bank after closing costs and prepaids.

I'm currently not factoring in my year end bonus (generally an extra paycheck, so a little over $2k) and my usual state/fed tax refund (another $2k). 

A family member has also offered to gift me $10k, which would probably put my mortgage payment closer to $1200/month.

personalfinance,"High interest debt paid off, not sure what to tackle next.","25 year old prior military, landed a government job late last year making just about 100k on the dot in a low cost-of-living area.


Some poor financial habits in the past led to me starting this job with a few thousand dollars in credit card debt, so that and shoring up my emergency fund have been the immediate priority. A few months into the new job I've got my CC balance down to zero and a $5,000 emergency fund set aside. 

On the retirement side, I've kept my TSP contributions at 10 % of my pay and I receive +5 % matching for a total of 15 %. I also have a mandatory contribution to a defined benefit pension plan of another 4.5 %~. If I can keep both of these going long-term, I should be able to retire comfortably.

Now that I've got the high-interest stuff under control and retirement is building, I need a plan to rack and stack my lower-interest debts.

&gt;Mortgage (3 bedroom home) - 3.75 % - $75,000~

&gt;Vehicle (Low-mileage used hybrid) - 3.35 % - $9,000~

&gt;Student loans (Subsidized) - 4.3 % - $7,000~

I think the conventional wisdom here would be to take down these debts from highest interest to lowest, so student-&gt;mortgage-&gt;vehicle. However, I do anticipate starting grad school in the next six months. When I'm once again taking classes, that $7,000 will go into deferment and (if I understand correctly) not accrue interest.

So I guess my main questions are:

1. Does it make sense to hold off on paying student loans because I know they're going to go into deferment?
2. If so, when I'm back in school does it really make sense to prioritize paying off my home before my vehicle?
3. Should I be maxing my TSP or ROTH before even tackling debts at this interest rate? I could increase my TSP contributions in order to hit the yearly 18k~ cap and expect better returns, couldn't I?",finance

Unfortunately, with regards to accessing your money, the TSP is not as flexible as most 401ks. The TSP only allows you to:

- make a partial withdrawal once in your lifetime. (Since I have two TSP accounts I can make a one-time partial withdrawl from both of them.)

- otherwise, you have to make a ""full withdrawal"". The ""full withdrawal"" term that the TSP uses is inaptly named. When you make a ""full withdrawl"", you have the choice of receiving either:

- a single, lump sum payment, or

- a series of monthly payments. You can change the monthly amount that you would like to receive, however, you can only change the monthly withdrawal rate once per year. (The minimum monthly payment you can receive is $25.)


Given the TSP's low expense ratios, and the G-Fund (which is guaranteed never to loose principle) there are many people who say to avoid withdrawing money from the TSP for as long as possible.

My monthly expenses are totally under control and within my means, but due to debt payments I'm unable to save and I have no safety net.

I plan to pay about $150 each month towards the student loan even while I'm in school.

Currently, all of my student loans are on deferment and I will be graduating this December.  Six months after that, I will have to begin repaying them; so around June 2018. My loan balances are as follows:

- Subsidized: $23,000

- Unsubsidized: $20,500

- Balance: $43,500

- Average APR: 4.4% (on total balance)

- Accrued interest since 2011: ~$3,050.

Additionally, I also have a car on which I owe $24,500 remaining at an interest rate of 7.5%. I have no credit card debt at this time.

I'm trying to formulate a plan and decide whether I should:

- Not contribute the max of $18,000 a year to my 401(k) (or put anything in it at all, ignoring the employer match) and aggressively pay off my student loans, or car, or both.

- Put the minimum amount every month to ensure I get the 4.5% employer match, and aggressively pay off my student loans, or car, or both.

-  ?


It appears my student loan interest is manageable, and if I pay the min. I would be able to use the interest I paid as a tax deduction.  I'm unsure what to do here and plan for my future.  Starting in 2018 I was planning on maxing my 401(k) contribution of $18k/year + employer contributions + further investments, but currently, this leaves me with 5 months of 2017 to aggressively pay things with, or invest. 

**Note:** I live with my parents and have no plans to move out currently. Any additional expenses would be for necessities, entertainment, etc.

personalfinance,Is taking out a loan to pay off my credit cards debt of $25K is a smart idea?,"I have a credit cards debt of almost $25 K (+ $45 K in student loans, but that's a different story) with a APR ranging from 18-20%. As you can see, I'm drowning in debts and I'm in my 20's! I just got a job few weeks ago which pays decent ($3.5 K take home salary per month). I'm spending a total of $2 K every month which includes rent, utilities, car, food, student loans and other payments excluding credit card interests payments (I don't use them anymore, just paying the minimum interests). I think I'll be able to save 1-1.5 k every month to pay towards credit cards bills (Maybe not all the savings, as I'm trying to set up an emergency fund too).

I read that you can take personal loans ( from company like discover, lendingclub, prosper) for debt consolidation. I am just not sure how effective or smart the move is! I mean it's better than paying 20% in interest obviously. But I never took out a loan like that (only federal student aid loan but that's different). I don't know what's the consequences and all that! I am trying to be debt free with minimal cost and hopefully you guys can help me find a way! Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Investing Advice?,"I'm a 25 year old and make $60k a year in Maryland. I have expenses of about $1575/month so that leaves me with about $2000/month to invest or spend free-willingly. I have about $26k of student loans left with interest rates ranging 3.75%-7.5%.

personalfinance,Is my investing strategy sound?,"Hey PF, I wanted to give a general rundown of my finances, and get your opinions on them.

I'm in my late 20's and am a social worker, so my net income is ~30k a year pre-taxes, health insurance, etc. I'm putting about 5-10% of my monthly income into my IRA, and about 5-10% of my monthly income into stocks, and ETFs. 

I plan to be in a higher tax bracket when I retire, so do you think having an IRA makes sense over a Roth? Does it make sense to have a Roth and a regular IRA? 

I also have an auto loan which I'm paying down each month, putting a bit extra toward it so I'm a couple months ahead on payments. This way, if I for some reason forget a month or have a tight month I can skip a payment without harming my credit. The interest rate on the loan is about 2.1% so it's pretty low anyway, I figured I'd make more sense to put the money into the stock market than to put all of it toward the loan.

Do you think I'm saving enough, and is there a different way you would suggest I go about any of this?",finance
personalfinance,"Help! Finances are starting to get out of control, worried could be broke in a few months...","Hi /r/ PersonalFinance 

Using a throwaway account to avoid being connected via my main account.  Literally feeling like my head is underwater in my current situation, and reaching out here to see if there is any advice or help to get my finances back under control.

**Quick Backstory:**  

Previously I was working overseas and while my financial situation with loans and debts wasn't perfect, I was actively in control and making strides toward financial freedom.  Recently my mother was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer, and only given 3 months to live.  As a result, I returned to the U.S. to help take care of her during this difficult time; and to spend what remaining time I have with her while I can.

Subsequently this has taken a blow to my finances and now I'm starting to feel the pressure as bills mount and my savings diminish.  Here is where I am at currently.

**Credit Score:** *700 - 750* depending on Bureau 

**Savings Account:** *$9,500* (Previously $19,000 before listed events occured)

**Checking Account** *$4,000*

----------------------------------------------------------------
**Expenses**
-----
**Auto Insurance** *$132.73 monthly*

**Health Insurance** *$272.55 monthly*

**Credit Card Balance** *$2,045 balance, @ 9.15% Variable Interest. 

Minimum payment $50/mo*
Normally my balance is paid off each month, but I've had to over extend myself recently with purchase of flight and other unforeseen cost circumstances.


**Federal Loan Balance** *$13,427.27 @ 6.8% Fixed Interest.* Minimum monthly payment of $176.00

**Private Loan Balance** *$76,053.21 @ 6.6% Fixed Interest.* Minimum monthly payment of $875.50

**Private State Loan Balance** *$4,853.53 @ 9.00% Fixed Interest.* Minimum monthly payment of $51.00

**Phone Bill** *$65.00*

------------------------------------------------------------
***Total Minimum Monthly Payments = Approximately $1,600***
------

Previously I was making around $5,000 to $6,000 monthly while working overseas; sometimes more, but at current I'm back in the U.S. and have been unable to find new work.  So I have no income at the moment and I'm starting to lose all my savings while trying to quickly readjust to the current situation.

No Car payment, bought a used car outright for $1000 to get around town, visit to hospital, looking for work, etc.

None of this is ideal, and I'm now concern about handing upcoming costs of funeral, burial, etc.  Father lost his business a few years ago, and has practically no money to contribute.

Obviously the real big item here is quickly finding a new job stateside Until that happens however, I'm afraid I'll be broke or near broke within 3 months time.  Checking account will last me until end of August.

Savings account will technically add three more months, but I want to avoid losing that money and going broke, as I will have no other recourse if that happens.  Also worried about new unforeseen costs creeping up too.

**Regarding Rent &amp; Food**
- 
Currently staying with a friend so do not have to worry about rent, although this will not be available indefinitely.  Food costs are being kept to a minimum, but conservatively coupled with gasoline costs, approximately $300 monthly.  This brings my total monthly expenses to around **$2000/month**

-------------------

I feel blindsided by the events that have occurred and now starting to feel the pressure.  I'm trying to be there for my sick mother who won't be here much longer, but also running out of time to stay afloat and sustainable.  Actively applying, calling, e-mailing, and pursing job leads; but the job market where I'm at hasn't good for a long time.

Starting to feel lost here - are there better ways for me to handle my current financial situation with everything that's happened??",finance

personalfinance,Going exempt on income taxes to invest yourself?,"I've tried looking this up online, and I'm sure I'm not wording it correctly, but why not go exempt on your federal taxes through the year and invest that money yourself making a profit, than pay what you owe at tax time?

personalfinance,"[UK] Should I take out a postgraduate loan for my masters, given that I don't need it to pay my tuition/living costs?","*first time poster, long time lurker*

Context: I am currently studying at a good UK University, I have near £50,000 in debt under the new UK student loan system where you pay 9% of anything you earn over £21,000 back with the debt rising at RPI + interest rate (scaling from 0% to 3 dependent on how much you're earning), it not effecting your credit score and being wiped after 30 years. I feel I will likely be part of the majority that won't pay this back in the time limit so see this as more of a tax than a loan.

To get on the career path I am currently aiming for I would need a specific masters, I currently have an offer of this masters from my current Uni with enough funding that I wouldn't necessarily need a Government loan to support myself, however, would it be a good idea to take this loan in it's full amount (£10,250) regardless?

Context: This loan would sit alongside the undergrad one where I would be paying 6% of anything over £21000 (6+9=15% in total), with the debt rising at RPI + 3%, once again not effecting the credit score and being wiped out after 30 (less likely this would happen given it sits alongside and is a significantly less amount). 

My rationale for thinking this would be a good idea as once I get a full time job my first thoughts would lean to me saving money for a house - this would give me a head start in this regard, especially when considering the UK governments new lifetime ISA scheme. The scheme is offering a 25% interest rate on upto £4000 per year, where the money is either put towards a pension or the buying of your first home (has to be less than 450,000). There are pitfalls if you withdraw early etc. but the opportunity demonstrates well the possibilities I could do with the extra liquidity. 

Summary: On one side I would have to pay back less per month on my loans but would lose the head start gained by a £10,000 injection. On the other I would have money to invest in the lifetime isa where the gains would outweigh the costs of the loan as long as spent on my first home, a ready made emergency fund for when I graduate etc. I'm leaning towards the latter, however I'm wary my lack of experience is making me naive hence the post.",finance
personalfinance,First credit card through 1st Financial Bank USA.,"**Background:**

I recently graduated from high school last month and got my first job. I only work about 25 hours a week at minimum wage so I'm not making too much. Most of my money goes toward rent and such. I'm having trouble saving.

I received a letter in the mail from 1st Financial Bank USA offering a student credit card. To me, an uneducated noob, it seems like a great deal. I question the 30.65% APR, however, because I had previously heard 28% was on the high end.. 

I would really appreciate some input on where I should start with my first credit card. Is this a good deal? 

**Benefits:**

Payment flexibility
Security and convenience
Text banking
Customer service 
Mobile app
No foreign currency conversion fees
Zero liability


**Interest Rates/Charges:**

0% APR for the first year
30.65% APR the second year and beyond

Minimum interest charge is $0.50



**Fees:**

No annual fee for one year, then $25

Transaction fee for both cash advance and balance transfer are $3 or 3%, whichever is greater.

Penalty Fees for both late payment and returned payment are up to $38.


**Other random info I think may be useful for you:**

They issue credit cards to students with some initial credit lines as low as $150. You can reduce the line to as low as $100 



My input- it appears that this service is provided to help students build their credit scores and learn from their mistakes while the stakes are low. 

I'm not so sure I like having a limit. I don't like the idea of some of my money being inaccessible. Maybe I'm just being uneducated, though. 

Please enlighten me. 

Any other random advice having to do with new-adult things are highly encouraged and appreciated.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my Navient (Sallie Mae) student loan?,"Hi all,

Currently I have a $9000 student loan from Sallie Mae.  I'm just about down to the original amount that was taken out after 3 years of payments (it rose to about $12,000 over 4 years of interest).

My parents essentially took the loan out for me when I was 17 and about to head into college, they had terrible credit and I don't even think I had a credit history.  Because of that, it ended up being a variable interest rate, which has now risen to 11.625% and is rising at about .1% every single month, which is outrageous.

Should/Could I refinance this loan since I now have a very solid credit score (750+) on my own to change the interest rate?",finance
personalfinance,More confusion with my federal income taxes. I can't seem to figure out if my employer is deducting too much.,"Last week it dawned on me that my employer was not deducting federal income tax from my pay check. Turns out I was right. No biggie as I'm new and have only collected 2 paychecks with this error.  
This Friday I received my 3rd paycheck, with fed income tax deducted, and I think it's too high. Or maybe it's not since it's so damn hard to find a solid answer online.  

My gross pay this pay-period was $2243.75, my federal income tax deduction is $297.04. That's like 13.2385%. I get paid every other week. I'm filing as a single person and I put the standard 2 allowances on my W4.

Based on the IRS website that says my taxes should be: ""$5,226.25 plus 25% of the excess over $37,950,"" that would put me at 16.81% effective tax rate since I'm making $52,000 annually. 

Based on this website: https://smartasset.com/taxes/idaho-tax-calculator#GNEQwtafzi I should be at an effective tax of 9.65% with two allowances and 11.63% if I did one allowance. 

Can anyone shed some light on which is the proper way to look at this?

I hear things like the 20/4/10 rule, and also keep your monthly payments no more than 15% of your monthly gross income, and also keep your car payments/insurance/fuel costs/maintenance at or less than 20% of monthly gross income.

They are building their own physics engine (currently use havoc physics, but their new engine is called rubikon)

They have their own console (steam link)

they have their own 1st party controllers (steam controller)

they have their own game-ui api (used to use 3rd party solution scaleform, now uses in-house ""panorama"")

Valve has a pool of their own voice actors they use for every game. 

they have all of their original music done in-house with (and i'm not kidding about this) the ""valve symphony orchestra. 

They don't need to use 3rd party ANYTHING. They can start and finish a game completely in-company without needing to branch out. 

If game stores stopped selling valve games, they can just sell on steam.

If windows stopped supporting steam, they have their own OS. 

they don't rely on 3rd part game or physics engines, and their ui is home made. 

They have their own multiplayer so its not like microsoft and sony can stop supporting a game. Valve is completely self sufficient at this point.

So I'm 21, not great credit (445-505, depending on the report, but I've got some money to pay off debts. I've only got about $1,650 in credit card debt and have about a grand in federal student loans, (I think I owe the book store an additional $150-$200.) It won't be hard to pay off. 

Now on to the houses. My grandma died last week at 93 y/o, and owned 2 multiple unit houses, a duplex and a triplex. The duplex she rented at 500 and lived this the above 2 bedroom. I would value rent at 700 for the upstairs. (The location im in has pretty affordable housing) The market value of the house is at $98,000, the mortgage would be just under $500, taxes and utilities around $250. The house pays for itself when rented. The triplex she had she rented at $550, $550, and $450. The market value is $86,600. I haven't calculated the mortgage payments but it would be less then the other house, obviously it's just cheaper. Taxes I don't know either (I can and will find out asap) but I'd imagine it would be less based on price and they're in the same township. 

I need a place to stay also, and I have a few options. 
1. I live at my parents. It's free, but my dad is self employed but is a borderline hoarder and very lazy. He could be wealthy if not for being lazy. He misuses resources like he has never run any thought through his head. Yeah he's old and tired, and not in good health but that's his doing just because he's overweight and has never given two shits. Don't get me wrong, I love my father, we have a decent relationship. He is just stubborn. Sorry, I rant. Anyway it's not really an option. 
Option 2. I live in one of my units. The one reason I don't want to do this is because I want someone to pay me to live there. Duh. My dad has appartements and he might cut me a deal. So if I was able to rent from him for less then I rent my unit out I should do this option right? 
3. Is live in one of my dads apartments I just mentioned. 

Lastly I have to mention my aunt. She wants to buy the duplex. It's more of a home, where the triplex is, well a triplex. My father also wants me to buy the duplex because he's sentimental to it like my aunt. I don't give two shits about his sentimentality, I care about money. And I'll be able to pick up the duplex when my aunt kicks it (she's old also. 68 I think) so I think the triplex is the better buy for me. 

My father offered my a loan for the down payment because I don't have it saved. Grandma went quicker then I thought. She seemed healthier. 

My aunt, my dad, and my other aunt are all benefiting equally in the estate. However my dad and my other aunt (this one lives out of town and has little preference, other then not dragging the estate out long) are executives. The aunt who wants to buy the duplex is not an executive. 

That about sums it up, sorry it's so bloody long. Lmk what y'all think.",finance

So here's a basic breakdown of my financial situation. I'm 31 and I work part time in commissioned sales while going to school full time for Computer Science (so I'm expecting a pretty big bump in income within the next 3-5 years.). 



My income isn't consistent from month to month, but I've been bringing in anywhere between $1900 to $2500 a month after taxes. My expenses amount to about $1100 a month.


I am also starting to make plans with my girlfriend to move in with her in her very affordable condo, which would save us both quite a bit.


My main question is whether or not I should pay off my credit card debt from my savings all at once, or just put as much as I can towards it monthly while holding on to my savings. We'd like to save up for a down payment on a house, so I'm not sure if I'm better off keeping that cash on hand and dealing with the interest over time.



Also of note, I'm currently at about $15,000 in subsidized and unsubsidized student loans so far. And I have about $9,300 sitting in a retirement simple IRA from my old job that I haven't rolled over into anything yet.



So basically, I'd love opinions on the credit card situation specifically, but also suggestions on the full financial plan given all of my other assets and debts. I'd be open to increasing income, but I'm also trying to finish my degree as soon as possible, which is why I'm doing the part time job right now (not many night classes available and with this field, I need to be able to allocate a decent amount of time to get the work done without burning myself out). 


Thanks in advance. I look forward to hearing from you all.",finance

Back story: I was driving my car in NYC on a 3 lane wide road.  The left hand lane turned into a left hand turning lane only, I wanted to continue straight.  I immediately turned my right indicator on.  I looked out my back window saw no one coming in the middle lane to my right.  Looked forwards as I turned my wheel with my indicator on and entered the middle lane to my right, got at least half way into the lane when I saw something in the corner of my eye.  Depressed the brakes and stopped immediately because I moving quite slowly.  Traded paint on my front bumper with another drivers and passenger door as well as the rear quarter panel.  My right indicator lamp popped and I have a scuffed bumper.  The damage to the other drivers car was:  possible scratches, new paint, but no dents.  Damage to mine: scuffs, scratches, new paint, and a popped indicator lamp.  No one involved was hurt.

I took images.  Chatted to the other driver.  Police came and listened to our stories.  Accident report explains that I changed lanes striking the car.  But does not mention that I did not see a car in my lane and that I was at least half way into the middle lane when the accident occurred.  I believe the car switched into the middle lane or was driving in the middle of two lanes. Which would account for why I didn't see it out my rear window or side mirrors.

personalfinance,125K in Private Loans. How to allocate my paycheck?,"Hi,

I've just graduated college and have ~125K in student loans. It's a complicated situation to explain how I got there but my mistakes coupled with my parents thinking they could help me after the fact but actually couldn't.

My question is what I should do with the breakdown of my paycheck. Disclaimer, I have a nest egg of ~$4500 just in case in my savings account already. Also, I already have planned to refinance/consolidate these loans later on down the road.

EDIT: THE INTEREST RATE ON THE LOANS HOVER BETWEEN 7.25-7.85%

I take home ~$3750/mo after taxes.

The monthly payment on the student loans is ~$1250/mo, my rent + utilities is ~$900/mo, and then my monthly commuter pass is ~$70/mo. My job pays for food Mon-Thurs so my expenses after that are close to none but we'll say $300/mo to be safe for misc. things. 

That leaves me with ~$1230 per month that I haven't accounted for. 

My question is do I start maxing out my 401K matching contributions (company only matches $0.25 of every dollar up to 6% for the first 2 yrs)?

My other option is would it be better for me to put the extra money towards loan payments and if so how much extra per month?

My last option is would I continue to put money in my nest egg in case I lose my job? 

I appreciate all the advice I can get. Thanks.",finance
MachineLearning,[D] Multiple object recognition in high-resolution videos,"I'm trying to work with a new dataset and applying convolutional neural networks to it. It's proving to be quite the challenge for me though and have some open questions I'd like to discuss.

First, let me describe the data: I have videos of surgeries that have been annotated frame-by-frame with the surgical tools visible in the frame (there may be anywhere between 0-3 tools visible in each frame). Note that only the presence but not the location of the tools is known. The videos are of 1080p resolution and the tools elongated objects of about 30 pixels width. The task is to classfiy which tools are visible in each frame.

For now I want to work on each frame separately although it would probably make sense to use the temporal information later.

*Now my questions*

**Dealing with the high resolution**

Obviously 1920x1080 images are far too large to work with. However, when scaling the images down it becomes hard to distinguish between the different tools.

One easy solution that comes to mind is a sliding-window but I don't think I can use that: Given an extracted window I would want to train a classifier on it but I don't know what or if anything is visible in that window since I don't have location labels. 

While researching publications I found works on object detection like R-CNN that use a region proposal component and then classfiy the proposed regions. However as I understand it all these publications also have location labels available. So this has the same problem as the sliding-window.

Do you know of any approaches that solve this problem?


**Designing the classification head**

Given that there can be multiple or no objects in each frame I cannot use a softmax layer in the end. I had some ideas which I will outline below *but honestly have no idea how to do this properly*. Is there a standard way to do this?

&gt; Idea A: Don't use an activation function in the last layer and simply train with vectors such as [-1, -1, 1, -1, 1] where positive values are in favor of a class and negative values against a class. Then train with mean squared error.

&gt; Idea B: Have one small ""layer"" for each class fed from the second to last layer. Each layer would have 2 units and a softmax activation function trained as usual.

I've already been approved for federal financial aid for the 2017-2018 academic year. I'm normally a full-time student, but for the summer I decided that I would go to school part-time at 8 credits (12 credits is considered ""full-time"" at my school), and add hours to my work schedule. I figured this would end up giving me a ""mental break"" by reducing my school workload.

As it turns out, I was wrong. Despite the fact that my day job doesn't require a lot of critical thinking, I'm finding myself mentally overwhelmed even with what *relatively* little homework I have.

Here's my dilemma/question:

If I was to withdraw from my summer classes, will I lose my aid for the remainder of the academic year? Funds have already been dispersed and classes paid. About 3 weeks into the term. If I go through with this, I fully plan to return to school in the fall.

I just need a break, feeling like I may have shot myself in the foot. I would appreciate any advice or insight.

personalfinance,Student Loan Question/Predicament [LONG],"I've done some Googling on the topic but all the results I'm getting back are essentially the same, so I thought I would turn to the smart folk of this subbreddit for any advice. Please bear with the wall of text.

My girlfriend is about to start her last year of college. In order to graduate, she is required to take a language class, which would put her over her maximum credit allowance for her last year. This means she would have to take an extra quarter at her university, but that puts her slightly behind the 4-year degree path that she's on. Her parents are divorced, and her father refuses to pay for anything past his contractual obligation to pay for 4 years of university, which means that her mother cannot afford to pay for the last quarter of school. My girlfriend already has Federal student loans out in her name, but without a parent to cosign a loan for her extra quarter, she will be unable to graduate. Neither parent is going to cosign a loan for her, and she has nobody else in her family that 1) Has credit to be a cosigner, or 2) Is willing to be a cosigner. What can she do to get a loan in order to be able to graduate? I figure it'll be a long shot for her to get approved for a private loan considering her lack of credit history, and even if she was approved, she's worried about the lack of repayment flexibility.

BACKSTORY: My girlfriend is a double major. She holds a part-time job along with a part-time unpaid internship at a law firm, all while attending school full-time. She's attempted to take a language course this summer to fulfill the graduation requirement, but the school she's taking the course at decided to switch the curriculum up and make the class a level 3 instead of a level 1, so understandably, she's struggling to understand what's being taught. The school told her they're allowed to change the curriculum when they see fit, and they refuse to put her in a level 1 equivalent class because they claim the current course she's in is the lowest. This she says isn't true because she's asked for help from some Spanish speaking friends, and they all agree that the material is much too advanced for a level 1 course. The school refuses to refund my girlfriend the close to $1,000 that she paid for an online access code and for the class itself. Her father told her she has a week to provide proof that she'll be able to get this language credit  before he forces her to drop out of college. She's extremely upset and knows that the only way she could possibly pass the advanced language class would be by studying full time, which she can't do because she's working full time while also attending a law school prep class this summer. Hence, she was planning on taking a level 1 language class at her university, but again, she now has no way to pay for that extra quarter and will be unable to graduate. I've seen all the hard work she's put into her education, and she's devastated that her parents are essentially forcing her to drop out of college because neither of them are willing to cooperate to pay or cosign a loan. 

I've told her to try and contact her university to see if they can waive the language requirement under the circumstances, but she feels that it won't be a possibility. What are her options in regards to getting a loan to pay for her extra quarter? Should she try and file her FAFSA as an independent to try and get more Federal aid? I feel that the amount wouldn't be enough to cover the difference regardless. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for sticking through and reading all that!",finance

My financial situation is thus. 
55k salary (will bump to 60k mid August, but around 3k after taxes each month) 
39k student debt
7.5k Credit card debt
3k Auto loan debt 

Two years ago I moved to Los Angeles, long story short I bought one hell of a lemon car and racked up my existing credit card debt along with some frivolous spending which I have since stopped. 

I'm in a much more stable job situation having switched from working on film sets to an Entertainment Ad agency and have been working towards stabilizing my financial life as I've been paycheck to paycheck for some time and am really sick of it. 

I gave up my apartment in favor of a rented room at a home my parents recently purchased so I will have $625 to directly put towards my debts starting August 1st. 

I currently contribute $200 a month to my 401k through work as well as $50 a month to a Roth IRA that I opened with the rollover from a former employer. 

I auto deposit $150 (bumping to $200 once my raise hits) into a savings account (Ally Bank, current interest rate of 1.15%) Right now it's small at around $3.8k but am working on building it as an initial emergency fund. (Want to know if I should consider opening multiple savings accounts for different things.) 

I am focusing on these for now but also am planning on putting $100-200 aside every month for a down payment on a new car since my current vehicle has maybe two years tops left in it. I also utilize the Digit app to help funnel small amounts away as an emergency fund but it's small as I've had to use it a few times this past year. 

All in all I am very motivated to crush this debt and begin saving over a broader spectrum and slowly working up the confidence to try different investment avenues. But I am just trying to chip away at this one step at a time. 

As it stands I plan to put around $900 a month towards my two credit cards and my car which would have me paying everything off by August of next year. (Any overages once paid off I plan to put into my Ally savings.) 

I am incredibly intimidated and hoping for your advice on where I could improve or make changes and work towards better financial habits.

Roth IRA- $6,348.28
HSA- $1,300

I know many people are against paying down/off a mortgage with a low interest rate when you can make more in the market. However, I am wondering if in our situation it would make sense. 

I was thinking about keeping an emergency fund of $24,000 and making a lump sum payment of $83,000 toward the mortgage. This would get rid of PMI as well. 

I was then thinking about putting an extra $1,000/month towards the principal. This would pay the mortgage off in 9yr, 7 months. Paying an extra $2,000 would be tight (Bc we spend too much) but we could pay the mortgage off in 6 years, 6 months. I was considering eliminating 401k contributions to take home approx $7250 a month and put $3,000/month towards the mortgage to pay it off in 5 years. Does this make sense since I don't have an employer contribution? I would not touch any of the money currently in retirement accounts. 

The reason I am hoping to pay the mortgage so quickly is that it will mean we are debt free. Without the mortgage our monthly expenses drop from $3327 to $1347. 

I am a corporate attorney and it is ok but not something I want to do long term. My husband is getting his teaching license currently (just graduated) so hopefully next year or maybe even this year we will have some extra money. We are 29 and do not want kids.

I want to pay off the mortgage so that I can pick any job and be financially ok. I don't want to be stuck as an attorney. I have thought about teaching myself but with the mortgage, it really isn't possible for us both to teach. 

Another idea was to do the drastic 3k/month for two or three years and then try to recast or refinance for a smaller loan payment. I'm not sure if that would work.

Is this a good plan? Am I being too drastic? I basically didn't sleep last night bc I was so worried that I would be stuck as an attorney because of this house. Your feedback and critique is very much appreciated. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Lost with how to pay for Medical School,"Hi there,

So I am am essentially financially illiterate so I am quite overwhelmed with what I should be doing. Sorry in advance for any ignorant questions.

I am starting Medical School in the Fall and just received my Financial Aid letter from my school and it gives me the options to take out $40,500 in Direct Unsubsidized (Stafford) Loans and $44,030 in Grad PLUS Loans.

My total tuition is around $56,000. There are other expenses (cost of attendance) such as housing, food, etc. but my parents can help me pay for that I am mostly worried about the tuition.

My parents have also offered to help me pay for my tuition as well, but I don't want to lessen the burden on them if I can. We technically have the money saved up (both are retired though) but I would like to leave as much as I can for them while still making correct financial decisions.

My first question is: *Is it better in the long run to have my parents pay for my schooling first (and then pay them back once I graduate) or to take out loans?*

I know there are options such as IBR, PAYE, REPAYE, and PSLF, but I am not entirely sure how they work and if they will exist in the future. I heard people saying that the new administration may be trying to get rid of these programs. But if the programs continue to exist, I understand that there is loan forgiveness after X amount of years, so I was wondering if that is a better option than asking my parents to pay for the tuition.

My second question is: *If I should be taking out loans, would be better to take out the full amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan every year and asking my parents to cover the rest of the tuition?* 

From what I have briefly read, people say to take out Direct Unsubsidized Loans first due to the lower origin fee and interest rate compared to the Grad PLUS loans (I believe it is 6.8% vs 7.21%). Because of that, if I should be taking loans, I was wondering if it would be smarter to avoid Grad PLUS loans altogether.

I went with Chase to do some balance transfers and it turned out to not take all of my cards into one, so instead of combining into one it just created ANOTHER bill. My credit card bills are constant and I am not making enough money at the moment to handle them all month. I am looking for a way to combine all the cards into one. The interest rates are mediocre at the moment, so I do not want to break the bank on interest. I saw a company like Prospect will take all the loan debt off your hands at a decent rate. Are these companies worth it? Or is there a better way to pay all these off? I feel like it just won't ever stop. I admit I screwed up and I am working on a better path but I want to make it easier. Any advice will help. Thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,120k income with 240k in student loans; employer offers no 401k,"Hi

I graduated from a professional graduate school about a year ago and took a ~120k salary job that offers no 401k. So it's been almost a year since I started working here and I still have about 240k in student loan debt (120k in private with 4.9% interest rate and 120k in federal with interest rate ranging from 3.1~6.9%). 

I've been paying down my student loan aggresively for the past few months (about total monthly payment of 5k) and was wondering if there is any ""good"" way that I can start investing for retirement. Many people have recommended me about Roth IRA but the thing is I've worked so much overtime this year that I will not be eligible for Roth IRA. 

Also, should I just keep paying down my student loans aggressively or start investing a small portion of my salary?",finance
personalfinance,Need advice on home refi,"Hello PF,

I've been lurking here on my main account for about year now which has help me realize that I have made some poor financial decisions. My parents were basically poor and never taught me or spoke of any sound financial advice growing up. Same applies to my wife. I'm not blaming them for my poor decisions and CC debt as I know i'm 100% responsible for my choices. It was when I was 20 years old in the Army attending a Dave Ramsey presentation that I realized how financially illiterate I am. 

I'm 25 now and I bring home roughly $4,100 a month. I have 19k in credit card debt ranging over 5 different credit cards which are all basically maxed out, most with pretty high interest rates. That takes up $600 a month if I'm paying just the minimum payments. 

I have a mortgage balance of $211,700 on a home that I closed on just a year ago. That monthly payment is $1443 with taxes and insurance included. Its a 30 year VA loan with fixed interest rate of 3.75. 

My wife is not on the mortgage with me and I do not plan on adding her to the refi cause of her student loans and even worse credit than me. We basically live pay check to pay check with hardly nothing in the savings account. We have separate bank accounts and split the bills but I make more so I pay more. We get the bills paid, food on the table, and have never been late on anything ever. There's just no cushion room for savings or extra payments. We are currently not on a budget, which I'm realizing is probably our biggest problem. 

I've recently began to explore the options of using the equity in my home to help consolidate all my credit card debt. There's multiple homes in the same subdivision as me that are slightly smaller and older that have sold in the last 12 months for $240k. I originally purchased my home for $215k. I'm estimating my homes value would be high enough for me to be able to get all of my debt consolidated. Obviously it's just an estimate on my part and all of this is really up to the appraisal. 

I did a loan inquiry with a company I saw on TV, not sure if I'm allowed to say there name here but they got some mixed reviews on the internet. They told me they would be able to consolidate all my CC debt in to a new loan of $240,000 (if the home appraises of course) at an interest rate of 4.75 for a total monthly payment of $1704 for 30 years. They also told me something about if I chose a 5.25 rate they would be able to give me back $4800 and I'd also receive all the money in my current escrow account which would be able to jump start a new savings account for us. I think going from 3.75 rate to a 4.75 or even 5.25 rate is not a good idea. 


Also, I apologize if I haven't given enough information or too much pointless information for advice. And help would be appreciated. 

Edit: adding some more info I think might be relevant.
Lender told me they would pay for appraisal and I would have zero out of pocket costs. Also, this is a single family home, primary residence, and first mortgage. 


TLDR: want to consolidate 19k in CC debt. Have $211,700 mortgage balance on one year old home and I THINK it may be valued at around $230k - $240k range.",finance

personalfinance,Considering cashing out my annuity and question on taxes.,"Live in California. Married with 1 child. Wife has been off work since having the baby (beginning of March). 

First question, with my wife not working (probably through the rest of the year) and a baby, what should I claim for dependants? Right now I'm claiming 1 but am unsure how my wife not working will affect us come tax season. I'm expecting to make somewhere in the 50k range, due to taking time off for the baby, and 2 different deaths in the family. My goal is to just not owe anything come tax season, at minimum. 

Through my union I get money per hour put into an annuity for me, which I will receive as a lump sum when I retire or leave the union. If I cash it out early I will be taxed at 32%, as opposed to 20% if I wait until retirement. I'm also considering cashing out the cash value on my life insurance, but am unsure what penalties I would get from that, tax or otherwise. 

Short term, cashing it out would allow us to put a decent debt into our debt, saving us money going towards interest. 

Long term that would take away from retirement but that is 35+ years off so my feeling is that I have plenty of time to be adding back to it (the rate per hour just went up 90 cents so that'll be a big boost) and getting the debt under control and knocking off money being wasted on interest will help in both the short and long term. The biggest negative I can think of is getting hit with the 12% extra in taxes, but that's better than the interest rate on a lot of our debt. 

Im at work on break right now so I don't have the exact numbers in front of me but doing this will pay off about a third of our debt, with most of what will be left being our 2 car payments that are at pretty decent interest rates. 

Any advice or thoughts on this would be very highly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,My parents are thinking about giving me 10k to pay off a student loan so that I can pay them back at a lower payment with no interest...what's the best way to go about this?,"Hi everyone,

I have a $10k private student loan that's costing me a little over $300/month. It's my second biggest expense after rent and probably the biggest source of stress every month.

My parents have floated the idea of paying it off for me, and letting me pay them back with no interest, at a lower monthly payment (not yet determined, but even a payment to them of $200/month would help). I also have a government student loan of about $47k that I'm paying about $80/month through REPAYE.

I'm curious about a couple of things:

1) If we decide to go this route, where might this fall in terms of gift-giving and paying taxes on that?

2) Is there any reason NOT to do this? Would the money make more sense going towards the federal loan for any reason? 

3) This might sound nuts, but I want to make the best choice: I've been able to afford the loan for a few years now, though it does keep money tight. Does this money make more sense going into some kind of investment account where I can use the interest made to go towards the payment? Effectively some kind of discount where I the 10k stays generally safe? If that's even a possibility, would it ever equal the savings on interest from just paying it off completely?

4) What things should I tell my parents to look into before they decide to pay this off? (Tax implications for them, etc.)

To me this seems like a no-brainer but I'm by no means a financial pro and I understand there are probably several things I'm not considering.

If anyone needs more info on the loans to give me any advice I'm happy to provide it. Thanks in advance for any help!",finance

personalfinance,Planning for Student Loans (&amp; Taxes 2017),"I have $217k in consolidated federal student loans @ 7.4% interest. I am employed in a qualifying PSLF position on an IBR plan and looking forward to loan forgiveness in, approximately, 6 years. I recently got married (2017 tax year) and am looking for suggestions about how to structure tax filing to minimize payouts (both student loans and taxes).

So here's the breakdown of finances -
I will earn approx. $65k in 2017
Spouse will earn approx. $33k in 2017

I have a standard IRA.
I am covered by a qualifying employer health plan for IRA purposes.
I don't know if spouse's retirement plan is qualifying for IRA rules, but I assume it is. (She makes well below the income limit so it it hasn't mattered to her to look into the income limit rule for qualifying plans, yet).

I easily reach the yearly student loan interest amount for taxes each year. Spouse has no student loans.

Those are our only two deductions.

Currently, I pay $400 per month in student loans.

I know that to minimize my student loan payments and taxes as a single person, I have to fully-fund my IRA (as much as I can...last year I could only contribute $1,200 before hitting the deduction limit) as well as take the standard deduction and the educational interest deduction. That will allow me to use the IRS link to myfedloan, which results in a lower monthly student loan payment than when the Dept of Edu is allowed to calculate my annual income. (My assumption is that is because the IRS actually applies deductions correctly...).

How do I do this now that I'm married?

I'm not sure whether it is better to file jointly or individually. I have some flexibility in how much money I take in this year. Minimum is about $65k, but could, potentially, go up to near $70k, if I sell back all my leave time. 

Based on what I've read and using the [FedLoan Estimator](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans#estimator), using only the standard deduction, it looks like my student loan payments would be around $482 per month if we file jointly and $402 if we file individually. I have never found the estimator to be close to accurate, but I assume that what it's really telling me is that married filing jointly will result in me paying about $100 more per month than married filing separately. That amounts to $1,200 a year or so. 

If I understand the [IRA contribution limits correctly](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/ira-contribution-limits/), we'd have to file jointly to receive the IRA deduction, correct? (And, assuming we make under $99k, that would be a full ($11000) deduction?)

If I understand the [IRS Publication 970](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch04.html) student loan interest would not be deductible unless we were filing jointly, too, right?

personalfinance,"Husband and father, 26 yrs - wife is 23, BIG changes coming up..advice?","Ok, so here is the situation:

I'm 26, like the title says, my wife is 23, and at the moment we're both students at a 4-year university. I am just about to graduate in Decemberwith two degrees: a BS in Economics (Econometrics) and French Studies. My wife is going to graduate in about 2.5 years with a MDT (Music, Dance, Theater) degree. We have an 8 month-old. He wasn't expected, but he was/is perfect and we love him to death. 

I was offered a job contingent upon graduation at a tech startup doing analytics consulting. Pay is ~$50k with bonuses, full benefits, unlimited PTO, and a great location to boot (in-between our house and the university). I love the company and am excited to get started. According to the job market in my area, that's right where I want to be right after college. Right now, I'm working as a research assistant to a PhD Economist. It pulls in around ~$600 monthly, and my wife doesn't work because of baby and her school workload. We're both currently in school full-time and will be until December (at least for me). Our son is taken care of; both of our immediate families live within 10 minutes of us, so we are extremely blessed.

So there's the background info. Here's the finance part:

All in all (excluding student debt) we have around $30k in stupid debt (car loan, CC, medical, etc). For student debt, we're currently sitting at around $50k. We have conceived a plan on how we're going to get out, and I wanted to run it past the subreddit for your input!

The plan:

Upon graduation, I am going to start working. I should be pulling in around $3.2k after everything monthly (I think). My wife will start a new semester. What we thought would be a good idea is for her to take out a student loan to finance her a schooling and have my entire salary go to paying off the stupid debt (the interest rates are murder - way worse than the student loans). Once ALL of it is gone, then we won't take out anymore student loans. We currently take care of my grandmas house while she's gone and only pay around $450 a month in rent. I'll save a bunch of my income monthly, and whittle away at the student debt until we are both graduated and able to put more money to it every month. The kicker, though, is that I would like to pursue higher education in the form of a MSA (Master of Science in Analytics). The program cost is about $50k. Ideally, since it's an online program, I would like to start the MSA program after my undergrads and take out student loans to finance that, all while working full time and putting my salary to the stupid debt before attacking the student debt. 

The question:

Is this a good idea? Do you think there are better alternatives? Give me your advice/opinion!",finance

personalfinance,Health insurance premium isn't being deducted from my paycheck.,"Hey everyone, ok so this one isn’t all that dramatic, I just don’t understand health insurance as well as I’d like and I’m trying to do things in the proper order so I don’t potentially hang myself out to dry...or commit fraud I guess. Sorry for the length and let me know if this isn't enough info. 

I started working at a new company in January, and my benefits kicked in in March. I signed up for the company’s HRA health plan along with Dental, vision, life, etc (just in time for me to turn 26. Thank my lucky stars). 

The total per-pay period cost is $70.10, of which the company pays $68.18. The $2.00 difference is important.

Now with the HRA, my deductible is high, $3000 but I also get a debit card that has $1500 on it provided by the company that I can use for any deductible-related expenses. Those doing the math may notice that $68.18 over a 22-week period is $1500. I’m not sure if this is a coincidence or not. Are they paying my premium AND 50% of my deductible??

Ok, health insurance talk and numbers are basically out of the way, but that was important.

Now I’ve been on the insurance plan for ~4 months, I signed the papers, and have the Debit and ID cards, and haven’t had a single deduction from my paychecks besides my 401k which I signed up for at the same time and it's been going for months. At first I thought it might take a month or so to show up on my paycheck, but that time has come and gone.

So my first plan was go to HR and ask what’s up, but based on a lot of stories I read here and similar subs, I have a pretty strong inherent distrust of HR and avoid them when possible. My main concern is they’re going to go “Oh would you look at that, we goofed. You owe us $XXX for months of not paying your insurance” or something like that, and I can’t afford a potential multi-hundred dollar hit like that all at once on top of my school loans.

Do I say nothing and accept my fortunate circumstances (Is that fraud? Lawyer, Facebook, Gym?) or is there nothing wrong? Should I budget for a pretty substantial financial hit and a new deduction from my future paychecks? What about that $2.00 difference between total cost and what they cover? And why are they covering what seems like both my premium and 50% of my deductible with that $1500 card?

TL;DR On company HRA plan, no deductions from paycheck even though the premium they cover is $2.00/pay period short of the total cost. Also other things. What do?",finance

Dad's loans will be paid out in 10 years, but my mother's loans are currently on the Extended Fixed plan, which is crippling me with $857/month alone. And because it's Parent PLUS, it's not eligible for Income-Based Repayment (but is for Income-Contingent Repayment).

Kansas communities, schools, and families depend upon internet access for news, commerce, communication and information. I appreciate knowing your thoughts about the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) 2015 “Open Internet Order,” also known as the network neutrality order.
 
As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which oversees FCC functions, I am particularly interested in ensuring a fair regulatory environment for all internet actors.  I believe the federal government must ensure a fair and open internet that is not blocked or slowed and I agree that individual websites or online services should not be discriminated against. 
 
However, I do not agree with the FCC’s 2015 “Open Internet Order,” which abruptly decided, on a partisan vote, to apply outdated, utility-style regulations to the internet.  This inappropriate regulatory framework was intended for monopolistic telephone companies in the 1930s.  Instead of leaving the internet vulnerable to the consistent threat of interpretation and change by a group of unelected FCC commissioners, Congress should craft bipartisan legislation that preserves a fair and open internet. If the FCC reclassifies internet service providers, legislation passed by Congress will make policies governing the internet transparent and consistent; rather than subject to change from one administration to the next.  This is an issue of great importance that requires a thoughtful, transparent debate on the best path forward.
 
I am grateful for the opportunity Kansans have given me to serve them in the United States Senate. If you are interested in learning more about my efforts on your behalf, I encourage you to visit moran.senate.gov. Please let me know if I can be of service to you or your family in the future.

As for my accounts, I have around $1,600 in my checking account and around $11,000 in a savings account with 1.15% interest.

Side note: all of my student load interest rates are under 5%, with the exception of one that is at 6.4%.

Seeing as how I already have $11k in my savings as an e-fund, should I reduce Savings to pay more aggressively on Student Loans? I also want to save as I own my car now but it is at 180K miles and would like to buy a newer used car for around $6k-7k next summer.

personalfinance,"Father invested in property in 06, should he get out? How?","My hard working dad invested in a property right at the peak of the market, in 06, as a form of retirement savings.

I don't have the specifics on what remains on his mortgage and home equity loan he took out at the time to finance this investment property, but he easily has 5-6 more years of payments if I'm not mistaken.

He's a small business owner and an immigrant to the US, so he didn't understand investing in markets at the time. He had sold his first business and had a large amount of cash and wanted to make sure it would grow, so he thought real estate investing was the right way to go.

Anyways, the property is a combination of residential and commercial units. 2 of the 3 commercial units have been vacant since 09-10 with the exception of two years in which one of the two units was leased. The 3 residential units have been fully occupied pretty much always with the occasional month or two between tenants moving out.

He has had the whole investment property for sale on the market for quite some time, but he has his price set pretty high, close to his original purchase price, so as to not take a loss. He hasn't had many inquiries about it though. The market in the area has remained pretty low in price, comparable to the pre-boom market prices according to zillow, or about half the price he paid for this property at the time.

personalfinance,"Case Study - 45K in savings, 68K in student loans - What should we do?","QUESTION: How we should be allocating our money?

My husband and I recently got married about 8 months ago. We’re slowly trying to figure things out but we’ve had no real strategy with personal finance the past year or any order to the money madness. I’m doing tons of reading and I want to be smarter about how we allocate our money.

Summary: We have 45K in savings with a 68K of student loans and wanting to buy a house in Austin Texas. Starting to invest and figure out how best to make our money work for us.

Life Situation: Recently married and filing married/joint no kids– Austin Texas

Combined Adjusted Gross Income: $7,200 monthly (after taxes, 5% in 401K – company match, HSA, etc)

Debt – Student Loans: $68,000 in student loans at 4.625% through SoFi (It was at 98K 18 months ago) – no other debt aside from student loans

Savings: $45,000 in a money market at 1% - initially for a down payment

Current Monthly Expenses: Student Loan Repayment: $2,400 (goal to pay off in 2.5 years) Apartment Leasing - $1200 monthly (will be around $900 in 4 months if we don't buy, we currently have a 2/2 and looking into 1/1) Other living expense (utilities/insurance/bills/groceries/etc) -$1600 Savings: $2,000

My question is: How should we approach this? Pay off loans first? Buy a house and while paying-off student loans? Forget the house and just use our 45K of savings to pay off a large portion of our student loans? I realize it would be more strategic and logical if we were to apply some simple math but I’m not sure what sorts rules, formulas or comparison I should be making (interest rates of mortgage rate vs loan rates vs current rent??).

We want to buy a house because housing in Austin has skyrocketed in the past 4-5 years and I think it’s going to continue climbing along with interest rates. We're planning to live here for a long time since both of our families live here. Mortgage rate around 4% (we have great credit score)

personalfinance,Sallie Mae Lower Monthly Payment Plan?,"So I called Sallie Mae today because I wanted to see if there was something I can do about my $900 a month student loan bill. I've set up my federal student loans on an income-driven monthly repayment plan. It has given me about $100 extra a month to put towards other loans, medical bills, rent, etc. and I wanted to see if Sallie Mae had similar options. 


Anyways, I called Sallie Mae today to see if there was anything they can do about my super high monthly bill. The customer service agent that I spoke to told me that because my account is current on what I owe that there is nothing that they can do about it right now. So I asked them in what cases are there ways to lower your monthly payment? He said for accounts where it is clear that the borrower cannot pay their regular payments, only then Sallie Mae can try and set up something similar to lower monthly payments for the account - very vague and would not give me specifics. 


It seemed really weird that he wouldn't give me a direct answer unless my account was negative, so I'm asking here – do you think it's worth it to be late on several of my payments, call Sallie Mae back, tell them that I cannot make the payments they are currently offering at all without going into default, and seeing what they can do for me? I don't know why they wouldn't disclose the options available to me now, I tried to tell them I was trying to be proactive but obviously they didn't want to tell me what options there were for lower monthly payments.

I've busted my ass working crap jobs and adding to my repertoire of skills because I realize far too late: WTF do I do with a degree in Photography?! Any-who I'll get right into specifics.

I make 44k/yr (gross) now. My monthly net pay is $2608. 
I have a car payment, insurance, and monthly expenses that total $616.64. (This includes student loans as of rn)
I currently owe $44,453.16 in student loans. 

I was on a forbearance for quite some time as I was unemployed and then I was on income driven repayment plan which amounted to $0/mo as I was making less than $10k/yr which ended in about April. I then started paying the full monthly payments ($464.66) up until this upcoming payment due Aug 1st which I reapplied for the income driven repayment and my monthly payments are now $51.43 with Aug 1st as the first payment with this new amount. My mom suggested I refinance for a lower interest rate.  

I've put down a deposit and first month's rent on an apartment where my rent will be $750/mo. I'm unsure of the cost of our utilities, but I originally calculated the highest amount for utilities and still had money left over. I live in Connecticut, no cable, gas heat and internet is provided. We are responsible for electricity and heat/hot water.

Right now I have $787 in my bank account. Only because I wrote a check for the deposit and my roommate owes me $900 still. By Friday I should have both my paycheck and my roommate paying me back so I should have about $2300. I've just paid all of my bills for the month so by the time I move in I should have roughly almost $3,000. I get paid weekly btw. 

I'm a bit anxious because I've never had so many bills before, but I've also never made this much money. I am still frugal, but like to live comfortably and enjoy life. I like to see money in my account and only spend when I can, but still saving each month. Please be honest with me, I'm nervous that I'm getting ahead of myself by taking on all of these new great things (that I really want) but I don't want to fall flat on my face. Either way I have a great family who is supportive, but I want to be responsible with money. Am I doing ok?",finance
personalfinance,"Based on my calculations, I'm paying too much in taxes (25% on $35,360 salary). Should I set up automatic withholdings to correct this issue, or just wait till April?","As the title says, I have a quick question about taxes. I make $35,360/yr ($17/hr). I'm currently paying 25% tax on that income, calculated as YTD withholdings (excluding health insurance and FSA) / YTD earnings. That rate seems quite high. I'm disappointed, because I quit grad school (where I was making $25,500 a year before taxes) but somehow even though my pay is nominally $10,000 higher with my new job, my paychecks are _the same size_. Even after accounting for my higher health insurance premium, something seems off.

I know it's possible to specify a set withholding on each paycheck and settle it in April, but my question is how to go about doing that. 

My calculations are below. I know tax brackets are marginal, so
for federal:
$9,275 * 10% + ($35,360 - $9275)* 15% = $4840.25 per year for federal income tax

and for Oregon:
$3,350 * 5% + (35,360 - 3,350) * 7% = $2408.2 for state income tax

These two figures sum to $7248.45, which is 20.5% of my yearly income. That's less than 25%. Am I forgetting something? Social security? Or am I correct in calculating that I'm being taxed at the wrong rate?

If my calculations are correct, should I set it up so they withhold $7248.45 / 24 paychecks = $302/check ? At the end of the year, with deductions, I should still get a modest windfall. Is this correct, or did I drop a stitch along the way? Thanks in advance.


By the way, I've been lurking this sub for a while and I LOVE it. Since I began lurking I've made a budget, started putting money away for an emergency, and started paying my student loans down systematically using the avalanche method. So -- thanks for everything, and I hope you guys can help with this question.

personalfinance,"How To Double Your Money Every Decade Without Doing Anything - A ""Rule of 72"" Primer","Sound too good to be true? Mathematically, it’s not! This is essentially a basic lesson on compounding interest and what many refer to as the rule of 72. Of course, this post is just an overview and introduction and isn’t a guaranteed or professional source of financial advice. 

**WHAT IS THE RULE OF 72?**

The Rule of 72 is basically a shortcut to approximate compounding interest, which posits that with only a few reasonable assumptions made, you can consistently double your money nearly every ten years. Let’s explore a bit.

The way the rule of 72 works is that dividing the number 72 by your interest rate, you can arrive at the number of years it will take for an untouched monetary investment to double. So for example, at 6% interest, your money will double after 72/6 years, or 12 years. At 7.2% interest, you arrive at 10 years. The rule of 72 can even be used to approximate inflation: if you leave your money in a savings account for 10 years, and inflation is 2%, it will take 72/2, or 36 years, for your money to lose half of its value. 

This is why it is very important to invest money rather than leaving tons of liquid money in bank accounts not accruing interest. A $20,000 investment now, at a 7.2% interest rate, is $40,000 in 10 years. A $20,000 sum of money in your bank account decreases annually with inflation rates, leaving you 10 years later with $20,000 that has the modern day buying power of about $17,000 give or take. So as you can see pretty plainly, it’s important to place your money in interest-accruing investments, and leaving large sums of money sitting in a savings account is doing you no favors. Not just that, but now you’re armed with the rule of 72 which is super simple to understand and implement. Now the more important thing to explore is how do we do this?

**STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLE INVESTING**

If you’re in the U.S. and not in the need of liquidity, the 401k or Roth IRA might be right for you. If you want to learn the basics of those retirement vehicles, there are tons of resources on this sub and throughout the web in article, blog, and podcast form. More commonly though, I hear people say they need liquidity for one reason for another. I constantly hear my friends say they are saving for a house so they leave cash sitting in their bank accounts, but when I ask them when they plan to buy, it’s usually a one or two or three year trajectory. Of course, if you’re planning to make a large purchase in the next few days or weeks, it may make sense to leave cash in your bank accounts. If you’re already very wealthy, and expecting a crash soon, and looking to preserve your wealth, I could understand this line of thinking as well, but you probably don’t need to be reading this post!

For nearly anyone else, you need a place to invest, whether it’s for two years or twenty. Outside of retirement vehicles, there are a few main ways to invest relatively safely.

The first is to open an ETF, or exchange traded fund, with a firm such as Vanguard or Fidelity. An ETF tracks an index, a commodity, or bonds, but trades similarly to stocks. One big advantage of an ETF is that they are actually quite liquid, able to be sold and converted on the spot and available as spending money within 3-5 business days in most cases. They also have lower fees than mutual funds and many other forms of investing, meaning you aren’t going to be dinged with hefty fees that cut into your investment gains. 

There are many ways to go deeper into different types of ETFs and exactly how they work, but suffice to say you can quite easily hold a brokerage account with a firm such as Vanguard that includes indexed stocks and bonds, both domestic and international, so you are able to allocate funds in a manner that best suits your investment timelines and risk tolerances. Focusing on bonds will keep your interest rate lower, meaning it will take longer to double your money, but the bonds are less likely to be too heavily influenced by the state of the economy, and will not tank out in a recession in quite the way stocks would. If you’re younger, with a long investment timeline, you may be more able to take on the risk of U.S. and international stock and enjoy the long term year-over-year gains, perhaps doubling your money faster than every ten years.

Another example is to invest in mutual funds, which pool the funds of many investors get managed by individuals who invest those funds in an effort to produce capital gains for themselves and the investors involved in the mutual fund. Again, there are many varieties, including exchange-traded mutual funds which in a way combines ETFs and mutual funds to trade like an ETF, with lower fees than mutual funds, in some manner providing the best of both worlds to individual investors who aren’t placing 6+ figure investments. 

**DOES THIS ACTUALLY BEAT 7.2% RELIABLY?**

How often do these types of investment vehicles beat our needed 7.2% annually to double investments every decade? Let’s look at the S&amp;P 500, which is an American stock market index of 500 large companies. Since the year 2000, investments mirroring the S&amp;P 500 has passed 7.2% in 10 of the past 17 years. 7 of those 10 years nearly doubled or more than doubled 7.2%. In 2003, 2009, and 2013, returns were over 26%. Only 4 of those years were negative, with one notable crash in 2008. So without doing any work, if you simply invest in an S&amp;P 500 index fund -- which is provided by many of the main firms named such as Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, and others -- you are historically likely to make short-term gains and highly likely to make long-term gains even outpacing our 7.2% baseline for doubling your income.

Of course, no investment is risk-free, and there is always the chance that you hope to buy a house and your investments are in the red several years in a row as the S&amp;P 500 was from 2000 to 2002, leaving you behind your original investment, but barring crashes and down markets, this is a tried-and-true, time-tested way to turn money into a lot more money essentially without lifting a finger.",finance

I know that taxes will be reported as 1099-INT and be paid on the interest earned but we both think it would be far more worthwhile to move this money into a retirement account where it has potential to see significantly more return over 30 years than ~1.5% interest until full maturity (9 more years) and then moving to a retirement vehicle.

personalfinance,Flowchart and Student Loans,"Hi PF,
I'm loving the flowchart, but have a clarifying question with respect to student loans. I'm at the part of the chart that reads ""Do you have any moderate interest debt?""

I have four loans:

* Sallie Mae $32K @ 3% VAR, paying interest only while I'm still in school ($77) but it will go up to $400 in 2020 - 7 year term

* AES $11K @ 4.5% VAR, paying in full, $285 min, paying $500 - 10 year term

* Federal Direct $20K @ 6% FIX, funds haven't been disbursed yet - 25 year

* Federal PLUS $22K @ 7% FIX, funds haven't been disbursed yet - 25 year

In the context of the flow chart, avalanche, and snowball methods, is there any thought given to the risk of the liability? I could see an argument for paying off the variable rate loans before the fixed rate loans as a reduction of risk to make sure that I'm insulated from any rapid increases of interest rates. I might pay a little more in the long run, but would that make sense to do?

Thanks!

Additionally, I'll likely be living far from work, and California allows the use of HOV lanes for electric/plug-in hybrid vehicles. I value my time, so cutting down my time spent stuck in traffic would be worth a reasonable increase in car expenses for this budget.

Loans don't go into repayment until March or so. Due to this, I'm considering spending the first several months of this new budget building up my emergency fund (to about $9500), as well as making a few major purchases that I consider important (specifically, a new bed and a more work-appropriate wardrobe). 

Once the loans are paid off (in 2022 or so, hopefully sooner if the refi makes sense), the $1700 allocation for loans would go into investing for retirement. Is there anything I should be doing earlier than that?

personalfinance,Loans against ... to buy a house,"I am 23 years old. I may want to buy a house in 5, 10, 15 years... 
I max out my IRA, and contribute for a full match to any 401k match. 
I use extra savings to invest outside of these mechanisms.
I have recently learned of 529 plans and their tax-advantaged status. I really like this, especially in comparison to capital gains taxes, and looking at the power of invested money over time.

Knowing that at some point, I will likely both buy a house, and pay education expenses again (mba for self or future kids college): Should I put money into a 529, in my own name (switch to future kid's name if MBA doesn't happen), rather than invest extra cash on my own and pay capital gains taxes. 

I know that the principal behind roth IRAs can be withdrawn without fee. There is also (generally/always?) a first-time homeowner allowance of $10,000. Is it difficult to take a loan against 401ks and 529 plans for a house? Say 10 years in the future? In addition to a mortgage. Would adding the collateral of these help get a better interest rate on the mortgage?


I know this is a lot of questions. Please correct me if I am wrong, and let me know your thoughts or the rules as you understand them. Thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my balance before applying for a second credit card?,"So, I have two bank accounts, a checking and savings with Apple FCU, and a checking and credit with Bank of America. All my money I make goes to my Apple account and I currently have the rewards credit card with Bank of America, which had for about a year now.  I also have federal student loans of course, which I don't have to pay off yet (I do occasionally pay off the interest though). My FICO score is at 731.

It has a balance of about $260 (which will go down to $160, once my money from my other bank transfer over). Since I have no interest on my credit card, I usually just pay it off slowly. I make roughly around $350 a week, which $200 goes into my savings, and $100 goes to my credit card, $50 for food and misc. 

I am planning to apply for Bank of America's travel rewards card because of its sign up bonus, which will be useful as I am studying abroad to Japan in the spring time and some money off that plane ticket would be nice. I'm planning to charge my tuition money to my credit card to get the bonus, then immediately pay it off from the money in my Apple account, then afterwards, just keeping my balance to a minimum (I usually am around $200~300 a month, which I pay off of course).

Should I just apply for the credit card right now? Or should I wait till I pay off my current balance?

personalfinance,I owe the IRS 14k in student loan debt and scared to death,"r/personalfinance, you're the only people that can talk some sense into me. Please tell me what I need to do. 

Here's the situation. 

I live in the US and applied for a 4 year state university in the state I live in. I went for fall term, and applied for fafsa in the winter. Because I was young and didn't think about the consequences of my actions, I never finished the remaining paperwork. I continue on for the rest of the winter and spring term before deciding I needed to get a job to pay for school. 

I started a minimum wage job and try to make a living, only to find myself barely scraping by. I move in with a roommate, and continue working for the next two years with an open balance at my university. 

Due to my job, I have a variable income job paid by commissions. After two years, I hadn't paid a dollar back because we were barely squeaking by as it was. I have, however, paid my taxes on this revenue. 

Today, I get the mail to find a letter from the State Revenue Service stating I owe the 10k balance, 1.5k in late fees, and 2.5k in interest. 

At this point I'm freaking out because I have no idea how to pay for this. I had to use my credit card a lot these last few months, and between this hitting collections and my credit usage, my credit score has dipped into the low 600's.

What can I do to get out of this? I doubt I can get approved for a loan, and it sounds like I need to quit my current job and get two jobs to pay for all this. Hopefully, with this method, I could clear it out in 2.5 years. 

What are your recommendations? I'm terrified, and I need help.

Edit: now that I've cleared my head, I've fixed a few things. I paid my taxes on the income I took in. My student loan paperwork was never completed, resulting in an open balance at the college, which they sent to the STATE revenue service, not Federal. Corrected that in my post.",finance

personalfinance,"Seeking advise, ideas and information for investing 200k","For starters I want to say I will be using a Financial advisor from a scholarship foundation I am apart of. Before getting the advice from them I just wanted to get some ideas of what people would do in the situation or suggest as I'm always open to taking in information. 

My situation is I have been fortunate enough to acquire 200k. I don't have any plans or need to use any of this money anytime soon as I have steady income for the rest of my life(medically retired/disabled Veteran), my savings, along with currently attending school which also pays housing allowance(only 36months). 

My current income is around 4k a month without working. I have 0 debt, don't need another vehicle or housing, I do have a 1 year old child(custody), I am 26 years old and unmarried. 

The type of advice or ideas I was hoping to hear is what should be done with 200k that you don't actually need to spend anytime soon. My cost of living along with my daughters is taken care of between my monthly income and what I have prior to the 200k so no current expenses or needs should be taken into account. 

I will eventually enter the workforce after college so with hoping that no unforeseen costly emergency happens(although I do have tricare for life), I should continue to never need to touch the 200k or whatever it increases to over the years and have more outside income to add to whatever investment methods. 

I am thinking long term/growth of the money BUT I'd say until the age 45-50 not 65 as most would say, if thinking that far along, for trying to live off it(plus I will still have medical retirement). 

I have been researching on my own the last few weeks doing similar google searches to my topic and looking into different methods of investment, prior to this I was going to be satisfied with finding the highest interest rate CD account with depositing 1k a month into it, as all I've ever heard financial advise wise was ""stick your money in a savings account"", until I realized how many other opportunities there are out there.",finance
Economics,Question about federal funds rate,[removed],finance
personalfinance,Need advice on which pension investment option to choose,"Hi Everyone, my company is giving us an option on how our pension savings are invested. 

&gt;Currently, my pension benefits are determined under the Cash Balance Pension formula. Your pension benefit grows at a pre-determined interest rate based on the 30-year US Treasury securities interest rate, with a 3% per year minimum and a 9% per year maximum. Interest is applied quarterly to your account. Once you begin to collect your pension benefit, your compensation credits and your interest credits end. There is no more growth in your pension benefit.

This means that there could be less of an upside on your earnings potential compared to the Defined Contribution Pension formula, but you assume no investment risk. The Company pays all investment management fees. When I ""retire"" or leave the company I could roll over the cash balance to a IRA. This option is the only one that includes a choice to receive an annuity with lifetime payments instead of a lump sum payment – meaning guaranteed income for life.

&gt;We are being offered a one-time opportunity to transfer into the Defined Contribution Pension formula in Vangaurd. This is additional/separate to the 401k that Vangaurd administers. I decide how to invest my pension benefit and the final amount I receive depends on how well your investments perform. The return on the funds you select determines whether the value of your benefit goes up, down or stays the same. I am responsible for my investment choices.Once I leave employment, my compensation credits end. However, my remaining account balance may grow, decrease or stay the same depending on how my investment choices perform.

This means that there could be a greater earnings potential compared to the Cash Balance Pension formula, but I also assume the investment risk. I pay investment management fees from the assets in my account. Fees vary by fund. If I retire early then the account can continue to grow. This option doesn’t offer annuities with lifetime payments.

The company does provide a modeling tool but generally speaking should I stay in the cash balance and diversify my retirement investments? Does this allow my 401k portfolio to be a little more risky? 

Appreciate any thoughts, suggestions, or tips to model these scenarios.",finance

personalfinance,Thinking of Consolidating My Debt...Need Advice,"Hi all,

Last night I spoke to a debt specialist at National Debt Relief. I would like some more input if this is a good idea for me. A little background:

I have about $16,000 worth of credit card debt spread over 4 cards. I was basically young and dumb and had a hard time getting a job out of college. I did only have one card, I decided to try and move my balance to a 0 interest card, was approved and it wasn't for the full amount of my debt so I could only move a small amount. I stupidly did this more than once and my credit score took a hit since I didn't know that even applying for a card made it go down.
I am actually slowly dwindling my debt this way but there is no way I can actually pay off the 0% cards by the time that rate is done. *Quick side question: When the 0% rate ends, do I just start paying interest from there or am I hit with all the interest I didn't pay that year?*

Anyways, here is what the debt consolidator told me:
*National Debt Relief is 100% compliant with the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) and we charge no upfront fees whatsoever. Our fee is already factored into your monthly payment and can only be collected once a settlement is reached, you agree to the terms of the settlement, and the creditor receives a payment.
 
We are members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFCC (American Fair Credit Council.)
 
We are also accredited with and have an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau.
In this program, your monthly payment drafts into an FDIC-insured savings account which is established in your name. As the funds are accumulating each month, we are negotiating with your creditors and settling the accounts for approximately 50 % of what you owe.
Based on your total amount of debt of $16165 you may qualify for a 33 month program with a program payment of $377 per month. There are no prepayment penalties so you can always add additional funds to expedite the process of the program*

I think this would be slightly more than I am paying towards my debt right now but I think I can manage. She is estimating I can pay it off in about 33 months instead of more than double that. What do you think? 

My major concerns are:
1. Is this a scam? I did research on here and google and it seems like other people have had positive experiences.
2. She mentioned my credit score would take a hit at first but as I start paying off the debt it should start rising again. 
3. Are their any hidden fees or agendas? She said they will take a fee from me, but its after they negotiate with the credit companies to lower my debt and would be worked into my payments. All these numbers include that fee.

Sorry about being so long winded. Should I do it? I really want to get this debt paid off!!!",finance

I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on the best way to approach this, and what would make the most sense.

Our monthly income is $3,775.

Our monthly bills are as follows:

Mortgage: $1374.61

HOA: $41

Student Loans: $599.31 (*There is one loan payment not included in this figure and that is going into default. Total owed on student loans is $86, 217.82)

Cell Phones: $172.23 (*This is for 3 phones, plus we owe $411.62 on one phone and that is included in the payment at $21.67/month)

Internet: $75

Electric: $160

Gas: $25

Water: $165 (*We are billed for 2 months at a time.)

Car Insurance: $47 (*We own both of our vehicles, and have liability only as of right now.)

Credit Cards: $58 (*This is for two cards, total owed $2,295.65)

Credit Cards: $98 (*This is for two cards, total owed $3,551.96)

HBO: $14.99 (*I'm canceling this before the next payment since it's an unnecessary expense.)

Gymnastics for one of our kids: $45.00

TOTAL: $2,875.14

Those are our current monthly expenses. However, that excludes groceries which we generally spend $400-700/month on. That's to feed four people and also includes everything - food, toiletries, etc. We are doing our best to cut back in that area as much as possible right now. And we have two kids, so we have a lot of random expenses throughout the year (school supplies, clothes, field trip fees, school pictures, etc).

We have ZERO savings.

Now, I'd like to break down the student loans a little bit and hopefully someone smarter than me can give me some advice on tackling this mess.

Loan 1: $8,749.23  Interest: 12.25%

Loan 2: $13,192.59 Interest: 14.125%

Loan 3: $8,928.65 Interest: 5.5%

Loan 4: $10,866.29 Interest: 5.5%

Loan 5: $6,135.04 Interest: 5.75%

Loan 6: $5,238.94 Interest: 6.25%

Loan 7: $16, 623.46 Interest: 10% (*This is the loan that is going into default. The payment is $215.15/month. This is through Navient. We have begged, pleaded, done everything we can think of to try and get some sort of help but to no avail. This loan was originally about $8k and we've paid over $12k into it. We just got to a point where we couldn't do it anymore and it's been spiraling out of control unfortunately.)

Loan 8: $16,483.62 Interest: 6.5% (*This loan was on its way to default. However, as of Aug. 1st the interest rate will be dropped to 1% for 15 months - I feel like we should throw every cent we have at this loan while the interest rate is that low.)

What do you think would be the best way to approach this? We really want to start the process of paying things off, somehow establish a savings, and eventually get to have a life of some sort.

Any advice would be MUCH appreciated! Thank you.",finance

**Sell or Rent**

I can take 200k out right now or I can get:

If I sold today I would probably hold on to the $$ for a while then look for other investment opportunities stocks or real estate if prices went down again (less likely pay down 500k mortgage on primary residence)

We're trying to bring these all together in one lower payment to make things a little easier on us financially.  This is my wife's first car loan so the interest rate is rather high (9 or 10% I can't remember), my motorcycle loan, while the interest rate is low, has a balloon payment in a couple of years (thought we would be making money hand over fist and I could pay off sooner but babies happen) and my credit card with an interest rate of 8% is through my CU.

I've spoken to Lightstream's customer service and they say I can't use a debt consolidation loan to pay off the vehicle loans, is that true?  I've read the contrary but thought I'd ask here too.

If this is the case, what are my best options to try and bring this into one payment?",finance

personalfinance,Help Choosing a Mortgage,"Hi Reddit!

I am in the process of buying a condo (my first home, yippee!) and my loan officer gave me some options to chose from for my loan.

A little background:
The property is in a nice community in Gilbert, Arizona. $210k price, 3% down (would have liked to wait and save more before purchasing, but due to other circumstances I had to jump on this now)

Have around 16k in bank now, but get paid bi-weekly with a $100k salary. 

I know the obvious choice is the lowest interest rate, but with only 16k in cash, should I leave more cushion of cash, or do you think with my current salary I will be fine to take the jump?

personalfinance,Taking steps to reduce my debt,"I have been reading alot about personal finance and debt lately, so I just wanted to share some about how I am working toward paying down an excessive amount of credit card debt. Some background, I am 37, husband is 40. We both have good jobs, but neither of us is good with money. I primarily take care of paying the bills every month. Unfortunately, I tend to put ""fun"" things ahead of paying bills first. We currently have around $24k in credit card debt plus 2 personal loans totaling roughly $20k. I recently borrowed some money from my family to get our household bills current. Some of the things I have done to reduce our monthly output is: I called our phone and internet provider and negotiated a cheaper rate (locked in for life). I cancelled our cable and signed up for Sling TV. I switched to a cheaper cell phone plan. I have figured out the minimum we need to live on each month and we will be paying all the extra money to our debts each month. I am also going through items in my house and looking for things to sell. I know that it's going to be a long road, but I think it will be worth it.

Edit to add: Thank you for all the input! Unfortunately, we are not able to get by with less than 2 cars. We live in a rural area and we cannot rely on public transportation (no such thing in my area) and we work in different cities, my commute is about 40 minutes each way and the Mr is about 25 minutes a different way. We do have one car paid off, and are about 2 1/2 years into a 5 year loan on the other. The car payment is a big expense. I thought carefully about how to handle that, but when we purchased the car we had better credit and a got a really low interest rate. At this point, we would not be able to sell the car for what we still owe on the loan so we opted to keep it and continue to make payments. My car is a 2003 and runs well and is well maintained. My Mr just got rid of a 2004 because the engine blew. We are not ones to get new cars often. We opted to get Sling TV and get rid of the cable since that will be one of our only sources of entertainment for awhile and it's inexpensive. Dropping the cable saved us $135/month.

Although, a single finance major from my state university is hard to get a great job with.

personalfinance,[US] Snowballin'! Coming up with a plan to get rid of (and add 1 debt) want some advice.,"So in approximately one month, I will be moving back in with my mom into her house. I have decided that I need to pay off my debts and purchase a home in the near future and this would be the easiest way to do so (plus I get to have my mom cook for me all the time). **My question is, what is the best way out of my ""I have no money and need to get more and yet save and yet try to not live with my mom for the rest of my life"" situation.** Yes yes, get more income I got that. That's what the $25000 student loan is supposed to be for.

So this is my income:

2020 after taxes per month
1980 after 401k loan payment (to be shown at the bottom in debt)

Debts:

Amazon card (26.74%): $1220

Car (9%): $18,880

401k loan 1 (5%): $1,600 (this and the other 401k loan come out of my 
check automatically)

401k loan 2 (5%): $3,358.44

Federal Student Loan: $74,517 (55k and some change with too much interest that has accrued)

New debt incoming:
Private student loan: $25,000

Now I plan to snowball my debts down. Here is how it broke down for me on whatsitcost.com and the order in which it says to pay things down:

1. Amazon-paid off: 12/01/17
2. Car-paid off: 04/01/19
3. 401k 1 paid off: 05/01/19
4. 401k 2 paid off: 09/01/2020

My Federal student loans are $250 right now, but I plan to pay $100 on it and my private student loan even though it's going to be deferred while I'm in school. 

What I plan to do with the rest of my income (just in case you need that):

Medical - $70

Federal loan - $100

Insurance - $117

Electricity - $80

Internet - $100 (guessing...mine is $117 right now)

Savings - $150

Gas - $75

Food - $150 (includes eating out)

Personal student loan -$100

Snowball debt (above) - $800

Should leave me with about $168 of leftover omg what happened cash

Mom wants me to handle the electricity and internet, since I work at home and will ""use up all the damn electricity in the house with your big ass computer"" so I'm fine with that. 

Does this look like a good plan or should I go in another direction? Any tips or hints or whatever will be appreciated. 

Edit: So I don't know if this is planning or budgeting, I figure it's planning so I'ma go with that.",finance

technology,Response from Senator Tillis re Net Neutrality. Can we get some more calls into him?,"&gt; Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts about internet regulation. I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.
&gt; 
&gt; According to industry metrics, private investment in the internet has exceeded $1.5 trillion dollars since 1996, leading to the creation of millions of jobs, economic prosperity, and a society where the accessibility of information is at a level unimaginable merely two or three decades ago.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission voted in secret to reclassify broadband internet access services as “telecommunication services” under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. This allowed the government to regulate the internet under the same rules designed for telephone companies in the 1930s, hampering innovation and growth in that industry for more than fifty years.
&gt; 
&gt; The FCC’s 2015 edict requires Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to treat all data traveling over their networks equally, rather than allowing ISPs to customize service offerings with their users and compete for more customers on the basis of quality and price, even if those service offerings include treating some data differently. This essentially imposes a one-size-fits-all business model on the internet and represents an unprecedented government power grab to control and regulate the internet.
&gt; 
&gt; I support Chairman Pai’s desire to overturn the FCC’s 2015 mandates, which clearly run contrary to Congressional intent, to better allow Congress to dictate appropriate oversight of the internet through new, thoughtful legislative initiatives.  In fact, I cosponsored S. 993, the Restoring Internet Freedom Act, which would scrap the FCC’s ill-founded interpretation and net neutrality mandates.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me again about other issues that are important to you.

personalfinance,"Filing chapter 7 bankruptcy, what should I do with my car?","Hello, I am in the process of filing chapter 7 bankruptcy after having been debating it for the past year or so. I am scheduled to meet with a lawyer early next week and I am in need of some advice/guidance.

I had 2 cars repossessed about 2 years ago. One was mine the other was my girlfriends, but she was only the co-signer. I had from that point been relying on a company vehicle to cover all my transportation needs but it got to a point where my girlfriend really needed a car of her own to get kids to and from school and for when I was out of town. 

So about 6 months ago I was able to secure financing through Exeter Financial at 26% interest rate on a 2009 Mercury Grand Marquis with approximately 70k miles. We financed a little over $7000 after a $2000 down payment. I am currently paying about $212 a month with about 54 more payments to go.... It wasn't the most wise decision because of the interest rate but we desperately needed a car and I was just grateful someone was willing to offer me financing.

My lawyers paralegal advised me to just stop making payments and drive it until they repossessed it and then get something else with a much better interest rate after my bankruptcy had finalized.

And this leads into my question. Is what the paralegal suggested exactly what I should do? I am worried that post bankruptcy ill be at the point of having had 3 cars repossessed in addition to the bankruptcy and I really wont be able to secure financing period. I am also nervous because we really wont be able to afford an extended period of time without the second vehicle and I don't want it to get repossessed months before my discharge and be without that second car for a long time.

EDIT: I realize the car wasnt the most wise decision at 26% interest but I literally had no other options at that point and I didnt feel confident enough buying a $2000 car off craigslist because of bad experiences doing so in the past. The paralegal I spoke with said id have no issue getting financing shortly after my discharge and said many of their clients get pre-approval letters rolling with decent interest rates for all the local dealerships. I want to believe her but... just sounds too good to be true?

Should I perhaps continue making payments and carry on the loan past bankruptcy in hopes of being able to refinance? Sooner the better 26%..... its just so bad. I would love to just let it go and not replace it and continue just relying on my work vehicle but its been made very clear to me by my significant other that's just NOT an option. So please oh-so-wise internet people give me some advice, thanks!",finance

technology,IL Senator Tammy Duckworth's response to Net Neutrality and the 2015 Open Internet Order,"Dear Neighbor,

Thank you for contacting me about the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) 2015 Open Internet Order, often referred to as the net neutrality rule. I appreciate you taking the time to make me aware of your concerns on this important issue. You may be pleased to know that I support the FCC's net neutrality rule and oppose the current FCC Chairman's efforts to dismantle it.

As you know, the FCC net neutrality rule reclassifies broadband internet access as a “telecommunications service” under Title II of the Communications Act, while exempting broadband internet from hundreds of older, utility-era regulations, such as rate regulation, that could unintentionally reduce future investment in broadband innovation and expansion. As the Chairman of the FCC noted in announcing the Open Internet Order, using authorities under Title II and Section 706 of the Communications Act makes sure the net neutrality rule rests ""...on the strongest legal foundation to preserve and protect an open Internet."" 

This statement was confirmed on June 14, 2016, when the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the legality of the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order. On May 1, 2017, that same Court denied the United States Telecom Association's petition for a rehearing of the case, effectively upholding the 2016 ruling that affirmed the FCC's legal authority to develop, issue and enforce net neutrality.

As a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology, which oversees the FCC, I am committed to protecting net neutrality rules. We must protect consumers by banning internet service providers from engaging in paid prioritization, blocking and throttling. All of these restrictive practices not only harm consumers, but they threaten the very freedom of the internet. I am disappointed that the new Chairman of the FCC is working to undo the 2015 Open Internet Order, which achieved a reasonable balance between the need to establish clear, enforceable rules that protect consumers, while protecting internet service providers from regulation that stifles innovation and investment. 

Congress must not allow cable or telephone companies to act as gatekeepers of what content consumers may receive. That is why I have voted against efforts to weaken the FCC's long-standing statutory authority protect internet users from unfair and anticompetitive practices. As your Senator, I am committed to promoting an open Internet that is free from censorship. Freedom of the Internet is crucial for the success of our economy and the free flow of ideas. I will continue to monitor this situation and keep your views in mind as the new Republican-appointed Chairman of the FCC seeks to repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order.

Thank you again for contacting me on this important issue. If you would like more information on my work in the Senate, please visit my website at www.duckworth.senate.gov. You can find upcoming events in the state, sign up for my newsletter, access my voting record and see what I am doing to address today’s most important issues. I hope that you will continue to share your views and opinions with me and let me know whenever I may be of assistance to you.

I am posting for a friend, and would appreciate any advice or life experience you can offer.

My best friend is about $25 000 in credit card debt, she hasn’t been able to make a dent in it as the interest rates are high, and the economic climate is tough. She is 30-years-old with no savings, and has asked friends and family if she could borrow money off of them to pay the loan interest free, and then pay them back, and no one is in a position to help. A collection agency has recently contacted her with the threat of garnishing wages, and she’s met with a financial advisor who basically offered that she has no options.  She was hoping to go back to school which doesn’t seem possible for the next while, as she needs to get the debt under control before moving forward.

We live in Canada, has anyone out there ever claimed bankruptcy, and if so what does it entail beyond bad credit. Are you still required to pay back the money, and are there any fees attached. She’s not in a position that her credit will be needed for at least a few years (no plans to buy a house, or lease a vehicle).

personalfinance,Best way to get rid of this debt?,"My husband and I (41M and 38F) just got married a few months ago. We bought a house together last year. We are both previously divorced, which means we both came into the relationship financially shaky, and we bought an older home that is in good shape but still needs stuff that we didn't anticipate. We make about $80,000 a year between us in a moderate COL area, but I'm self - employed with variable income and he's paying child support, so doesn't go as far as you'd think. We both drive clunkers that are dangerously close to giving out on us,  but luckily mine and my kids' lives are 90% walkable in case one car dies... he has a commute to work,  so we need at least one car. 

We have the following debts: 
Best Buy (replaced 1960s appliances in our kitchen): $2500, interest free until June 2018. Monthly payment $250,  so we can get rid of it before interest kicks in. 

Total sewer line replacement (damn thing totally busted a few weeks after we moved in last summer): 6500 left to pay,  6% interest. Monthly payment $151.

Debt consolidation loan (divorce and protracted custody battles are expensive! ) : $13,500, 15% interest. Monthly payment $461, but we've been trying to do $600.

So, our total monthly payment towards our debt is around $1000. We are not acquiring more debt, thank goodness, but we're also not saving much. 

I get a larger chunk of money from my job in September. My idea is to get rid of Best Buy at that time and then start using that $250 to pay off the sewer line at a rate of $400 per month. Then after the sewer line is done, pay off the debt consolidation loan at a rate of  $1000 per month. With this plan, I'm thinking we could be debt-free in about two years. (Seems like such a long time!).

My question is: Is there a better way to do this? With Best Buy being interest free, should I pay that off later? My concern is with freeing up money in monthly payments to throw at other debt, but I hate paying off the interest -free loan first. I wish the interest rates on everything were switched!

personalfinance,Considering A UX immersive; Need Guidance,"Background: I'm 26 and looking to change careers from—what has heretofore been—Graphic Design to UX Design. I have no credit history, my only debts are govt student loans for a SUNY 4-year degree.

That said, there are three options on the table.

The first and most ambitious is The Center Centre in Chattanooga, TN. On the one hand, it's
not [yet] an accredited school. On the other hand, it's a 2-year immersive program, geared towards creating exceptional UX Designer candidates who are industry ready. Tuition and cost of living for the four years comes out to $80,000, but there's a loan program. From the website:

&gt; The Give Forward Student Loan Fund allows qualifying students to borrow what they need to pay for tuition at Center Centre. Qualifying students also have the option to borrow up to $59,880 to cover tuition and an additional $20,000 each year of the two-year program to help cover living expenses. The fund offers reasonable terms, hardship deferments, and flexible refinancing.

&gt; The loan is interest-free while a student is enrolled in the program and actively taking courses. Interest doesn’t start to accrue until 90 days after a student graduates. This gives graduates time to find a great job before they start paying back their loan. The low interest rate is fixed. Once repayment of the loan begins, graduates may take up to 20 years to pay off the loan, keeping monthly payments manageable.

&gt; We structured the Give Forward Student Loan Fund as a revolving loan fund. This means that every time a graduate makes a payment on their loan, they’re contributing money back into the fund. Every time a graduate makes a payment on their loan, they make it possible for a Center Centre student to earn their education. Graduates are giving forward. This is why we call it the Give Forward Student Loan Fund.

&gt; The Give Forward Student Loan Fund is a non-profit fund serviced through the Chattanooga Neighborhood Enterprise (CNE). CNE brings extensive experience in humane approaches to lending. They focus on building relationships with their customers. This means our students will get to know their lending servicers by name. They’ll work with our students and give them the flexibility they need to handle unforeseen challenges making a payment or adjusting their loan.

That said, I'd need a guarantor, and as both my parents are approaching retirement, they've declined to take something like that on, which I understand. I'm going to talk to the school's founders to figure out if there are any hardship discounts or whatever available.

Given that the average UX Designer salary is around 90K, my taking on 80K in debt, albeit paid back over 20 years, seems like a reasonable exchange to me—but a second opinion from this subreddit would be appreciated, as I also think that I may be _woefully_ misinformed.

**The second option** is obtaining a certificate at Pratt -or- FIT. My parents have a college fund allotted specifically for continuing education at accredited institutions, like Pratt and FIT. This is the route that my parents are the most comfortable with me taking. In other words, getting a certificate would be fully covered. 

The one issue is that there aren't uniform standards for UX Certificates, and most recruiters—from what I've researched—look at portfolios moreso than certificates. i.e. It may not be the best use of funds. But a certificate may encourage recruiters and employers to gloss over the less than one year of experience, and I could probably use the more formalized skills to build a portfolio.

**The third option** is to just use lynda.com courses to teach myself and, eventually, make a portfolio and pray that it's sufficient for getting hired in the UX Design field.

That said, which is the best option? Are there superior alternatives to all of this that I'm

I am a veterinarian and looking to get a new job that pays better. My current employer has taken advantage of me and not giving me income that was originally promised. My debt to income isn't terrible. I have all government loans and on the IBR program so my monthly repayment is manageable. 
My husband dropped out of school and joined the military. We pay about $2000 per month on his student loans and really getting nowhere. Most of his loans are from 2003ish so government repayment programs are ineligible. We are considering consolidation. Here is what he has: 

private $4,412 6.5%

private $19,943 8.4%

private $4,883 8.4%

stafford unsub $1,630 6.8%

stafford unsub $2,379 6.8%

private $4,412 6.5%

private $15,605 6.5%

So this used to be a lot worse. I went on here about 2 years and used the snowball method. We paid off a lot of the smaller ones with mid-range interest (6%). So thanks for that help!
We approached Navy Federal for loan consolidation (military only bank). They would not based on the fact that my husband did not graduate. He is taking advantage of GI bill and going back to complete his degree this fall.  
There are so many consolidation programs but it's hard to know who to trust. I feel like those 8% interest loans are what's killing us so maybe consolidation may help us get to 6% interest for those.

personalfinance,Have Home. Claiming Single &amp; 0. Throwing Away Total Money I Could Have?,"Hello all,

Almost 1 year ago I purchased my first home for around 70k.  Since it's such an inexpensive home, I am not paying much for property taxes &amp; mortgage interest.  

I have always claimed Singe &amp; 0 dependents on my W-4 forms, so I always look forward to a refund when I do my taxes each year.  Yes, I know many people are against this but it has worked for me in the past, especially since I never had enough things to itemize on my tax returns (i.e. I always claimed the standard deduction when doing my taxes).

When I purchased the home last year, and did my 2016 taxes, I found out that I paid so little in interest on my mortgage that I would still get a bigger refund by doing the standard deduction.  

Since I got no tax refund benefit out of my mortgage payments at all I am assuming that I lost any potential money I could have received during the year.  For example, I should really be claiming Single &amp; 2 which will reduce my fed tax amount on each pay check, and give me more take home pay during the course of the year.  At the end year, I won't presumably won't get any tax refund for doing this so I doubt I'd be able to get the standard deduction.  However, I should be able to itemize and include my mortgage interest.  Won't this give me a greater overall return versus getting a refund from the standard deduction?  

Basically if I get more take-home pay during the year, and then get some refund from mortgage interest, will the total amount I've received for the year exceed the refund I'd get from the standard deduction?

Hopefully I have framed this question in a way that makes sense.  Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Just started my first job out of college. Looking for help with 401k fund selection.,"I'm 22 and just started my first job after college and have been doing a ton of research on here and /r/investing trying to figure out the best way to invest in my 401k. I've read the wiki and the fund selection guide, but I'm still a bit unsure and want to make sure I'm not making any mistakes. My employer matches 50% of the first 6% of contributions so I know that I want to contribute at least that amount and am planning to go with something around 18%, but choosing funds has been very confusing. It doesn't appear that the TRP Retire plans are all that great, which is the default if I choose not to manage my own funds, so I feel like there's room for improvement over that. After reading the [401k fund selection guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2658o5/stepbystep_guide_to_401k_fund_selection/) I've found that I should be doing an 80-20 split of stocks and bonds, a 70-30 split of US and international stocks, and a 80-20 split of large and med/small cap US stocks. What I've come up with on my own is the following:

* 45% - VFIAX
* 7% - VIMAX 
* 4% - VSMAX
* 24% - FSIVX
* 20% - VBILX

Please let me know if that makes sense and if there's anything you see that I can do to improve upon that, even if it's just tweaking the percentages. I saw that at the bottom of the 401k fund guide that they mention opening an IRA if your employer plan isn't that great, but I don't know how to tell if I should be doing that or not. I put all of the funds I have available to choose from and their expense ratios in the following table.

personalfinance,Cash Back vs. Low Interest Credit Card (CAN),"My bank just sent out a letter that they are discontinuing the cash back credit card I've had for a year. The bank has offered another cash back card that they say is similar, but I have concerns about a few things.

The old card offered 0.75% cash back on all purchases no matter what. This new card offered 1% cash back on gas and groceries, but has an annual spending cap of $5000 (which I would definitely reach within the first quarter). The card also offers only 0.5% on all other purchases with no spending cap.

Interest rates are the same between the old and new cards, and neither had annual fees.

I use my credit card for almost everything i buy, and pay it off at the end of each month when I get paid. There's the odd month where I don't pay the whole balance, but typically it's paid in full each month.

My question is, would I save more money by sticking with this other cash back card, even with the spending cap, or should I change to a low interest card?

The same bank offers a low-interest card of prime (around 3%) plus 1.5%-12.75%. Even if the bank decides to charge the max interest (15.75%) it would still be lower than the cash back card.

The low interest card has an annual $25 fee.

I'm not sure how much I would benefit from low interest since I pay off most of the card each month, but I also know I would hit that spending with the cash back card.

Any input would be great!",finance

investing,How can I profit off an expected Illinois/Chicago Real Estate Crash?,"I have reason to suspect that Illinois real estate will crash hard within 10 years. Reasons why:

- Inflated house prices funded by lax lending standards(5% down is ok!) and low interest rates, which are beginning to rise(you can say this about any location)

- Property taxes are the highest in the country, and will continue to rise, pricing the middle class out of their homes.

- Tons of new apartments and houses being built, which increase supply.

- The state is the only state that is losing population, people are leaving the state.

- The states income taxes just went up, without addressing any of our spending problems or pension problems. We'll likely face another budget crisis in the next 5 years

- Many of Illinois's largest businesses, such as Motorola, Sears, Caterpillar, etc are all dying out, causing job losses.

- Lack of worker's comp reform is causing manufacturing plants to close and leave to adjacent states.

- College tuition is super expensive compared to other states, and funding is scarce. Many students are leaving the state and not coming back.

- Chicago has many similar problems to Illinois, but much  worse. Their public schools have a junk credit rating and pay 9%(maximum legal amount), and their bonds are insured via property taxes- if they default, taxes go up.

- Unfunded pension liabilities, which are protected by the state constitution, are absolutely massive, and we haven't even seen the effects of this yet.

- Massive crime in Chicago is scaring families out of the city.

I honestly see Illinois, especially Chicago, going the way of Detroit.

The problem is, how do I profit off of this if I don't currently own real estate? People are being stupid and buying houses they can barely afford, with the assumption that its a good investment.

Is there a way to take advantage of real estate you know will lose value in the long term?",finance

I now own a Toyota Corolla that I love for its comfort and fuel saving. 
However, I'm thinking to get a bigger car that will fit our new family. Now I wonder how the whole refinance process can be matched with a car upgrade. Can I exchange the 2016 car I have, get another car, and still be able to lower the interest rate for the loan? 
Should I go to the dealership to negotiate a refinance or should I look for another institution for this matter?

personalfinance,Auto Refinancing Advice,"Hey PF,

About a year ago when I needed a new car for my job I made a (financially suicidal, i know) decision to get whatever car I could from a tote-the-note place. Their APR is something like 25% whatever the legal max is in Texas.

I do realize this is one of the worst ideas, but I did need a car and I also knew I could pay it without issue, so I did.

My question now is, I have made aggressive moves to increase my credit and am now at around a 678 according to my BoA Fico Tracker, althought my Credit Karma puts my 2(of3) scores @ 610, not really sure how there is that big of a difference between FICO and those 2 agencies, but whatever.

I would like to get my car refinanced, I was just browsing through the credit karma options, but the capitol one offer mandated that the current loan be from some kind of FDIC insured bank or ""major"" auto place, so I didn't even apply.

I want to try to avoid a hard pull on my credit during this process, but that isn't mandatory if I am fairly certain I will get approved for it. The only real issue I have w/ my credit now is account age, I have only had credit cards in good standing for the past 2 months, to clarify, i didn't have any cards before so they were never bad, just not good.

What chances do you guys think that I have of getting refinanced w/ 670 FICO from BoA and 610/613 from transU/equifax with very limited credit history.

Or can I get it refinanced at all since its currently through a no-name BS dealership?

personalfinance,Zero Coupon Treasury ETF?,"Hi everyone, I for some time have been buying muni bond funds for my taxable accounts that are targeting retirement. I'm in a state with high income taxes.

I recently went to some online calculators and found that those muni funds offer very little negative correlations vs. equities (see [this summary matrix](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-class-correlations), in particular ticker MUB vs. VTI, or national muni's vs. total U.S. equities).

I am guessing that is because they obviously lack exposure to U.S. Treasury bonds, which offer the most negative correlations vs. equities; in any crisis, there is a flight to safety towards Treasuries.

So, my thinking is this: how about buying some zero-coupon Treasury ETF shares? Logic:

- Zero coupon, and so, no dividends are taxed
- Reduce portfolio volatility
- Live with interest rate risk. The [Vanguard ETF](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0930), for example, has a duration of 25 years",finance

In particular, we want to know if other negative factors, like maternal stress during pregnancy or offspring stress during development can enhance the toxicity of lead – or other similar neurotoxic metals. We hope to understand whether positive versus negative early behavioral experiences can change the trajectory of developmental consequences caused by lead and/or prenatal stress exposures.

personalfinance,Need help analyzing numbers for 2014 Honda Civic,"Hello I'll cut to chase. Went to the dealership and was able to get the interest rate all the way down to 2.9%.

personalfinance,"Selling one of my cars, what do I pay off with the money from it?","I have two vehicles, and I've come to the decision to sell one of them. I figure that I can get approximately 12k for it, so I need to decide what to do with that money once I get it. 

I have two options as it stands. 

Option 1) pay off my other vehicle, which has an outstanding lien balance of 11,865 @2.69%. The monthly payment on that is 251.13, so paying it off would let me save that much every month. 

Option 2) pay off the special assessments on my house, which have a remaining balance of 7,274.75. Interest rates vary since it's a bunch of smaller amounts that add up to that amount, but I'll say the interest rate is approximately 5%.  These are technically paid monthly, as they are part of my mortgage escrow. In 2016, with principal and interest, I paid 1,007.92, so if I paid off all of these specials, I'd be saving approximately 85 dollars a month. 

I know that conventional wisdom says to pay off your highest interest debts first, but just wanted some opinions on what I should do in this situation, since paying off the vehicle would save more per month in the short term, but paying off the specials would let me pocket some of the cash as well (about 5k worth).",finance

The 7.8K and 14K loans are federal loans in deferment as I am in school through work but all the others are in repayment. The $80,000 was a consolidation that was done in 2008.



My current strategy is to pay off the smallest loans first to improve my debt to income ratio. I pay the minimum on all the loans except the smallest where I pay 310 a month which totals about $1000 a month.

As the federal funds rate continues to increase .75% over the past 6 months I have noticed an increase in my interest rates which I hate as I have worked hard to get an 795-805 credit score and always thought it would help with interest rates.



Should I be employing a different strategy to paying off these loans and are there ways to lower interest rates on loans through Navient and WellsFargo?

personalfinance,"Anyone heard of an app called ""Active Hours""?","I've heard some folks talking recently about an app called [""Active Hours.""](https://activehours.com/) The premise is that you get paid kind of as you work instead of on a 2wk cycle. You have to give them your banking login info, they scan to see your payroll amount, and then at the end of each day you can send them a photo of your timesheet to show the hours you worked. They'll then pay you for those hours immediately (up to $100/day and $500/pay period) and when you get paid, debit it back out. 

Sounds like a payday loan or SALO, right? Here's where it's interesting, *there's no interest rate*. You can choose to ""tip"" $2-$14 when they debit the money out of your account.

I think that this cannot be the only way they're making money, so I figure that with that unfettered account access, they're scraping your transaction history, mining your data, and selling that. Anyone else have any other thoughts on this?

personalfinance,Buying home spring next year - should I get a new car now?,"Hey everyone,

Thank you for taking the time to look over this post and hopefully answer my questions. I will lay out as much information as possible but if I am missing anything, please let me know.

Purchased Audi S4 in 2016. I purchased this pre-owned. However, at this moment, I am under water around $7k or so. Interest rate is high and around 5.5%. I drive mostly freeway to work (about 40 miles each way). The Audi takes premium and I will go through $300-400 in gas on a monthly basis. Insurance for the car is $225 per month. I have a perfect record. Car payment is around $580 a month.

I am comfortable with the car payment.

FICO - 740

I am getting married in September. To make things easier to manage, I have a personal loan that I took out in June 2017 for $28,000. I pay double the payment with additional going to principal. This loan will be paid in full within 2-3 months after the wedding. Definitely before the end of the year.

Future wife and I are looking to purchase a home in the spring of 2018.

With how much I commute, I believe the s4 is overkill. I have been eyeing on a lease - trade in, to get out of being underwater. ( I kno that it's not really getting out of the debt). I am also looking at purchasing a vehicle if that's the better route. I have been looking at Subaru Forester's and Crosstreks. in Michigan, I prefer AWD, reliable, and something that will last at least the next 5 years.

My main question to PF is this. Should I wait to unload the Audi and get a new vehicle after the purchase of the home or should I do that now? From what I have read, it is not recommended to make any large purchases within a year of purchasing a home. However, if I can save $300+ a month on insurance, gas, and a car note; would it be worth it?

Thanks for all the help!

""The number of defaulted federal student loans hit a new high in 2016: about 8 million borrowers have given up paying on more than $137 billion in education debts.""

That means at least one out of every six people who have any federal student debt haven’t made a payment on their loans for at least nine months. In fact, 1.1 million student borrowers defaulted for the first time in 2016. the total amount of defaulted federal student debt grew by about 14% in 2016.

More Revealing quotes: 

""An increasing share of federal student-loan borrowers are entering into repayment plans that allow them to make smaller payments than they actually owe on the loans""

""Rapid run-ups in debt are the single biggest predictor of market trouble. So it is worth noting that over the past 10 years the amount of student loan debt in the US has grown by 170 per cent, to a whopping $1.4tn — more than car loans, or credit card debt.""

personalfinance,I need some advice about exercising/selling Stock Options,"I live in the US and have access to ~2000 shares of a fairly steady public stock at a strike price of around $1.30 and the shares themselves are worth around $35 a piece. *edit:* The options are of the type ISO.

I have a decent amount of credit debt and loans (have been digging my way out of poverty, didn't have the best financial education till recently). After paying off the strike, I'm anticipating having about 60k in stocks to do with what I will. I have been reading a lot about the difference in selling immediately and holding for a year and I think it's wise to sell. However, I know that taxes are different when you sell stocks right away VS holding them for one year.

My current debt is:

**Credit**

6000 on a card with 17% APR

1000 on a card with 20% APR

7000 on a card with 9% APR

1000 on a card with 8% APR


**Loans**

10000 in Federal Student Loans, APR 4%-7%

30000 in Private Student Loans, APR 6.5%

8000 in Car Loan, APR 2.5%


There is no way for me to know how much money I will be taxed for selling the options upon getting them (if you know, please tell me), but I heard it would be taxed as income. I make 80k a year. I am anticipating selling all 60k in options will make it so I have 40k to work with, which I think the best plan after reading a lot of this subreddit (especially the Prime Directive/Windfall section). The tension mostly comes from whether holding or selling is better for me personally, given taxation.

**Current Plan:**

- Pay off all Credit debt (15k)
- Buff emergency fund from current 1k to 11k (10k)
- Use remainder to pay the highest interest Federal and Private student loans (15k)

I anticipate exercising the remaining 3/4 of my stock as it becomes available and then holding for a year, in order to be taxed capital gains instead. 

**tl;dr:** Do you think it's worth it for me to sell my $60k in stock after exercising my options (this is only a quarter of the total, the rest will vest over the next 3 years) and pay off my credit debt/some of my loans rather than holding for the next year to be taxed less under the Capital Gains tax?",finance

&gt;  
&gt; On April 26, 2017, Chairman Ajit Pai announced the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) intent to revisit the FCC’s 2015 Open Internet Order. In 2015, The FCC ruled in a partisan 3-2 vote to reclassify broadband services under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 was originally designed to regulate the legacy telephone network. 
&gt;  
&gt; While I support consumers’ ability to access the Internet, I had serious concerns that the FCC's 2015 attempt to prevent Internet companies from blocking or slowing consumers relied on a 1930s portion of law, which was never intended to regulate the Internet. Using outdated regulation to police Internet companies threatens innovation and investment in the Internet. The FCC’s latest decision provides a new opportunity to find a way forward on bipartisan legislation that permanently prevents companies from blocking or slowing consumers. I believe that consumers should be able to access websites without a company unfairly blocking them or slowing down their Internet speeds, which is why I support legislation to ensure this issue is resolved once and for all instead of leaving it up to the whim of the FCC.
&gt;  
&gt; Again, thank you for contacting me, and do not hesitate to do so again when an issue is important to you.

personalfinance,My car is underwater and always in need of repairs. What do I do here?,"I owe 20 more payments of about $340 (24% interest rate) on an '06 Maxima with 127k miles on it.  Payoff is about $5800.  It has some rather obvious interior damage, and has been a complete lemon mechanically.  It is worth $2000 max, but more likely about $1000.

I've spent $8000 in the past year on repairs, including $2000 since this February.  The bulk of the $8k was a transmission rebuild that cost $4k, but as you can see there's still a ton of other issues since then.  Basically all of them engine related.

BTW, these numbers are only repairs and tows, I do not count expected things like oil changes and new tires and stuff.

It is once again in the shop, as it is every month.  They're saying it needs new ignition coils and spark plugs, $750.  There is some suspension and tire work suggested, that I've put off for about 8 months now, which would be another $1500.

My financials:  I make $60k per year with no kids and my only debt is my student loan which is substantial.  Rent $1100, plus the standard assortment of internet and phone and insurance bills and whatnot.

My family has been telling me to just get rid of this car any way i can.  I should be living well below my means, except this car is costing me the bulk of my disposable income.  My uncle is a car salesman and is suggesting I buy this 2016 corolla with only 30k miles for $14k.  My credit is still bad though slowly improving, so it would be 20% interest.  On a 60 month term it's about $400/mo.

Because of how underwater the existing car is, I can't just trade it in on a $14k car, it would have to be a significantly more expensive vehicle.  Which I definitely don't want to do.

I have a younger brother who doesn't have a car and is willing to take on the remaining car payments if I split the cost of (current) repairs with him.  For his day-to-day life he doesn't need a car but says it would ""help him make more money"".  He is not the most reliable person:  I have to look at this as at least a significant chance that i just end up with two car payments.

If he were to make all the payments though, it would be 2 or 3 times as much as I'd ever get by selling or trading it in.  So there's that.  

Help me out?  What should I do here.

EDIT:  I had asked my mechanic a couple days ago to do a more thorough inspection and give me a recommendation on whether i should continue to put money into it.  I've only been seeing him for a couple months.  He finally called back and says he's surprised i've had to do that many repairs, he doesn't think it's realistic to expect to have to spend that much going forward.  Says this ignition coil thing as well as the other more recent repairs are not indicative of other problems.  Just standard wear and tear on older vehicles.  Much as it pains me to do this, I guess i'm going to hang on to this thing for now and hope for the best while trying to pay it off.",finance

personalfinance,21F: Should I dip into savings or take out a loan? I'm really not sure what's best.,"Hi Reddit!

I'm 21F, facing my last semester in college thankfully! After financial aid [not loans- just grants] my balance is $7,600.

Relevant facts:
1.) I have zero financial support from my parents and have been living alone since 18.
2.) I do not want to start getting help from my parents 
3.) I serve at an upscale restaurant and on weekends I work at a popular night club as a bottle girl. Lastly I pick up shifts at a bar if I'm having a bad month. My take home per month is around 5,500, with slight variances if it's holiday season or something. I also receive insistence through work.
4.) My current rent is $2,400 and I live alone. Other bills include 200 for cell phone&amp;wifi&amp;cable as well as electric that varies but in the summer is around 200-250 because I use my AC a lot. Other personal expenses that I won't budge on amount to another 500$ a month. So I'm looking at fixed expenses of $3,200 without groceries. 
5.) When I paid off my previous loans I was doing the same work, but was paying $1,400 in rent (I had roommates) so I had an extra thousand per month I don't currently have. 
6.) Moving/decreasing rent isn't an option- I live in NYC and have certain desires in an apartment I won't sacrifice so this is the cheapest I found five those requirements. 
7.) I have about $18,000 in savings, about $4,000 in credit card debt that's all in my current billing period (no old debts- pay CC in full), and currently have $1,000 of my rent which is due in a couple weeks and am expecting to make the next 1,500 by then. In my checking account that I can spend freely I only have a couple hundred.



I have a few questions and will try to organize it well.

1. Should I accept federal loans of $3,600?
I am currently loan free. I started off with $65,000 in loans (52,000 private at 11%, 13,000 federal at 6%) and I didn't really understand what loans met until I did some research and got freaked out about debt. I dedicated two years to just paying off my loans (with my lower rent) and finally made my last loan payment in May. I also had about $6,000 in stocks I removed to pay my loans. Have not re-invested since- waiting to have 30,000$ saved before I invest again because that's what will make me feel secure in case of emergency. That said, I'm very debt averse. But should I consider taking out these federal loans? It would be at 5% interest. If I do take out these loans, I would just use it to decrease my monthly payments to my school but pay off the loan at my own pace with no strict deadlines by the end of the semester. But a part of me feels like it's not even worth the drama of knowing I have a debt lingering. 
With the loan, my monthly school payments will be around $750. Without the loan it would be around $1500 which is definitely a drain. 

2.) I need to either make a full tuition payment by July 24th, or enroll in a payment plan by then which would have a $50 one time fee as well as a 20% deposit day of. There is also a $200 late fee if I for any reason miss a payment on the payment plan. A part of me dislikes the idea of having another bill every month, especially a big one and just want to pay it with my savings. My hesitation however is that I'll feel discouraged. I was very careful with money and worked a lot to build a savings and had a goal of $20,000 saved by September. I'm so close so that goal that removing almost 8,000 will discourage me. That said, is there any financial reason (benefit or con) to do one or the other? 

I also personally value being able to spend freely so I'm nervous about having another $1500 bill every month. 5,500-3200-1500 leaves me with 700 for groceries/saving. I'm trying to balance my personal needs to be in a happy mental place because financial freedom is important to me, while also trying to make the decision that makes the most sense here. 

To note: last semester I paid my tuition via a payment plan however I received a $2,000 school stipend for a tutoring for two semesters  which helped drastically. It gave me an extra 500 a month over the course of the 4 month semester which gave me about 1,000 of free money which is a number I'm comfortable with. I will not be getting that stipend again. 

Lastly, I lent my brother $500 I'm expecting to get back next week so that's another helpful swoosh. However, I've had dentistry issues this month (which is also why my credit cards are a little higher this month than usual) so next week I'll be looking at another $350 payment to the dentist, after already spending about $400 this month for dentistry. 

All that said: should I take the federal loans? Then should I pay in full or do payment plan and feel uncomfortable financially?

Thank you for your help!

Tldr: should I make an almost $8,000 payment in one go or should I do a payment plan? Should I take out a small federal loan despite being debt averse?

personalfinance,Advice for my 12 year old's bank account and savings.,"My son has been saving up his money here and there from chores and what not and had about 110$. He was carrying it around in his wallet with him everywhere we went which made me incredibly nervous. So we went to the bank and opened up a checking account. I am on the account as well (as he's only 12) and he did get a debit card. We made a deal that if he was responsible with his card and didn't go crazy with it and spend all of his money right away I would give him full responsibility of it... but if he started to go crazy and be irresponsible with it I would have to step in. I made this deal knowing that it wouldn't be a problem. He is and has been incredibly responsible with it and has since made another deposit. We have the online app that he can track his money (which he does even though he's not spending anything). I never had an account at such a young age, so I want to help him do it right. What are some things I can do to help set the foundation of saving? Should I talk low level investment? I was never taught how to save money and had to find it all out the hard way,  so any advice would be great. I don't think I'm the best at it as it is. Should we open up a savings account as well?

personalfinance,Mortgage application/credit score/ financing advice,"Hi PF,

I am a recent college grad looking to purchase a home. I have high income to debt ratio. I currently work a W2 job making ~50k a year. I thought my credit score was 750+ but when the loan officer did a hard pull to check my credit, they were 590,630 and 740. 

My parents were extremely generous and agreed beforehand to fully fund any secondary education for their children. It turns out, however, we were late on the first two payments on the repayment schedule and ACS Education reported it to the credit bureaus. 

My mortgage applications are unfortunately denied.

Does anyone have any ideas on improving my odds of getting financing? 

My ideas are:

1)Writing a Letter of Goodwill to the loan company.

2) Transfering the loans to my parents to lower my debt to income ratio?

3) Trying to get a temporary forbearance until I can get the financing and then continuing to payback the loan.

Thanks.

personalfinance,(US) Best Method to Maximize Value,"Hello all,

I have dug around on here and cannot find any information specific to my question, so I thought I would post here.

I will begin working at a law firm this fall. Pay is approximately $140k. I have approximately $80k in debt. I will not have housing expenses as I will be living at home for the short future. My partner is from another country and I am unsure where we will end up after two or three years. I plan to pay down the grad-plus loans with high interest as first as possible, which will leave around $60k in student debt. Normally I would just pay this debt down as soon as possible, but there are two issues with this: (1) the interest rate is pretty low so that I may be able to generate a higher return elsewhere; and, (2) if my partner and I move after two years, having cash on hand would be exceptionally important. If we were to move, I would be leaving my law job and searching for a new legal job or leaving the legal profession (law doesn't transfer well internationally due to admissions to practice law).

Thus, my question is what is the best way to maximize the value of the extra money that I have after paying down the high-interest grad-plus loans? I have considered something like a Charles Schwab account and investing in an ETF or mutual fund with low risk but hopefully 5% return. However, I would love to know if anyone here has better ideas or suggestions.

The major issue with paying down the remaining $60k in student loans is that it will likely leave me with little cash, which would be detrimental for an international move. The student loans have an interest rate of approximately 5.5% and are still with the federal government, not private. 

Any and all advice is well appreciated. Thank you.

Best,

technology,I sent an email to Congressman Jeff Duncan regarding net neutrality. This was his response.,"""Thank you for contacting me with your thoughts on net neutrality. As your U.S. representative, I appreciate hearing from you.

There has been uproar and much misconception following the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) vote on May 18, 2017 to formally begin the process to peel back President Obama’s net neutrality regulations. The term coined in 2003, net neutrality, is the basic principle of a free and open internet. The debate surrounding net neutrality today can be traced back two years ago, to 2015 under the Obama administration, when the FCC acted to greatly expand its own power. The FCC abated the effectiveness of the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) privacy approach by voting on net neutrality rules to reclassify internet service providers (ISPs) as common carriers, thereby making them subject to Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.

Title II regulations weigh down investment in broadband and have had negative unintended consequences. Essentially, these regulations treat ISPs like “presumptive monopolists”, and according to the current FCC Chairman Ajit Pai the market failure the regulations were enacted to protect was simply non-existent. Market-oriented policies have delivered far more value to both the market as well as the consumer, fostering economic growth. Market-oriented policies, not pre-emptive regulations, are the reason our internet economy is the envy of the world. During the Clinton and Bush Administrations and prior to the last two years of the Obama Administration when the FCC imposed net neutrality rules, the internet flourished under a “light-touch” regulatory approach. In 2015, the FCC under the Obama Administration unnecessarily inserted the government into the Internet economy, thereby stifling growth.

Late last year, just ten days before the 2016 presidential election, the FCC adopted, on a party-line 3-2 vote, overly prescriptive online privacy regulations. I voted in favor of the joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) 2016 broadband privacy rule (H.J. Res 86/S.J. Res 34). Congress was right to rescind the Title II broadband privacy order passed by the FCC in October. The FCC’s overreach is a dangerous deviation from successful regulations and common sense practices implemented by the FTC to protect consumer privacy while still maintaining the capability of the internet to flourish and foster innovation. The internet has thrived under the technology-neutral privacy regulations developed by the FTC, the entity best equipped in implementing internet privacy regulations. I support the goal of ensuring the online privacy of consumers, and am optimistic that with the guidance of Chairman Pai, this goal will be accomplished well still maintaining a competitive internet market place.

Once again, thank you for contacting my office. I welcome input from you and all my constituents as your Representative in Congress. Should you need any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact my office directly.

Blessing and Liberty,

I tried to take classes around work, but I was only able to take 1-2 classes a semester rather than go full time and after a semester of being fed up and really not knowing what I wanted to do/major in I stopped again. 

It's now been 3 years and I have a better idea of my goals and what I'd like to major in (not 100% but thinking of business administration with a focus in finance or something similar). Though I don't know what to do about actually going to classes. Do I stop working and lose out on the management experience I'm currently gaining for my resume, putting myself in $50K+ debt while completing this in 3-4 years. Or to take night/online classes and halve this debt but complete it in 6-7+ years depending on class availability.

I've written this as a bit of a vent, and so that others can learn from my mistakes. I've included a link to one of my posts explaining the situation below. However, a TLDR is: I've received 3 XPS 15's with manufacturing defects. 1st = bezzles falling off, 2nd = misaligned keyboard, 3rd = dead pixels and massive screen bleed.

https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/6nyszg/need_to_vent_about_my_dell_xps_15/


I was fed up with Dell and either wanted a complete refund or a new XPS with a 3 year extended warranty as way of compensation.

I called Dell up and after being transferred around for an hour and a half, I learned the following:

Dell cannot refund me any money because my original laptop was purchased over 30 days ago...NO SHIT!!?? Each laptop took about 11 days to ship and that doesn't include the time required for the replacement request to be approved. The bezzles on my first laptop did not start delaminating till about 2 weeks into my ownership. Of course it's been more than 30 days since I got my first fucking laptop.

As for compensation? Nothing. The ""best"" they can do for me is send me another replacement.

To anyone in the market for a XPS 15 (or Dell in general), I would HIGHLY recommend looking elsewhere. If you absolutely HAVE to get an XPS, learn for my mistake. If Dell sends you a shit unit, ask for a refund immediately. Then, if you decide to give Dell another shot, you can just buy a new unit with the refund money and have a new 30 day refund window. That way, you don't waste any refund window time waiting for the replacement to arrive.

personalfinance,Got a job offer but unsure if I should take it.,"**Backstory:** I have been working in the professional services department of a software company for about two years. It is my first job out of college and I was very grateful to find something in my field of study.  I was unemployed when I took the job so anything was better than nothing, but I was offered the position at $14.50 an hour. 

At the beginning of the year, my employer put me in charge of our largest project to date which I handled and was able to ""close"" as a result of good project planning and execution. When I closed the project, my boss pulled me into his office to tell me that he was fairly sure that he was going to promote me to another position. Right before the week my promotion was supposed to take effect, my boss ended up leaving the company for another company. I was working out of town at the time he announced this decision and did not return until after he left. When I returned, I went to discuss the promotion with the VP of services. The conversation did not go well and essentially telling me that I was not a worthwhile employee (which is interesting as I really never worked with him to often).

I discussed the results of this conversation with my wife who told me that it might be a good idea to find another job. I agreed with her but there was one major problem: There is no competition for this industry in my area. The employer is well known for under paying employees and having ""meh"" benefits but people hire on regardless because there is no where else to go if you are in a STEM field. 

My wife and I decided that we would try to move away. I beefed up my resume, cover letter, LinkedIn and GitHub to being my job search. After a few interviews, I found an employer that I was generally interested in. My initial interview went very well and they invited me to a second round of interviews in a major city. These interviews went even better and later on in the week I was presented a job offer.

**Here is the problem:** I am currently pulling in around 40k before taxes. The job offer was for 55k with a written agreement to move to 60k if the first 180 day period on the job goes well. The job is in another city that is three hours away so my wife and I will have to move. We have to break our lease which is going to cost us approximately $2600. We outright own one vehicle, owe about $5000 on a truck and about $1200 on my motorcycle. We also have about $4700 in credit card debt. 

Our rent right now is approximately $900 and if we move will be somewhere in the range of $1300-$1600 a month. We have a monthly budget that we update and prior to this job offer our primary goal was paying off all of our debt (we were committing about $1250 a month to debts).
I guess I am trying to justify taking the job offer when I know my expenses will increase as well. This is my first time contemplating a job offer while still being employed and I have never had to put in a two weeks notice or make a major move before.



**Bottom line:** Is this pay increase worth moving for?



**TLDR:** Current job doesn't value my work. Got another job offer that will take me from 40k to 55k. Job offer requires me to move to a big city that is three hours away. Rent will jump from $900 to $1500 a month. Other expenses may also go up. Currently have a moderate amount of debt.

Salary: $50k/yr
Current take-home: $2800/month

I have $27k in federal student loans, $34k in private, and $3500 owed directly to my school. All the loans owed except the school ones are serviced by Navient. My balance was much higher to start with but I've been making all the payments (minus a few months after college when I was unemployed). My uncle has been a huge help by generously gifting me $5k every six months for the past few years explicitly for paying down my loans. I recently paid off the most expensive loan that was $400/month. My total student loan payments are now $1000/month. I know this is ridiculous and I've tried to consolidate the private loans twice. A few years ago I was told at that time I made too little money (~$43k) and my credit score wasn't good enough at ~740. My credit score hasn't budged since then but I make more money so I think that's why they said yes but you need a cosigner. My uncle was willing to cosign until SoFi refused to give me a rate before they got his signatures, and I don't blame him for backing out of that. We started talking about him paying off my loans for me and I would then owe him the money with a lower interest rate, so I could at least get away from Navient. Then we found out he needed heart surgery. I don't want to bring it up again while he's recovering. Asking him for help might not even be an option at this point. 

I figure that all my federal loans can be deferred once I go back to school, but that's only $350 out of $1000, and my salary will be cut from $50k to ~$30k. I don't want the interest to build up, especially on the private loans, so what else can I do?

Right now my plan is to throw as much money at the loan as possible while I still have extra. When I start school, I'll get the federal ones to go into deferment and continue to pay the biggest private loan with what money I can spare, until that's gone, then start with the next one. If I could just get that next one paid off before I enter grad school I would sleep better at night.

The SSN was one digit off, and when I indicated it was wrong, they said I had to make an in-person appointment at a physical branch to correct. 

I've had this account for 12 years. It's been reported on my annual credit reports. They've grown my credit limit to be five digits. 

It strains belief that this could happen with the wrong SSN. The cynical part of me sees this as some ploy to get me in and sell me something. 

If that's the case, they may piss me off enough to cancel the card. I only charge about 5% of the available credit on my three cards monthly.  I'm not planning any purchases that would result in a credit pull. I figure I can weather any hit that this card disappearing means, and I can have Netflix changed before I leave. 

Has anyone else seen anything like this?  Could they really have my SSN wrong for 12 years, yet report my credit correctly?  If so, do I really want to be doing business with a company so shoddily run?",finance
personalfinance,Poor Graduate Student,"Hello all!

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, or even if I'm doing this correctly. Obligatory ""I'm on mobile, so please don't hate my formatting"" as well. 

Currently, I'm a 20yr old graduate student that seriously needs some help finding scholarships/grants. I've searched in my area, and no one seems to give out scholarships to graduate students. They only give them out for undergrads. 

Are there any PF people out there that know of any good resources, or have any information about places that award graduate students scholarships?

I've already checked with my grad institution and my undergrad institution and exhausted all they could offer. FAFSA only offered me loans at a higher interest rate than my undergrad loans (which I'm trying to avoid at all costs!!). 

Any and all information would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks, friends.

personalfinance,My Wife and I Need Help Deciding if We Should Buy a House or Rent. Could You Please Help Us Decide PF?,"Buying versus renting has been a topic of late in this subreddit, and I am struggling to figure out if I should buy a house or rent in my current predicament. 

My wife and I have recently graduated. We have quite a lot of student debt, but we also have a lot of income. 



I currently owe ~142k in student loan debt. I owe ~36k at 6.8%, ~36k at 5.4%, ~36k at 6.2% and ~36 at 5.8%. My wife's student loans are going to placed on a minimum payment of $550.00 because after 10 years her loans will be forgiven due to her line of work. My 10 year payoff plan is ~$1700.00 a month.

We both have car payments of 240.00 and 285.00 (both at &lt;5% interest). Our rent is 675.00 plus all utilities (should be similar as having a house +- 100.00/month).  

My take home pay after taxes is roughly $5700.00 (after contributing employer max match contribution of 5% into 401k) and hers is roughly ~1800.00 (****actually it's 2400.00 she says) a month. Our combined gross income is ~140k/year. My 401k has been earning a rate of return of 6.8 % lately and averages ~6%. 

We probably spend anywhere from 700-1000/month on random things and trips/drinks/restaurants. I know, it's a lot ... roughly we both spend about 20.00 each day ~1200 - month. This most likely will not change unless we have children (unlikely). ***

We do not have enough saved for a 20% down payment, so we would have to go with an FHA (3.5% down) or a conventional (5% down). We are looking at a house for ~165,000 to ~200,000 right now, but we can't decide if we should wait to buy a house. 

We are torn because of the high interest on my student loans. We were wondering if we should wait to buy a house until after we have paid of my &gt;6% interest loans. We have already checked into loan consolidation and the best rate I could find was 6.3%. My credit score is around high 600 to lower 700 depending on when checked. 

The other factors to consider is that interest rates are rising and so are housing prices in my area. Currently I can get an interest rate of 4.5% conventional 30 year, 3.25% FHA 30 year, 3.25% conventional 15 year and 3% 15 year FHA. These interest rates could be as high as 6% in 5 years when I'm likely to want to move. I may, however, not move for as long as 15 years.

Another consideration is that because I do not have 20% down yet, I would have to pay PMI ~150.00/month (already looked into). On top of that I will have to pay house insurance, which is around 110.00/month. I will also have to pay taxes and upkeep on the house, but I don't know how to figure that into the equation.

The total price of a mortgage seems to be as low 1250 for a 30year FHA (1350 convention) to 1900 conventional 15year for a 200k loan (rough estimate). 

My wife and I both have steady jobs and could potentially stay in the same location anywhere from 10 to 20 years (30 years if I become a manager). We will be in the same house for at least 5 years. 

With all this information, should we buy a house or rent? We could use the extra money we would spend on a mortgage to pay off my student loans quicker. However, by the time I pay off my student loans (hopefully in 4-5 years), interest rates could go up to 6 or 7 percent. However, housing prices could also increase and the house I want now for 165k could be worth 200k. 

Please help us personal finance. We cannot decide what to do. Thanks so much for any and all help/comments!!

personalfinance,Currently making 53k a year. My old company offered me 66k to come back. What to do?,"I would like to gather some more input before I make my final decision.

Fast forward, I am now with a bigger IT company making 53k a year. I've been working here for 5 months. I can see a great opportunity for growth within this company. Additionally, this company is closer to my home and provides better benefits.
I just received an email from my former employer offering me a 66k salary if I come back to the company. I'm unsure what to do at the moment. I miss my old company but am afraid it would be strange to return as I've already moved on.

investing,Odd Question About Debt Consolidation,"This is not at all on topic for this subreddit... But, I am not sure if there is a better subreddit for this type of question. If there is, let me know and I would be happy to go ask there. Regardless, I think the userbase here might have some useful input.  

&amp;nbsp;

Question:  
lets say I have three loans totaling ~100k. A mortgage, a car loan, and a personal loan. Interest rates are 3.5, 1.99, and 1.5 respectively.  
If I wanted to consolidate into a single loan...  
Is that something that is possible?  
If it is, where would I start?  
And, would there be a chance of a comparable interest rate? The weighted avg interest rate is 2.94%  

&amp;nbsp;

Any input would be much appreciated.  
Thank you.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit1: Collateral would be the house. There should be plenty of equity in the house to cover the new loan.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit2: The reason for my interest in this idea is that I want to pay off my debt early.  
Since smaller car and personal loans usually have higher interest rates, it makes sense to pay them down first (Debt snowball!, Dave Ramsey!). But, with the loans I have, its backwards, my largest debt has the most significant interest rate (even though its still very favorable).  
I was surmising that if I could roll all of it into one big loan with a similarly favorable interest rate, then paying extra on that loan would be a much easier decision.  

&amp;nbsp;

Edit3: I suspect the financial advice of Dave Ramsey might be at odds with some in this community. It would be pure blasphemy over at /r/wallstreetbets. lol.

personalfinance,"(US) Almost $20k in total debts, how do I deal with this in the smartest way possible?","**99 Problems and All of Them are Ignorance**

This is on behalf of my boyfriend [24], who doesn't reddit. I've been helping him get his finances in order for about three months now, and while much progress has been made, through reading old posts here I've realized we could be doing a lot better on a larger scale.

Current debt is as follows 

* Auto Loan $9,289 (9.95% and payments are $253 a month)
* Student Loan $6,357 (In forbearance pending details on income based repayment, which should go through in August. I understand there's different options like PAYE and REPAYE but I'm not super clear on it. Previously he had missed several payments and was around $150 under on ""due payment"", so that drove this.)
* Assorted Medical Debts $6,169 (This is very recent and none of these have gone to collections YET. Some of these people have been called and payments have been arranged, but not all. I use Mint and if all of these were paid off in a year, the monthly payments would be $800 a month. This is not doable. The original plan was to use the snowball method, but as they get closer to being sent to collections I'm getting cold feet.)
* Capital One Secured Card Debt $171 (23.65%... This has been open for 5 years and only has a limit of $200, the same as when it was opened.)

Overall, this is not a large hole to climb out of. He makes weekly paychecks of around $375 and his monthly bills (outside of debt payments and groceries) are around $400-$450. We don't pay rent. While I do have the Mint budget set up, I take a stance of ""try not to spend any money ever"" so it's mostly been used as tracker for areas that need improvement rather than ""here is the amount you can spend, don't spend more"". 

Questions beyond general advice

* How bad is this car situation? I've figured out that this is a very high interest rate, and refinancing may be the smarter option. His bank doesn't offer refinancing in our state (FL) and my credit union doesn't offer it either. I've heard PenFed has good rates, but they have a $17 dollar application ""donation"" and I don't want to do that if he'll be denied. (I don't know his ACTUAL credit score, but CreditWise estimates 692.) He was approved by DCU Consumer Lending this morning but I haven't pursued that further. I think the lowest they offer is 2.24%? I'm not even sure if that's a variable rate. I thought 9.95% was a great deal, so I'm not very confident in this area.
* Is it worth it to transfer the credit card balance to a new, better card? Yesterday he was approved for the Chase Freedom card, but I got lost as far as which card offered which benefits. I'm not sure what his interest rate is on that, and their website is offline at the moment. The Capital One card seems like BS and I'd like to be rid of it as soon as possible, what with the interest rate and annual fee of $29 (which is coming up 08/15).
* With the medical debt, is it better to consolidate? Apparently that's a thing people do, and that is the depth of my knowledge on the subject. If we do, should we wait until all are sent to collections so we have a better idea of their respective interest rates? Again, more phone calls need to be made to see if the debt can be reduced further. This is the after insurance amount, the original was closer to $50k.

Thank you for reading this novel of a post, I'm pretty sure I got in all the information but if not I will be refreshing this post all day. I know there's a lot to learn and aspects of finance and debt that I've never heard of, and I hope you guys can help us continue to grow.",finance
personalfinance,Looking for advice on saving responsibly with debt,"Hello, I appreciate the time out of your day you have taken to read this.

My fiance and I are getting married in about a month, we are both in our young thirties. Our goal long term is to buy property near where we both grew up in NYC. We both have student debt and after paying for a wedding we are struggling to figure out how to make our dreams come true.

Our combined income is about 150k. We pay $2,040 in rent per month, with utilities and car insurance our monthly outlay is about $2,350.

Our only debt is student loans, which combined are about 160k. We both make payments on this, usually at the minimum level. They are all federal loans and our interest rates are below 5%.

For over a year as we saved for our wedding we were putting $1400 a month into a savings account. While it felt like we were doing well, after sending in our final checks our total savings (combined) are down to about $35,000.

Homes in the New York Area are expensive and we are struggling to figure out how we could save the requisite $100k - 150k we would need for a home especially if we want to have children in the next few years. We know a place in the city is likely out of our price range.

So here is where we are at: We can either keep paying the minimum on our student loans to maximize our liquid capital in the next 5-7 years, thereby being able to afford a home but losing out horribly on our student loans OR we can give up the dream of home ownership and pay down our debt.

It doesn't seem like we can do both and we don't want to be financially irresponsible.

Is there anything else I'm missing? How are we ever going to be able to afford to be home owners?

personalfinance,Parents saving very little on retirement.,"Hello PF, I need some recommendations on how to approach a sensitive subject with my parents. they both are in early 50's with stable jobs. 

my father is a supervisor with a local school district. he is in charge of maintenance duties for several schools. est salary 50K. he says he has a pension and should retire with that. he plans to retire at the school district pending no disasters.

my mother is an RN who works 60 hrs a week and brings home about 85K gross. she has a 401k program but is contributing less than 2% to the program.

they have both had major financial problems and are constantly behind on their bills(no reason for it).

I have 3 younger siblings with 2 still at the house. both are working and were gifted vehicles on their 16th b days(parent financed)

this is my main issue. they both seem more interested in donating 10%+ to the church and saving money for grandchildren(2) than saving for retirement. for instance my Dad puts $50 a week for the 2 grandchildren(not mine). I am meeting with my parents next week to discuss this as I see this as a very important thing. I am trying to make them understand that if they do not save for retirement they become a burden on their children and grandchildren. this may be a touchy subject as I would like for them to put all money they have saved for the grandchildren towards debts(&gt;100K) and to retirement. my belief is that parents are responsible for their children. I really don't feel comfortable having my parents living in poverty when they could easily save 250K from now until retirement. here is a little about their debts etc below.
est 7.5K net monthly
mortgage:350 remaining 32000 @11.99%(due to poor credit they are unable to refinance)
4 vehicles+insurance(mom,dad,sister 16,sister18)=$2200(avg interest rate 10%)
groceries 125/wk
phone/internet/tv/gym $700
church offerings undisclosed but imagine more than 10% of net.
savings $0
eating out $750 monthly
credit cards not sure on balances but payments are around 300/month.

my 2 younger sisters are actively building credit and saving/investing. they both work and will begin to take over their car payments thus drastically cutting down on some unnecessary spending by my parents.
my parents seem to have quite a bit left over after all bills for saving but they are not doing it. I know their payments are higher but it is due to my mom having issues with paying things on time. she does not understand due dates and pays whenever she feels(thus decimating both of their credits). most of her payments incur a late charge and this is where i'm thinking they are losing most of their excess. They had mentioned they had about 10K in savings around this time last year but that was liquidated for my youngest niece. 

My brother(23) has 2 little girls whom we adore. I'm sure that my parents are providing financial assistance to my brother and his wife. 

in summary please help me with getting this difficult topic across to them. after a few years of digging myself out of debt I am comfortable and saving for retirement. at 26 yrs old I have amassed more retirement and savings funds than my entire family(10K) ehile still paying off massive debt. I have been very fortunate to have graduated with a Master's degree in Molecular Pathology and found a company that I love and is paying more than I believe that I am worth, however they say I am contributing massively to the company so both sides are happy.

thanks PF for helping me with this sensitive topic. I believe that parents once kids have left the house need to focus on their own financials and not their children. they are grown ups:)",finance

personalfinance,"Recently filed bankruptcy, how to look forward and start building credit responsibly?","My wife and I recently filed bankruptcy due to me losing my job many times over the last few years. We went from making $160k/ to $40k/year, and I just couldn't seem to keep a job. Anything from call centers to fast food, sometimes 2 jobs at once. We seemed to be making headway, then I would get ""you just aren't the right fit for the company."" I even got this generic response after working for the call center company for 4 months. After being promoted to team lead just 2 weeks prior, I get walked into the HR office (coincidentally (?) after telling a few women to report sexual harrassment to HR). It has been very frustrating to not hear what you did wrong, just that you suck as a human and can't provide for your family. This is all another story, but we decided after months of discussion, that we would file for bankruptcy. We figured we would be fighting an uphill battle over credit card, auto loan, and medical bills (the CCs being in collections) for the next 7 - 10 years and then have to deal with the damage it did to our credit for a few years after.

All of that was to say, now that we have filed and our credit is restarting, what's the best way to look forward and try to build our credit so that we can have a good standing and credit history at the 10 year mark? Is it better to take one of these credit card offers that are 30% interest and $199/year activation fees and $60/month maintenance fees that we keep getting in the mail? Do pre-pay credit cards actually work to build credit? If I get a pre-pay credit card, charge to it and pay it off every month, how long does your experience tell you until they allow you a small unsecured card? Would it be better to try to find an unsecured $300 card or something with a higher interest rate, just to get started again?

We paid off a few credits cards and store credit items before filing, so it's not that we don't have the discipline to do so, it's just that we were idiots with money when I was making a lot more than I ever had. We never put extra money towards the mortgage, ate out a lot, and bought toys (a truck, TV, computers, games, kid stuff, etc) instead of using it wisely. I definitely think this was a great life lesson about finances, it has taught me a lot about creating and keeping a budget, spending percentages, and it brought me to this wonderful sub where I have gained a lot of great knowledge, mainly from lurking.

I know PF generally hates bankruptcy, so hate me if you want. I am just looking to the future and how to correct this to give my kids a much better example, something neither of our parents taught us.

Thanks.

personalfinance,"Don't know what to do anymore, any help is appreciated","I rounded up on the numbers so 125 would be 130, 190 would be 200, etc.


So back in February my fiancé lost her job after giving birth to our second child, she had to have an emergency c-section so I had to take time off work to help her with day to day activities (showering, dressing, kids, walking up/down stairs, etc). During that time we used up our savings and then  bills started to pile up and I started looking for a second full time job.


I started a second job towards the end of June, and because of how far behind on bills we are I'm now filing Federal Exempt from my tax forms. 


We own our house, but currently still owe for June and July, plus August after the 1st. We talked to Mortgage company and have to pay June by the 31st to avoid default.

Credit cards haven't been paid in a couple months. 
So minimum payments are high, 5 total credit cards; and we have 1 personal loan. 
My fiancé is now watching both kids l, no job because daycare would be more than what she used to make a month for both kids, not including gas.


Here are the monthly payments:

House: $1120
CC1: $195 ( due now, past due) Line: $1500
CC2: $170 ( due now, past due) Line: Cancelled
CC3: $20 (current) Line: $1000
CC4: $120 ( $170 due now, past due) Line: $2000
CC5: $125 ($545 due now; past due) Line: $6300
Loan: $86 Left: $1500 left to pay
Car: $200 Left: Around $4000
Other bills (utilities, insurance, internet, etc): $740


Between both jobs and no tax withheld I'm taking home around $3500/month, can go up or down by a couple hundred.

My fiancé says paying off mortgage and then the least amount total on each CC is the best way to go, but I'm not too sure.
Obviously mortgage comes first, but I'm not sure what to pay off next, I was thinking personal loan?

It seems like right now I can't seem to get ahead no matter what I do. Any help is appreciated, please let me know if I need to add more info. Thanks and have a good day.",finance

I am 35yo engineer and make ~ $80 k.  I do not own a house although have been pre-approved and my credit score is good ~720.  My question is what would be the best strategy to approach my debt.  

1)	Pay the credit card debt as quick as possible.

2)	Pay car off first to use as collateral to get another low-interest loan to use towards student loan.

3)	Pay the 401k loan first, for potential earnings.

4)	Pay the personal loan first since it is the highest interest rate.

5)	Bankruptcy.

6)	Move to Europe and stuff myself on wine and cheese because this is overwhelming. Que sera.  (not a joke, serious consideration, although I have no clue how that impact a potential return in the future)


Options 2-4 are with the hopeful assumption that if the credit cards are not paid off by the end of the 0% promo period, I will still be able to transfer the balance to another card with a 0% promo period, somewhat of a gamble but feel pretty confident this would be available to me.

Bitcoin,To everyone who has hated how difficult this process has been... it SHOULD be this difficult to alter consensus rules in the network.,"Admittedly I have gotten a little fed up with it as well as times.  But just remember that it is *supposed* to be this difficult and it *should* be.  The harder it is, the more distributed and diverse the network is.  We all have different visions of what Bitcoin is and how it is going to change the world.  To come to an agreement about significant changes at the core level, *even* if it's a soft fork, it will inevitably, by its nature, be a difficult and arduous process of **having to convince people of your argument, and prove to them the reliability of the code.** It is proof of a widely distributed power structure within the ecosystem. And it is proof that no one is able to simply force a change onto other players. 

Had SegWit actually been dangerous, unsecure, and risky code, then BIP148 would have been a joke.  1000 nodes wouldn't have done anything except fork to their own coin.  But *specifically because* SegWit was clearly safe code that presented multiple improvements, BIP148 simply became the excuse to finally make a decision.  But make no mistake, BIP148 success is not exactly what this activation demonstrates.  It is a better demonstration of the networks tendency toward extensive debate and testing in the face of controversial code, the process of broad decentralized consensus, and conservatism in the face of uncertainty.

TL;DR This entire process has doubled my confidence in Bitcoin as a secure, long term financial network that is going to completely change the nature of money, trade, and governance across the entire planet.

&gt; Network neutrality is generally the principle that Internet Service Providers (ISP's) and governments should treat all data on the internet equally and not discriminate based on content.  As you may know, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently approved a proposal to reclassify the internet as a public utility which would allow the FCC to regulate the internet under its Title II authority.

This seems like a great deal, I have no work to put in the house. I get my 70k plus a small interest rate on the ""loan"" I lent to the buyer, plus I would receive an additional windfall after the sale of the house of whatever is paid off from the mortgage payments from my sale date to the buyer's sale date.

What am I missing here? is this common and safe for me? anyone have any bad experiences with ""wrap around mortgages"" or ""all inclusive deed of trust""?

investing,My skepticism in Tesla's Model 3 reservation/deposit scheme,"On March 31st 2016, Tesla began taking fully-refundable deposits (reservations) for the to-be entry level vehicle, the Model 3. The cost for one of these reservations was $1,000. With that payment, you get a spot in the Model 3 production queue. 

Within the first week, Tesla took over 325,000 reservations which represented $325 million+ in new money for Tesla to invest into Model 3 production along with the doorway for up to $14 billion in potential sales. My call is that it'll end up being much less.

Here's where my view comes into play.

My bet is that at least 33% (one-third) of those reservations will be pulled out. The $1,000 payment is not a deposit, it's a 'reservation'. The $1,000 covers the cost of a place within the ordering queue, not a part of the value of the car (unless you *do* order it | [see parts 1 &amp; 3 of the Reservation Agreement](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/model_3_reservation_agreement.pdf)). It's purely a marketing concept from Musk. It's a smart idea from a smart guy, I'm not alleging any wrongdoing from him- just that the reservation figure should be taken as a tiny grain of salt in the grand scheme of things. A lot of people will likely go through with it and buy the car, but just as many are impulsive and just want to feel they're part of a movement (the ""[week that electric vehicles went mainstream](https://www.tesla.com/blog/the-week-electric-vehicles-went-mainstream)"").

Many people see Tesla as a tech company. People wait in lines to pay for hot releases from tech companies. Whenever the new iPhone is coming out, people line up around the block of many Apple Stores waiting to be one of the first owners of the new device. Many do it not out of need, but to be the *first* member of their social circles to have the hottest new device. People are excited about it for a bit, and it eventually dies off, but 'bragging rights' chasers and/or tech-lovers love the idea of being that person.

It's hard to do the same with a car. Outside the realm of highly-exclusive, limited-edition cars, people tend not to rush into waiting to be the first to pull the trigger on a new car. It is simply too expensive with not enough reward to justify purging a great deal of one's financial capability for temporary bragging rights. So, Tesla, which many people see as a tech company, came up with a brilliant marketing idea: Offer the car for a phone-like price and start taking orders just like a phone release. It gripped the attention of tech-lovers: They could pay a phone-like price to earn some instant bragging rights without any risk of losing that money. As stated, many will pull through, but I believe a big chunk have done it just for mostly impulsive, social reasons.

In short, those who are trying to ride this like an iPhone launch get to satisfy their impulsivity for no cost at all.  

 My suspicion is that a huge chunk of the current reservation figures will be pulled out and the number will end up being less than 300,000, and likely much closer to the sub-200,000 mark. If Tesla can't pull through on upping its maintenance capabilities then it could be drastically lower.

It's still a big number, but don't buy TSLA with the assumption that $14B in Model 3 sales is promised revenue.

Another way to think about this is as an alternative IPO. 

Get this: 

 Elon Musk actually convinced a bunch of folks that they could take a share (reservation queue spot) for $1,000 instead of actually buying shares in TSLA stock. He didn't have to sell *anything* and he still raised several hundred million dollars. Those that end up pulling out their $1k may end up with a case of ""reserver's remorse"" when they realize they could've bought stock and ridden this enormous bubble/wave of TSLA's value instead. Nobody who ordered a Model 3 with the intention of getting a 'sexy' EV at an affordable price will be getting an affordable price. Tesla has stated it will first deliver to those orderers that configured their car to the priciest specification. By the time affordable Model 3s hit the market, the federal tax incentive will have expired. 

Reservation holders also are not people who *need* a car soon, otherwise they wouldn't have placed said reservation when their car won't be delivered until 2018-19. So in my opinion, this was a highly misguided placement of said $1,000. It's not much, but given its degree of pointlessness, it may as well be much higher. If one bought $1,000 (or more) of TSLA on March 31, 2016, the price would have been $229.77 per share. It has since peaked at more than $380 per share and is now (Jul 21, '17) trading at $328 per share. If you bought $1,000 in stock, it would've gotten you just four shares. But those same four shares would now be worth almost 33% more, a much better return than a slightly quicker delivery of a Model 3 (if they even stay on schedule, [see track record here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3sukrh/elon_musks_credibility_on_outlandish_claimsgoals/)).

***

**Tl;Dr:** If investing in TSLA, disregard the current count for Model 3 reservations.  I believe many (up to 33%) of the original reservation holders will pull out, only having done so in the first place out of impulsivity and a craving for bragging rights (iPhone-like tech hype). 

For those that *did* place their reservations with the intention of ordering a Model 3, I believe that was a misguided allocation of dollars and you would've been better off with some patience and/or a purchase of TSLA shares. 

Additionally, if you view current Model S [values on the used market](https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/cars+under+45000/Tesla/Model+S/California+MD-20619?endYear=2018&amp;makeCodeList=TESLA&amp;maxPrice=45000&amp;modelCodeList=TESMODS&amp;searchRadius=0&amp;sortBy=derivedpriceDESC&amp;startYear=1981&amp;Log=0), many are listed at or around $40,000. The value will easily be undercut by the Model 3 because it supposedly will come standard with 'Auto Pilot', whereas many Model S in that price range do not. This, to me, will push the value of those Model S values near or below the $30k threshold and will in turn be a much better value.

Just received my first check from work and I was wondering why my Fed (S/0), OASDI, and New York City Res. taxes took a lot more than I anticipated. Just a little background info, I'm in college and this is a summer job which means I'm only working from July through the end of August. After doing the math, it seems that 25% of my paycheck was taxed. Also, how would I go about filing a tax return that will allow me to get a partial refund next year?",finance
personalfinance,Should I open home equity line of credit?,"I would like some advice on home equity line of credit (HELOC) options. I own my home worth ~450k and owe 280k. I am considering opening an HELOC of 50k+. I can get an interest rate of 4.2% for the HELOC. 

My first use of the HELOC would be to pay off the remaining balance of $4800 on my student loan currently at 6.4%. I pay double the minimum payment each month right now on student loan ($100 minimum so $200 a month). I would only save a couple hundred if I went to HELOC to pay it off but might be worth it.

Other than student loan I do not have any outstanding debt (other than mortgage) but thinking having open HELOC for extreme emergencies, is not a terrible idea. Things such as major home repair, medical, putting a downpayment on a second home. 

HELOC main points. 4.2% entry with adjustable interest rate. If I keep HELOC for 3+ years no fees whatsoever otherwise $500 closing fee. Would be getting it with a credit union.

I plan on owning but potentially not living full time in current home for 3+ years.  So I'm not sure if you can have HELOC on home that is not main residency. So really just interested in advice on whether having a HELOC is good idea. I am responsible with money, no credit card debt, and 740+ credit score.

personalfinance,Need $10-$15K for upcoming medical bills - what's the best way to leverage home equity to get it?,"I own a home in California that is worth about $250K (conservative estimate) in a neighborhood where home prices are going up fast and probably sustainability (real neighborhood change/development, not speculation). I bought it almost 2 years ago for $185K, with almost no downpayment - knew it would take forever to save one up (I stayed in grad school tooooo loooong) and was feeling behind on retirement planning for my age (36), so bought a house to build equity through CA real estate appreciation. Basically, my first mortgage was $174K (4.5 interest rate) and I have two CalHFA piggyback loans, one is about $5k (0% interest) and the other about 10k (3% interest). I don't have to pay anything on those right now, but they have to be paid off with any refinance. My total payment with taxes and PMI is $1200/month, same as my rent before buying. So all together I borrowed about $190 for it, which is actually kind of blowing my mind right now, since the house was only $185K. Not sure how I missed that the first time around. So I guess a background question is, did I get screwed in some way on my first mortgage(s)? But that's not why I'm here today. 

I'm here because I have some medical bills coming up in the range of $10-$15K and I want to leverage some of the new equity in my house to cover them. So far I've been offered a cash out refinance from my original lender where I get $10K out and my mortgage payment only goes up $50/month (PMI is removed). Maybe not the most cost effective way to get the money with closing costs and all, but it's really low impact right now and the house is going up in value and we don't think we'll own it more than 5 years or so. However, if we do a simple cash-out refi, we lose our mortgage credit certificate (MCC) and that's worth about $1500/year to us. So suddenly that's another $100+ cost per month to the refinance. 

We could also get a home equity loan for $15K from another lender, that'll cost us about $100/month and leave our other loans as-is plus no closing costs. Seems like a better deal, but the interest rate over 30 years is over 8%, which just makes me squirmy. I assume it would work the same as a regular mortgage in that we'd pay all that interest up front? And of course we could choose a shorter term and have less interest in the loan but I like the idea of lower monthly payments if we're not going to own the house for that long. 

So...what am I missing? I did not come from a family with money and have no one to ask about this stuff and am feeling super confused, like I don't know the right math to really assess and compare options. Like I said, spent too much time in school and then low paying non-profit jobs, and still only making about $50K per year. My partner makes about $35K per year and contributes to all household expenses. We're both feeling behind on saving and overwhelmed by having to deal with these medical bills. Right now I've got about $10K to put toward them but that still leaves the gap of $10-15K. 

Sorry for the throwaway - my other account I mostly talk about the medical issue I'm dealing with, and I just didn't want to mix them.

personalfinance,I won a $400k condo. What to do? Should I sell it? (US),"Background

There are several new condo buildings being built in a nearby suburb, all by one builder company. The builder holds 'lotteries' where you can purchase a ticket. Once each set of buildings is completed and ready for move-in, there is a drawing and one person wins a free condo in the complex.

A few months ago, I received a ticket for free from an employee of the builder who is a family friend. I wouldn't have bought it on my own. The employee said it was an extra. I never expected to win. Well, surprise, I won Monday's drawing! (The family friend either doesn't know or else hasn't been in contact yet... which is fine by me, we aren't close)

I already own a townhome in my suburb and don't want to move for the time being. The condo's suburb is farther from work and also has higher property taxes than mine. I also prefer my townhome to a condo.

***

Sell or Rent

I am debating to sell the condo - may need to pay for realtor and all transactional costs...

Or to rent it out. Would rent for $2100/mo based on other condos/apartments I priced near it. Provides an income stream, but I don't want to deal with tenants. Property taxes, insurance, high HOA fees will eat into this substantially.

***

Issues

It's a lot of money. It hasn't sunk in yet that my net worth has basically doubled overnight, because the money is still tied up in the illiquid condo. Btw, I am up to speed on general investing principles such as asset allocation and tax-efficient fund placements, I have read a lot of the Bogleheads wiki and follow 90%+ of it. I have no debt except mortgage on townhome at a good interest rate (btw my townhome would sell for about half of this condo, because the condo is bigger in terms of sqft (go figure) and it's in a more desirable area - less desirable for me personally but not in general).

I am *very* confident I won't blow through the money if I sell the condo. It's almost sad, but I can't even think of anything to blow it on, short of paying off my townhome (which doesn't make sense given mortgage interest rate vs. average stock market returns...)... maybe setting up some 529s for my nieces... which isn't really 'blowing it' the way most people think of it. I cannot travel for a bit anyway because I just started a new job a month and a half ago.

personalfinance,Can someone tell me how long it will take to pay off my student loans,"Hello r/PersonalFinance, hopefully someone can help me figure out how long it will take for me to pay off my student loans. Thanks in advance for any time invested in this. 


Some info:
I have 9 student loans that I am currently paying back. I make one payment a month to GreatLakes. The minimum payment is $353.97/month, I currently pay $700/month, and plan to continue to pay 700 a month until I am debt free. The loans are broken up as seen below. 


Loan Token |Loan Type |Current Balance |Interest rate 
----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------- 
1|	Direct Subsidized Stafford|	$3,014.87|	4.25%
2|	Direct Unsubsidized Stafford| 	$1,392.93|	6.55%
3|	Direct Subsidized Stafford|	$2,585.86|	3.15%
4|	Direct Unsubsidized Stafford|	$1,651.42|	6.55%
5|	Direct Subsidized Stafford|	$3,243.22|	3.15%
6|	Direct Unsubsidized Stafford|	$1,751.70|	6.55%
7|	Direct Unsubsidized Stafford|	$6,973.09|	3.61%
9|	Direct Subsidized Stafford|	$4,737.62|	4.41%
0|	Direct Unsubsidized Stafford|	$451.98|	4.41%


If this was just one lump sum of money with one interest rate, it would be fairly easy to calculate, but that's not the case, and thus why I am asking for help.


First, when I make a payment, the minimum amount ($353.97) is first applied to any accrued interest and the remaining is then applied to the current balance of each loan. I have no idea how this 353.97 minus interest is split up and distributed to each loan, but I think these are important numbers to help determine total payback time. 


Second, the extra I pay (700 - 353.97 = 346.03) is then applied to the current balance of the loan(s) with the highest interest. Again, I am not sure how this remaining excess chunk of money is split between the loans with the highest interest (currently 2, 4, and 6). Obviously as time goes on the loans with the highest interest rate change also, which is another hurdle in calculating how long it takes to pay off these loans. 

If anybody can help shed some light on exactly how my payments are being split up and how long it will take me to be debt free, I would be extremely grateful. Let me know if you have any questions, or need more information. Thanks Again.",finance

personalfinance,"Accidentally missed student loan payments I did not know about, now credit score is destroyed. How do I fix the issue and rebuild credit?","Hello and thank you in advance to anyone who helps me out in this situation! In 2015 I graduated university with a BA and then immediately after became a teacher and was enrolled as a part time student getting my credential. 

Starting this passed November 2016 I began paying Direct Loans in addition to some transitional funding I had received through Teach for America to help me relocate. So for the past year and a half I have been paying my loans on time. In May 2016 I finished my teaching credential education at a university.  

The other day, I was checking my credit score, and found that it is 574, because I had two delinquent payments from my university.  Found out through my university that this was the Federal Perkins loan which has a grace period of 9 months after someone is a student of at least part time standing. I made the mistake of thinking that all of my loans were consolidated into one place (Navient). Unfortunately I made this mistake, but I never once received billing information or notice from the lender for my Perkins Loan. 

My questions are this: Is it legal for my university who is listed as the lender to neither notify that my loan was now in repayment or that I was in delinquent status? My issue is that if I didn't check my credit report, I would not have known about this loan! 
Secondly, I started getting charged for the loan in December, which is less than nine months after I finished school. 

I immediately paid the current balance due, but is there anyway to get this late payment off my record? Especially since the lender started charging me before my grace period was over ? What steps should I take to fight this? And ultimately, if I cannot get this off my record, how can I rebuild my destroyed credit? I currently do not have any credit cards, but I have 8 student loan accounts, have paid off a car and another student loan.

personalfinance,What is the purpose of a Children's savings account?,"My wife and I had our newborn a month ago, and are trying to open a savings account for her. Initially it is a place to temporarily hold her college savings starter, bit longer term it will be a storage place for allowances, birthday and holiday gifts, etc.

Savings account interest rates suck already - usually a max of .8%. However, as soon as you have a ""kid"" account, a number of banks seem to cut the interest rate as low as .05%.

At that rate, they are literally taking cash from children because inflation will NEVER be lower than that.

What exactly is the point as a financial product?

Edit: I am not looking for suggestions about 529s, that isn't the point for this account. This isn't college savings. It will be a place to park college starter cash temporarily while we figure out the 529 allocations. Once that cash is used to fund the 529, the account will remain in use to store cash gifts she receives.",finance
personalfinance,Did you do something to get benefit from debt freedom today instead of saving for FI in the future?,"My big question is: what have you done to realize benefit *now* in your life because you are debt free?

My wife (35) and I (36) with two little boys are debt free, have been for 4 years. When we were paying off debt, it always seemed like our lives would change once it was gone. They did change a little in things like interest rates for mortgages don't affect us and there is a low-level stress now gone but nothing bigger. My wife is at home with the kids, I'm the only income.

I've been wondering of ways to use this debt freedom for an enhanced life today though because right now the only thing that really changed is our investment accounts. I'm saving up for FI of course and live a simple and, what I think is, luxurious life; we don't want for anything that matters.

I'm just trying to figure out if others got some of that FI time freedom now instead of in XX years. In 10 years I can have *all* the freedom but I really wonder if trading some of that future time (taking longer to get to FI) is worth gaining some of the freedom now.

I guess this comes down to saving for the future is the right thing to do but a future FI that's XX years away can be so far away for many people and sickness, accidents, and bad things can happen that might make that future never come. 

Here are my thoughts on the subject:
* reduce work hours if possible. I know some people at my company who go to 80% work time. Still get 100% benefits but 80% hours (every friday off) and 80% pay
* take a different full-time job but one that a person enjoys more. Probably take a pay cut. For example, I make $115k/year now which seems high for an individual earner in my relatively small (300K people) city. Our expenses are 40-50k a year and save about 20-30k a year, there is a cushion there. 
* a person could try and get a seasonal job like teaching at one of the local universities/colleges/business colleges and have the summers off

My ideas seem to focus around work because that's where 10 hours of my day goes five times a week when you factor in commute.

Very curious what kind of thoughts others have had. Thanks for taking the time to read :)

On a side note I have been saving some money with the plan to help pay off my debt. I currently have $1,000 in a Roth IRA and about $3,000 in a savings account. I was curious how much should be saved for college debt versus retirement savings at my age and that since I don't have to start paying back my loans for a couples years where should that money go?

So I fucked up majorly about 3 years ago by getting a $25K student loan from Sallie Mae (and then a $10K the following year as well). At the time, neither of my parents could help me with school and I saw no other options but to get a private loan co-signed by my grandfather who was kind enough to do me the favor. Fast forward two years after acquiring the initial loan and I find out I have Bipolar 1 disorder that has been affecting my performance at school. For a while I thought it was ""just"" depression and could deal with it, but it obviously never went away. Anyway, at this point (junior year) in my college career I had also realized that I wasn't pursuing a degree I was passionate about so I did the natural avoidant thing I've done before when things get hard and just plainly stopped going to school. Yes, I know, bad idea, stupid, but I was in such a deep rut that I had no idea how to properly care for myself.

Okay so this is my problem now. The grace period is up and I am nowhere close to making enough money to cover even the bare minimum of the monthly payments. I'm living with my mother, have no car, a shitty job and I don't know where to go from here. 
I don't want my loans to default. I have a couple of federal loans that I'll have to start paying off in November as well, but I'm not all too worried about those because I've heard of PAYE and I'm sure there are other programs I could use to my advantage in that area (please correct me if I am wrong).
I was wondering if anyone knows what I could do about Sallie Mae trying to hunt me down for this money.

I've been procrastinating on doing my taxes for a while now - I *think* about 2010 or so was the last time I filed a Federal US tax return.  I have no good excuse, I was just lazy and, well, after I missed the deadline once with no (immediate?) repercussions, taxes just didn't become a priority.  I have always been in the lower income brackets, and from what I've been told, since I've never heard a peep from the IRS, I probably don't owe anything.  For what it's worth, I've never owed anything on any of the returns I've filed in the past.

I don't think I have any old W2s around, or any 1099s, or any of those little slips of paper saying whether I had health insurance or not, etc., either.  Some of the places I worked were smaller local businesses that don't exist anymore, and one of the lost 1099 (I think that's the form) was for a small law office that since dissolved, and I have no contact info for anyone even related to it.

I'm in my early 30s now, and getting ready to move out of the country, so I'd like to deal with this before I leave later this year - whether to settle a debt with the IRS, or possibly receive belated tax refunds.  I am in a state that has no state income taxes, so that's a non-issue.

So, the questions I have for PF are basically ""where should I start?""  

* Can I just go to an HR Block (or similar, I've never even been inside of one) and tell them what I've told you, and let them start the process?  
* Would they have access to records that I don't?  Or, at least a more efficient way to find what's needed?  
* Any idea what that might run, costwise?  
* I've haven't made much more than about $12/hr USD in my life, so if there are large upfront costs, I'd probably be SOL - if there *is* a return, would they be able to take their cut from that amount?

I'm sure I'm forgetting something, or not asking the right questions, etc.  I understand that there is a ""taxes"" subreddit, but the **much** higher traffic in this sub led me to post here, hope that's alright.

Now with the addition of the second bartender, my tips are cut in half! The tip formula is: Total Tips / 2 people x hours worked.
And although i can cut the second bartender at the end of volume, it rarely makes much of a difference financially. I'm losing about $300-$400 per pay period because of the second bartender.
How do I approach my GM for a raise in base pay? I know a nearby Bar (SE US) starts their bartenders at $10/hr + tips. Should I bring this up? My employers are pretty cool, and I feel like they would be open to the idea of increasing my base pay to make up for the loss im taking on. But I need somewhere to begin. Have any of you done this before?
edit: Would also like to add that we are short staffed. If I leave, they are fucking fucked because there is only 1 other strong bartender that can run a shift. Thanks, -Slow",finance
personalfinance,Am I misunderstanding something about consolidating my student loans?,"So I've been contacted by a company wanting to consolidate my student loans. 

Currently my loans are at $28699.16

My current payment plan I pay $176.61 so I will end up paying 46857.02 over 266 months. (though I pay $200 now with that extra going towards the loan with highest interest rate so I should be done sooner and pay less in the long run).

This consolidation company want me to pay $200 a month over 240 months which comes out to be $48,000.

personalfinance,turning work study into loans,"I'm going into my junior year of college and my financial aid package this year includes ~$2700 in federal work study that I'm thinking about turning into federal subsidized loans. I'm wondering if this is a bad decision financially.

I'll have about $8500 saved going into this school year from summer internships. Most of the work study jobs at my school are basically working as a receptionist or office assistant, and I feel like I could use that time for schoolwork, extracurricular activities or getting an internship that isn't capped at $1350/sem. If I do this I'd have $10k total in loans at the end of this school year all federal subsidized at 4.5% and I'm assuming I'll take another $5-7k out for senior year. That's a lot of money but it seems manageable since most people in my major graduate making $55k to $75k. Does my thinking seem reasonable?",finance
personalfinance,Basic Financial Walkthrough for most US adults (great for young people!),"I'm super bored so I thought I'd create a financial walkthrough that will lead your average person in the US to financial stability. This kind of basic framework for success isn't taught in most schools, and a lot of people in this country don't even know the basics.

All you need to start this game of RL monopoly is a J.O.B. and expenses that don't exceed your monthly take home pay. If you're in the red, you're pretty much dead. It's ok to go into debt to gain job skills! Income in the black? Good. Let's go. Keep in mind this whole walkthrough will take you many, many years. Assume that all credit takes roughly two years to mature and inquiries can take that long to fade from your credit. Try not to go nuts. Sloooow down.

1. If you can get direct deposit, you should. Most banks can use this as a way to waive service charges on checking accounts. On this point, get used to using the digital world for everything. Pappy will tell you to rely on cash, but Pappy's wrong. Digital transactions allow you to keep great records and also most digital forms of payment have extensive fraud protection. 

2. Find a bank you like and establish checking with them with no monthly service charges. From this point on you never want to pay banking fees. EVER. No overdrafting! Choose a bank with some rep. You wanna stay with one institution unless you have liquid assets in excess of 250k. If you do then, no offense, Bruce, but you're not really my audience. You don't want to waste time moving funds around from bank to bank like a nob. That's an incredible waste of time.

3. Get yourself a starter credit card. Activate it and use it for tiny charges every month, not to exceed 15% of your total limit. Pay the whole thing off every month. Having access to available credit strengthens your credit. Using a ton of it makes you a risky prospect. 

4. Now you have cash flow and your credit is budding. Work on slowly creating an ""emergency fund"" in a savings account for job loss or other acts of God. This should be roughly 3-4 times your monthly expenses. At the same time you need to get one more credit card at a place that will give one to you (like Kohls, Victoria's Secret, etc). Make sure your monthly minimum payments for both cards are being paid out of your checking account auto-magically so you NEVER EVER MISS A PAYMENT.

5. Now you have two trade lines (sources of credit) bolstering your credit score! Awesome. You should also have enough money to stay alive if something bad happens to you. Ok, this has probably taken you a while because life isn't easy starting out. Are you vested with your job yet? If you don't know, most companies will start to match the money you invest in your retirement account up to a certain amount after you've worked for them long enough. This should be a big red flag that it's time for you to start saving for retirement. If you don't, you're crippling your future self and leaving matched money on the table. Get that table money, future retiree!

6. Time to establish an installment loan! You may have already done this, but you probably should get a car or some other large purchase financed through the bank. Credit comes in three flavors: revolving, installment, and mortgage (which is kind of installment, but it's separate on your credit report). Having an installment loan gives you another trade line to build your score AND it shows lenders that you can handle credit of that type. I would advise against buying a new car. Get one a few years old. Most major banks will finance a car up to 7 years old at new car rates!

7. Let's sum this up. You have: 3 trade lines of healthy credit for hopefully two years or more. Your emergency funds account. A dependable vehicle that's not killing your income with maintenance. A growing retirement fund. If all those things are present, it's time to move on to some more advanced stuff :)

8. (Optional) Ok...now it's time to really cut loose. Are you staying in the same area for the next two years at least? Are you ready to start growing your money? You should really consider buying a home. These days you don't need tons of money for a down payment. Sure, you'll get a lower interest rate with more money down, but real estate loans have incredibly low interest rates and generally your mortgage payment should save you money over paying your rent for a similar living space. Your ultimate goal will be to refinance your property for the best possible rate later anyway.

**Your home is a useful investment for many reasons. First, assuming you are chose a good place to buy (do your research!), it should be gaining value. Second, the difference between that value and what you owe on the property becomes ""equity"" which is a very good thing. Equity is how much money you would get back if you sold your home for value and paid off your mortgage. That extra money can also be tapped using equity loans or home equity lines of credit to create low interest ways of borrowing funds (instead of using credit cards like a sucker).

9. Time for some housekeeping Old Man/Lady! After taking everyone's trash credit cards and liking it, you're probably eager for a little financial revenge, ha ha. It's a dish best served COLD, remember, so don't just start cancelling your crappy credit cards. That's like trimming a bonsai tree with a chainsaw. First, shop for a few really dynamite credit cards. You're a big shot now with a 700+ score so you'll get some awesome deals. Get a nice cash card and start passing your purchases through it to generate additional revenue. It's only a trickle, but it's money. Keep it paid off monthly. Get another good card for travel if you travel, or something like an Amazon card if you're like me and buy everything online. 5% cash back is great for online shopping! Remember that new credit is like a weak, useless baby. You need to let it grow and flourish before you go closing your older cards. Trim responsibly!

**Your great deals on home loans generally bottom out at 70% loan to value. Meaning that once your $300000 mortgage is down to $210000 you'll be eligible for some nice rates. You can cheat this a bit by refinancing that 210k as a first mortgage with an awesome rate and throwing the overage onto a second mortgage. Just be careful to make sure the refinance is in your favor and good for the long term. Every time you restart the clock on your mortgage you restart the ""amortization table"". Without going too deep on this concept, banks make more money (interest) in the early years of the loan and you pay more principal towards the end. Every time you refi, this advantage shifts back to the bank. It's no big deal if you live there for a long time, but if you move a lot you end up really taking a beating on that table.

10. By now, your basic needs for shelter, clothing, food, and transportation should all be met. You have great credit. You have emergency funds for later and you've started a retirement account with your company if you have the option. The final financial priority to worry about is investing. Investing is intimidating, because it can bear risk (risks means your money isn't always insured against loss like at a bank) but it's necessary. Also, you really shouldn't take investment advice from some random person on the 'net. Find yourself someone licensed to sell investment products and maybe consider some real estate if you want something that is potentially less risky. Just make sure you DO invest. Your money ""decays"" over time due to inflation. If it's not generating revenue, you're losing money. Don't put it in a mattress, grandpa/ma.

You hear it all the time. People don't like credit cards. They don't trust banks. You hear people talk about getting ""ripped off"" by financial institutions with fees. Fear and ignorance are not acceptable excuses for losing control of your destiny. Learning how basic finance works will put you well ahead of the game.",finance

personalfinance,Help with PSLF for Student loans. I think I fucked up.,"For the past 2.5 years I have been working for a local government assuming that I would be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program if I kept working in the public sector for a total of 10 years. 
About 5 months ago I decided to get my ducks in a row and had my employer sign an Employment Certification Form. After I submitted this form my 6 student loans were transferred from Navient to Fedloan servicing. I noticed that fedloan labelled my loans differently from navient. Navient called 4 of them direct unsubsidized loans or direct subsidized loans. Fedloan calls them direct unsubsidized or subsidized STAFFORD loans. 
I looked at the faq for PSLF and it looks like in order to qualify for PSLF the stafford loans need to be consolidated and the clock will restart for repayment. I would have in essence wasted 2.5 years and the money i put into those student loans. Am I correct in this assessment?  I looked at my master promissory noted and i indeed have stafford loans. 

Im waiting on fedloans to send me a letter to say how many eligible payments i have made but that will take up to 3 more months. If i need to consolidate loans i would rather due it sooner rather than later. 

My loans are as follows if it matters:

Direct unsub Stafford loan-$19,816.61 @ 5.41%

Direct unsub Stafford loan-$21,434.79 @ 6.8%

Direct sub Stafford loan-$7,877.20 @ 6.8%

Direct unsub Stafford loan-$12,163.45 @ 6.8%

Direct student plus loan-$45,561.40 @ 6.41%

Direct student plus loan-$35,209.05 @ 7.9%

I believe the 2 plus loans are currently eligible for the loan forgiveness.

personalfinance,What's the benefit of credit unions?,"I have an excellent credit score and always make sure I avoid all the potential fees on my bank and credit accounts. Is there a reason someone like me would benefit form banking with a credit union as opposed to a larger bank?

As far as I understand, most of the benefits of credit unions come from the fact that they aren't trying to screw over their customers. But as someone who has a relatively good understanding of how consumer banking and credit cards work, I'm pretty sure that I actually benefit from the fact that banks charge so many fees and higher interest than credit unions, because the money they take from the people who pay those fees is then shared with me in the form of signup bonuses and low interest rates that try to get my business in hopes that I slip up and also have to pay fees or interest.

Basically what I'm asking is whether my understanding of the situation is correct, or if there's some benefit of credit unions that I'm failing to see. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,NZ Young Adult | Starting University Soon - Poor | Trying to Figure Out My Options,"Hey guys! I'm a seventeen year old bloke and I've been looking into my options regarding the next five years or so of my life. I know with absolute certainty that I'll be going to University either next year or after a gap year. I'll likely study a double major of economics and communications and possibly go on to do postgraduate in one of them. This would hopefully give me diverse career options in marketing, business, politics, media or journalism, as well as a handful of other things. Apologies in advance for a wall of text. The things I'm currently taking into consideration are:

---------

**My Skills:**

* I currently hold a valid first-aid certificate which will expire at the end of the year. I'm looking into courses to get this renewed.

* I have two years of work experience at a nearby ski-field. I work in a very versatile position that often moves around to support other departments and as a result have experience in retail, customer service, administration and as a kitchen-hand/server. 

* As a reasonably out-going person who's partaken in a few employment workshops, I feel like I'm reasonably capable of finding employment, though I definitely don't expect it to be easy.

---------

**Financial Situation:** 

* To be blunt. My family is poor. Not *poverty* poor, but we don't exactly have a uni trust-fund. I already have an older brother in university and my parents were able to help him pay for residence in the halls (dorms), but not much else. I expect that same treatment if not worse, seeing as the last few years have made our household income less reliable than ever.

* Because of this, I expect to rely almost entirely on student loans and a part-time job in order to finance my studies. Seeing as I'm currently sitting on about $200 (and am owed $150) and don't expect to earn more than $300-$500 before I leave for uni. I expect to live frugally. Uni students always do. As a white male, I do not qualify for many scholarships, but am applying where I can and due to my good grades, have managed to get into a few scholarship exams. I don't intend to rely on getting these scholarships when planning my future, they'd just be a nice safety-net.

* Luckily, the student loan system in my country is very forgiving. Assuming I stay in the country, I'll have an interest rate of nil because I'm contributing to the economy. If I leave the country to travel (which I intend to do) after studying, I'll receive interest around 5% iirc. I will not be required to make minimum payments but if I haven't paid of the debt in ten years I won't be allowed home. I don't intend to be gone that long. 

* I still feel that having a job will be absolutely necessarily for me to leave university with any sort of financial stability. I plan to withdraw the maximum loan each year and invest and compile interest until I graduate, before paying back what I have left. I plan to seek out a job within days of arriving at uni.

* If I should so choose, I may be able to get a full-time job next year as an assistant vet-technician and take a gap-year to make some money before uni, but I won't know for sure until August.

* After some deliberation, I've decided that I don't particularly care about being incredibly financially stable for quite a while, as I'm rather adventurous and don't have a lot of (read: any) material wants as of right now. As long as I can score a cheap flat with a few room-mates I'll be happy.

-----

**My Questions:**

1. First and foremost, **What skills should I look to acquire in the coming months?** I want to be as versatile, capable and employable as possible. I need every advantage I can get over the job market and my presumably competitive courses. What skills or workshops would you recommend I look for? Are there any skills I can learn easily at home?

2. **What is your opinion on a working gap year?** I understand that taking the year off will leave me far better off economically. There's no real financial downside to it, especially as I can still live at home, which is far cheaper. Though I would of course want to help my family with utilities and the like, I'd still have far more money going into university than I would otherwise. 

3. **What jobs are available to me?** What part-time work would you suggest I pursue, given the skills I listed? What in your opinion is most suitable for a student, based on hours, pay and available experience? I also understand that the basic labour market is bouncing back and expanding at a pretty substantial rate, but would it be possible for me to even find part-time work as a laborer on say, a construction site? Or in a factory? In expect that the pay would be higher, but the hours might be difficult to negotiate.

4. **What am I missing?** I'm seventeen. I'm not gonna kid myself and pretend that I've covered all the bases. I'm positive that there are options I haven't considered. Circumstances I haven't foreseen and things I need to look into. What would you suggest?

personalfinance,Refinancing Auto Loan - Need suggestions on next move. Car payment currently too high.,"Hello all - first time posting here. Little background on my current situation.

First of, I had terrible credit at the time. My father opened a lot of credit cards under my name and maxed them all out. They're all in collections by now. So I've had bad credit since I turned 18.

I bought a car on Sept. 2014 - a 2015 Kia Forte. Price was $22,036. I put down $3,500 and the dealership gave me a $750 rebate for a total of $4,250. This brought the total balance to $17,786. Stupidly I agreed to the extended warranty for an extra $2,214. 

Anyway - I got a loan for the car for $20,600 at an annual interest rate of 14.78% for 72 months. This comes out to a monthly payment of $432.72.

Currently I owe $14,287 on the car. Currently I live with my parents so I can afford the payments for now but I'm I definitely want to reduce them. I looked at some credit unions and they're willing to give me a loan for what the car is worth - $11,500 at an interest rate of 10.6% (forget exact number). The remainder of the balance I will have to pay off myself.

I wouldn't have too much of a problem paying my monthly payment if the car was something worthwhile or a little bit nicer. What destroys me is having to pay such a high price for such a basic car - a car I'm unhappy driving.

My question is - should I refinance with this Credit Union and stay with this car? Sure it'll reduce my monthly payments to something like $306 but I don't know. Someone said to me why don't I trade in my car to a used dealership for some thing nicer. Will other Credit Unions look at my case and give me the same deal?",finance
personalfinance,Where's the best place to put my money?,"Hi, there. I just want to say thank you in advance to anyone who can leave some sort of advice!

I am 26 years old and about 9 months ago I started my career as a physician assistant. I work in a rural area as a family medicine practitioner, which is about an hour drive each way. After school, I accumulated about $150,000 of student loan debt. Since working, I have paid off approx $20,000 by being as aggressive as possible with my payments. (Student loans are an avg of 6% interest rate)

I was fortunate enough to be accepted into the Student Loan Repayment Program for my state. The award is $45,000 in exchange for a 2 year commitment. They will pay $5,625 every quarter for the two years towards my loans. This will start in October, first pay out will be around December. I can apply again after my 2 years and I hear that it is easier to get accepted again.

Since I started working, I chose to put most of my money towards my loans, which are an average of 6% interest rate. As such, I've only saved about $4500 in savings, and contributing 3% into my 401K. 

Since being awarded the loan repayment assistance, I was wondering what I should do. Should I continue making aggressive payments (on top of the loan awards) to get completely out of debt in ~2 years, and keep neglecting savings/retirement for now? Should I back off my payments and focus more on savings/401K? Should I make less on my payments and pay more into my husband's student loan debt (he owes about $20,000, 6% interest rate)? Should I make less on my payments and save for a house that will be closer to my work, making it a bearable drive and save on wear/tear/gas of the car - then consider applying for another 2 year commitment?

investing,"Why I'm not sold on the ""Death of Retail""/Amazon Hype","I'm up in Canada (not in the middle of the Arctic) but rather close to Toronto. I work part time in retail (an automotive, commercial, and rural type store). I had a guy come in looking for a product, however we do not sell it, and neither did any retail competitor. 
He could easily buy the product from Amazon, however he claimed that he had to pay around $50 to ship the product (which was around its actual price), plus the exchange rate, plus possible duty fees. So a $50 product just turned into a ~$150 product. On top of that, he needed the product right away, not in 2 weeks (but most likely longer). 

This is a super specific example, however there's most likely thousands of similar scenarios that happen every day. 
I'm just not sold on the hype, ""Amazon is killing retail"". In a sense, they literally are, but there are plenty of people (in the US and Canada) who, for whatever reason, cannot rely on Amazon (or any e-commerce) for certain products at certain times. 
If you lived in metropolitan New York, LA, or modern cities, there'd be no problem with ordering some random thing off of Amazon, and getting it the next day. But at the same time, there's going to be a person who may not have internet access (rural area), who may need to directly witness a product (like clothes or shoes), or someone who needs something right away (without having to pay a premium). 

Even with the whole ""pay on your phone, get food delivered"" movement. Although it is much more convenient, it seems to appeal to an odd market (alike those in e-commerce). *You can easily get a product without having to pay for it to be delivered.* 

Now is a time where money flows through the economy nicely (record low interest rates). When money becomes harder to get, and more expensive (higher rates), will people still pay for these added premiums on products that they could've easily bought in a retail store? 

With that, I just want to start a discussion about this. Maybe it's my experiences, but I cannot seem to understand this societal/economic movement towards online shopping (specifically Amazon). Even in the markets, how could so much potential be entrenched into Amazon, and so little belief in retail?",finance

This protects our value of primary pairings, however this shouldn't startle certain secondary cryptos that offer a value accepted by their inherent market values.

As I am not allowed to spend my money on it I have been thinking about taking out a loan for it. You don't have to start paying back on it until you graduate. I don't know the interest rate but I am guessing it is kind of high.

The total amount of money I want to take out is &lt; $3k on the high side, and probably $1-2k.

I spend a lot of time making music, it has personal importance to me, so it is kind of investing in myself, even if technically the interest is working against me.

I am guessing I will have less time available for music once school starts up but I will still have some spare time.

What do you guys think, are there any obvious pitfalls to avoid here?

personalfinance,"To take a long term disability lump sum buy-out, or not to take it??","That is my question.

General facts:  Left a white collar gig a few years ago because of organ diseases (verifiable via MRI’s).  Long term disability (LTD) insurance policy from work determined me disabled for my occupation and any occupation (also qualified for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) on 1st application).   I have 20 years of payments coming to me.

I was just offered a lump sum payment to close my claim that comes in at 1/3ish the total value (yes I get it’s the Present Value of the $ but it’s still hard to swallow) or about 6 years worth of payments.  Tax attorney confirmed my lump sum is tax-free.  I’ve talked with a tax attorney, my disability attorney, and financial planners.  This is a big decision so all input appreciated.

Some Pros:
It gets the insurance off my jock, I no longer have to provide paperwork whenever they want it (and opens me up to cancellation for any reason they create), don't have to constantly look over my shoulder at who’s cell phone is up and possibly making a video of me carrying groceries that the insurance co can twist for their benefit (which makes me disabled AND paranoid, a great combo!).

A bird in the hand- I’ll have a chunk of cash (6ish years isn't chicken feed and I don't know how long I will live- no one has that crystal ball).  I will do my best to invest the $ (I’ve saved a couple years of funds I can live off of), however if you’ve lived through the 2000’s internet bust or the 2007-8 real estate bubble and recession you know even the best investing can't protect you from large (40%) losses.  Also investment gains are taxed, while my monthly payments aren't so growing the money will cost me unknown amounts in taxes.  Also it is doubtful I will make enough returns to match the 20 years of payments (1% interest in your current savings account anyone?).

It would maybe provide seed $ to allow me go back to work if I feel up to part-time work which, despite our politician’s suggestions the disabled are lazy malingerers, I’ve dreamed about since the last time I stepped out of my office.  I dream of working for myself or creating a start-up,  both of which my health may never actually allow.  But a guy can dream, right?

Cons
Last year insurance CEO said he wants to shave 11 billion dollars from their budget and despite terrible quarter-to-last-year’s quarter earnings they appear to be highly rated and have $ in the bank (but I think WaMu did too when they failed) so they could always go under and the I get screwed (my state insurance commission backing wouldn't cover the full amount they owe me).   Also despite being a top-5 insurance company their future seems uncertain lately given deregulation (removal of Dodd Frank and ""too big to fail"" status) only makes it easier for them to bail on commitments (not here to argue politics, this is how I see it).  

In the last year they closed their individual disability and long term care policy sales so they want out of the business and fired much staffing this area (I lost my long-time caseworker suddenly).  ERISA laws govern so my research shows no real consumer protections allowing “insurance” companies to close cases whenever they feel like it (like to retaliate for me not taking lump sum) which requires those of us who are disabled to hire lawyers, sue in federal court and maybe 2 years later the insurance co says “sorry” and hopefully reopens your case.  Worth it for them because they have plenty of $ to deal with these lawsuits and in hopes I can't wait 2 years for payments or best for them I will die in that time.     

If our president does away SSDI, theoretically the insurance contract is for X% of my salary which they paid until I was eligible for SSDI, which they reduced their payments by SSDI’s amount.  They may then be on the hook to pay the amount of my SSDI again (bringing the amount they pay back up to X%) should the president remove this benefit as he suggested in May.  So if I settle I could loose what amounts to an additional almost ½ a monthly insurance payment should SSDI go away.

Thoughts?  Thanks.

personalfinance,23 year old senior in college getting a divorce - need help getting on my feet.,"Hi all, first time poster - I read through the sidebar info and hopefully I'm doing everything right. Thanks in advance for reading.

My wife and I have been married for three years. We've decided to split up. Everything is perfectly amicable and agreeable so we will not be needing to pay for any sort of extra legal fees.

She is absorbing the debt of a credit card that was taken out in her name and I am taking on the debt of a loan we took out together a few years back to buy a camper ($5,660 left on that with a 19.26% interest rate.... I know). We have made monthly payments on this since we took it out.

I also have a credit card in my name which I owe $1,867.41 on. This card has been closed for a while and I have not made any payments on it in a while. Certainly, this has affected my credit in such a way that any loans or credit are not an option for me. Which is probably a blessings because I don't want any more debt anyway.

We have no real assets to divide aside from the camper we purchased which is going to become my responsibility. I view this more as a burden than an asset though to be honest. It needs some work before it can be sold and even then, I don't expect to get more than a couple thousand dollars off of it (which we've agreed will be split 50/50 between us if/when I get around to selling it). Neither of us own vehicles. 

I live in Portland, Oregon. I make roughly $300 a week (plus maybe $80 a week in tips but until now, that money has been spent before it's even counted most of the time) or $1,200 per month (during the Summer while I'm not in school) and I don't qualify for OHP or SNAP... I'm assuming this is because I'm legally married and with our joint income, I'm over the qualifying limits for both?

If I can sort out financial aid, I'll graduate with my bachelors in December 2017. I'm not positive about these numbers, but I think that I'll have about $5-6,000 student loans upon graduation.

I'm hoping y'all can lend some guidance/encouragement in regards to the following questions:

Should we legally divorce ASAP so that I can qualify for food and health benefits? I can't afford private health insurance and I'm not going to be able to easily afford food once I move out of our shared apartment.

How do I find an affordable place to live where I can live with my young dog? (I'm taking on the responsibility of my pup)

How do I save enough money to buy a cheap, yet reliable car so that I can work more hours and possibly pick up a second job?

My monthly budget (currently) breaks down to the following:
$10 Spotify

$31 Phone

$32 wifi

$97 short term private health insurance (until open enrollment or ohp?)

$40 pet insurance (i know this one seems frivolous but it will be among the last things to go...)

$205 groceries (this includes all of my dogs monthly expenses as well)

$70 health (this gets put into an envelope in case I have to visit the doctor - because it's $30 a visit with this shit insurance I have - but it mostly gets spent on pizza at the end of the month)

$5 goes into the savings account at WF because they make you pay $5 a month to keep your savings account open

$60 Utilities 

$350 (This is only so low because she has a nicer job than I do and a ton of free spending money - she is paying 

$650 a month and I do all of the housework in return - This low rent is going to make moving into my own space very difficult because it will certainly be much more expensive)

$210 that big fuckin loan with 20% interest
_____________

$1,110 per month

and I make approx. $1,200 (not including tips)

It'd be cool if I could say that the $90 surplus has been going into a savings account and I have a few hundred dollars saved up but... again, pizza and the like. Felt secure with a shared income. Wasn't a big deal. Don't know what to do now. Help me make a plan?

What's the most efficient way to get a car, get my own space, get rid of these ridiculous debts, and get stable?

We plan on applying for PSLF in case that changes, but likely we need to plan to pay off his loans in full in 10 years or less.

Future plans: we want kids, starting in approx 1-2 years. We want a house but not for at least 3 years. We have a 3 month emergency fund, and until 2 weeks ago I was the sole bread winner.

Me: income 122K, fed loans 165K@6.5%,

Hubby: income 49K the next 3 years (residency), fed loans 227K@~8% (site down, cannot verify but I recall it being around 7-9%). After residency his income will be around 100K.

1:Pay loan w/extra money from his income + budgeting. Stop contributing to Roths for both of us, allowing EXTRA $11K annually to pay down his loan.

Most of our team are young single people who work in high-tech and are in very different income brackets than our sponsored family will be. We're a bit in over our heads when it comes to budgeting for a family but we're trying to learn.

It's likely that only the father will be able to work to start, and we figure we should prepare for the worst and assume he can only land a full-time minimum wage job. ($20,000/year). The mother might be able to work part-time but this would result in daycare costs.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans as fast as I can or invest my monthly surplus?,"(All amounts are slightly rounded off for easier explanation). 

Main questions: 1) Should I pay my minimum balance on my student loans and invest instead into a Roth IRA or other growth investment, save up for a house, or focus on paying off loans as fast as possible? 2) Same question, with loans bought out by private investor and then owing $222/mth at 4%?

My situation: I make $43,500 a year. I am 43 years old, single with no add’l income, health care covered by the VA, car paid off, auto and renter’s insurance above minimum requirements but affordable. I rent. I have $11,000 in savings for emergencies. I max my 401(k) with 100% matching 4% of my pay. I could bump 401(k) up to 8% pay with that second 4% at 50% match. I also have a separate Roth IRA with $33K in it. (Sorry, a lot of percent signs).

Details: My federal student loans total $24,000, most of it at 6.8% and about $6k of it at 4.5%. Currently, after maxing my 401(k), paying the minimum loan payment of $181, paying my bills and leaving a little for quality-of-life expenses, I usually have between $300-$600 a month left over (I know, right? I budget well and keep expenses really low). I currently dump my monthly surplus into my loans, some months breaking $800/month total into my loans.

I have a private investor interested in buying out my loans, and keeping contract with me to pay back $222/month at 4%. He is a lawyer and life-long friend interested in a good investment and helping me. I think it's a good idea, regardless, but would like to hear from ya’ll.

I don't know how to calculate the long-term value of making minimum payments in these situations: investing that surplus, OR saving for a house, OR paying off loans as fast as I can, which would take four years at $500 a month, 4 ½ if I didn’t get bought out by my investor.

Bitcoin,How I buy and sell Bitcoin,"Firstly, I get paid.

I send my tax liabilities to a separate account, deduct living expenses (to cover fixed outgoings, not including groceries, goods or eating out) until my pay is next due, give 5% of my income to a few causes (I believe in a better world, so I finance those who are working on that), and then the next Saturday after receipt of my salary, buy Bitcoin with the remainder.

I choose Saturdays, because Day Traders, by definition, close their trades at the end of each day, and on days off their money isn't in the market (unless they are also investors, or swing traders, but not all are).
Many Day Traders have children or partners, and I believe are most likely to take Saturdays off, of all days of the week.
So, I believe this is on average the best day for investors to buy. I haven't done much research into this, though.

Many would call this reckless - putting so much into such a volatile asset, but I have enough money set aside (spread across about 15 stocks) to pay my living costs for 6 months, if I require it. I would sell these before I sell my Bitcoin, because I feel less confident about my stocks than Bitcoin. This is quite simply because, the stock markets of the world are reliant upon the Quantitative Easing programs of the ECB, Japanese government, Chinese government, Federal Reserve. Without these programs, it is widely held that the stock markets will enter a nosedive, of which there is uncertainty where the bottom will be found. This is the position of most countries, and their justification for these programs.
I believe these programs will continue for this same reason - and this again, is a good reason to hold onto my Bitcoin, which is positively affected by this creation of money without corresponding value (QE). At the same time, if these programs were to end, I believe Bitcoin would benefit more than my stocks.
Why have stocks at all, then? They are uncorrelated assets, that is all - diversification is a necessity, if you want to try to avoid black swan events wiping you out. When the next recession hits, I intend to wait until about 12 months in, and then gradually increase my stocks position to cover 12 months of living expenses - the risk of unemployment at this time will have grown, I believe Bitcoin might at this time be temporarily overbought, and I expect stocks to be much more reasonably priced. I won't be doing this by selling any of my Bitcoin position, though, unless it's over 10 years from now!

Over the course of the month, I stick an advert up every 3-5 days on LocalBitcoins, and sell enough to pay for the next 3-5 days.
This takes a little bit of work, but most of the time, it gets me a discount off whatever I'm buying, and I'm making it easier for others to obtain small quantities of Bitcoin quickly and easily. I usually find a buyer within half an hour. Sometimes we'll have a chat, I recommend it.
I will never sell - I believe in this community, I believe that there are more than enough people who, like myself, will never sell out, no matter how much money we are offered (unless it is far above the market rate, and you can be certain that you will be able to instantly buy back in at a lower price). The majority will go to causes when I die - I can't think of a better way for my life to have real meaning. I don't use a bitcoin debit card as they offer uncompetitive rates and put money in the pockets of Visa/Mastercard. I use cash for in person payments. Except at my barber, who accept Bitcoin using Mycelium (they're a hodler).

You might wonder why I go to the effort of buying and selling throughout the month.
If you look at the price of Bitcoin, it goes up. This means that by doing this, you benefit from a discount on everything.
Ah, but what if Bitcoin starts going down? Well, that's fine by me, it means that I can afford to buy more. As we have seen many times before, it will always go up again - look at the price of Gold historically.
There is a limited supply, of an extremely useful good (programmable electronic cash), and a rapidly growing world population, which have grown up after the birth of the Internet. The end result of all this is not debatable, in my humble opinion.

personalfinance,I'm upside down on my loan and needing advice,"Just curious as to my options here. I'm 24 and I currently own a 2013 Nissan Altima. I bought it about a year and a half ago from the Nissan dealer. My interest rate is 9% but the car is worth 11-12 and I owe around 15k on it. I bought it on a whim because I wanted a new car soooo bad and had only had clunkers up to that point. Anyways I'm tired of this I would rather go back to owning a car that's far less expensive that I don't owe on but I'm not sure how to go about it. I'm not savvy on financial stuff so don't hate me too much. I'm assuming my only option is to maybe save up the difference of my loan and pay it down to where I can sell my car. Just curious to see of some advice out there. Thanks

personalfinance,College Student with no debt looking for advice to secure financial future,"Hi /r/peronsalfinance,

I'm a 19 year old junior in college studying Chemical Engineering. Luckily, I was able to get a full scholarship to my state university. I started browsing personal finance around the end of 2016 and have attempted to get my financial life together. 

Since I have no student loans, I opened up a savings account at the start of 2017 with the goal of saving up 10K by the end of the year. Currently I've saved up about 6K, but am unsure of I will be able to obtain 10K by the end of the year though I should come close. 10K is a pretty generic number and I just choose it because it seemed like a good goal. My main question regarding my savings account is what should I do when I reach my 10K goal? Currently it is sitting in a Bank of America savings account gaining about 0.1% APY. I know that that interest rate is pretty low and a lot of people suggest using Ally Online banking because of the higher interest rate but I opened with Bank of America because I also have a checking account and a credit card opened with Bank of America. Apart from where I keep my money, is there anything I can to do to make my money grow besides having it sit in a savings account? If so, how much should I leave in my savings account and what should I do with the rest? Following the flow chart from the sidebar, I have no expenses or any debt. The 10K is supposed to be my emergency fund and I don't work full time for anyone that I would be able to put money into a retirement account for. What's left is investing, though I am not sure if this is the correct thing for me.

My second question relates to my credit. I opened up a Bank of America Cash Rewards card at the beginning of 2017 and had a $700 credit limit. After waiting 6 months, I saw from Bank of America that my credit score was 759, which is pretty good I think. I know that a portion of your credit score is based on the % utilization of your credit, but I have some confusion about that. I have read that it is good to keep your utilization at ~10%, which I have tried to do, but I am not sure if what I'm doing it correct. The way I generally use my credit card is to use it for whatever I need to buy for that month. Before the due date I will pay off however much I need to pay off so that my balance is at 10% of my total credit. Then I usually don't use my credit card until the closing date where the bill for the next month is created. Is this the right way to be using my credit card? Do I have 10% utilization the way I am doing so? I know lower utilization is good, so I also asked for a line of credit increase from 700 to 2500, but they countered with 1500. This was after 6 months of owning my credit card. I think I will ask again in 6 months for another line of credit increase. I plan to continue to do this every six months. Is this a bad idea?

 I was also considering opening up another credit card since I have read that the average age of your credit cards is also a metric that is used in calculating your credit score. I figure if I open up a few credit cards now, when I am older and need a good credit score for taking out loans that it would help improve my credit score. Should I bother with this or should I just stick with my one credit card for now. If it's not a bad idea, which credit card should I open up? If I open one up, then it should be a good credit card since I would presumably be using it for the rest of my life. I heard that as your credit increases, you can open up credit cards with better rewards and that Chase has good credit cards. I don't buy too much of anything and am pretty happy with the rewards I get on my BoA card (3% back on gas and 2% on groceries). 

My last concern is that my parents are getting old and my dad will be retiring soon. Most likely when I get out of college or a year after that (2-3 years). My mom doesn't work at all so she will not have any social security benefits. From what I have seen, my dad does not have a lot of money saved up for his retirement. He will have approximately 150K saved up by the time he retires. Judging by the 4% rule and what I have researched about social security pensions I figure he will get 12K a year (6K from his savings and 6K from social security). By the time he retires, he will have paid off the house. Other than that I don't think he will have any large expenses. Is 12K a year enough to support two people? I know my parents typically spend 100 dollars on groceries a week, so that's 5.2K a year alone... It does not seem like a lot to me. Considering that my dad makes 50K, that will be a huge decrease in income. I hope to secure a good engineering position after college and am ok with giving my parents money, but will I be able to do so without compromising my own financial future?

Sorry that this post has a bunch of random topics thrown together. I have had these concerns on my mind for quite awhile but have never had the courage to ask.

My main goal is to graduate college debt free or under less than 10k.

I'm pretty sure I will qualify for financial aid if I didn't have that money saved up but I could throw it in a Roth IRA since retirment accounts don't count as an asset for Financial Aid so I would probably qualify.

personalfinance,American Express Platinum Card - max number of recommended credit cards,"Good Evening PF,

I just wanted some quick input on credit cards. I currently have 2 credit cards. Navy Federal with a 9,000 dollar limit and a USAA with a 15,000 dollar limit.

The Navy fed has a 1.5% cash back and the USAA has a 2.5% unlimited cash back. I rarely use the Navy Fed one but I have heard canceling a credit card can hurt your credit score since it is reduces your total available credit.

I carry zero balance on these card (statement balance paid in full every month).

I recently learned that military with good credit are able to get the AMEX Platinum without having to pay the $500 yearly fee. I travel a decent bit and could make use of all the airline perks that are associated with it. I just don't want to negatively affect my credit score by having too much available credit/too many cards even though they are obviously all paid for each month. 

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

personalfinance,Where should I put my extra savings?,"I've been reading the wiki pages and following the sub pretty well (even contributed a few comments myself from things I've learned). Now I'm trying to look at what to do with my current savings, and how to plan any extra income I receive. 

Here are the basics:

married with 2 young kids - wife is a stay-at-home mom, so I am the sole provider, paying for food, diapers, the works

Income/savings:

* 75k income (before tax) - approx 45-50k take home pay after tax/insurance/401k

* 25k in savings (US Bank, making near no interest - I plan to move to Ally per suggestion of this sub)

* I also have a mutual fund with about 5k and an IRA with about 10K, then my 401k through employer is on track, have to check exact amount

* 2 cars, no loans on them

Debt:

* 61k mortgage (on a 70k house) at 4% interest (Side question: is refinancing worth considering for a better rate?)

* 17k my fed student loans at 5.375% with Navient

* 53k wife's fed student loans at 5.375%

* 4800 private student loan at 5.7%


The question really is.. what should I do with the money in my savings? I think 25k is too much to just sit there.. I have a stable income and pretty good job security.

I think step one is just knock out the highest interest (and lowest total) student loan. Should I do that immediately? If so, should I stop there or put any other money somewhere?

I can do graduated repayment which will lower my monthly payments to just the interest for 12 months, but this would still use up ALL of my readjustment allowance that Peace Corps offers, and is supposed to help with readjusting after service, though many use it for paying off private student debt.

Does anyone know of a company to consolidate with that has lower interest rates, defers for volunteer service/economic hardship, or has an income based repayment option?

I think if I can consolidate to a company and switch to a 20 year plan then I should be alright. Citizens Bank requires bachelor's degree holders like myself to make their first 3 payments first before switching over to them. So theoretically I could do my first 3 payments with graduated interest, then have a cosigner or POA switch over to Citizens Bank and consolidate them and change the loan term to a 20 year plan. I say having a POA do it because by the time I make my first three payments I will likely be in a rural area of Senegal.

Forex,Auto-trading fun with Bollinger bands [Novice level].,"Whilst we have a fair few 'novice' posts about TA and Global Macro (aka ""Fundamentals""), there aren't too many involving auto-trading. Seeing as I'm in the middle of teaching myself MQL4, I thought I'd throw this out there as discussion prompter. 

By ""novice"", I mean someone who has moved beyond complete beginner (""what's a FOMC and a NFP?"") but still not deploying robust and market ready strategies (""how does market structure affect news event response?""), so constructive criticism, informed commentary or taking the ideas and developing them further are very much the point of sharing in the first place. It's not meant to be a showcase of code, because the code is a mess!


This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/6p0e70/anyone_else_just_use_bollinger_bands_and_mean/) got me thinking about how relatively trivial it would be to implement a Bollinger Band mean reversion autotrader.

**Project Goals**

My interest in the project was as a way to begin development of a skeleton EA that would use a custom indicator to implement trade signals. The point of this would be to allow for faster prototyping of visually based autotrading before taking it to the testing environment. The key advantage of this is that you can see on your charts which entries are being *missed*, something that is much more laborious to do via visual mode in the strategy tester.

**Concept Development**

So to begin the project, I sketched out the concept.

One way to trade Bollinger Bands is to trade the reversion to the mean. Intuitively, we expect that wider deviations from the mean will result in more reliable reversions to the  mean. To explore this we could enter when price breaches the second SD band and then returns back inside it. 

Here's the default Bollinger Band on default settings in MT4, demonstrating this sort of behaviour:

http://i.imgur.com/dK2oDO7.png

**Prototyping**

I want to use the indicator, and not the EA, to generate trade signals, as this is the point of the project for me. Because I'm lazy and grew up coding in basements, I opt to fiddle with the default indicator code rather than build up from scratch.

My first goal is to add two things.

Firstly, I want to add another layer of bands, because I saw a set up like that a while ago and liked it. (This is not a very good reason, and I think it costs me down the track).

Secondly, I want to add in a way to visually indicate the trade signals before we pass them to the EA.

Adding another set of bands is just a copy and paste of the existing bands. My learning point here is that I need to adjust the amount of buffers to match the number of bands I want. This comes into play for adding the trade signal arrows, as they need to go in the same sort of structure as the second lot of bands. 

[I know from reading about the project goals in advance that EAs access custom indicators via iCustom(). This function can only receive the contents of one of the first 8 indicator buffers. Thus the idea will be that the buffer that marks out the trade entries on the indicator will later be used by the EA to mark out where entries should be. It's possible this is not the best way for EAs to access custom indicators , so input from more experienced coders is welcome!]

After a bit of tweaking typos, the indicator now displays two sets of bands, one at 1x SD and one at 2xSD from the mean (moving average). It also has two buffers that will use the DRAW_ARROW style to mark out potential trades.

**Adding trade logic**

I still can't decide if it's better to isolate the logic code in the Custom Indicator or the EA, in the long run. There seem to be performative, stylistic and redundancy issues, but for the moment the project is to put the logic in the Indicator, so that's what I did.

The fastest way to prototype this idea seems to be identifying when price *closes* outside of the far band. 

This is trivial to achieve. We compare the close to the two outer bands, and if it's outside them, then we set the relevant trade signal buffer.


//
     
     double tempclose = close[i];
     
     if(tempclose&gt;(ExtUpperUpperBuffer[i]+10*Point))
     {
     SellSignalBuffer[i] = high[i]+(20* Point);
     }
     else
     {
     SellSignalBuffer[i] = 0;
     }
     
    if(tempclose&lt;(ExtLowerLowerBuffer[i]-10*Point))
     {
     BuySignalBuffer[i] = low[i]-(20*Point);
     }     
     else
     {
     BuySignalBuffer[i]=0;
     }
     
     }





It works!

http://i.imgur.com/Ak3UkkK.png

Green arrows successfully mark out possible sell entries where price closes above the top band, and red arrows mark out possible buy entries when price closes below the lower band. 

The logic can be a lot more complicated than this obviously, but the point of my project is to develop the iCustom technique, rather than make a good autotrader.

Now it's time to switch to the EA.

personalfinance,Should I take a semester/year off of college?,"Crossposted to r/studentloans. Thank you in advance for paying attention to such a lengthy post.

I finished my first year of college this past May, but I am now on academic probation due to motivational issues, poor time management, and possible depression. As a result, I am no longer eligible for federal/school financial aid due to SAP requirements. I calculated that I would be able to repair my academic standing in one semester, were I to finish my courseload (11 A-F credits and 2 P/F credits) with a 3.22 GPA or better. Until then, I would need to pay for this upcoming semester out of my own pocket.

Before I list out expenses, I first want to state that I was initially considering transferring to a local community college, but I realized that is not an option due to my GPA in those courses not being able to transfer to my current school, basically disallowing me to be admitted to my prospective major.

Before summer ends I will be able to have at least 1400 saved up (at least 1750 if I'm able to get my security deposit back from my current/old apartment). As tuition and fees come out to 14488 for the 2017-18 academic year, that totals 7244 I have to pay before I can have access to financial aid again. I will be able to contribute my savings to my tuition bill and enroll in a five-month payment plan, reducing my obligation to 1172.80 a month after a $20 payment plan fee.

I currently work at least 34 hours a week at an 11/hr. job, bringing my income to 748 every two weeks (630.19 federal payroll and income taxes as well as MN state income taxes) at the minimum. I intend to continue at least this many hours going into the next school year. I may also receive a 3% annual raise at the end of September (.33 extra per hour) and/or a promotion sometime around then (at least $1 extra per hour), but I will not bank on either of those for the purposes of these calculations.

My job offers a 1000/yr. tuition reimbursement, but I wouldn't be able to access that until the semester is over. The same would apply to the $1000 American Opportunity Tax Credits I will be able to get refunded.

I just signed a new 9-month lease (starting August 30) for an expanded one-bedroom apartment with 2 roommates, bringing my rent+insurance to 550 a month. I'm not sure how much utilities will be yet, but electricity and water/sewage are billed to us (internet is free in our apartment complex).

I'm not sure how much I will have to spend on food, but I assume 400 is roughly the standard. I will try to reduce this total by using r/eatcheapandhealthy standards, but this is a worst-case amount.

I spend 100 on transportation a semester (the cost of a bus/train pass through my school), budgeting to 20 monthly.

My phone bill is 50 a month, which I cannot reduce as I am on a family plan and leaving would increase my rates.

I'm unable to calculate miscellaneous expenses currently. I'm also (thankfully) on my parents' health insurance so I don't have to cover that in this point of my life.

I imagine that being able to pay for school would require me to either work two full-time jobs (impossible if I am to have time to study and improve my grades) or take a semester/year off in order to build up a semester's worth of tuition, unless I were to somehow gain access to an extreme amount of credit or grants. I would find a second job to increase my income if I were to take time off of school.

If I were to take a leave of absence in order to do this, I would have to start paying off the student loans I have, starting in November (when my six-month grace period expires). I have 2200 in Perkins loans at 5% (through the University of Minnesota), 4500 in direct subsidized loans at 3.76% (through Great Lakes), 2000 in direct unsubsidized loans at 3.76% (through Great Lakes), and 2000 in a private loan through my high school at 3.25%. This totals to 10700 altogether (mostly accrued from an expensive dorm my freshman year) and a weighted loan APR of 3.92%. Using a loan calculator, I would have to pay 108 a month for a 120 month term.

Which is my most feasible option, then, attempting to find (expensive/private) credit, or taking a semester/year off to build up my savings to pay for my next semester of college?",finance
personalfinance,Advice on what home loan to take out for repairs.,"Hey guys, So I own a house right out with nothing owed on it (yay!) but it needs a lot of work (boo!) I'm really struggling with choosing the best route to go when it comes to taking out a loan for the much-needed repairs (Windows, siding, new furnace, new electrical box, plumbing and electric, reno two bathrooms, a kitchen and painted top to bottom). 

---The three loans I'm looking at and some of the details as it pertains to me:

• [203k](http://imgur.com/878Qpcp)- In the amount of $60k. Got a quote from a contractor and I'm around $10,000 over so I would either have to skip the windows or the furnace (His words). This contractor is not someone I know or someone who would give me the 'family discount' but with a 203k the contractor does not get paid up front and none of the people I know, while good licensed workers, can up front the cost on such a project. So with this loan, I'd get almost everything done but I would still have to figure out how to get a new furnace or windows, soon. also, this loan and the streamlined one are at a .5% higher interest rate.

---Or I can combine these two loans:

• 203k Streamline- Can take up to $35,000 out and the contractor can get paid up to 50% at the start of the project. I might be able to use the people I know for this one, I still have to ask. With this loan, I would have to focus on the major necessities so when I apply for the Home Equity Loan the bank will see that the house is worth backing (see next loan for more details). I could get the furnace, all electrical, plumbing, and windows done. At the end of this loan, I would have to be sure the house is up to par to qualify for a home equity loan, and I'm not exactly sure how much / what exactly needs to be done for to do that. 

• Home Equity Loan- I originally applied for a $80,000 home equity loan at my Credit Union and it was perfect and at a rate I could afford, but I was denied based on the condition of the house, also everyone I've talked to since says you need to own the house for six months before you can take out an equity loan and they never mentioned that, Sep 15 I will have owned the house for 6 months. The inspection report they gave me after the walk thru was very vague but did mention that the paint was chipped on the garage so I dont know if they are looking to fix cosmetic things before I can apply as well? Taking out this loan I would have free rein over who I use for the remainder of the repairs after the 203k streamline, and I would get a much better price on the work.

---Other factors

• This house was my Grandmothers and passed down to me after her death as a wedding gift by my mother, We did a quick transfer for $1.

• In the deed, there is a contingency that for the next 5 years if I want to sell the house I have to give my mother first right of refusal and only for what I've put into the house, not for the market value ( Gotta save those receipts!) This would prove to the bank that I'm not just flipping the house for profit?

• September 15 I will have owned the house for 6 months

• Cosmetically the house looks rough (heavy nicotene stains on walls) but with paint and new siding it will look brand new, there is nothing wrong structurally 

• 3 out of 4 sides of the house is asbestos siding that can either be removed (Expensive) or wrapped over.

• This is in Upstate NY if that matters

~~~

With all the closing costs would it even be worth taking out a home equity loan after the 203k streamline? or just lump it all into the 203k, with the whole loan being .5% higher interest and losing out on any price cuts I could get. 

Do banks even give you two loans like that?

What do banks look for to give a home equity loan? what would be the best use for the 203k streamline to get the house in shape to qualify?",finance
personalfinance,Should I take out a personal loan to consolidate my debt?,"Hi Reddit, 
I am thinking about refinancing some of my debt to get one monthly payment instead of keeping track of multiple ones per month. This is what I currently have...

~$6,000 @ 6.24% - personal loan to pay for college

~$4,000 @ 0% until October then over 20% - credit card debt 

~$2,200 @ 6.8% - Federal student loan

I have a couple other student loans that are at 3-4% and a car loan. The current rates in my area are about 6.25%. I know that the credit card is better to wait to refinance to avoid paying interest for as long as I can but right now the balance just keeps growing. My hope is that I pay it off with the refinancing and hide it away for emergencies. 

Should I include all of the listed debt? Does it make sense to refinance at the current rate or should I wait until it goes down? Are there better options than going through my current bank?

I'm getting ""kicked out"" because I got my own phone line against my dad's wishes because he feels that if I'm responsible enough to pay for my own phone, then I'm responsible enough to get an apartment, car, and pay for tuition my self. I got my own phone line because he has a 10 year old plan of 30gigs for a discount but it's somewhere north of $300 a month and between the 5 of us in the family, we keep going over. I've tried to get him to move to an unlimited data plan but he doesn't listen to reason and he still thinks he's getting a killer deal.

Private student loans -$4800 at 5.5% APR
Phone bill -$100 a month
Tuition for the Fall 2017 semester - $3500 remaining (due by the end of the week)


I don't have a car. I'm going to try to buy my dad's Lexus that I've been driving for $2500 by the end of the summer. Should I take out a loan or should I liquidate my brokerage?

Also, I will have a much higher paying job over the semester. 

For the tuition, I can take out another private loan without a consigner because I have decent credit. I've considered also moving off campus which would drop the money I owe for tuition but I don't have any roommates so rent would be considerably high. Additionally, part of room and board for school has already been paid for so on campus seems like a more viable option for the fall semester.

When I started applying for credit cards when I was around 19 years old I was denied over and over again but then Discover took me in. I was very careful with that card and paid all my bills on time. 

I took some very foolish advise from my mother on how to pay credit cards off and eventually got into the horrible debt cycle that many of us easily fall into. Something I wish I never would have done because it destroyed my habit of paying off the card.

I am now married, and my wife and I are drowning in Credit Card debt, around $4,200. Around $3,300 from Discover, and the rest on Chase.

Both of those credit cards have interest rates around 23%-25% and it is absolutely killing us. We have no rent, as we are now living we my in-laws. She has a job, making around $15 an hour 40 hours a week. I have a job that is more of a stipend from the University around $800 a month. 

I am starting the semester off in the fall and Tuition is going to be around $4,500 for the semester. I do not qualify for financial aid or federal loans anymore because I have used up my 6 years of financial aid at this University. I am so close to being finished in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics, I am due to graduate in the Fall of 2018. I will be taking two 18 credit semesters and one 16 credit semester.

Tuition, again, will be around $4,500 in the spring of 2018, and most likely around $4,000 in the Fall of 2018. We have no idea how to pay for this without taking more loans, we have even played with the idea of throwing it on the credit card but that sounds like a horrible idea to me.

One conversation I don't see here is about buying corporate bonds. The rates are better than CDs and government bonds.

personalfinance,"""Don't buy a home with cash when interest rates are low, invest!"" - Then why are banks heavy on home loans instead of other investments?","Perhaps I didn't phrase that PF enough, I'm trying to figure out if there's a good reason against buying a home outright, yet the common advice I see is to take the loan, and invest the cash in other places. 

So I want to understand this from the bank's perspective.

I can think of a few possible reasons, but they don't seem like the full picture to me:

* Banks can fractional lend, but can't fractionally invest in, say, stocks (or can they?)
* Investing in home-loan-making diversifies their portfolio
* Some law or tax asymmetry between individuals and banks, that makes it make sense for the banks to loan to home buyers at interests rates worse than what the stock-market bears, and home buyers to use loans instead of cash?
* They shore up their risk by charging interest preferentially upfront. IE even after you've paid them for several years, they still own the underlying asset disproportionately-much to the amount you've paid.
* something else?


From a home buyer's perspective, here are the pros of taking a loan, and I don't see how it'd particularly apply to a cash-laden individual:

* build credit
* get something now, and send the bill to future-you
* diversify your portfolio (at the cost of paying guaranteed interest)

It's been two years since I've pulled my own score, so I'm hard pressed to remember if they have the score on there too or not. 

We're doing this trip so he can visit my family and friends out there, along with seeing where I've grown up firsthand. I'm sure there's plenty of people who've done this before, I'm just not one of them nor is anyone in my immediate circles the sort to use their cards outside of energency and holiday expenses. I'd rather him save the cash towards the trip instead since he's covering for his flight and shelter expense, but he's feeling like it would be a good way to build his credit score to do it this way. I've fallen into the credit card trap before, I haven't had one since paying off about three grand in late cards two and a half years ago and I won't apply for another until I'm feeling secure enough in my abilities to do it again.

I am a doctor and was considering a doctor loan, but we have 20% down payment for the range of homes we want, so I thought it'd be better to do 20% down conventional loan. Our range is $400-500k.  We have about 100k for down payment with some set aside for closing costs/etc.

Surprisingly, according to two different banks, the doctor loan was at a lower % rate than the conventional with 20% down.  I believe neither doctor loan has PMI

Bank 1 Doctor loan: 3.7% interest rate

Bank 1 20% down conventional loan: 3.8%

Bank 2 Doctor loan:  3.75%

We're not going to stay in this house more than 7 or 8 years, most likely. But we may keep it as a rental.  

Or should we invest that  $500 into something else?

I believe paying $4480 for 0.8 points is better because:

1. I have the money.
2. Break even is about 4 years. End of year 4, the 0.8 point option will cost me $229. End of year 5, the 0.8 point option will save me $1182.

Break even calculations: http://imgur.com/a/js9Tt

The downside is if for some reason interest rates plummet 1%+ and I want to refinance within 5 years for a lower monthly payment, then my 0.8 point payment would factor in negatively to my refinancing calculations. Another risk is if I move somewhere else and want to buy a house there instead. I currently don't qualify for a jumbo loan because of my limited credit history of 3 years, so I don't think I can take out another mortgage.

personalfinance,"Just graduated with $85,000 in Student Loans, looking for advice on how to start off my life.","Hello /r/Personalfinance! I have been following this sub for years in preparation for my graduation and eventual repayment of student loans, as well as for general financial advice. Hopefully you guys aren't too sick of the student-loan posts.  

Debt:

I graduated in May from a private school with around $85,000 in student loans. I owe $34,704 @ 4.3% in my own name, and $50,584 @ 6.7% in my mother's name in the form of Parent PLUS loans. My mother cannot afford any payments on my loan, so I will be paying that full amount as well. I know generally that is not the best idea, but it was the only way I was going to go to the school I wanted, and it ended up turning out well for me. 

Income:

I recently accepted my first job, paying $65,000 per year, or $2,500 bi-weekly. This is in my hometown in the Midwest where costs are generally low, and I will be able to live at home for as long as I see fit. There are also bonuses given out at the end of each year, but I am not including those in my income, as they are not guaranteed. 

The position also offers a 401(k) match that will contribute 7% so long as I contribute 6%. 

The plan:

As per the side-bar advice on ""How to handle $"" I am planning on saving towards my emergency fund the first couple months of work before my loan repayments kick in. However, I'm unsure what the amount should be. The guide suggests 3 to 6 months expenses, but living at home I will have very little expenses besides loans and money to run around on. Would $3,000 be enough? 

After I begin working I plan on contributing 6% of my income to my 401(k) so I receive that 7% match (woohoo free money!). After my 401(k) contribution and taxes I estimate my take-home pay will be around $1,700 every two weeks, or $3,400 monthly. After paying for monthly parking and gas, I estimate my monthly take-home will be around $3,100.

With this remaining $3,100 I planned on tackling my loans using the avalanche method. This would mean attacking the $50,584 @ 6.7% first. My question is regarding the length of the term I should choose. If I choose 120 months on that loan, my monthly payments would be $580 per month, which I would add more onto. In the meantime, I planned on paying the $34,704 loan @ 4.3% over 300 months, and paying the $152 per month until the higher interest rate loan is paid off. 

Is this a logical decision? Pay the 4.3% interest rate loan at the minimum amount of $152 over 300 months, while throwing around $1,800 per month at the 6.7% interest rate loan? This would allow me to keep ~$1150 per month for savings and to still spend some money on things that I want to do (hanging out with friends, saving for a new car). 

Goals for the near future:

I currently don't owe anything for my car, but it has over 170,000 miles on it and is barely limping along. I would really like to save up for a more reliable used car within the next year. I would also obviously like to move out on my own as soon as possible, but want to be financially stable first. Would paying off the high interest rate loan and then moving out and continuing to pay on the low interest rate/smaller principle loan make sense? 

Conclusion:

I have what I believe to be a reasonable plan laid out, but am unsure the best format to quickly pay down my loans. Can I pay extra on the minimum amount of the high interest loan each month, or is it better to make extra payments? 

I want to achieve my goal of moving out on my own and having financial independence as quickly as possible. 

TLDR; Student loans of $34,704@ 4.3% and $50,584 @6.7%, income of $65,000/yr. Attempting to formulate the best strategy to kill these loans, but also not live at home for the next 5 years.",finance
personalfinance,Entering graduate program and taking out loans for the first time. Am I calculating the cumulative interest on this loan correctly? And is this too much debt for my anticipated salary?,"Thanks in advance for any help. The staff in my school's financial aid office are incompetent and I keep getting different answers from them about everything related to these loans, so, here I am on /r/personalfinance.

**Question #1**
I'm planning to take out direct unsubsidized loans at an interest rate of 6%, $5,000 per quarter for six quarters. I will owe $30,000 when I graduate, plus interest. I'm trying to figure out how much interest...

According to [https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/interest-rates](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/interest-rates), it sounds like interest compounds daily?

&gt; How is interest calculated?
The amount of interest that accrues (accumulates) on your loan from month to month is determined by a simple daily interest formula. This formula consists of multiplying your loan balance by the number of days since the last payment times the interest rate factor.

&gt; Simple daily interest formula:

&gt; Outstanding principal balance
x number of days since last payment
x interest rate factor
= interest amount

I calculated my interest as if it compounds quarterly and got $6,969...which seems insane for such a short period of time.

This leads to **question #2**: I anticipate owing $36,969 when I graduate. I estimate that my gross salary will be ~50k when I graduate (special ed teacher). I know people on here say don't exceed a 1:1 debt:income ratio and that my anticipated debt:income ratio fulfills this rule, but the loan repayment calculator I'm using says this would require monthly payments of $410 for 10 years to pay off. Or if I wanted it gone in 5 years, $714/month. This seems like too much to deal with each month. 

It's hard for me to imagine how I'm supposed to enjoy life after taxes are taken out of 50k (single, no kids, state income tax), and I contribute to retirement, emergency savings, my student debt, rent (average studio =  $1,200/month), utilities, health insurance, etc. etc. For those of you that have had a similar debt:income ratio, how have you managed to still budget for ""fun"" activities?

EDIT: Thanks for the help guys. I wasn't calculating the interest correctly. My actual debt at graduation will total $31,615, which is a bit more manageable than what I previously anticipated.",finance

personalfinance,"Afni, a debt collection company has been sending me letters about a non existent debt, so I called them today.","It's regarding a Centurylink internet debt for $200. I've gotten three letters from Afni so far, and each time I've called Centurylink to see what it's all about. Centurylink says they have no record indicating I owe them anything. I've been a customer for 5 years and have never missed a billing cycle, so I knew something was wrong. Centurylink said that it is probably a scam. 

So I decided to call Afni today. This whole situation has been bugging me, because I don't really want anything negative to hit my credit. 

When I called, the rep that answered was very straight forward and insisted that I pay this debt as soon as possible, then went to pull up my account. I gave him my account number that was provided with my letter. He then asked for my social, which I declined. He said that was no problem, and asked for the city and state. Once he ""confirmed my identity"" he asked me of o was going to make a payment today, at which I replied that I was calling to dispute the letter. I informed him that Centurylink has no records of ever sending a debt to any collections agencys, and that Afni must be mistaken. The rep went on to blame Centurylink and asked me if I know which system they had looked my my information on, and I replied that it would be something Centurylink would know about, since I do not have knowledge of how their systems work. 

He then got super defensive and raised his voice. He said that I can just let my credit get messed up, or I can pay my debt, but he wasn't going to try to reason with me unless I trusted him. 

I told him that I was merely calling to inform them that they had their information wrong and to contact Centurylink for confirmation. He scoffed and said to call back in a week and hung up on me. 

I am writing this to get reddits opinions. Should I even call him back? I have worked in a few call centers myself, so I always try to be as courteous and clear as I can be.

personalfinance,"I'm buckling down on budgeting, and I estimate being able to save $15K in 2018. What strategies can you advise to pay off loans (vehicle and student), while also having squirreling away for 6-months expenses?","As the title states, looking for some advice on strategically eliminating debt and building savings. My husband and I are generally good with our money (we don't spend more than we earn, contribute regularly to retirement, pay bills on time, no credit card debt, etc.), but we're buckling down in 2018 to be better in general with finances. I estimate that in 2018, we'll have about $15K in new savings (barring extraneous circumstances, that is) after normal budgeting. We have $15K in loans on vehicles (2.9% APR), and $29K in student loans (ranging 3.76% - 6.8% interest). I would also like to have 6 months of expenses saved up (~$22K) as an emergency/slush fund. My goals are to eliminate the loans as quickly as possible, while simultaneously building the emergency expense fund. 

Most of the $15K savings will come from a profit-sharing bonus made by my employer (January 2018). The rest will come from our regular savings contributions, and also self-pay from a side business that I run. *(The self-pay income is approximately 25% of what I earn -- I put 40% away for business operations, and 35% goes towards state and federal income taxes.)* We anticipate these savings being repeatable, as I have no intention of leaving my job, nor quitting my side business.

We currently have $8,600 in savings. We also have some investments that could be quickly liquidated (though we don't want to touch them), and our Roth IRAs (6% salary contribution, employer matches 3% of salary).

Barring any major life changes or emergencies, we expect our incomes and expenses to stay about the same, if not rise slightly. We do expect healthcare and dental bills, probably some vet bills via our dumb-dumb doggo, and vehicle repairs here and there. These items aren't necessarily being budgeted for, but we would consider them expenses to come from our slush fund, as they're very irregular and unpredictable.

I plan to use the snowball method for my husband's student loans. I would also like to pay off the car loans first, as the vehicles won't last forever. What advice do you have to build a strong savings account while also strategically paying off loans? I would like to eliminate both debts within the next 3-5 years.

personalfinance,"College grad. Making good money, spending almost all of it on unusual expenses. How does this budget look?","I'm a recent graduate making great pay for my age ($81k/year, 22yo) matched with unusually high expenses for my age. I'm seeking a [budget critique](http://i.imgur.com/8rwGZS7.png) to see if I'm being unrealistic in certain areas and to ask if there are any opportunities for improvement.

College brought many unexpected twists and turns, one of them being the birth of my now 18-month year old daughter. The arrangement is coparenting, so my budget includes $1,000 for child support. The coparenting arrangement works very well and her mother only needs $600 currently per month. We have agreed to park the additional $400/mo into some type of money market fund so that it can grow while remaining somewhat accessible. We are not comfortable locking it into a 529 where it isn't available. Childcare expenses may go up depending on her employment changes and the purpose of this fund is to help with any surprises. Additionally, this position is unfortunately not geographically convienent to see her. I have added in a cost of $500 to buy a plane ticket to see her each month. 

I have a total of $100,000 in student loans which I will be consolidating soon. The average interest rate before consolidation is ~10%. I'm looking into several options (SoFi + others) which will certainly drop the interest rate but might not drop my monthly payment depending on the number of terms. I will have assistance from my family to pay this off, but only toward the principal. I have to come up with the minimum payments regardless of what I can expect from family.

I realize my 401k contribution could be much better for my income but my expenses are preventing me from making a dent in retirement for the time being. My employer does match 50% up to 5% of my pay so at least I'm not leaving money on the table there. Any extra money per month will either go here or to the loan.

I will most likely be coming off of my parent's insurance and paying my own. I have a car that is paid off. My parents have offered to continue paying the car insurance for the next year. The same is true for my cellphone. I will be living in an expensive part of the country and my living situation will be with 3 other graduate students. This rent/utility figure is truly as low as I can feasibly go. (I don't want to bring my daughter to a crack house if she were to ever fly out).

Finally, one more wrinkle. My income is entirely dependent on government budgets and I will be working in an area that the new administration is not friendly to. My work contract is a year with the opportunity to extend based on performance.

personalfinance,Should I (or my sister) buy my parent's home to help them fix their poor decisions and help with retirement?,"I have a challenging situation is helping my parent, maybe sister, with their finances.

I am financially secure, with some solid savings and I'd like to help some of my family fix their problems. To explain, I was the only family member to go to college, and with respect to finances, my parents and sister are very naïve. They've made very poor decisions, accumulated much debt, and they don't understand interest rates. 

My parents are just retired.
My sister is 30 years from retirement.

My parents have a home worth 150K. They still owe 80k. But they also have 72k in debt. Much of it is car and camping trailer (they love camping), but 20k is a really terrible, exploited, credit card debt (averaging well over 20% interest rates; how is that legal).

**My sister has live with my parent for 15 years.** Makes a decent income, but also terrible high interest debt. Her credit score is around 600. She has no savings.

**Given my sister has been living with my parents for many many years, I thought one good option would be to have her buy my parent's house.** I could help her with the down payment (I do trust her to pay it back, no trust issues here). My parents would give her a good deal, but still make enough gains to pay off the worst of the debts, leaving ample money to 1) pay rent to my sister, 2) have an enjoyable retirement.

My sister would having a highly subsidized mortgage payment (parents paying rent) and tax write off thanks to my parents. Maybe, because she got a good deal on the home, she could also get a loan for a little more than the house, to help with her own debts, even if it's just a little help.

Would this work? Given my sister's poor credit score, credit card debts and lack of savings, maybe buying a home, even is good deal, is not an option? They live in Washington State, if that matters.

**Alternatively, I can buy the home.** I have just enough cash or could set up a mortgage as well. I don't really want the home, but I do want to help them. That said, if I set it up as a mortgage, which they pay off as rent as well as maintain the house, it's as if I bought a rental property, which is not a bad way to diversify my investments. I'm 10-20 years from retiring. I contribute well to my retirement and have some nice stocks. So a property might not be a bad idea.",finance

Bitcoin,Cost of holding bitcoin vs. fiat and DLT shitcoins,"I just made a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6pbqsq/bitcoin_options_will_be_available_this_fall/dkojsmz/) related to bitcoin-based financial instruments and it occurred to me that bitcoin costs virtually nothing to hold.

Of course if you have just $50, you could as well hold that in your pocket (as cash). But those who have significant savings (let's say over US$200,000) are at risk from bank bail-in, taxation and negative interest rates. If they park their savings in DLT shitcoins that doesn't help either (who wants to save in crap backed by absolutely nothing but trust in the corrupt government?). Additionally I believe in the medium and long term the holding of permissioned DLT coins will likely involve a fixed cost (let's say 0.5% per year) to pay for DLT infrastructure.

In case of Bitcoin there's a fee to send, but not to *hold* bitcoin. In that sense keeping one's savings in BTC is not such a bad idea. While you don't earn any interest, you also don't need to pay anything and your counterparty risk is zero so we do away with negative interest rates, fixed charges, bail ins, and so on. 

There is, however, one ""cost"" associated with saving in bitcoin, which is your time - in other words ""constant vigilance against against all enemies, off- and on-chain"". UASF BIP148 volunteers have collectively spent thousands of hours to keep Bitcoin free (as in freedom) as have hundreds of contributors (especially developers) who have done even more. I wish there was a free market way to justly reward these contributors and some altcoins attempt to do that with varying degrees of success. So far our approach has worked well, but it remains to be seen whether this free-rider problem can remain unaddressed without adversely impacting Bitcoin.

tl;dr: when we discuss bitcoin and banking, we mostly focus on counterparty risk and inflation. It is rarely emphasized that there is no cost to holding bitcoin (and most altcoins).",cryptocurrency

However onto the real issue - My mother unfortunately passed away from a heart attack in early January aged 58, and as my Mom and Dad were divorced a few years back, that means me and my sister will inherit her house and private pension fund that she didn't even start. We are looking at about £190,000 or $250,000 each, a huge amount I never even considered receiving until I was at the very least in my 40s. 

Just thought it would be useful to get some advice from people here with my life experience than myself? I was never spoilt growing up and my dad is very concerned that coming into that money at 23 years old is going to have a negative impact and mean I won't appreciate the value of money. 

I definitely have the feeling that this is too much money to handle myelf, but I don't like the idea of financial advisors, fund managers and whoever else all taking a % each year and eating into any gains. I have always been interested in investing and finance, and already invest in some vanguard index funds, bonds, commodities and REIT's, but obviously in much, much smaller amounts. I am thinking I should put a certain amount down on a house to get the best fixed interest rate possible, keep some as an emergency fund in my bank, and the rest into a diversified portfolio, and increase the % that is in stocks when the market plummets - as it will do (probably a few times) in my lifetime.

personalfinance,Is it worth enrolling in an MBA program?,"I have the opportunity to enroll in an evening MBA program at a large state school.  The regular MBA program is ranked in the top 30, the evening program somewhat better among similar programs.  It should take me about 32 months to complete the program at the recommended pace and will cost about $80,000.

I'm 35 years old, single, and will continue to work full-time while in the program.  My financials, in a nutshell, are as follows:
+ Salary: $72,000.  Take-home is about $4,000 per month.  I work for the state, so I do not contribute to Social Security, but I contribute 10% before tax to retirement (employer contributes 14% of my salary in match).
+Major expenses are rent: $1,000/month; auto lease: $275/month; parking, gas and insurance: $240/ month; utilities (including cell phone and internet): $205/month; medical: $230/month (I have good insurance but also a number of health issues, so this is my out-of-pocket).
+Food and other spending comes to around $800-$1,000 per month
+Savings: about $1,000-$1,200 per month

I know I should have a more accurate budget, and should be more closely watching my discretionary spending (I eat out way too much).  However, since I have been able to save on average about 25% of my take-home, I haven't been too worried.  If I really tried, I'm sure I could up my savings.

Assets/liabilities:
+$46,000 in my retirement account
+$30,000 in a rollover IRA from a previous job
+$66,000 in savings/checking (I was saving up for a downpayment on a house + emergency fund)
+No debt aside from the auto lease.  I pay my credit card balance every month.

The ROI on the MBA program is hard to estimate.  Since it draws students that are generally mid-career, pre-matriculation salaries vary quite widely.  I was told by the assistant admissions director that because of this, they do not track post-graduation salaries for the program.  However, their full-time program averages a $20k salary increase, so I guess it's fair to use that as an estimate.

I filled out the FAFSA and my expected contribution is $50k.  I figure I can pay $1,000 per month by just foregoing further savings for now, which gets me my expected contribution of about $30K.  My employer will only contribute $2,000 per year, but I think I can actually dip into this well 4 times since the 32 months will fall in 4 calendar years, for a total of $8,000.  I'm approved for unsubsidized federal loans.

Does this seem like a reasonable risk/reward scenario?  I feel like I have the potential to really increase my earnings, but the prospect of spending 80 grand on more education is a daunting prospect.  Additionally, how should I go about financing it?  In theory, I could pay for it without accruing debt, but it would deplete almost all of my savings.  I'd like to buy a house after I graduate and settle down somewhere, so I'd like to have that capital in the bank.

On a non-financial note, the other reason for me doing this is that I'm really unhappy and burnt out at my current job.  I really don't like working in the public sector.  I started my career in the private sector working in corporate development and planning at a Fortune 500 company.  I found it to be a much more dynamic work environment, with more growth and advancement opportunities.  That's something I'd like to get back to, but I don't think my recent job history would allow me to make the switch back without the boost from an MBA.",finance

technology,My congressmen's premade net neutral response.,"July 24, 2017


Dear  Mr.  ,

 

Thank you for  contacting me with your thoughts on net neutrality.  It is good to hear from you.

 

As you may know, there is some controversy related to the amount of control broadband providers should have over a subscriber’s access to the Internet.  In 2004, the FCC proposed guidelines to keep the Internet open.  These were not rules or regulations, merely proposed principles for Internet Service Providers.  In 2008, the FCC attempted to enforce these principles against Comcast when they were accused of slowing down traffic for BitTorrent.  The FCC would eventually censure Comcast.  This led to a ruling on April 6, 2010 by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that held the FCC does not hold the authority to regulate cable Internet services under the broad policy goals contained in the Communications Act.

 

In December 2010, then Chair of the FCC, Julius Genachowski, issued the “open Internet” rules.  This was undertaken without direction or authorization from Congress.  In January 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court overturned those rules, but did say the FCC had the power to regulate the Internet.  In May 2014, the FCC released a revised proposal of rules to replace those struck down by the court.  In April 2015, the FCC published the final rules on net neutrality which went into effect on June 12, 2015.

 

It may interest you to k now that I supported H.R. 1, the Continuing Resolution that provided appropriations for the fiscal year 2011.  In that bill was an amendment that would prohibit the FCC from enforcing net neutrality rules.  I also was a cosponsor to H.R. 96, the Internet Freedom Act in the 112 th session of Congress which would also prohibit the FCC from enforcing these regulations.

 

I believe issuing the net neutrality rules was an unconstitutional, unauthorized, and unprecedented move by the FCC to over-regulate a private industry.  Additionally, the rules infringe on an internet subscriber’s constitutional right to free speech.  This would patently change the telecommunications industry and negatively affect consumers by giving the federal government the authority to police the internet.  As Congress considers other measures to prohibit the implementation of net neutrality, I will keep your thoughts in mind.

 

Once again, thank you for taking the time to contact me.  Please do not hesitate to do so again in the future.

 

Sincerely,


Steve King

personalfinance,(Scandinavia) Why might some funds be unsuitable for short term investments?,"Savings accounts here have a *fantastic* interest rate of 0%, and I have had around €5000 sat doing nothing for a while. 

I plan to buy a house next year and would like to build that €5000 to save on loaning for the mortgage later. I already have some investments in index funds and they're performing relatively ok. 

Looking at the various index funds available to me it seems that all of them (including the non-index one I started under the advice of my bank manager!) say that they could be unsuitable for investors who will withdraw their money within 5 years. 

Given that they have zero purchase / selling fees and the yearly fee is under 0.5%, why might this advice be written on the information sheets?

personalfinance,Tax Withholding on a Grant Stipend,"Hi all,

I'm hoping for some advice regarding my tax withholdings.

I am a postdoctoral fellow (which is the Phd/research equivalent of a residency for medical doctors) and I was recently awarded a fellowship from the NIH which pays for my salary. Because of my fellowship, my federal, state and FICA taxes will no longer be withheld from my paycheck starting July 31st but, like everyone else, I am still on the hook for paying them. 

Based off of talking to other fellows, I've surmised that I have two options: 

1) Withhold the money myself in my bank account and file my taxes quarterly through the IRS/State of GA's tax websites. This is fine with me, I'm responsible and I won't spend the money. Or,

2) Have my husband withhold more money for his income taxes.

We are tempted to go with the latter solution (apparently filing quarterly is a real pain), but I have some questions:

-If my husband withholds extra Federal and State taxes, do I still have to submit a quarterly FICA payment? Is that done through IRS.gov?

-Do I need to file any additional paperwork with the IRS quarterly letting them know I'm paying my taxes through my husbands paycheck? Basically, is there a form that says, ""Hey, I'm making this extra income and I know I need to pay taxes on it but we're paying extra through my husband- See? Proof right here"". 

-Does anyone recommend one option over the other? If we go with option 2, is there any advice on how to calculate how much extra we should withhold from his paycheck?

personalfinance,"Fourth year university student, where should I take my final student loan out of?","Hello Personal Finance! 

I soon will be entering my final year of engineering school. Unfortunately, I have had to take out a private loan every single year and have about $70,000 in debt (The amount is a separate story).

With no credit as an 18 year old and no consigner I decided to take a high interest rate loan( 10%+) out through Sallie Mae. And for the following two years I have done the same.

Once I graduate I plan on immediately refinancing somewhere but to be honest I don't know how it all works.

Should I get my 4th year loan through a credit union so refinancing will be easier? Should I just do Sallie Mae one last year and deal with it when I graduate?

She makes around $1.9k a month after taxes but with bills and groceries, etc she ends up having around $500/month free spending money available. Doesn’t have any savings or anything like that. She asked me if it would be a good idea to get a personal loan from her bank to try for a lower interest rate. I don’t know what her odds are of getting approved for a lower rate... her credit is around 630. Also she has two accounts in collections that she is trying to cut a deal and pay off but doesn’t know how to contact the appropriate company to pay it and is afraid of getting scammed over the phone. 

I told her to dump the $500 straight into her cards each month but she “feels likes she works so hard and doesn’t get to see any of it”.

personalfinance,How to Spend Wedding Gifts Wisely?,"Hi, Redditors!

My fiancé (31F) and I (29F) will be getting married at some point late next year, possibly early 2019. We were discussing what to do with the monetary gifts that we will accumulate in the smartest way possible.

We live together in NYC and rent an apartment, just resigned for our third year. The cost of moving doesn't seem worth it (to us, at this point) and we plan on staying where we are until we decide where to settle down/buy a home, or if one of us gains employment outside of the city.

We make average salaries, combining to around $130k, and have a budget set for wedding saving (among the usual bills and such). Her parents are also helping pay for the wedding, giving a significant amount.

We both have student loans, myself more than she does; however, a large portion of mine are federal loans and I work for a city agency that qualifies for loan forgiveness, as does my fiancé. Outside of said federal loans, I have a few private loans that vary in interest and combine to be about $5k. 

Since we want our next move to be to (hopefully!) purchase a home, we were thinking about putting the money in a high interest rate account and not touch it until we need it for a down payment. We are not familiar with these types of accounts and plan to see an advisor- although, any suggestions are definitely more than welcomed!

Another idea- was to pay off the small, private loans I have and then put away the leftover amount into a high interest rate account. It should be noted that half of the total amount of private loans are in my dad's name, and the rest is in mine.

We are only discussing options at this point, and I wanted to reach out to this community and see what you would suggest or what you have done if you were previously in this situation. I would greatly appreciate any advice that anyone has for us! 

Thanks, all.

But I feel that the money is just being wasted sitting there being of no use to me. 

The reason I have kept both these accounts open is that in the next 1-3 years, I might be on the market for my first home and I when I do that, I want to apply to multiple banks to get the best rate, because even a difference of 0.1% in the interest rate will make a difference in the long run.

Part of me thinks I should take the gains off the house and invest it in another home that doesn't need work and in an even better part of town but part of me is saying stay where I am because I have a good interest rate and low mortgage and if I were to move I know I want a bigger home which is going to cost me more money.",finance

personalfinance,Should I take money out of TSP to pay off Debt,"Hi all, I've read a ton of different post on here and it seems that the consensus is to NEVER take money out of your TSP or 401K. I'm 32, a federal employee, and have about 60K in my TSP. I have student  loan debt that is 29K, 20K of that being unsubsidized and occurring interest at 5.31%. I've tried paying what I can on interest every check, but it seems like whatever I pay, the balance is back where I left it 2 weeks later. It just seems like I'd be better off taking out the amount from tsp loan and paying it off. I hate renting and would like to buy a home in a few years. That's my real motivation.

So from  my reading it seems like most folks will say NEVER borrow from your tsp, we need more info about you financial situation....

Roughly:
Rent - 1000
Car - 633.00 (I know, I know. It'll be paid off end of 2018 and has an interest rate of 2.9)
cable/home security/internet - 167.00
Phone - 83.89
Water - 30 bucks
Electricity - 145 (it's hot and humid n the south, turning off the AC won't work for this polar bear. It's significantly less in the winter though)
Car Ins - 127.
Gas utility - 25.
Gas for vehicle - 55 bucks every 8 days or so.
Child support - 850 monthly.
Groceries - 350 per month
cc card - 6000. (will be paid off by end of year, 0% interest until 2019.)
net monthly ( after taxes/medical, 5% contribution to TSP, contributing to savings account) - Before paying bills = $4290 roughly $2145 net per check.
Emergency fund = 4K, will be 5k next month.

Short term goals in the next 3 (more likely 5) years, I'd like to have all debt paid off, a down payment for a home saved, and to be contributing at least 10% (hopefully 15%) to TSP. I live in a low cost area in the southern us, but still seems like the student loan is in the way. I'v e only been a fed for a year and plan to stay and retire from the gov't in 32 years or so.

personalfinance,Which of these mortgage offers is the better deal?,"Just put in an offer today on a first-time home purchase, and it was accepted! I've got two loan estimates in hand (and plan to shop around a little more tonight and tomorrow). Thing is, I'm not sure which is currently the ""better"" offer. I don't want to risk looking stupid by approaching one of the loan officers asking for him to ""beat"" the other one, only to be told that I've misunderstood the whole thing and his *is* the better one. 

One estimate assumes we're putting 20 percent down on a sales price of $838,000. The other assumes 20 percent down on a sales price of $830,000 (we got that estimate last week when we were still trying to decide what to offer; the actual sales price of the home will be $826,000, per our ratified contract.) We haven't locked rates yet.

One estimate offers a **30-year fixed mortgage** of $670,400 at a rate of **3.875 percent** with total closing costs of $20,731 and $4,656 in prepaids and escrows. Cash to close, it'd be $192,988.

The other would be a **75/10 conventional plus HELOC**, with $622,500 on the first trust and $41,500 on the HELOC. The fixed-rate loan would be **4.125 percent**, and the HELOC would start at **5 percent**. We would plan to pay the adjustable rate loan very aggressively, looking to eliminate the balance in five years or less to avoid interest rate risk. Total closing costs would be $21,243 and prepaids and escrows would come to $4,027. Cash to close, it'd be $191,869.

My gut wants to assume that the larger single loan with the lower (and fixed) rate is the better one, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything. Thoughts?

EDIT: One commenter pointed out a mistake! I misread the second loan estimate (which came in last week when we were still debating how much to offer). It actually assumes a sales price of $830K. Hope that doesn't throw things off too badly!",finance

personalfinance,Recent grad with a plan... can you take some time to give feedback?,"Hello r/personalfinance! I've been working a lot on my personal financial plan and wanted to share it with you and get some feedback. I'm very much a planner and I love to weigh my different options but I need a bit of help with this one. A little background, I'm 22 years old from the US, I'm a recent grad with a bachelors degree in finance so I know a lot about investing and personal finance (though I know I don't know everything hence the request for help!), I just started a secure career with a large telecom company in june, and I'm living at home to save money for the next 22 months. 

I'll first show a description of my complete financial picture and then explain my plan for the next 22 months. This will be a fairly long post, but I’d be happy to offer any financial knowledge I may have to you in return for a look through my plan. I'd really appreciate if you could give me some feedback and suggestions!

**My financial picture:**

Income:

* Work Income: 65,000 annually plus up to $12,000 in bonus (which will be cut in half for 2017 due to my beginning work in June instead of January) with annual raises based on performance. 
* business income: launching an ecommerce store which has potential to bring in a decent amount annually, though I don't count this in my income calculation

Liabilities: 

* $17,500 car loan at 4.39% interest rate
* $27,700 student loans averaging 4.14% interest rate

Assets:

* Cash and cash equivalents: $3,800
* Investment accounts: $3,100
* Auto: 2015 Scion tC worth ~$11,500
* 401(k): $800, but contributing to the maximum match at 6%
* IRA: $750

Monthly Income/expenses:

* Income: $3200
* Gas: $60
* Food: $200
* Insurance: $75
* Everything else: $250
* Left over: between 2,500-2,600 (this will be put towards my car payments and student loans and extra applied to principal)


My financial plan:

For my plan I'm assuming no raises or promotions despite being on an accelerated development program. I'm also assuming no tax returns, bonuses or business income. My big plan is to pay off my loans entirely by the end of my time living with my mom. I have a total of about 46,000 in loans and can afford to put 2,600 a month towards them if I save nothing more than what I already have saved. I have a monthly car payment of $393 and student loans will begin December at $282,which will be covered by this $2600. I also plan to buy an engagement ring for my girlfriend of 5 years for under $5,000. 
 

If I save 2,600 for two months I will be able to buy the ring in cash, and from that point forward if I put all of that 2,600 towards liabilities I can have the entirety of my loans cleared by March of 2019 (I calculated this using vertex42's debt reduction calculator). From that point forward I will have about 3 months to save the extra 2,600 each month and be left with a total of $7,800, more than enough to move out and find a place to live. My plan from there is basically to assume that I can still save over $1,500 a month and use that to buy a house and for a wedding. 

Now obviously as I said I will be getting bonuses, tax returns, as well as raises and probably at least one promotion in this time period, and if business picks up I’ll have that supplemental income as well. This is just worst-case scenario. So from this whole analysis I have 2 main questions:

1. Does it make sense to pay off my loans this aggressively, or is the money better spent saving for a down payment for a house earlier and for a wedding and investing the extra?
2. A more specific question. Right now I’m working in a job where my appearance means a lot, and the car that I drive doesn’t exactly allow me to “dress for the job I want, not the one I have.” Does it make sense to pay down my car loan to about what it’s worth (pay off $6,000) then buy a car such as an older BMW that gives the image and still costs less than my scion is worth? This would mean trading my car with 30k miles for one with closer to 80k, giving me less life out of the vehicle, but could also be an easy way to shave an extra 2-3k off of my total loan balance.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read and give me feedback! I know it’s long but it’s much appreciated.",finance

Together my fiancé and I have about 80k to put down as a down payment and we have a combined income of around 90k.

personalfinance,Submitted a mortgage application too soon.,"I'm considering multiple lenders for a mortgage.

I submitted a mortgage application to Navy Federal Credit Union knowing that the score they'd see would be 716. I knew that once I paid down my student loan by ~2k and another lender would submit proof of that fact to the bureaus to get a quick credit score bump, I'd be over 720.

720 is believed to be the cut off point for ""Very Good"" credit standing with Navy Federal Credit Union. I didn't realize that Navy Federal would refuse to rerun my credit once they ran it with the initial application.

What this means for me: I either get a rate based on a worse score from a credit union that offers lower rates in general (NVCU) or I get a rate based on a better score from a lender that offers worse rates in general. It's about breakeven for both.

personalfinance,[Debt] Tackling CC debt with credit balance transfers tips?,"Hey PF! So I started out well-disciplined in using credit that shot my score pretty high up within a year or two. Unfortunately I fell into the trap of ""0% APR for 12 months"" Capital One Venture card that I was approved for last year. Well, it's one month until my 24% interest rate kicks in, and I have a balance of 12k. After reading up a bit here and in some other places, I felt the best way I can tackle this is dividing this debt up to other credit accounts that allow balance transfers. (If there is a better way please let me know!) 

Fortunately this week I was approved for a 0% interest for 21 months CC from citi, but only have a limit of $3800. If I load that credit account up (should I?), I felt that I could tackle ~8k of CC debt within a year budgeting around $800 a month assuming I don't add more to the debt. Budgeting this much may lead me more to a more rice and beans diet though. Budgeting less than $600 a month is more manageable and pay this off in 1.5 years. (I'm using this credit card calculator on the Capital One website). And today I got another email from usbank (of which i have a car loan from) saying that i got pre-approved for a 0% interest for 15 months CC because I've been keeping up with my payments. I know pre-approval doesn't mean much, but I just got approved with Citi earlier this week.

That's my situation. My main question is hard to articulate as it branches off to several questions. I want to tackle this debt as aggressively as I can, but at the same time, I know if I apply for more CC accounts can really ding my already falling credit score. But I can be patient in rebuilding it as I don't plan on buying a house or applying for any more loans in the near future (3 years).

Shall I apply for yet another credit card (USBank offer) to transfer my balance to? 
Shall I immediately request for a higher credit limit for my recently approved Citi account?
Or tackle the ~8k debt with what I already have at the moment?",finance
personalfinance,What are all factors for buying a home and how do I calculate anticipated costs?,"Hi! I'm thinking about starting to buy a home. I want to purchase a home within 3 years from now. I'm freshly 26, I make $85k a year, but I live in Boston where I'm burning $2000 a month in rent

personalfinance,"To pay off student loans, start emergency fund, or both?","I spoke with a (fiduciary) financial adviser this morning, and I ended up with a few questions about the plan he and I came up with.

My fiance and I are both 22, and I just graduated from college in May with a nursing degree. I am beginning my job as an RN in a couple of weeks, and will be making about $6k per month between the two of us. We currently live nearly rent free in a parent's house, with a total cost of living of about $1,000/mo, but we desperately want out and into an apartment.

I also have a substantial amount of student loans to pay back, with my grace period ending in November. Private 15 yr loan of ~$94k at 8.5% and an est. monthly payment of $926, but I plan on refinancing this loan. Hopefully with a much lower interest rate considering a nice income and a good credit score, and potentially a cosigning parent if need be. I have a 10 yr fed loan of ~30k at 3.8% and a monthly payment of $320. Two other 7.5 yr loans of 4K and 6K both at 5% interest when grace ends. Total monthly minimum payments total $1382.

My financial adviser's best advice was to take the opportunity to live cheap for a few more months, and I agree. He suggested that my first move should definitely be putting everything I can into a simple savings account for an emergency fund. Essentially I would be putting about 5K in for two months to reach a comfortable 10K, which would be slightly less than 3 mo of expenses if we were to move out after then. The third month I would be putting 3K toward student debt, 1k to savings, and 1k to an apartment fund.

My question is, should I pay it toward an emergency fund or toward my student loans? Both equally(-ish)? I'm horrified by the thought of my interest compounding when my grace period ends, but also know I'm going to re-fi the private loan anyway. I don't know what the best course of action is, and I don't know that what my adviser suggested is exactly what I want to be doing.

personalfinance,Cannot afford to continue university; what is/are my best option(s)?,"I'm feeling a bit helpless right now, as I can't figure out the best route to go in for the sake of my financial well-being. I've finished one year of university at UMass Amherst. I could not afford it, and the majority of it was paid for by a Parent PLUS loan. The exact breakdown of my debt from my first year is:

* $5,500 Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan
* $20,054 Parent PLUS Loan (I realize the PLUS loans are technically my parent's responsibility; regardless, I intend to fully pay it off myself)

The price for this year is going to be approximately the same, so the loans will be approximately the same . I'm extremely stressed about continuing while building up this level of debt. I've seen it said not to take on more debt than your graduating salary; according to UMass' website, [the average starting salary for engineering is $66,000](https://engineering.umass.edu/welcome). I'm just completely lost. I don't know what the right path to take is. I'll try to list any relevant information about my current financial situation below, feel free to ask for more:

* My parents are well-off but didn't save any money for me to attend university, so I'm not getting any financial aid other than the Direct Unsubsidized Loan and have to borrow the rest.
* My father is the breadwinner, and my parents are planning a divorce; will this potentially increase the financial aid I'm offered?

My two current options boil down to continue at UMass Amherst this year or take a gap year and try to figure out some alternative. Continuing is the ""easy"" option I suppose. Taking a gap year would let me save more money to pay up front, but I still believe it would be a pittance compared to the near $30k that UMass costs. I can take the gap year and attempt to transfer, but I'm hesitant on that option; I still want to go to a recognizable engineering school, as I still want a reasonably high starting salary when I enter the work force. There's not many other options in Massachusetts (I was accepted to WPI and WIT back in high school, but they both cost significantly more than UMass, and getting into any big name schools is a pipe dream). I can look for schools outside of Massachusetts, but I hate long drives (I realize it sounds childish to use that factor to limit myself when I'm already limited by finances, so of course I won't shut down schools far away) and want to avoid flying fees for further away/international schools.

Another complication is my parents' divorce; it's not going to be amicable, so I'd like to be out of home to avoid the fallout. Again, I realize it's childish to have such preferences while I can barely afford school, but if I were to take a gap year I'd probably try to start renting an apartment (potentially near whatever school I'd be going to the next year so I can just stay there year-round).

The formatting of this post might not be great, so sorry for the wall of text. What is your guys' opinions? Am I worrying too much and should I just stay at UMass? Am I an absolute idiot for taking on this debt in the first place and do I need to explore other options? Have I already messed up my financial well-being beyond reasonable repair? I appreciate any input to this problem!

personalfinance,refininancing a car loan,"hello! I recently got into a car loan for 18k at 8.2%. I was really expecting much less since I have good credit and I applied to penfed (which boasts on having the best interests rates). The official said something about having little experience which is kinda true. 
At this point I am trying to figure out my best course of action to lower how much siphoning the bank is going to do to me (over 4k in interests throughout the life of the loan!) I have these options in mind:  
*giving out high payments (600$) I would pay half interest (2k)  
*shop for more interest rates to see if some other bank offers a better interest (tho penfed probably is my best bet)  
*waiting out some time and refinancing loan (but car would be older and interest would be higher?)

personalfinance,"feeling precarious financially, CC debt, high COL area, baby on the way, details inside","Sorry in advance, this post came out long. Also throwaway because reasons. I flared this post as ""Debt"", but a lot of my questions could also be flared ""Credit"".

Background (Detailed expenses/income with interest rates will follow): My husband and I have almost $18000 (high interest, across 14 lines of credit) combined of credit card debt, around $7000 remaining on a (painfully high interest) joint car loan for a 2013 Hyundai Elantra. I also owe the IRS $1700 from an income tax return mistake from several years ago, set on a payment plan. We are a single income family of 3 (soon to be 4) renting in the Miami metro area, FL. We’re both in our early 30’s.

Our goals, in order of highest to lowest priority is to: liquidate all of our debt, then to simultaneously build our credit (again...) and establish some kind of savings beyond the few hundred dollars we keep currently in case of emergency car maintenance, then to purchase a 2nd car ASAP (as an aside-- I understand a lot of replies here may not agree with this in the spirit of living frugally; however, husband commutes 2+ hours a day, right now daughter and I manage to stave off seclusion/stir craze by taking him to work twice a week so that we can get out of the house a little bit. Our area is not pedestrian-safe or pedestrian-friendly. There are also health concerns with walking due to my pregnancy, complexion, and the weather (60% humidity and 90+ degrees, alternating with surprise rain storms; fun for the whole family!). Public transportation is unreliable, sparse, and miserable.), then eventually to purchase a home (distant future/pipe dream).

Though I stay at home now (home-school our daughter, run the house, and now pregnant), I used to work in a highly seasonal industry, with several bouts of un-/under-employment. Husband is highly employable (devops/tech industry), and recently took a new job at a pretty prestigious company for a huge pay increase, so now he now grosses close to 6 figures, plus bonuses.

A portion of our credit card debt comes from living expenses during bouts of unemployment.  The rest is heirloom debt from both of us from before our relationship, when we were younger and spendier. We were both raised in pretty financially uneducated environments, so we’re learning as we go. Hopefully we’ll be able to pass down better habits to our next generation…

I have some specific questions I’ll ask at the end of this post, but generally we’re looking for advice on the best way to work our way out of a hole created by (current) delinquent payments and (past) poor spending habits, and the best way to salvage our tanking credit scores and begin building them again in the process, in the name of the Future!.

Some of the lower accounts on the below list are delinquent by a month or 2, and are probably a few weeks at most away from going into collections. Average minimum payments are $50 each, but because of the delinquencies, a lot of them have minimum payment warnings that are much higher due to stacking minimum payments plus late fees. Accounts became delinquent due to a combination of husbands last job being low paying, me not working, and the recent job change putting a kink in our payment schedule. We were treading water for awhile, and the job change threw a wrench in that. The highest priority during this time was to make sure our rent, car note/insurance, and utilities were paid as well as putting food on the table. AND NOW HERE WE ARE.

Income: Husband grosses 95k with a bonus that pays out in Feb each year of 10k minimum (will be prorated this year since he was hired partway through the year). After insurance (800 per month or 9.6k per year for the family), and taxes/deductions, we bring home $63,600 per year, paid $2650 twice per month. I’m not counting any kind of bonus; we’ll look at where to put the bonus when/if it gets here.

Questions:

* 	I think we should close most, if not all, of our lines of credit. If so, all of them or only some? If not all, which should be closed? A lot of these were opened in desperate times and carry fees in addition to the astronomical interest rates. Which should remain open? How does “account closed by cardholder” affect one’s credit score? Should we attempt to hold on to any of the older lines of credit, even if those have higher interest rates/balances?
* 	Debt consolidation/management - pros and cons? Are we good candidates for any of those services, and if so, what companies are recommended?
* 	Our credit scores are the lowest now that they’ve ever been, hovering at around 600 for either of us. What is the best way to proceed in general that will both reduce our debt load and start improving our credit ASAP (that is, avoiding declaring bankruptcy, defaulting on the lines of credit, etc.)?
* 	Would it be better under any circumstance to default on any of the lines of credit, take the additional hit to our credit score, and then haggle/pay to delete later? If so, which lines would be candidates for that route?
* 	Once this is all done and fixed, and depending on what route we take to get it done, what kind of timeline to recovery of our credit scores can we expect? That is, how many years are we looking at to being able to access reasonable mortgage/loan rates, assuming all other factors (down payment, etc.) are equal?
* 	Am I overthinking this and we should just snowball/avalanche it down like the basic bitches we are? Do we have enough monthly surplus to do that? What do we do about the increased minimum payments we’re seeing currently due to delinquencies? Or is the first step to bring everything current again and then snowball? If that’s the case, I believe there will be accounts transferred to debt collection agencies before everything is current again. Should we divide out accounts that we will snowball and let the others go to collections?
* 	One of my major concerns about our credit score is that once our lease is up, we will be moving. We've been late on rent maybe once in the past 10 years, but I'm worried about passing credit checks to rent at a new place early next year. What can we do to mitigate that concern and ensure that we'll be able to find a place to live, as I know credit scores take a long time to repair/build? We are already preparing to pay first/last/deposit (customary for this area), and I've heard of instances where renters with lower credit scores may have to pay a higher deposit (2x monthly rate as opposed to 1x) or additional fees. What do you think we can expect, and what else should we do to prepare, assuming our credit scores are still decimated by that point? Will the fact that we have a solid renting history be a factor for the positive?
* 	Any other advice?

I'm currently employed part-time, making $30k a year, pretax. I am moving into a full-time position next month with the same company, where both an annual review bonus is expected to increase my hourly wage as well as an additional promotion via moving between employment statuses (I hope).

I am 25 years old and have never been on my own. I am moving to Michigan to live with my girlfriend for the next four years while she attends on a fellowship for her doctorate program. I will be done with my undergraduate this month before I move in early August. We anticipate to split costs evenly, although I do not expect her to contribute anything to my loans.

I have about $4.5~$4.8k in savings. I have been reading that it is important to have an emergency fund. This is the first time moving on my own. I am splitting rent with my girlfriend of $700, $350 on my part. Water, Heat, and Trash removal are included with rent. I will be paying for Electricity, which I'll expect no more than $100. Internet, we will have to find an Xfinity hotspot and use my parents login information to use Wifi. We will be sharing one vehicle, under her name. I am getting rid of mine. I have no credit card debt, no children, or unpaid expenses. I will have to get health insurance, no more than $90 a month.

My girlfriend will have a monthly stipend of $1,500 a month, on top of approximately $800-$1,000 a month from her current employment. She is going from full-time, to part-time in doing so. She has no student loan debt, but minimal credit card debt of $1,500 to $2,000.

Lets begin. 

I have a Stafford Loan totaling $39,940.96.

- Unpaid Principal of $34,720.00.
- Unpaid Interest of $5,220.96. (I did not know that interest accrued while in a grace period. I just learned that unsubsidized loans do in fact accrue interest. My mistake, I did not know this until now).

My grace period ends 11/30/17 and my first payment isn't due until January 1, 2018. I have the option as well to setup Auto Pay, which will reduce my interest rate by 0.25%.

- Direct Unsubsidized Stafford: $6,209.98 @6.800%
- Direct Unsubsidized Stafford: $7,220.34 @6.800%
- Direct Unsubsidized Stafford: $7,089.50 @3.860%
- Direct Unsubsidized Stafford: $8,421.14 @4.660%
- Direct Subsidized Stafford: $5,500.00 @4.290%
- Direct Subsidized Stafford: $5,500.00 @3.760%


My question to everyone is, where do I begin? Should I refinance, consolidate, keep the standard repayment method, go on income based repayment? I'm not sure what option is best fitted for me. Thanks so much!

Edit: I forgot to mention that I am already overwhelmed by these student loans and I haven't even began to live on may own yet. Please take that into whatever consideration you come up with. Thanks again.

I want to say something about this ""Marshall Faulk"" note that was in the latest annual report, and has since been paid off (see PR on 4/12, and 8-k on 4/13).

Here's the 10-k...

https://www.otcmarkets.com/edgar/GetFilingHtml?FilingID=11967147

From the Notes Payable section...

Quote: 
Promissory notes issued in December 2015. Lenders earn interest at a rate of 10% per month. Notes are repayable on March 9, 2016. $30,000 of principal and $49,000 of interest and penalties were converted to 987,500 shares of common stock in 2016. The Company was unable to repay the remaining note at maturity and the note is in default. The Company is obligated to pay late-payment penalties totaling $5,000 per day on the remaining obligation.

This note was originally for $130k. The remaining $100k balance (after conversions) was in default for 13 months while the company was in default! This $100k note is the 2nd smallest note in the entire Notes Payable section! The company had lenders willing to lend the company money at much better interest rates!

This Marshall Faulk note required 10% interest per month!! Plus $5,000 penalties per day!! For 13 months!!! On only a $100k loan!! When we have investors willing to loan at 2% interest per year - see 4/12/17 PR and 4/13/17 8-k!!!!!

When this note was eliminated (4/12 PR and 4/13 8-k), the stock certainly reacted positively, so I think it's safe to speculate that there were investors that were scared by the note, until it was eliminated. And guess what, IMUN never had to pay any of these penalties after all as it was usury (illegal interest rates, which is why they ultimately don't have to pay them).

""Pump and Dump"" vs. ""Dump and Pump""

http://www.extraordinaryinvestor.com/penny-stock-scam.html

In my opinion, that's why Noreen or Peter can sign such a note, because they know the company will never have to pay such ridiculous interest rates, while at the same time it will serve their purpose of wanting to keep the stock price low. That's ""Dump and Pump"" for you. The ""Dump"" phase, though, is ultimately ONLY attached to the ""Startup"" phase of the company in a ""Dump and Pump"", theoretically speaking. Once we have our initial contracts (if they ever come), there should not be any more demotion at that point.

Now, I consider myself an ""extraordinary investor"" according to how an ""extraordinary investor"" is defined in the above link:

And if I were NOT an extraordinary investor, I would've been scared off into selling my shares for those 13 months that IMUN had such an outrageous note on their books!!! It is actually that I speculated the note was purposely there to scare investors that I did not sell! When in reality I should've sold, and bought back cheaper. But oh well, I've been an investor for over 2 years now, and have a very large position at a great average in my mind - $.069 now. I've bought a lot more this year, and when I originally bought in 2015, I got in at a good price as well.

If MOST PEOPLE are not extraordinary investors, then I would speculate that MOST PEOPLE would have stayed away from this stock for those 13 months (and before it too). Because they were ""scared off"" into thinking this was a stock to stay away from in my opinion.

In my speculative opinion, this stock seems that it is a ""Dump and Pump"" scheme, the opposite of ""Pump and Dump"". The link above defines D &amp; P if you scroll halfway down.

If it is true that the management was involved in ""demoting"" the stock, then that means they have to be pretty damn confident it will one day be worth much much more. In my opinion.

Look at the graph of IMUN throughout 2017. There was CERTAINLY a lot of accumulation going on this year. The volume shows it.

Next point, here is the cash on hand for the trailing twelve months:

March 31, 2017 – $98k

Dec 31, 2016 – $74k

Sep 30, 2016 – $22k

June 30, 2016 – $64k

Now WHY in the WHY would IMUN continuously carry under $100k in the bank when the burn rate is $100’s of thousands per month? It is very clear that they do indeed have plenty of insiders willing to keep giving money. Well, in my opinion, if they keep the cash low, it will scare away investors, more evidence for why it’s about to rocket whenever these contracts do get here. Because the initial contracts, whenever they do arrive (if they do), should finally prove that this company is legitimate (in terms of the revenue stream they should generate and the value it produces), this stock should finally skyrocket when those contracts do come.

All of the other evidence backing up my opinion, you’ll have to read the 3000+ posts and figure it out on your own.

Hopefully, when we see initial contracts (if they ever come), the stock will increase dramatically. From that point, there will be years and years of good news to come. This stock is a long term GROWTH stock. Revenues will continue to increase quarter by quarter. Countries will continue to be added. Approvals will continue to be granted. This is what we all hope of course, but it seems likely.

In my opinion, the stock is HIGHLY UNDERVALUED RIGHT NOW. Of course, I believe that the reason the market has incorrectly valued this stock is because the market has been ""tricked"" in a sense by the management, if it is true that there was a purposeful ""demotion"" of the stock in the past.

- Voting rights were more limited than they are in a regular enterprise. In part due to the Curators role as being in charge of accepting the different proposals.


&gt; For example, the sample contract proposal attached to the White Paper included little information concerning the terms of the contract. Also, the Slock.it co-founders put forth a draft of their own contract proposal and, in response to questions and requests to negotiate the terms of the proposal (posted to a DAO forum), a Slock.it founder explained that the proposal was intentionally vague and that it was, in essence, a take it or leave it proposition not subject to negotiation or feedback


- The pseudonanonimity and dispersion of the token holders made it difficult for the token holders to join together to exercise any meaningful cont
ol. 


&gt; The voting rights afforded DAO Token holders did not provide them with meaningful control over the enterprise, because (1) DAO Token holders’ ability to vote for contracts was a largely perfunctory one; and (2) DAO Token holders were widely dispersed and limited in their ability to communicate with one another


- The token holders profit were to be derived from the managerial efforts of Slock.it and their expectations were primed by the marketing efforts of Slock.it


&gt; Although DAO Token holders were afforded voting rights, these voting rights were limited. DAO Token holders were substantially reliant on the managerial efforts of Slock.it, its co-founders, and the Curators.",cryptocurrency

&gt; The SEC's Report of Investigation found that tokens offered and sold by a ""virtual"" organization known as ""The DAO"" were securities and therefore subject to the federal securities laws. 

&gt; [...]

&gt; In light of the facts and circumstances, the agency has decided not to bring charges in this instance, or make findings of violations in the Report, but rather to caution the industry and market participants:  the federal securities laws apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology.

--------

My view of this, as someone who owns a lot of ether, is generally positive. The space is currently running rampant with a great deal of irrational exuberance. This should (hopefully) tone that down a bit. 

Moreover, the fact that they have chosen to issue a caution rather than pursue prosecution (any number of previous ICOs could likely be defined as a security) makes me optimistic that they do not want to stifle innovation in the area. I hope this can help bring 'blockchainised' securities into the mainstream.",finance

I am an RN with my BSN. I make about $41,000 per year before tax (assuming I don't work overtime) with almost 3 years of experience. I got a paycut from my old hospital. I work between 40-60hrs. My husband has no degree, but has about 5 years of experience in retail and has been a supervisor (just above a regular employee, but not quite a manager) for about 2 years. Currently he is making $640 per paycheck. He is trying to get a better job. He's only been at this job for about 3 weeks. They were misleading on what he would be doing and other things. He had an interview yesterday. He wasn't making really any money from Nov-June.



We cancelled all our credit cards and have stuck pretty strictly to a budget. 



Our income per month: $3,480-$4,280 (depends if I work overtime)




Our monthly budget:


* Compassion International: $38
* Emergency fund: $60
* Phone: $166.31
* Grocery: $400
* Gas: $40
* Auto Insurance: $160.42
* Netflix/Anime/Gym/Apple care: $64.77
* Pocket money: $200
* Car payment: $285.57
* Credit Union credit card: $100
* Credit Union Line of credit: $50
* Best Buy Credit card: min $25, we pay $100 most months
* Sallie mae student loans: $575.02
* My federal student loans: $300.69
* His federal student loans: $161.10
* Shitty Medical/dental/eye insurance (comes out of my paycheck before taxes): $390 




Our debt:


* Medical bills (half are already in collections):  $1,193.90
* Best buy credit card: $2,319
* Credit Union line of credit: $2,326.74
* Family/friends: $3,190
* Credit Union Credit card: $4,658.79
* His federal student loans: $15,167.17
*Car loan: $16,157.04
* My federal student loans: $20,522.94
* Sallie Mae student loans (9.375%-10.375%): $35,510.57



I'm looking into travel nursing, which will pay more and he had the interview yesterday. Is there anyway we can do better with what we have!? 



Edit: I did not expect this much advice. I posted this before going to bed and checked reddit before clocking in at work. I am working on responding to comments as much as possible, but I am at work so I'll be slow. Thank you all so very much for your time and help!!!


Just to clarify my income, I make $22.30 per hour with $4 shift differential, my pay per year and per month is after taxes AND insurance. As stated above, my insurance is through the hospital I work for. 


I am not going to give up sponsoring a child through Compassion. I have sponsored this girl for about 11 years. I have met her and her family in person and I have built a relationship with her via letters. I will cut back on others things and continue to sponsor her. That is the only thing I am unwilling to budge on. 



Edit3: I realized I calculated my husband's for one week and didn't double that. It's  $640. And of course fixed our monthly income to reflect that. Also fixed my annual salary to reflect before taxes, not after. 


Edited to clarify that I'm an RN with my BSN.

investing,Fed reducing balance sheet and bond yields,"I am very new to investing but trying to learn as much as possible. I was reading an article saying that investors are worried about the Feds plans to reduce its balance sheet. The article then goes on to state investors are worried because it would increase bond yields.

Why would increased bond yields be a bad thing? Because the bonds investors currently hold would be worth less? Also if anybody has any insight into how the Fed reducing its balance sheet is likely to affect the general investing climate that would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for the comments in advance.",finance
personalfinance,How accurate is the W4 worksheet?,"So, obviously the IRS calculator is the most accurate way to estimate your tax liability and set your exemptions, but how accurate is the worksheet on the W4 form? 

I just started a new job and after going through the worksheet it had me claim three exemptions, one for me, one for my daughter, and one for childcare expenses. Once I got my first paycheck, however, I only had about 10% of my gross pay witheld for federal income tax. That seems extremely low since my wife and I both work and are in the 28% tax bracket before deductions. 

Is the W4 worksheet really inaccurate and does it tend to over-withhold?",finance

personalfinance,Approved then denied car financing??,"Yesterday my girlfriend and I went to the local subaru dealership in search of her dream car ""impreza hatchback""
Now I've already been offered high interest rates around 20% on used cars ""my credit is 640 at age 25 with 43000 annual income""

So naturally I wanted to check newer cars for lower I rates...
After checking my credit, looking through car options and financing the salesman and finance manager told me I was a perfect fit for a black impreza premium to lease or own.

After test driving the car, running my credit, telling us it will be a perfect match, giving us the down payment and interest rate of 7%, and putting my girlfriend on cloud 9 the salesman comes back and says (oh, my bad..looks like it won't work out) and essentially pushes us out the door

personalfinance,"Am I crazy, or should big-time savers be maxing out retirement accounts before paying student loans down?","**TL;DR:** Isn't the value of getting additional money into a tax-sheltered account vastly higher than an extra few years of interest payments on student loans?

Usually when the topic of retirement contributions vs. student loan pay down comes up, people say that you should pay down student loans when their interest rate approaches the expected rate of return of the stock market. But isn't that ignoring the massive value of getting more money into tax-advantaged accounts at a young age?

I am asking from the position of a young professional who will likely be able to max out all available tax-advantaged investment opportunities in the first year or two of full-time work. The specific situation is whether one should contribute $5.5k to a Roth IRA in the last year of law school with a $100k job lined up, but the question applies more broadly. Shouldn't one pay down student loans early only once all tax-sheltered investment opportunities are gone?

So to be concrete: would you pay $100 to get an extra $1000 into a Roth IRA in your 20s if you were out of other tax-advantaged investment options? For me, that's a no-brainer since Roth IRA savings are worth much more than taxable savings over a 40-year horizon. If you would pay that $100, then you should contribute to a Roth IRA before paying down even a 10% student loan. That's far from conventional wisdom here.

You even have the principle of a Roth IRA to take out in a pinch.

What is the best method of reducing our credit card debt? Get a debt consolidation loan for a low interest rate and pay it off or try to refinance our mortgage and payoff credit card debt by refinancing for more than we currently owe? Does it simply come down to whether we would get a better interest rate on a refinance or from a debt consolidation loan?

I've also seen letters sent to my house about paying off credit card debt for a fraction of the balance. I'm assuming these are either scams or are based on ability to pay, right? In which case it doesn't really pertain to us. Annual household gross income is ~$220,000 per year. 

We don't currently use an accountant. The best time to get one was 10 years ago. The second best time is now. That said, what should I look for in an accountant? I want to finally get on top of our finances and be smarter about our money.

btc,"IMO, we are being hypocrites when we say Bitcoin is decentralized","Seeing the current hard fork war going around and reading some posts around here made me think: how stupid are we to believe Bitcoin is *ACTUALLY* decentralized?

There are some facts that prove my point:

- Bitcoin is a protocol. Whoever manages this protocol can choose whatever improvements to add to it. e.g.: Core developers control the coin, which may, in turn, receive funding from a corporation, so they'll look forward for the companies best interests;

- Every single forum is centralized in the hands of a few people. r/Bitcoin, bitcointalk.org and bitcoin.org are owned by /u/theymos, for instance;

- You need miners to ensure that the coin grows and becomes successful. Without miners in a PoW coin, there isn't a cryptocoin. Because of their powers (processing transactions), they are also in control of the coin.

So, developers centralize the protocol's development at their hands: they will often look out for their personal interests in improving the protocol (what they think is right for that current moment). If you disagree, you are free to fork and do whatever you want with it, but some changes won't be backwards compatible with the original protocol, which would be a ""split"" or ""hard fork"".

Miners ensure the protocol does what it was designed to do. They process transactions. Now, someone may say ""but miners are distributed everywhere, thus leading to decentralization!"". Part of it is true. What happens when miners decide to join forces and act together? Not by issuing a 51% attack, but by coming to an agreement and deciding X feature from Y is good or bad. This joint operation centralizes the control of the protocol in the hands of miners as well.

I'm not quitting bitcoin or crypto, this is just a thought I had about decentralized cryptos being an utopia. My point really is: how is this similar to federation, which is mostly seen on open source social networks like GNU social and Mastodon?

personalfinance,Buying new home - where to pull money from? (US - WI),"Hey /r/personalfinance,

My wife and I are planing on buying a home this fall or next spring. Our budget is about 400K - the home would be in Wisconsin, our state of residence. 

We both have money in regular, non-advantaged investment/brokerage accounts - sufficient to make 20% on a down payment. We are also planning to file our taxes jointly for the first time this year - our incomes are pretty similar and our combined income should put us in the 33% federal tax bracket. 

Question 1: based on our income and the plan to purchase a home, is filing jointly a good idea? Or is it more advantageous to file separately?

Question 2: I already own a condo - my wife does not, it would be her first home. Is it financially-prudent to have her ""own"" the home outright and get the mortgage entirely in her name? 

Question 3: Any considerations for taking money out of the investment accounts? I know we'll be paying short/long-term capital gains taxes on sales - any impact/benefit to be gained from timing it EOY 2017 vs. early 2018? Or is the withdrawal from the investment account+accompanying capital gains taxes more or less completely separate from our income tax filings?

Thanks much - go Badgers!",finance
personalfinance,[Mortgages] Do the margins on tracker (ARM) mortgages charged by lenders generally increase when interest rates rise?,"UK based question but all views welcome.


I'm trying to decide whether to leave a lifetime tracker with a fairly uncompetitive margin for a two year fixed term tracker with a much better margin (0.84% over Bank of England base rate vs 1.84% over BoE base rate). BoE base rate is 0.25% so the relative difference is pretty big. 


Ignoring the downside of having to pay a fee to rearrange the mortgage after two years with the two year tracker, the question comes down to whether, if interest rates rise, the 1.84% over BoE of the lifetime tracker would look competitive again.


Common sense would suggest that the margin isn't really related to interest rates as it's just how the lender makes its money but since when has common sense applied to mortgages? 


Would be interested to hear from those who had tracker mortgages when interest rates were higher.",finance
personalfinance,"401k Loan to consolidate debt, increase cash flow and decrease taxes. Thoughts?","**TL;DR**: Is it worth to 'refi' existing debt to increase cash flow and start maxing-out 401k *now* (as opposed to late 2019).  

We are paying roughly $2,200 a month  repaying several loans (albeit low interest) and it occurred to me that I could take a $50,000 401k loan to pay them off (thus increasing our cashflow) but at the same  time allowing me to increase my 401k contribution (thus decreasing taxes). Without 'refi' these loans, the earliest I could max-out my 401k would be in late 2019.

I am aware that 401k loans would be due immediately if I changed jobs, but other than that, do you see any other downsides? Good/bad idea?

==Personal details==  
Age: 35 (Married)  
gross salary: 110k (household income about 160k)  
Current 401k contribution: 9% (~10k year)  
Employee match: 50% up to 6%.  
401k balance: 130k  (RoR 11% YTD)  
Credit score:800  
State: IL (5% Income tax)   

==401k loan details==  
401k Loan amount: $50,000  
Interest: 4.25% (Finance charges over life of loan would be ~$5200)  
Monthly loan repayment: ~$950  
Repayment period: 5 years  

==Current Loans/debt monthly payments (excluding mortgage)==  
700/mo @ 5.625% (Maturity date 08/2020)  (Rental Property)  
350/mo @ 2.29% (Maturity 01/2020) (Car 1)  
450/mo @ 2.24% (Maturity 07/2020) (Car 2)  
500/mo @ 0% APR for 14 months  (Balance Transfer)  
200/mo @ 0% APR for life of loan (Maturity 10/2019) (Home Improvement Loan)  
Total: $2200/mo  


Proposed  401k contribution: Contribute $675 on top of current contribution to max out 401k. (i.e. $1500/month instead of $825/month)  

If my calculations are right in the end my net paycheck would decrease by $1625 (extra 401k contrib + 401k loan payment), but I would no longer be paying $2200/month with after tax money. So in essence cash flow would increase by at least **$575/month**, this is without counting fed tax witholding would be less.

What do you think?  

**Edit**:

I ran a compound interest calculator, and the 401k balance would be *higher* in 5 years with a starting balance of $80k and monthly replenishment of ~ $2450/mo VS a  130k balance with initial contributions of $825/mo

$309,582 : Starting 80k bal @ 9% return with monthly replenishment(contrib+loan repay) of $2450/mo for 5 years     
$299,857: Starting 130k bal @9% return with a starting monthly contributions of $825, but being 'snowballed' as loans are repaid

&amp;nbsp;

**Needs/Wants/My Thoughts**
The responsible side of me says to sell my truck. Its expensive in every way possible. However my irresponsible side says to keep it because I genuinely enjoy it. Its definitely a luxury item. If I can improve my credit and refinance my truck to a lower interest rate, I think its a little more justifiable to keep it.

My rent. I rent a 3b2b home. I *wanted* a home with a backyard for the dogs and a garage large enough for the truck. I current have a roommate who moved in less than a month ago. Once he gets a job(He has till Sept), he will begin paying $850/mo. So that helps with the burden of the home.

&amp;nbsp;

**The house buying situation**
My landlord is a much wiser guy(73yo). He doesn't mind continuing to rent the home to me, but he would prefer to sell it off so its one less asset he has to manage. He's offered me first dibs on the home if I want it and has a close friend who will walk him and I through all of the paperwork for purchasing for free. The home is valued around $320k. I genuinely enjoy the home and would like to continue living there. My lease renews in April of next year. I'm a bit torn because I won't have the 20% to put down on the home so the amount of money i'm ""saving"" is ~200/mo. It will cost me more than my current rent to own this home(Unless my math is skewed!)

&amp;nbsp;

I would like to hear the advice of r/personalfinance on where I should go from here to improve my credit and opinions on home buying at my age, etc... I would like to start paying my father back as well. 

Thanks for the read and please let me know if I need to provide any other critical details.

Any feedback/criticism is appreciated and encouraged. Anyways, here’s some free DD-

**Company Info:**

Capital One ($COF) is a financial holdings company operating under 3 sectors: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking.  Recently beating their 7/20 earnings by 3% (1.96 vs 1.90 expected), COF saw a nice 8% increase in their share price (1).  COH has a slew of competitors in their industry including (but not limited to): Visa ($V), Mastercard ($MA) and American Express ($AXP) to name a few.

COF gains roughly 85% of their revenue from net interest while the rest comes from non-interest portions of the company.  COF has seen an 8% increase in net interest income from 2016 to 2017 (2).  COF’s commercial banking department saw a *317%* increase from 2016 (2016: 67; 2017: 213). However, their credit card department decreased from $609 to $271; I’ll expand on this later.

**Strength:**

To start off with some positives of COF, their net revenue increased by 3% this past year and they saw earnings increase by 6% as well (3).  As I mentioned earlier, COF also saw an astounding 317% increase in the commercial banking department.  This isn’t strongly reflected in their overall net income though, since they also took a *55%* hit in their credit card department cancelling it out.

COF isn’t as diversified as some of its competitors such as Visa.  As Visa mention in their 10k, if any increased regulations in the global payments industry can severely harm their business (25% of their revenue comes from international transactions)(5).  However, COF isn’t as exposed to the international market (only about 3%) shielding it from international policy changes.  In fact, if increased regulations were to come around it would present an opportunity for COF to gain ground on its competitors.

**Weakness**

In regards to their credit card department, COF actually reported $3,346 in net interest revenue (up from 3,033 in 2016; 10 percent increase).  So if they had a 10% increase in revenue why did the net income for the department drop by 50%?  The answer is they allocated $700 more dollars to “provisions for credit loss” (PCL) (2).  As a reference point, they increased their PCL from 1,071 to 1,717 from 2016.  This signifies a 60% increase in coverage while their net income only increased by 10%?  Seems a little absurd.

In their 10-k, they explain the increase in PCL is:

*  “due to increasing loss expectations” (page 12)(2).

* “higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to seasoning of recent growth” (page 11)(2)

For those who don’t know, a charge-off is a declaration by the creditor that the debt is unlikely to be collected (4).  What this reads to me as is that COF is relying on issuing riskier debts to maintain growth in their credit card department.  In the short term, this will inflate their net income for the department and perhaps even see continued net-interest growth in the short term since the interest rates on these will be higher than average.  However, when they fail since people (unsurprisingly, in this case) can’t pay it off COF will have to take the loss.

 Now, this is what they accounted for by allocating $700 more to PCL.  This should send up red flags, since they don’t disclose how heavily involved they are with these loans and use generic terms when referring to it.  Is a $700 increase enough to accommodate for all of risk they’ve taken on with these loans?  What kind of financial position is COF in that they resort to making unfavorable and unsustainable lending decisions and still take a 55% hit to their credit card departments net income?

They are one of the top 3 companies exposed to subprime auto-loan lending (7), which is frightening because automobiles are already one of the fastest depreciating assets by dropping a significant amount in value as soon as you drive it out of the lot.  WIth default rates already on the rise (7), how long will it be before COF is left bag-holding worthless loans?

**Opportunity:**

If COF’s 317% increase in their commercial banking department continues into next year, the upside potential is huge.  This is COF’s fastest growing department, and with an increased focus on it in this bull market it’ll be interesting to see just how much it can grow.  COF mentions it’s plans to open up larger investments and acquisitions in its technology infrastructure (page 19)(2).  This can have a large upside potential change for COF, as investing in technological infrastructure for the company has panned out well for a lot of companies.

It’s also impossible for their credit card department to take another hit like they did this year to it’s net income (from 609 to 271, would literally wipe out this department) so those losses won’t be dragging down COF’s overall net income.

**Threat:**

As I mentioned earlier, COF’s credit card department has been issuing a (much) higher percentage of riskier loans.  If something were to cause a larger-than-expected amount of the debtors to default on the loans (whether it’s the recession we’re long overdue for, rising interest rates or any number of things) COF can be in a lot of trouble.  COF is set up for another year in decreasing credit card net income, as it’s unsustainable practices of issuing riskier loans.

On a similar note, if charge-offs and PCL continue to increase again like they did this last year then COF can be caught in a sticky situation with decreased growth in ⅔ of it’s departments and even less revenue.

Any increased regulations on the domestic (U.S.) payment industry will impact COF more so than the majority of its competitors (such as Visa).  This is because COF’s business is primarily focused in the U.S. with only around 3% of their revenues coming from international transactions (2).

*Ratio Comparisons (6)*

P/E: COF 12.7		V 29.1

* COF’s P/E has seen a slight increase from its previous years value of 10.2.  This is as expected though since they did have decreased revenue.  V’s P/E is also up from its last years value of 29.1, around the same difference as COF.  If you look across the consumer financial sector, 12.7 is an attractive P/E to have making this a good sign for COF.

P/B: COF 0.9		V 4.7

* A P/B of 0.9 is exceptional, even for a sector know for their low P/B’s.  A P/B below 1 means they are trading for less than their book values indicate.  This can be both good or bad depending on the company.  In this scenario, I’m not a fan of it simply because of how their credit card department is performing, and this low P/B reflects that something is potentially fundamentally wrong with the company.  However,  if COF is able to grow and recover this next quarter there’s a lot of upside potential when the P/B will inevitably be corrected.

Med. Operating Profit Margin:  COF 25.1		V 60.6

* What operating margin tells us is the amount of leftover revenue after operations.  Typically, you want to see a higher OPM because that means you’re making more money per sale. I don’t like COF’s relatively low OPM, especially with their declining growth in one of their 3 main departments (credit card).  They’ll have to make 2 sales for every 1 that Visa does, just to stay even.

Return on Equity:  COF 8.3		V 26.26

* Return on Equity is important because it tells us how much profit a company generates from shareholder’s money.  A low ROE, such as COF’s 8.3 (generally anything below 10% is unfavorable) isn’t a great sign.  This means they will need 3x the amount of capital investments to get the same return as Visa.

Dividend Yield:  COF 1.8		V .7

* For anyone who doesn’t know, dividend yield is measures how much dividends are being paid out (based on share price).  A higher DY is preferable, and COF has a good DY for their sector.  This is what I like about COF, they have a nice dividend yield.  They are continuing to invest back into themselves by expanding their technology infrastructure while also issuing some dividends for the shareholders.  It’s the best of both worlds.

Conclusion:

* On paper, COF looks like a good company in their sector.  With low P/E, low P/B and a relatively high DY it can be an attractive company.  That being said, I don’t foresee COF having a strong future outlook.  With the increase in risky loans being given out in their credit card department and still underperforming, COF puts itself in a poor position.  With subprime-auto loans on the rise and COF being one of the 3 most exposed (7), I can easily see COF taking on a lot of water when people default on their loans.  With the way things are heading, they will need another 300% increase in their commercial banking department, which will be hard to match especially if anything were to come about to hinder it (as I mentioned earlier with a recession, ect.).  Obligatory ""I have no position in this company, nor do I intend to open one any time soon"".

personalfinance,Taking out a Lending Club loan to pay off credit card debt to build credit?,"A few pieces:  
-I just finished a masters program during which i accrued a decent amount of credit card debt (around 20k) in addition to student loans
  
-I now have a decent job and believe I can pay down that debt over the next 5 or so months.  

-My wife and I are starting toward the home-buying process, and hope to start seriously looking in 6mo. to a year.  

-Credit karma scores are 728 (Transunion) and 697 (Equifax). I have one thing in collections that I'm working on, but it looks like the other thing that might help me raise my score a bit would be more accounts.  

So my question is: Does it makes sense to take out a loan from Lending Club (or equivalent) to pay off my credit card debt, then pay off that loan in the same period of time that I was planning on paying off the cc debt? This would reduce interest rates for the next few months and add another account to my credit score profile, but will also presumably add a hard credit pull, which could be an issue if I'm applying for mortgages in 6 months to a year. Any thoughts and/or other aspects that I might be missing?

I was told they were accredited and had a high graduation rate as well as some of the best game design courses in the area, all of which was total bullshit that flew over my then 24 year old head.  After taking out over $10k in student loans I found myself taking basic biology and history courses as part of their required curriculum.  Only one class each semester would be dedicated to game design and even then it was all over the place.  One semester it was 3DS Max, the next it was game theory, the next it was art 101.  I ended up dropping out after not even a year because of the time it required to be on campus and the lack of education I was receiving.

I also discovered recently that they split my two loans (subsidized and unsubsidized) in to 4 ""tokens"" each with a different interest rate.  So my monthly payment of $139 over these last several years has only been paying a small fraction of the balance with the vast majority going to interest.

personalfinance,Retirement investing options for grad student ineligible for Roth IRA contributions,"TL;DR - wanting to open Roth IRA to get started on retirement/long term investing, but have no qualifying income to do so, and won't for the next few years (I'm a U.S. grad student studying in Sweden). Is a taxable/brokerage account a good alternative, or should I hold off for better opportunities? 

After finishing undergrad in Spring 2015, I worked my first ""official"" job (well, college funded ""fellowship"") until Summer 2016. I took a gap year of travel and volunteering until Summer 2017, and now will start a 2 year grad program from Fall 2017 - Fall 2019. 

I unfortunately wasn't thinking seriously about a Roth IRA or long term investing plan until after wrapping up my fellowship. After filing taxes this past Spring of 2017, I kicked myself for not opening a Roth IRA using the previous year's income. This summer I've been working small baby/dog/housesitting gigs, and my grad program will be out of country (Sweden), so I don't anticipate having any U.S. income (read: not eligible to open/contribute to a Roth IRA) for this current and at least the next two years.

Is a taxable/brokerage account worth considering at this point? As a first investment, I would choose a few low cost index funds, setting up a passive/long term investment strategy to build on (a la Vanguard / Boglehead). However, I wonder whether this would create more tax complications come filing time than it's worth. (Capital gains I'll need to report?) At this point, I could immediately invest 6-8K (savings set aside specifically for beginning to invest). 

I have started an emergency fund, and I plan to start a 5 year CD ladder this summer - not really an ""alternative"" to investing, but figured I should seek better interest rates as than my savings account offers. I've also thought about forgoing the taxable brokerage account for now, and saving that sum of money for use when I have an employer match to contribute to a few years down the line (i.e. contributing more to get maximum employer match and supplementing my income with that saved money). Adding to the uncertainty, at this point, I'm not sure whether I'll be working based in the U.S. or elsewhere after my studies. Studying in Sweden, I'm certainly going to try to leverage the networks I build and see what happens. 

My gut tilts towards not rashly jumping the gun, and instead waiting for tax advantaged opportunities to become available. On the other hand, I'm itching to start investing and build momentum. I'm 24, starting grad school, and feeling like I'll be falling behind and losing valuable years if I don't get something started soon.

Now for my second year I am set to take out the same amount of loans to pay for school and am receiving the same amount of money in grants, making the total $11,000 in subsidized loans and $3,000 in unsubsidized loans. However, the following year, my third year, I will not be receiving even close to the same amount of grant money and likely less money in federal grants as well. Since this is the case I will be taking out private loans my third and likely fourth year as well. While I am unsure of the specific interest rates I may receive from a private student loan, I am sure it will be much higher than the 3.76% I have with the federal loans.

So my question is, am I better off saving the $2,000 this coming year and using it to contribute to paying at least in part to my 3rd year of school, making the amount I need with the private loan lower, or am I better off beginning to pay into the unsubsidized loans that I already have taken out and continuing to pay down my debt as much as possible throughout the rest of my college career?

Extra information, currently tuition for my school approximately $7,500 and housing on campus $14,500 ($22,000 total per year). My school requires living on campus the first two years, hence why I am not living at home. However, for my 3rd and 4th years I will be at home meaning I will only be paying for the $7,500 of tuition.

Thank you for any help and advice and if anything needs to be clarified I am happy to answer questions!",finance
personalfinance,Debt Plan,"Hi all! By recommendation of my boyfriend, I am here to ask for some suggestions as to how I should most constructively demolish my debt. 

Backstory: 

I racked up a bit of medical debt around the age of 18, my parents were never great with handling money, I've never taken a personal finance course. I'm now 26, graduated college with $26k loans. I've got a small credit card debt (1.6k), my car is paid for, but I make monthly payments to my grandparents for the expense (they insisted I borrow from them rather than a bank because my grandfather hates the idea of interest being taken out of he can help me and knows I'm generally responsible). Now, we want to buy a house and my debts need to be paid. I've bundled up a list of my debts and their interest rates below. I am torn between debt snowballing, debt avalanching or a new approach that I'm open to hearing. I was approved for $1000 on a 15 month no APR (25% after), 3% balance transfer, $0 introductory fee double cash card. 

Debts: 
$1,600 credit card (13.8% interest) 
$11,000 student loans (4 bundled, ~6.5% interest rate) 
$15,000 student loans (4 bundled, ~3.8% interest rate) 
$1,800 medical debt (no accruing interest) 
$3700 on my car, paying $120/month 

I currently live with my boyfriend in his owned home with our roommates and he charges me minimal rent and we bundle our cellphones and internet. 

My current plan, which I would love feedback on (please): 

1. Roll my current credit card to the double cash card ($1000 of the $1.6), pay off the $600 first. 
2. I work at a brewery two days a week, I'll allocate my hourly wages and tips the following way: 20% to medical debt, the remaining on the credit card. 

3. Cut excessive spending and allocate those saved expenses to my medical debt. This includes no more restaurants, target trips, bar tabs and entertainment spending. This should bring $150-300 extra a month. 

After my large debts are paid (Medical, Credit) I would like to pay to have a good few dentist appointments, including alignment for my bottom row as well as begin saving for a house. Extra money will continue to go to my student loans. 

Little extra info: my full time job will be cutting back to 30 hours a week. I am in school again, for my associates this time since my bachelors did not work out to find a full time, which will be paid for with student loans (~$1,700 a semester, 4 total semesters when I'm done). 

Any advice you have, I greatly appreciate it. Let me know if I can provide any more information. Thank you kindly in advance.",finance

My question for you awesome guys and girls is:

personalfinance,How realistic are these house-buying guidelines from Rachel Cruze (Dave Ramsey's daughter)?,"Hi all,

I just watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nwv2IQRqQY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=56) and would like to buy a house one day, but I have no idea how I can meet the parameters Rachel Cruze is suggesting.

For reference, I am a federal employee living and working in Fairfax County, VA, where unfortunately even the most affordable houses (small cottages from WWII) are valued at around $400,000.

If I were to go for one of these houses, according to Rachel Cruze after saving 3-6 months expenses for an emergency fund and then saving $40,000 to $80,000 for a down-payment, I need a 15-year mortgage that is no more than 25% of my take-home pay.

As a federal employee, the highest salary that I can get within a reasonable amount of time is $94,796, which comes to about $4,740 a month after all deductions.  And yet even assuming a full 20% down-payment, a 15-year mortgage would still be 56% of my take-home pay ($2,673 a month).  That is nowhere near the 25%.

I would need a down-payment worth 70% of the home's value ($270,000) to meet this 25% guideline.

What am I missing?  I just don't understand how this is possible, or is it not?  Is Rachel Cruze just not being realistic?",finance

personalfinance,Grad Student Loan Payback,"Hi all. So I've been kept up the past few nights and this has been really stressing me out so I decided to post here and to get some thoughts. I apologize for the long post, but even just typing it out and venting makes me feel more at ease. lol.

I'm finishing up my last year of pharmacy school right now in the North East. I go to a petty established program and hope to have a good career. I love what I do and is one of the biggest reason for doing what I do. I plan to do 2 years of post graduate residency, to prepare me for a clinical position once I graduate. 

In the end, I will have completed my entire schooling in 6 years (2 years undergrad + 4 years professional school). Pharmacy school is about 15k a semester (and I was out of state for my first year, so tuition was apporx. doubled -25k/semester- moved in state and saved a buttload after that year). All in all, taking undergrad into account (which I had no college fund, or any help paying- See: private loan), I have taken out almost exactly $190k. Not including interest.

I logged on the other day to look at my totals including interest thus far: $145k (+30k for this year) for all my federal loans and $35k in private (was 24k originally). Looking at the interest rates I realized how high my Private loan interest rate was (11.25%) so I borrowed 15k extra in federal to bring that down. (so In the end there will be more federal and less private).

Pharmacy residents make 35-50k a year. After that, landing a clinical job, I hope to be around 90k-120k. Obviously depending on location.

So after doing some research and putting some thought into it, I have come up with a few scenarios-

A) Pay off to plan in 10 years or whatever the government tells me and basically live like a student for the next 10 years and not be able to save much.

B) Refinance EVERYTHING, get a lower interest rate and put my entire paycheck away to hopefully have (almost) everything by the time I turn 30 (6 years post graduation).

C) Residency's are usually centered around hopsitals, so just limit my search to non-profit hospitals and hopefully land a position at nonprofit and pay the minimum payment for 10 years and have loans forgiven after that. (This is the option that I think works best, but from what I've read it might not be around much longer??).

I understand I can't lump in my private loans with the federal repayment plans, which I would obviously try to refinance those and pay those off ASAP. I also also understand that if I were to refinance everything I would lose the federal benefits from my federal loans.

I'm living at home my final year of school and my only real expense is my car which has already been budgeted in. I really only plan on applying to residencies that are commutable from my home so that I won't have to pay rent. Also, I have not lived an extravagant lifestyle, pretty much all of my loan money went to either tuition/boarding etc., so this isn't a lifestyle issue. I also have no problem living a frugal life for a temporary amount of time. (I haven't lived on much so far in life so I wouldn't know any differently if I just kept along the same way!). I have tried to make the most financial sense (public institution, least amount of years in college total). I don't mean to whine and complain like I didn't know what I was getting myself into, I knew I was going to be in a lot of debt. But now, running the numbers with interest, I'm starting to get stressed (I also may be doing this completely incorrectly as I have a very limited finance background, hence my posting here). 

I think what stresses me out most is the unknown (isn't that everything in life though). I just need a plan to know what I have to do moving forward. 

TL;DR. Basically my questions are as follows:

1) Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Is it worth it?

2) Is it better to just refinance, buckle down, and pay everything off in full?

3) Are there any other options that I'm just missing entirely?? 

Thanks in advance and for hopefully putting my mind at a bit more of an ease. I know it's not going to be easy moving forward (but yet again, pharmacy school was certainly not a breeze, and neither is life), but I'm ready for whatever I need to do.",finance

personalfinance,Pay off loan or maintain emergency savings??,"Hi I wanted to know if it would be better to pay off my school loans or maintain emergency savings since my school loan's interest rate is not that high.  

Income: 3816/month NET  
School loans: 268/month. Principal is $16,700 at ~4.5% fixed interest rate.  
Current emergency savings: $25,000  
All Bills/Entertainment (no other debt) - $2,471/month  
Net income already includes 401k contribution to get employer match + pension contribution.  
At my current lifestyle which is not expected to increase anytime soon, $1,345 goes into savings each month.  
Should I do it?

EDIT: $2,471/month for all expenses already includes if I don't have the $268/month school loan payment anymore.  
I have my own personal excel budget. Currently bills/savings/entertainment is 41/35/23.

EDIT2: I would use my $25,000 emergency fund to pay off ALL the school loans. Would be left with $8,300.",finance
personalfinance,Not Sure Whether To Rent Apartment Or Buy Home,"***WARNING, SLIGHTLY LONG READ*****

Hello,

First i want to say thank you for taking the time to read this. I am a 28 year old male currently living at home with parents and would like to move out into my own space. 

I shared an apartment with my ex and our daughter for three years, but we split almost a year ago. I was unemployed when we split up last year but now I have a good job where i recently got promoted to manager. 

Here is my dilemma...I would like to move out of my parents house and get my own space. I have been looking at renting a place but I recently found out about some down payment assistance programs that i would like to apply for. Based on how interest rates are going, I would rather have a home than simply renting somewhere plus I could turn the property into rental income in the future. 

My credit score is poor, like below 600. But i am only $700 in debt. My goal is to pay off the debt, get a secured credit card, and try to get my score up to at least 630 to 650 so i can qualify for some loans. I also pay costs for my daughters clothes and daycare, but I am not on child support. My total expenses right now are about $800 to $1000 a month but some of that is me pitching in to help at my parents house. 

I also have no car or car insurance currently but those are expenses I will have to pick up soon.  My daughter is 3 now so i would like at the very least to have a 2 bedroom so she can have her own room, and in the part of Georgia that I live in, a 2 bedroom goes from about $1100 to $1400. And no, I do not want a roommate. 

So my question is should I even be flirting with the idea of buying a house or should I focus instead on renting and saving up? I know home ownership is a big step with unforseen pitfalls but I would love to buy one before the interest rates get high. 

Thank you all for reading",finance
Bitcoin,BTC-e case: Some thoughts and questions,"Having reviewed both the indictment as well as the press release from the DoJ, there are several questions I think should be discussed.
Some parts of the indictment make me believe that this whole action against BTC-e and Vinnik could lead to much more problems than most are aware at the moment.

For example: In count 2 of the indictment, they write: ""BTC-e was an international money laundering scheme [...]"". They do not state that parts of BTC-e were used by the defendants as a money laundering scheme. BTC-e *was*, according to the DoJ, a money laundering scheme, thus all persons who ever deposed money or Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency in BTC-e may be seen by the US as co-conspirators. I personally never used BTC-e, so I don't really care for me, but I know that people who were doing legit business also were using BTC-e. So does this mean that all of them potentially have to face a lawsuit against them in the US?

Under count 6, they state: ""Despite doing substantial business in the United States, BTC-e was not registered as a money services business... [...] as federal law requires."" Now they also state that BTC-e was managed by a company in the Seychelles and had its web domains registered in countries like Singapore, British Vifgin Islands, France and New Zealand while BTC-e stated to be located in Bulgaria, operating under the laws of Cyprus. At the end of the day, under count 16, the indictment states that BTC-e - which, according to the indictment didn't ask its clients for identifiers, serverd ""numerous customers in the United States and customers in the Northern District of California."" Am I the only one who thinks this is weird? First the DoJ claims that BTC-e did not ask for any identifier, then the DoJ claims that there were a lot of - obviously identifiable - customers from the US? Well, at least two of them were identified: Two corrupt U.S. federal agents.

Okay, then the indictment states that BTC-e used servers in the US. I guess they refer to Cloudflare. So using Cloudflare makes you potentially a subject to US law? Also, the indictment states that companies in California were used by BTC-e. But none of them is named nor its role. This looks a bit weird.

The indictment also states that wire transfers from banks in the U.S. and made by U.S. citizens were accepted.

So my interpretation of this: ANY Bitcoin exchange accepting wire transfers from the U.S. or accepting clients from the U.S. or using any internet service from the U.S. is potentially at risk of being prosecuted if they do not comply with U.S. laws.

Later in the indictment, they list illegal transactions of about 18'000 Mt.Gox-Bitcoin to Tradehill in San Francisco. All of these transactions took place in January and February 2012, the last ones on February 12, 2012. The next day, Tradehill announced that it will shut down its operations. Tradehill was by then, if I understand it correctly, set up and operated by Jered Kenna. So would this make him a money launderer, too?

To make one thing clear: I never used Mt.Gox nor BTC-e, nor do I support money laundering in any way. However, this case could become more important over the time for Bitcoin related businesses all over the world. It means: Accepting clients from the U.S. or using internet services in the U.S. potentially puts you in a situation where you have to act according to U.S. laws.

I live in Europe, and I'm willing to live according my country's laws (as far as possible). However, I am not willing to form my business to comply with U.S. laws - which sometimes would make me violate domestic laws.

In the long term, this could mean that Bitcoin companies should refuse to render their services to any US citizen and/or company.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Thinking of investing some of my Roth IRA in Vanguard European Stock Index Investor (VEURX) or Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF (VWO). Thoughts?,"I have some amount of money sitting in my Roth IRA that I have not yet invested due to the current market highs, but I am worried I am missing out on these returns. I do have a decent amount of funds currently invested from previous years (in the target date fund and Van total stock and bond funds), but I have not invested my past two years of roth contributions. I am thinking of putting some of the cash (probably around $2K each) towards Vanguard European Stock Index Investor (VEURX) or Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) to push up my returns a bit. It seems that a lot of money is moving towards the European market as the Eurozone is in the earlier stages of economic recovery compared to the US and companies are trading at lower price to earnings and price to book value ratios. However, just looking at last year or so VEURX looks to be expensive as well. The same seems to be true about VWO with investors looking for higher returns with interest rates so low. I know a lot of this sub suggests against timing the market but I have bought in the last few times during market highs and regret this. If this might not be the right strategy/too risky for Roth money, would this be an OK idea for a regular brokerage account?",finance

I had to take their 3.9% interest rate in order to get more than 6k off the MSRP of the car, so I did it, but looking at my contract there is no penalty for refinancing early so I'm looking to do so. My credit score is around 750 and I'm only interested in a 60 or 72 month loan. I don't have many credit unions in my area, only large banks with refinancing rates not much better than what I have now. I looked up a few credit unions online, but many of them require employer affiliation/ membership and I've found I do not qualify for many of them.

personalfinance,Loan to pay off credit card debt faster?,"Hi, all.

Posting for a non-Redditor friend - let's call her Lisa. Dollar amounts are approximate, since I can only go off what she tells me, and I get he impression that she gave me conservative estimates.

Lisa has been in substantial debt since she graduated college 4 years ago. In addition to her remaining student loan debt (~$25k), the remainder of her car loan (""a few thousand""), she also estimates that she has ~$7-8k in credit card debt spread across 3 cards, and ""maybe a few hundred"" on store credit cards. I know her student loans are on an income-based repayment plan, and she says she's been making the minimum payments on her credit cards and car loan, but that she ""probably"" missed a payment or two when she was briefly unemployed last year.

I recently told her about CreditKarma to give her some oversight of her credit, and a few days ago she told me that one the app's recommendations was to take out a loan to pay off her credit card debt all at once.

I have no idea if this is a good idea or not. If she were to get approved for an $8,000 loan, then she'd effectively just be consolidating her CC debt and only making one payment a month, possibly at a lower interest rate than whatever her CC companies offer. So there's a convenience factor there.

On the other hand, does it make sense to shift debt around like this? Does debt from a personal loan look ""better"" on a credit report than just CC debt? Considering her credit score isn't great, I imagine her CC interest rates must be high, so she can't be making much headway on that debt just by making minimum payments.

Obviously neither of us are experts - any advice would be appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Any way to leverage a short-staffing situation into a larger raise?,"Hello all, I have a question that I think you may all be able to help me with. 

First, some background: I am a manager at a theater out of what is currently at team of two. This past year we had our third manager run into some health issues and he has been placed on indefinite leave (the ideal amount of managers is 4, but there has never been the budget). This is about 6 months ago. At that time, we were starting to enter the slow season, so we were not so worried about being short-staffed. But, we are quickly approaching the start of a new season, and are still down to two. There have been a few applicants, none getting past the 2nd interview. 

Last year, I got a $3k raise to $48,000. As our fiscal year is coming to end in September, I can fairly easily anticipate a slight raise (1-2%) coming into the following season. The problem is that we are going into a very heavy season with only two managers, which would include taking on a very heavy (60-80 hour/week) workload. This can be problematic because of the physical and mental toll that this can have, besides going well beyond the 40-hour workweek I am salaried for.

My question is, is there any way I can leverage this situation into a larger raise? I have aims of eventual growth into a higher position, and would prefer not to put myself into the bad graces of HR, etc. 

Any suggestions would be extremely helpful!",finance

I realize and don’t mind the fact that I will not be going out to eat and do stuff for entertainment. Please, don’t be cruel, we all make mistakes. 

I’m trying to see when would be the best time to refinance my car as I will be making student loan payments come 2018 and don’t want to defer. I also hope to get IBR based on my income. I am currently living with family but unfortunately, that will be coming to an end. With credit card debt the past two years, (paying it and using it), I’ve managed to bump my credit from the mid-500s to the mid-600s. I am hoping to reach the 700s by 2018. 

I'm not sure what else I can also restructure to adjust for the tsunami that will be happening. I think that if I can lower my auto and combine that with my student loans I would pay almost the same amount as I am currently paying on my auto, perhaps a bit more like $700-$800. Is this realistic?

I know that a lot of people won't understand the things that led up to my insurmountable debt, but please, please give me advice. I feel like I'm drowning. I feel physically sick and I need to know a good plan.

I'm 27. Just got a job offer for 43,500 as an MSW. This is good money starting out. My private loans are $130,000. My interest rate is really bad- like 10%. When I calculate how much of my debt is from interest, I want to cry. My mom cosigned for me. No, she cannot help with the payments. I got the bill in the mail... roughly $1400. I owe federal loans too, but I'm not worried about those because I know they will help you out. Private loan companies don't care at all.

My job doesn't start until the end of August. Until then, my debt to income ratio is really bad. I got some quotes to consolidate, and I was declined. This is where I lost all hope. I don't mean to sound dramatic, but I have really bad anxiety and I don't know what I am going to do.

I don't know how much my expenses will be. I am unable to move back home, so I have to pay rent. Luckily, I am staying with my boyfriend until I can save a little to move somewhere. We are going to be roommates. But, we live in Charlotte, NC, so rent is ridiculous. We are looking at the surrounding cities for places to rent.

* I know I have 80 for cell phone- I'm on my parent's family plan, $60 is my bill and $20 for my phone. I owe about $400 on the phone, so I could concievably just give that to my mom at my first check (I still have 2 months of my forbearance) to clear up $20.

* Health insurance will probably be $300.

* My health is not good, and I'm on numerous medications. $40.

* No car payment, but insurance is $100 a month.

* Random personal bills I don't want to get into for about $350

* Not included is my portion of rent, utilities, groceries, gas. I've never lived on my own for REAL, as I've always had parents backing me up but they are done. That's why I'm at this alone, and honestly as it should be. I'm an adult and they've done a generous amount, so no shade to them whatsoever!

Anyway, I KNOW I need a second job and as SOON as I get settled in my schedule, this is my next priority. I am looking for online work, as I will have to work a flexible schedule daily since I am working with the homeless mental health population and will be rotated on call. I would love to find a job out somewhere, I'm just afraid I won't find the flexibility with my schedule. Any information on that, I would REALLY APPRECIATE IT. Any ideas for flexible part time jobs! Any advice for online jobs? I'm looking to apply for Amazon and VIPKid online.

If I need to add any more information, please ask me. I am willing for any suggestions. I feel like my life is over and it's barely just begun.",finance

personalfinance,Paying off student loans with car loans: Fraud or Not Fraud?,"A friend of mine on Facebook posted a question about refinancing her student loans. Someone responded saying they got a check from a credit union for a car loan (lower interest rate than the student loans) in the amount of the KBB value of their car and used that money to pay off the student loans. 

Is this legit? It sounded the fraud alarm bells for me, but maybe offering your car as collateral is above board. Let me know if this person is crazy or crazy genius, please!",finance
personalfinance,Taking out a student loan to pay off personal debt,"Hi, okay so I'll try to keep it brief. 
I'm a college student. I've incurred about $1000 worth of debt on my personal credit card. I pretty much live paycheck to paycheck and have had a hard time paying it off. Pretty much just making the minimum payment, and some months not even that. The other day when I told my aunt about this, she suggested I take out a student loan and use that to pay off the debt because of the lower interest rate and timeline on when I need to pay. 

Is this a good idea? Essentially debt swapping? I haven't talked to the bank so I don't even know if I could use a student loan towards something unrelated to school, but my parents do help with my tuition and I could ask them to use the loan for that and then give me the money they would have paid out of pocket.",finance

personalfinance,"why wont's some banks allow me to deposit 3rd party checks, unless that person goes to the bank with me? (even if it's a family with identical home address)","I've been wondering about this for a while.

I have checking, savings and other accounts at several different banks.   If a family gives me a check that was made out to him/her(for example, a rebate or refund on a company check), PNC and Bank of America have no problem accepting them.  The family member just has to sign the back of the check and write ""pay to the order of [my full name].   The family member has the same home address as me and that address is sometimes printed on the check.

However, a couple of other large banks that I use absolutely refuses to allow such 3rd party checks to be deposited into my account.  They have clearly spelled out printed policy that say the 3rd party must be present at the branch with me, in order for me to deposit it.  In addition, if the check is over $999, then that other person has to sign a form and pay $5 to have the form notarized. (the notary public is a teller at the bank)    They claim that was because of new federal banking regulations as a result of September 11. (if so, why don't PNC and Bank of America, two of the largest banks in the country) have such rules?

Just wondering... :)",finance
personalfinance,Big life changes not reflected in credit score,"Hi all!  I have a sort-of complicated situation I could use some advice sorting out.

My husband and I are interested in buying a home, but our credit doesn't reflect our financial situation.  Since his credit is absolute garbage and his income isn't much, our best bet will be for me to just buy the home without putting his name on it.  This is no problem, our current home is in my name only.

About me:  in 2005 I bought a home, and I had no business doing that, and no sane person should have given me a mortgage.  My income at the time was about $22k/year.  I hung in there for 9 years with my 9% interest rate and was completely upside down on the mortgage.  After the bubble burst, the home was worth about half what I paid.  In that time, my income did not increase at all.  In 2014 I got a deed in lieu and walked away from that house.  Got married, and my brother-in-law loaned me the cash for our current house with no interest.  The house is fine, it is just a tiny house on a tiny lot in a mostly-rental neighborhood. We just finished paying him back.  I finished a second degree and nearly tripled my income in about 3 years.

So this is my life now:  I own my home outright, the market value is probably around $36k (we paid $17k).  I make about $64k/year now.  The house we like is going for $99k, but has been on the market for nearly a year and is more or less a 1000sf studio with no actual bedrooms.  Not marketable as a family home, but pretty cool for us DINKs.  We have been casually looking at places with a little more land since our area has such cheap real estate and we have the ability to rehab a fixer-upper.

My TransUnion score is 571 and Equifax is 552.  I have one actual unpaid item on my credit report, a Comcast bill for around $360.  All my other dings are from old defaulted student loans that are now paid up and current, and the deed in lieu.  My mom cosigned on my car lease, which is pretty new, so I'm stuck with that for a couple more years.  I paid my credit cards and cancelled them all in 2005 and have not had any since then.

My monthly bills look like this: 
Car payment 347   
Insurance 78.  
Utilities 175.  
Phone/cable/internet 230.  
Misc subscriptions and crap 50.  
Student loans 550.  
Property taxes 440/year.  

With take-home pay of about $3800/month, I can certainly afford a mortgage payment, and of course my husband has income too, but we aren't even counting that.

Taking all this into account, how in the world can I possibly get a mortgage?  Should I try to get a credit card?  Even if this particular house doesn't work out, we are fine right where we are for now.  I would like to at least be ready to get a loan in the future if we should happen to fall in love with a property again.

TL;DR:  I tripled my income, but still have the credit of a broke person.  Please help.",finance
personalfinance,10k Medical Debt - Negotiable? Collections Consequences?,"My S.O. (now wife, then girlfriend) and I incurred about ~10k of medical debt for routine OB care relating to an unplanned pregnancy. We have since married and she is now on my health insurance which should cover 100% of remaining care, but we are trying to determine whether we can negotiate down the debt/what options we have.  

Some relevant info:  

* My wife is not a US citizen - we are going through the green card application process right now.
* She had health insurance during her treatment through her ESL school, but it covered a grand total of $0 of OB care.
* We have the money to pay now, but would really prefer putting it towards the baby/a down payment on a house.
* The debt is in my wife's name. She has no credit (good or bad) in the USA.
* The debt is still with the hospital and not in collections yet. The hospital offers an in-house payment plan where you can split out payments up to 12 months. Beyond 12 months you need some financing plan that has an interest rate associated with it (I believe 6%?).

A few of the specific things we were wondering:

* Can we negotiate to pay less than 100%? Other PF posts seem to suggest 'Yes' but when I called the hospital they said that we need to pay the full cost and that there is no wiggle room.  If you can negotiate is there a good way to go about it?
* I've read before that you may be billed less when you self-pay. I mentioned this to the hospital (as it went through her insurance but her insurance paid nothing) and they said this is false.  Does it matter?  It does seem as though the amounts charged for ultrasounds since she's been on my insurance are much less than the amounts charged for ultrasounds early in the pregnancy.
* They gave her one test too early in the pregnancy and had to run it again.  Can we get the duplicate charge removed?
* There is a $700 bill for '15 mins genetic counseling' (which we did get). This one in particular seems excessive - is it for just the consultation or resulting tests?
* If we went to collections (not seriously considering this) could they refuse to provide ongoing OB care?  As a married couple would this have repercussions down the line for a mortgage if the debt is in her name but we use my credit for the mortgage?

investing,"So, let's talk about Treasury bonds -- the kind the Fed owns.","There's a few things that ought to be more widely known, and I don't know all of them either, so let's all learn something here :-)

* When the Treasury needs to raise money, it sells bonds.  Nominally, they are $1000 or $10,000 face value, sold at a discount and redeemed for the face amount -- right?  (This is effectively how Savings Bonds work, too.)
* Currently, that discount isn't much -- around 1%.  So, the Treasury sells a $1000 bond, they get $999, and eventually pay back $1000.  
* When the Fed buys $1 **b**illion worth, as they did 85 times per month during QE, did they really buy a million $1000 bonds?  Or a hundred thousand $10,000 bonds?  There just -has- to be larger face value amounts, yes?
* When a bond renews/rolls over, does the bondholder collect the interest, and say ""keep the $999"", or does the interest roll over as well and compound?  Given that the rate might change every time, the former seems simpler than the latter.
* What really is the most common term for such bonds?  We always hear about the ""3-month T-bill rate"" as the benchmark; if that's the most common term, the Fed has been rolling over billions and billions of dollars every three months for quite some time now.  True?  Or is it an assortment of 30-day, 91-day, 6-month, 1-year, ... etc?
* Finally, as I understand it so far the tapering process will start next month, $10B per month.  On a day-to-day implementation basis, as these bonds come up for renewal, the first $10B in a month will not get rolled, then the rest for that month will then be renewed normally.  That is correct, yes?

I had to fight like hell to push through college and try to be there for my mother and siblings, but suppressed so much of my own pain.

The same people I sacrificed for my mother and siblings knew I was misdiagnosed ADHD in law school and took advantage of me while I was suffering on amphetamines for no reason. The doctor knew as well and they were covering for him so I wouldn't sue and once I escaped that trap and saw a psych, I got sober and saw things as clear as day. It destroyed me that they rejected me to the point I suffered and kicked me while I was down. They also tarnished my relationship with a woman I loved very much all 3 years of law school that supported me all because my older brother has a sexuality issue and it wouldn't be fair if I got married and he couldn't accept himself (somehow it's my fault). I managed to pull off some decent gigs in the WH over a summer in D.C. and a large law firm summer associate gig my first year, but at a huge price.

I consolidated all my federal debt and my law school was sticker price and coming from a situation like I am, I owe a ton of money over $100,000 in federal debt but thanks to Obama, Income Based Repayment kicks in and you only have to pay 10% of your discretionary income, but it's the private debt that kills because of the lack of repayment and options.

personalfinance,Pre-owned APR vs lease money factor,"I'm stuck on a decision. Should I buy low mileage, pre-owned... or lease?

Pre-owned... usually come with slightly higher interest rates. I have good credit, but not great credit. What I like about this, is it opens 40k-70k mileage cars with mid-level or luxury trims. If I lease, I'm looking at the entry level trim.

Lease... do folks usually get lower MF rates than they would had they financed? Or do they see similar ""rental"" fees (i.e. if I was approved for 6% financing, would I expect to see a 0.0025 money factor? 6%/2400 = 0.0025). Is it that much more difficult to qualify for a lease with decent credit &amp; no missed payments?

The reason to consider a lease... low payments, 100% warranty, improved fuel mileage, and I have a tendency to change vehicles a lot. I drive 15k/year, plus/minus 1,000. At 0.15 or 0.20 overage fee, I'm not concerned if I go over. You also get two options at the end of the lease, 1) to purchase at the depreciated value after 3 years, fully knowing how you treated the car, or 2) walk away.",finance

The $6k loan has an interest of 9.99% even with a consigner with amazing credit. It's through wells fargo (sallie mae had worse base interest rates) and i have no penalties on paying back early. I didn't have to use the full private loan due to having a friend that gave me his textbooks for free, along with getting a deal from a previous student on tools and a calibration kit we have to build in class. I was able to not use $246 and only take out about $5800 for the loan. The agent i spoke to said at the end of my deferment that i would have about $1,000 in interest.

personalfinance,"Broke, homeless, in debt, losing hope","Edit: not sure why this keeps getting downvoted. Just asking for advice here.

This going to be somewhat long. Some months ago, bad choices that I was consistently making caught up hard. I was living with my fiance, and her parents were paying for the rent. I had a job which barely payed me enough to buy food, and I was doing everything I could to get a better paying job but it didn't happen. Eventually my fiance had enough because I wasn't doing my part for other bills and I had a drug problem (which is taken care of), my belongings were stuffed into my car along with $500 and a brief ""good luck"". I was and still am completely devastated from this. Her father took my firearm which I could've sold for a very much needed amount of money.

With family thousands of miles away, and no friends nearby who were not able to have me stay, I set my sights for NYC where a friend promised a place to stay. This friend got me a job where he worked, which I had for a couple days until I had to take the subway alone for the first time, got lost and was fired on the spot being late. His roommates didn't want me there so out of respect for them I left. Everything went back into my car which was my home for several weeks, until I drove back to where I started from where everything is much cheaper.

A friend contacted me and told me he has a free spare bed in his house and as a manager of a store he hired me. Now, this friend was a foster child, and former foster children have some benefits after they turn 18 including free rent. Their case worker came over recently and informed us that only half the rent would be payed now that I'm staying there. Neither of us are able to pay it unless we'd rather starve to death, and the landlord firmly wants the rent by early next week, so I have to go back to living in my car because I don't want to mess up his credit and get him evicted.

It gets even better. I've got a court case for drug possession (only cannabis but it's a relatively serious charge here) which I can't afford a lawyer/court fees for, one of the penalties if convicted is drivers license suspension which would mean that my ""house"" would get taken away (my criminal background is clean otherwise). Wouldn't be able to work either. Secondly, I borrowed money from a friend to be able to afford basic needs, old credit card debts, and enormous hospital bills which are from a gunshot wound and being hooked up on a ventilator and a few other minor incidents; my credit is absolutely destroyed. I've been trying to get a better/another job with advice from all around the internet but no luck. I can't afford to eat properly, likely averaging between 400-700 calories a day, weighing 110 pounds or less as at a height of nearly 6ft. No clue how dangerous this is. My car is falling apart and there are several things that need to be taken care of both mechanically and paperwork wise, this earned me a ticket which has to be payed in roughly 15 days or my license gets suspended. I suffer from full body nerve pain which is nearly debilitating at times, of course no money to see a doctor anymore. I make ""too much"" to qualify for an even a remotely reasonable amount of food stamps. Homeless shelters cost more than I can afford here, I've checked (would rather live in my car anyway). My parents have lost hope in me so their help is very limited. The friends I have are moral support at best but that doesn't mean much anymore at this point.

That's probably everything. Every time when things seem to get better they get worse, there's always something that comes up. I'm starting to lose my will to live as it seems there's no way out of this. What are my options to dig myself out of this, if any? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel that I can't see myself?",finance

However, I want to know how I can for cast how much I'll owe in taxes next season if I change my federal withholding allowances from 0 to 10.

personalfinance,Partial Student Loan Refinance Case,"Hi guys, bear with me if I get long winded - I'm going to try and get right to the point:

I have lurked this sub and read many Student Loan Refinance threads. This one is sort of unique, and I don't know who to ask whether its a good idea or not. 

Background - Know that i'm not struggling to make my minimum payment, or even a little extra. But i'm 25 and I want to buy a house within the next 5 years, and I don't want to do that until I pay my loans off. So the last 6 months my payment aggression has been significantly turned up. (Snowball in effect!).... 

Ok here we go-

Private:
1 Loan, 19,450 - 6.24% 10 Year.   
    Minimum Payment is 234  I usually pay 320ish a month.

Federal Loan Total - $28,035: Graduated Extended 10 Year Payoff  
    Group 1: $3,200 - 4.5%    
    Group 2: $8,000 - 6.8%  
    Group 3: $9,000 - 3.4%  
    Group 4: $2,505 - 6.8%  
    Group 5: $5,049 - 3.86%  
    Group 6: $   661 - 3.86%  

edit: trying to get formatting right, AND 

*My payment on federal loans is usually $400, with the (minimum +5) going to all groups except Group 6 which gets the rest up to $400. I can provide how much that is broken down to, but i'll wait and see if you guys need that info or not*

Ok so my thought was this-

Would it make any sense to refinance the two 6.8% Federal Loans **Group 2 and Group 4** with something like a 20 year fixed for 4.82%? So that I can stop accruing so much interest on loans that i'm not focusing on yet? I know that some people will say that I need to focus on highest interest first, but the snowball method is really helping my mental well being. 

I'm just looking for some casual Friyay feedback. Thanks a lot for reading, and I totally botched it let me know. I've never posted something this long on here.",finance
personalfinance,Using earning effectively to pay down 100k+ of student loans,"Hi everyone,
So I am about to start working for a Big 4 Accounting firm so that means I will be starting to earn a decent wage and my wife makes enough that it covers all our fixed costs before factoring in my income. So that leaves me able to use my income pretty freely to pay down debt. I unfortunately have so many loans because I once flunked out of college but was able to make it back and get my MSA in accounting.
This situation leaves me conflicted though because of interest capitalization and the number of separate loans. I have two separate private loans of about 30K each, one with 7% and the other 11.5% interest. I also have my federal loans of varying sizes from 1k to 20.5k of around 4% each. So my question is whether I should be paying on the private loans with the higher interest but the ability to lower their principal enough takes a lot more cash, or pay off these 1k and 2k loans so there is no interest capitalized and then when its down to the bigger balances and I have more free cash flow take them down through higher payments or other strategy such as consolidation.
Any thoughts would be appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,The value of one of the MLM financial advisers out there.,"Recently, one of my friends let me know he's being recruited by Primerica and wanted to sell me as practice. Being a good sport, I listened. After listening, this is what I want to send back to him. Is it too harsh?


Life Insurance is their biggest selling product, so I'll cover it first:

In the presentation, the guy compared a whole life insurance plan (left side) to a Prime America term life insurance plan while investing the rest in an IRA. First, that's incredibly misleading because they don't have the same benefits and operate entirely differently. Whole life insurance has a lot more benefits, it lasts forever, will provide for your kids if they have disabilities and you die and can be converted to cash later if you want. Term insurance only lasts a fixed period. Term life insurance is the best choice for most people in the US, but whole life has a lot of value and shouldn't be discounted just because they don't offer it.

BUT, pure term life insurance is not what's being offered. Primerica is offering term life insurance and invests the difference. The term life insurance plan will run around $30 in the example he gave, so around $100 of that should be going to an IRA. So using $100 invest for 30 years, the 126,000 value he used comes out to an average interest rate of 7.2%. And that's assuming they take no fees, which they do, so they are probably assuming an average interest rate of around 9%. That' very aggressive and most other financial advisers would say to plan on an average of 6%. Now the other thing is, you only have so much you can put into an IRA each year, so this money is very valuable. People should usually do two things with their IRA, put it into a low cost fund like Vanguard or a high performing front loaded fund like Oppenheimer (and this only if you know what you're doing).

With this IRA being tied to the life insurance, you have no flexibility. I can stop paying into my IRA if I have an issue and take no penalties. That's not the case with this. I would only offer term life insurance and invest the difference to high risk individuals with no self control or intelligence to invest on their own. The only problem with that is, from the little research I have done, Prime America does not take on high-risk clients for insurance, which means they are only taking on the latter. It's hard for me to get behind a plan that depends on people of low financial intelligence to be successful.


Investments

Annuities are for old people so I'm not going into this.

Segregated funds are in Canada so I don't care.

Mutual funds:

Mutual funds DO NOT out perform the market like the guy said. And saying the stock market has performed at 10% over the past 30 years is also deceptive. There was a big dip 30 years ago that skews that number. If you look at 20 years for example, the return is 4%. The number for the stock market is 6-7% for returns and that is what you're going to get with a Mutual Fund, but on top of that Primerica has the highest fees in the industry. If I understand their fee report correctly, you're paying 7% fees for the fund, where you can get a similar fund from Vanguard which comes out to around 2%. For example, PRI920 for the past 10 years return was 5.77% and Vanguard's similarly balanced fund (VBINX) was 6.73%. I didn't look into it, but I would think a similar fund with Oppenheimer might get you close to 8%, and you're only paying 5% in fees. So you are getting better returns with Vanguard with almost 3 times less fees. Again the only person who should be buying funds with Primerica are the type of people who are at risk for being abused by people who know more. I don't like that.

I've already wasted too much time, so I'm not going to dig into their other products, but I'm going to guess they follow the same pattern. Deceptive practices to get at-risk people to buy into them followed by high fees while under performing their competitors.",finance

personalfinance,Saving for down payment on home - where should I put my money?,"I'm probably about 3-4 years out from starting to seriously think about buying a home, but I'd like to start saving as soon as possible. With a recent raise and reduced rent payment, I have ~$1400 in extra income to save each month. Student loan payments are $200/month and the interest rates range from 3.6-4.4%. Currently only putting 8% into 401K (+company match), so I could increase my contribution, but I'm already maxing out the match and would like to have access to these funds for a down payment a few years down the road. I've heard that first-time home buyers can borrow against their 401K, but I'd like to keep these finances separate.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my auto loan that I'll pay off very early?,"So, I don't have my appropriate emergency fund saved up yet, but I'm still living at home and I've been paying on my auto loan heavily to pay it off. Loan was 22k with APR of 6.84%. I'm 21 with a credit score hovering around 710. Credit karma keeps telling me I should refinance.   

I know that if I refinance my score will drop again due to low credit age (oldest accounts was student loans..consolidated them and now my age of credit average is only 8 months [amazon credit card I use responsibly and actively]). However it might be worth it for the potential savings.  

My payment is supposed to be 368 bucks a month. Loan is 74 months (salesman was cool and recommended the longer loan so I can pay towards principal quicker and pay it off sooner since I had low expense and could afford it). I pay anywhere from 500 to 550 a month and I've paid it down to 11,900 right now. My first payment was September 11th of LAST YEAR, so I'm doing well. (Edit: I will add, that the loan started July 20th or so..and I had a grace period before first payment.)  

So, I ask the people of PF, is it beneficial to try to refinance and lower the interest rate so I pay less interest (despite barely paying any since I'm paying it off so soon) or just wait it out til I pay it off in about a year? Another option I could see, refinance and make the MUCH lower payment and stop trying to pay it off early and instead build my emergency fund.",finance

I also just beat cancer (pancreatic). The total tuition for this MS is going to be about $36,000, but my employer is paying for $8,500 per year, so I'm responsible for about $19K of the entire program.

|           Monthly Payment:      |     $335.17    |                    | 

Here are other pertinent monthly details:   

Net Salary: $3,500  
Rent: $600  
Medical: $800  (I have diabetes and ongoing cancer checkups which are expensive as hell - deductible will be used up by September)    
Food: $150  
Gas: $150  
Internet: $75  
Utilities: $110  
Insurance: $135  
Gym: $55  
Life Insurance: $90  (not cancelling this since I got it before I got Diabetes and cancer - it's a $700K payout, universal life policy)    
Savings/Extra: $425(ish)   

With that info, here are my questions:   

1) I can either continue paying on my student loans or let them go to deferment. Which should I do? If I defer, I'm planning on putting the monthly payment to the unsubsidized loans first, then the high interest subsided loans. Is that a good idea?   

2) I'm going to pay for as much as I can out of pocket (~$250/month for now, more later if cancer stays abated), but I'm still going to have to take out some student loans. I can take out $20K per year at 7% interest, but I figure I'll only need like $9-11K. Should I only accept that much, or should I accept the full amount and put it toward my other loans? I know this will be kind of dumb because the interest rate is higher, but the department of Ed said they're going to take my undergrad loans and extend the term to match my graduate loans, so in the long run, it seems like I'll pay more in interest on my undergrad loans due to the 15 year repayment term.

My main concerns are:  
Health insurance: I have none. I am two years behind on my personal eye exams and physicals; as my very awful health insurance offered to me via the temp agency would garnish over $120 from my pay every week, as well as have high deductibles. This would make my living costs too high in my eyes.  
Although I am very healthy and have had no major health concerns, better safe than sorry. I would love to have some  

Refinancing: My student loans average 6.5%, 35k, 9 years to go  
My car loan is @ 3.67%, about 12k left on it, 4 years  

I am interested in re-financing to lower payments, but am denied continually due to income. I have no possibility of a co-signer. I have looked into the IBR, which would make me eligible for $0 payments. I would hate to do this as it would increase my total interest over the life of loan; which is counterproductive but could potentially be better in my scenario to get some health insurance.  

Are there any options to refinance or lower my rates in my position?  

Housing: I am interested in purchasing a house soon; I should most definitely be eligible for a PFHA loan. My girlfriend and I rent a house with bad neighbors and very small living space. Staying in the same home is most likely not an option after the year; but renting in the area has gone up drastically. We would definitely not find anything near our current housing price if we rent. Is this a bad idea in my current situation

Current savings: Better to rent for longer in current home and invest my 10k saved?  

It seems finding a higher grossing income would solve most of these problems, but over about 30 interviews I only had one job offer (What I took). FedEx offered to hire me full time @ $12/hr. This is about a $400 pay cut a month, but I would have better cheaper insurance and a 401k contribution. but it's in a call center position, nah.

The only reason I have such a nice nest egg is to churning bank account and credit card bonuses, but that can only last so long. I would like some more stable investments.

My monthly payment is 600$ a month, and I've also been sending extra money ($600) into an amex savings account (1.15% apy) every month towards a downpayment for a condo/house.  I live in the bay area, CA, where housing is rather expensive. I live with a roommate were our rent is $3000 a month for 2bed/2bath.  That is roughly 1,500 from each of us.

However, few friends have told me since my car is a depreciating asset, it wouldn't be wise to pay off early. Others have also mentioned because my interest rate is so low, it would be better to just put money into my savings account or other investments.

However, I feel that pay off my car, and having $600 extra towards savings/spending seems to make most sense.

investing,Are municipal bond ladders a safe/better alternative to Money Market for long term low risk investor?,"Money Markets pay 1.1% now (Fed taxable), but municipal bond ladders (not Fed taxable) are averaging over 2.5%.  The bond default rates, especially with higher AAA ratings, are very low.  Also, there is a small Fidelity transaction fee, so to invest $200,000 requires $2,000 upfront to buy.  Normally, something like a bond fund is preferable, but when interest rates changes then those bond funds can lose real money.  It seems less risky to just buy the funds outright, and get a guaranteed rate of return.  Fidelity recommends some AA3 bonds too, but not sure if those are too risky.


You don't know how the municipal project is managed or the financial controls, but I guess that is what the bond rating covers.  Stock index funds seems much more comforting to invest in because I understand them and I'm more familiar with their risks/rewards.",finance
Bitcoin,"For all intents and purposes, US has outlawed anonymity in money transfer.","In 2013 Silk Road was seized. Ross lawyer [argued in 2014](http://www.businessinsider.com/ross-ulbricht-money-laundering-dismissal-2014-4?r=US&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T)
that Ross could not be guilty of money laundering because bitcoin is not money, but property. The Judge [shoots down this argument](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/silkroad-bitcoin-isnt-money/) by stating that ""it's close enough to be considered money"".

Ross lost the case and was sentenced for money laundering, among other things

**Consequently: bitcoin is to be defined as money.**

According to Title 18, United States Code, Section 1960, it's a crime to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. The term money transmitting includes 
&gt;""transferring funds on behalf of the public by any and all means""

Thus, all bitcoin wallets and exchanges (exchanges conducting $1000 or more business per day with one person) are required to register as a money transmitting business with the Secretary of the Treasury as required by a separate statue,
Title 31, United States Code, Section 5330 and federal regulations pursuant to that statue.

Registration as a Money services business (MSB) requires you to provide name and location of business and owners/operators. There are a lot of requirements as a MSB such as identity verification for transfer of certain sizes (Title 31, USC § 1010.312), suspicious transactions reports (31 CFR 1022.320), having an US agent (according to C.F.R. §§ 1022.380(a)(2)) etc. 

Let's look closer at what is written in the indictment of Liberty Reserve and BTC-E:

**From the Liberty Reserve indictment:**
&gt;In registering the user was required to provide basic identifying information, such as name, address, and date of birth. However, **unlike** traditional banks or **legitimate** online payment processors, LIBERTY RESERVE did not require users to validate their identity information, such as by providing official identification documents or a credit card. Account could therefore be opened easily using fictitious or anonymous identities.

[...]


&gt;As set forth above, LIBERTY RESERVE's system was designed so that criminals could effect financial transactions under multiple layers of **anonymity and thereby avoid apprehension by law enforcement**. Not surprisingly, LIBERTY RESERVE was in fact used extensively for illegal purposes, functioning in effect as the bank of choice for the criminal underworld. LIBERTY RESERVE users routinely established accounts under false names - including such blatantly criminal monikers as ""Russia Hackers"" and ""Hacker Account"". Believing themselves to be protected by this anonymity, LIBERTY RESERVE users then engaged in criminal transactions with an impunity that would have been impossible in the **legitimate financial system**.

Liberty Reserve was found in violation of Title 18, USC, Section 1956(a) (2) (B) (i) (Money Laundering) and the owner was sentenced to 20 years.

**From BTC-E indictment:**
&gt;BTC-E was an international money-laundering scheme that, by virtue of its business model, catered to criminals - and to cybercriminals in particular. Through VINNIK's effort, BTC-E
emerged as one of the principal means by which cyber criminals around the world laundered the proceeds of their illicit activity. 



&gt;BTC-E lacked basic anti-money laundering controls and policies and, as such, was attractive to those who desired to conceal criminal proceeds as it made it more difficult for law enforcement to trace
and attribute funds.

[...]

&gt;The defendants and their co-conspirators [...] intentionally created, structured, and operated BTC-E as a criminal business venture, one designed to help criminals launder their proceeds

[...]

&gt;Those engaged in criminal activity using BTC-e gravitated to BTC-e because of the site's
lack of anti-money laundering and ""Know-You-Customer"" processes in place that could have them
reported to the government. Criminals who used BTC-e to launder funds were also willing to go to the
extra trouble of wiring money offshore to entities that operated through shell companies.

The business model of BTC-E was simply being an exchange. And one without identification requirements (at least for crypto-only transactions). It is here stated that this model,
by virtue, is catering to criminals. 

It seems clear as day to me that they are trying to make association between privacy (anonymous transactions) and unlawfulness. Claiming that anonymity is ""catering"" to criminals,
that is partaking in the facilitating of funds from unlawful activity or in other words: money laundering. 

Based on these cases, it appears you can not run a system as such in good faith while accepting US customers. As the target audience for such system ""must"" be criminals. Doing it regardless, will very likely result in a money laundering charge, or worse. 

If we wish to not partake in this US so called ""justice system"" we must exclude US customers. Now herein lies the problem: How do you exclude US customers? You can block US IP's, but 
US individuals will still be able to reach your site through Tor, VPN or other means. I would argue that this is simply not enough. Take this quote from the btc-e indictment:

&gt;42. BTC-e made a series of self-serving public statements. designed at least in part to deflect
the attention of law enforcement and regulators. For example, despite advertising on their website that
""we don't accept any more international . wire transfers from US Citizens or from US Bank.” 
This, too, was false. Through its elaborate funding mechanisms, BTC-e did in fact knowingly accept wire

Now imagine that BTC-E did block US IPs, how could the indictment look instead:


&gt;42. BTC-e made a series of self-serving public statements. designed at least in part to deflect
the attention of law enforcement and regulators. For example, despite advertising on their website that
US IPs were blocked and no US customers allowed, they simultaneously allowed a back entrance for US customers 
though the onion network, a network in large used by criminals to hide from law enforcement.


How is that going to sound in court?

No problem you say. Let's also block Tor. Fine, but then there is VPN providers. You can't block all the VPN providers, that would be an infeasible large task. Will it hold up in court as ""good enough""? Well, life sentences are being thrown out left and right in the land of the free. Are you willing to risk your life on that? Do you trust the US justice system enough to take that risk? I sure am not.

That leaves us here. With the only option to require KYC of all customers. That is, zero anonymity. Bye bye privacy. Unfortunately it does not end there. US customers can submit fake documents. I would argue that it is therefore necessary to also do webcam sessions with each customer, if anything to show good faith, and that you have tried your very best to stay outside of US jurisdiction.

This has enormous costs and removes a big advantage from your business, for yourself and your customers. 

Please note, I am no legal expert, and I have only scratched the surface here. So many laws it would take me months to ply through them. I was only looking at examples from real life, and the laws used to prosecute those.

financialindependence,On two generations of FIRE,"I want to tell a story about generational FIRE.

My parents have the classic rags to riches plot line. My dad came to America without a dime in his pocket, worked in big corporations, bought a starter home, got laid off, created a tech business, bought commercial real estate for business, sold commercial real estate for a profit, bought more commercial real estate, grew the company, invested in stocks/mutual funds/bonds, moved into a big house, got a heart attack, sold the company at the request of my mom, retired at 55, and watched the tech bubble crash. He's living the fat FIRE dream.

Great stuff-a man who clearly knows what he's doing.

Then there's me, a scientist, married to an engineer with a sweet baby boy. I work for the fed government and my husband is with a large tech company.

personalfinance,Balance Transfer Issue - Money sent but not received,"Hello all.

I recently got a Barclaycard Ring to take advantage of the introductory 0% APR on balance transfers for the first 15 months (recently did this with a chase slate card to pay off some credit card debt).

I wanted to use the Barclaycard to pay off a small chunk of my Wells Fargo Student Loan (the loan with the highest interest rate)

**Here is the timeline:**

* Applied and received Barclaycard
* Called Wells Fargo to figure out which account to use. I have a general student loan account # and sub account #s for each loan, the Well Fargo rep said that I would need to initiate the balance transfer from the paying side (Barclaycard) to the general loan account #.
* I Performed a balance transfer for the full credit limit on the Barclay card to the Wells Fargo student loan account #.
* 1 week: balance transfer not processed with Wells Fargo. I call Barclaycard and they tell me to wait, I call Wells Fargo and ask if its being processed, they haven't seen it. They also tell me they don't accept payments from credit cards (but I'm told by the Barclaycard rep that balance transfers are different. Barclaycard rep also states that a physical check is sent for the balance transfer, but another rep states it is electronic)
* 2.5 weeks: I called both Barclaycard and the Wells Fargo. I ask Barclaycard to cancel the balance transfer, they can't because funds have already been disbursed. Wells Fargo still hasn't received the payment. I ask Barclaycard for proof of the transaction, they are sending me a letter with all the pertinent information so that Wells Fargo can look up that information and see if they have received that money.

Is there anything else I can do? I'm still liable to make payments on the Barclaycard account even though I haven't received the funds.

personalfinance,Requesting suggestions on improving my financial situation,"I tried to be concise but also provide my assessment of the situation.

I have a credit card balance of approximately $1500 and an introductory APR of 0% until October 2018.

I have a car loan balance of $10802 with an interest rate of 2.69% and 48 months remaining. I pay extra each month.

My job is 26-30 hours per week with on-call every other week, with take home pay of about $1500/mo. I can occasionally work extra on-call, but my supervisor likes the extra pay, also. My employer provides a 401(k) but suspended contributions several years ago. Until this month, I was contributing 10%; I reduced to 5% this quarter. I am paid every two weeks. I have responsibilities similar to a systems administrator, but the job description and pay of a help desk technician.

I currently live at home but would like to move out in the not-so-distant future.

Monthly expenses include:

* Car pymt: $300 (I am paying extra each month.)
* Car ins: $120
* Gas avg: $140
* Internet: $48
* Braces: $135 (about 4 more payments left)
* Phone: $95 (includes plan and equipment installment payments)
* Subscription services: $15

When I add this up, it comes out to $853. When I digitally envelope my $750ish paycheck, I'm doing well to end up with $180ish remaining for spending and debt. Math tells me I should have about $140 more than that - which means I'm probably still spending out of bill money. 

Due to other obligations, it is important to me to keep work close to 30 hours/week. It's not an option at my current employer, anyway.

My transportation costs are clearly my largest expenditure - around 30%. From what I've read, that's the high end of what you should spend on housing. Which ... $550 for housing won't get me much without at least one roommate.

Anyway, any suggestions you can provide to help me get on the right track is appreciated. I'm more than happy to answer questions.",finance
personalfinance,Are allowances deductions or credits? (CA state and US federal),"Hi all,  
I've been trying to do some calculations to see how many additional allowances I should request to adjust for not having a job the entire year. To the best of my knowledge, one federal allowance accounts for $4050 and one CA allowance accounts for $1000.

Once you request an allowance, is this number applied to your AGI for calculation or directly to the actual withholding (eg. 1000/number of pay periods)?

The [CA Method B form](http://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/17methb.pdf) has me a little confused because it has two tables, Table 2 for the additional allowances being $1000 deduction per year, and Table 4 that appears to be a post-tax credit. Is Table 4 just a calculation showing the resulting credit that WOULD appear as a result of the $1000 deduction? That seems wrong since it doesn't take into account tax brackets.


Also to note that I have used the federal calculator and it is probably inaccurate because I will be getting paid more in future periods than I did in past, and I assume the withholding amount will increase, but I do not know by how much so I can't put it into the calculator.",finance
personalfinance,Have a lot of student debt. Just got a big signing bonus from my first job and I want to buy a PC but I'm not sure if it's wise. Advice? (tl;dr with numbers inside),"I just got a job straight out of college that pays fairly well (~$3100 per month after taxes and other withholdings). It also came with a $5,000 signing bonus, which is awesome!  
  
Using the helpful Wiki tools from here, I've organized a monthly budget for myself and so far I like what I see. I don't have any car payments (walk to work) or healthcare payments (still on parents' plan), so my major expenses are rent, food, utilities, and student debt. I have a LOT of student loan debt, and my grace period ends 1/1/2018. Luckily the vast majority of it is on low interest rates (&lt;4%), but even still I predict this will take 10 years to pay off.     
  
I've calculated that my monthly expenses are about ~$1700, leaving me about $1400 for paying debt, savings, plus whatever else.     
  
My question is: is it irresponsible of me to use about $2000 of my signing bonus to build a kick-ass gaming PC to stay in touch with my friends from home and entertain myself after work?  
  
This would be one of my first ""big"" purchases ever (other than college, obviously), and I'm hesitant only because I don't want to do something financially stupid when I have such a big cloud of debt hanging over my head. On the other hand, my monthly expenses look okay so far and I'd still have $3000 left over from the bonus to start a savings account.  
  
Does anyone have any input on my situation? I'm completely open to any and all advice and I want to say thanks in advance for your time if you've rest this far.

It only has about $2,000 in it because its fairly new. I also have $52,000 in a money market savings account. 

The only debt I have right now is $6500 for my car at a 1.8% interest rate. My interest rate is low enough that I don't feel the need to pay it off in one lump sum. My monthly bills are around $1500 not counting food and spending money. 

I'm making $70,000/yr at my new job which is substantially more than I was making at my old job so I have a little more breathing room. 

Should I start maxing out my 401K and dipping into my savings for any extra money I need? I'm also thing about opening a Roth IRA and maxing it out every year. I believe a Roth caps out at 5.5K a year? Is there anything else I can do with my savings that will yield more than the interest I'm making on my money market account.

personalfinance,Can I start investing before I pay off my student loan?,"I have just paid off a large loan I had, and now all I have left is a student loan with an interest rate of 5.2 %. My original plan was to put all extra money into my loan until it's paid off. It's at about $9000 right now.

Oh yea, I also have a mortgage. Not sure if the details of that are relevant here or not.

I have $1000 in my emergency fund, just as a cushion while I pay off debt. I realize it could be higher, but I feel it is sufficient for now?

I figure that following the CCP (oh yea I live in Canada) method, using TD e-series funds, I could probably get returns that beat the 5.2% interest rate on my loan.

  The fact is that such stuff is already being built by projects like SuperNet or Blocknet and some others. Atomic swaps work perfectly fine with Bitcoin as is and you can mix Bitcoin through anon coins and back in a decentralized way without issues. 
  In fact using the LN for atomic swaps is probably going to be a lot harder except for the simplest cases (that is direct swap between 2 known peers, try that with decentralized order matching and autotrading... ) and with the added drawback of having to lock more coins for an unspecified period of time.

I recently received an update informing me of the amount of federal aid I was granted. According to my finances page, I had received a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan equal to a hair above $10K for the first semester.


I had received a full-ride scholarship when I was an undergraduate, and thankfully as a result I have not accrued any form of student debt to date. This means that this is my first time dealing with federal aid, and I'm still quite confused on a lot of the details. I have pored over several websites and articles and have spoken to my university's financial office, but I am either misunderstanding something or getting contradicting information.


The program I am enrolled in consists of 24 + 6 credit hours, meant to be taken in two semesters of courses plus a 6-credit internship during the summer. I am planning on attending part time so I have more time to work to support myself financially, so I will likely finish in two years.


I understand I am able to defer my payment until 6 months after I graduate, but I am confused regarding whether I am responsible for paying the interest every month. How does this nonsense work and how do I minimize my potential debt by the time this is over?

I have a Care Credit line of credit for $10,000 which I think is no-interest for a year but I need to look into the details (not sure if that set-up was for my initial purchase with it or if it is ongoing). As of now, I cannot imagine paying off that much within a year and I do not want to accrue a ton of interest. I could use the Care Credit card to finance it for now while I figure out how best to pay that off. I’ve already delayed getting this stuff done for about a year so at this rate further delay will likely lead to more expenses.  

Any other loan options that apply to this situation? Other strategies I should consider? Any insight/advice is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Can somebody explain transaction limits? Thinking of switching banks.,"Some background: I have some money in a BoA checking and some in a savings account, my direct deposit goes into checking, and then every week, I have it auto send some money to my savings.  I have all my expenses paid out through my checking account.

I'm thinking of putting some of the savings money into Ally and have it auto send there instead of to my savings account.  On the Ally website it says:  

&gt; You can also make unlimited deposits and ATM withdrawals. But, Federal law limits other electronic, telephone and check transactions to a total of 6 per statement cycle

If I decide that I want to send to Ally more often than once a week, I should be fine right? because it's a ""deposit"". 

They just don't want me transferring from my Ally, to another company more than 6 times, right? 

They also don't mention an amount. so I can put a whole bunch in for a couple of days, take all of it out, and as long as I don't take all of it out more than 6 times a cycle (which I assume is a month), I'm fine.  right? 

and somehow that's different than ATM withdrawals? Can't I just do the same thing with plain cash unlimited times?

Not that I'll actually do all the things I'm thinking of, but just curious.",finance
personalfinance,"Accept job at large company 1000's of miles away, or small company in town? (Xposted /r/Sales)","Hi /r/PersonalFinance,


Recent college grad living in Northern New Jersey with degrees in finance and professional sales who needs advice on two prospective jobs.




Job 1: Inside Sales Representative

Very large logistics company.

$17.8 /hr plus commission (~10k year)

Requires temporary relocation to Arizona. Reimbursement given after 1 year.

Room for advancement vertically and horizontally within company.



Job 2: Inside Sales Representative

Local small website design / SEO company

Approx. 5-6 employees

Commission Only (possibly negotiate base salary). 20% initial sale + 10% management fee. According to CEO, cheapest website cost $4500 (range up to $35k) + $600 (not sure about scale) monthly fee. Therefore one account per month pays about $1000 + $60 residual fee every month thereafter.

5-10 min away from current residence

Not much room for advancement




 I understand that job 2 is in a pretty saturated industry but my goal is to have my own ecommerce store one day so I look at job 2 as a more useful learning experience than job 1.


When speaking with the owner of job 2, he said ""we're always looking for sales people""

Does that mean his former sales people got fed up and quit? Or he's basically saying, fuck it if your commission only, you're hired.




Any advice from people working in SEO sales?

How easy of a sell is this?

Will I struggle due to never having a sales job before?

Do businesses stay with these companies long term or just as long as they deem useful?



Will provide more information as requested.

personalfinance,"Undergraduate is withholding my diploma and transcripts claiming I owe ~8,200$ in past due tuition.","Long story short I graduated from professional school in the Fall of 2015 and took a few years off before trying to get my license this year. Anyways I called the University this week and requested my diploma/transcripts which were denied because of a hold on my account. Turns out that hold on my account was from unpaid tuition from the summer of 2015 in the amount of about 8,200 (1,600 they said were collection fee attempts). 

So this was all news to me, I asked the financial aid department why I wasn't made aware of this situation until just this week. They attempted to email my student account (guy on the phone said they attempted twice) to let me know, none of the emails I recall seeing. Second I ask why i was not given written notice of the debts owed and the guy on the phone said ""it was not university policy to follow up via written letters on past due accounts"", which sounds really odd to me. 

So finally i get a hold of financial aid for the University and try to figure out what happened to my account that summer. Lets start with i took out max loans every semester because of lack of family support. Every school year i took ~40,000 in federal loans and received  the difference after my tuition was paid. My initially talks  with them it appeared that I actually failed to follow up with payments that summer and i differed it to a later date. Well the guy puts me on hold for ~25 minutes to call the graduate university program financial director and it was revealed the student loans were dispersed that semester but never APPLIED to my account (is this negligence? the only year this happened to me in 4 years and ~ 12 semesters). 

So I am really frustrated at this point trying to figure out if i forgot to pay or if it was negligence on the university part to apply the funds. Finally get to speak with the director of student business services for the university and to summarize his response.

1. It is University policy that debts have to be paid in full to release academic info. Zero tolerance. (even though he can see i took max loans every fucking year)
2. A debt owed to the state would prevent me from getting my doctors license, which kinda sounded like a threat.. (pay us or else)
3. They WILL NOT work with me to create a payment plan to get a temporary release on the hold. Debt must be paid in full
4. His recommendation to me was to take out private loan to pay off my debts (i know you PF people will like that one), because since the loan was never applied to my account it was also never counted towards my debts so i would have had to pay it anyways (stupid reasoning) 

I will be speaking with my uncle hopefully later today who does corporate law and maybe he can give me some guidance on how to proceed. I guess the most important question I have is; If this was truly negligence on their part to apply my loans properly which resulted in my balance due, is it worth my time and effort to try and get a lawyer involved or is the ~8200 I owe ( *gulp* i owe 240k worth of student loans ) just not worth the fight?

edit: I just looked at the national student loan database and I owe 220k (yay?)",finance

personalfinance,With a 680 credit score what are my chances of credit card approval?,"I have a 680 credit score and am interested in getting my first credit card. I have done my research and Citi Double Cash appears to be a very well balanced card. Obviously after hours of looking through this subreddit, I am very aware that paying in full every month is essential. 

My financial information which may be necessary to receive input is as follows:

I am 23 years old. I have been employed in a salary position for 2 months where I make $34,000 a year. I am also a bartender 2-3 nights a week where I make roughly $300-$400 for the week.

I have about $2000 in my savings account. I pay about $650 in student loans between my 4 loans (2 Sallie Mae at ~8% interest and 2 Navient loans at ~9% interest). I also have a federal loan that is currently on the REPAYE plan that I am currently paying $0 a month until September. In terms of other monthly expenses, I pay $0 in rent, $150 food and gym, $80 gas, $100 miscellaneous. Essentially, my income from bartending covers my living expenses.


Do I have the necessary qualifications to be approved for this credit card? Or should I look at something with a lower cash back incentive to initially build credit and not hurt my statement with a hard credit inquiry?",finance
personalfinance,How can I calculate how much I'll owe on taxes next year?,"I live in Florida, so no state income tax.

However, I want to know how I can for cast how much I'll owe in taxes next season if I change my federal withholding allowances from 0 to 10.

Last year, I had a job paying 19/hr, coupled with a little overtime I grossed just over 41k.

I had that job until April 22nd this year.

Started a new job on July 3rd. Making 25/hr.

Last year I claimed 10 allowances to have the extra $200 in my paycheck, and after claiming my son, filing as head of household, and claiming daycare expenses, I ended up owing about 1200. (Down from about 4500 if I remember correctly before adding those things)

I want to do that again, but I fear that I'm probably underestimating how much I'll owe. The 25/he pushes me to 56k/year gross (granted not this year since I went just over 2 months unemployed.)

How can I calculate how much I'll owe if I don't pay federal taxes throughout the year?

To me, paying 1200 is worth the extra 300/check.",finance

personalfinance,Student (26) with limited income but minimal expenses. Should I focus on funding retirement accounts or investing in the market? Can I do both?,"I am 26 years old and am a (returning) student with about 2 years left of college. Here are some quick stats:

* Monthly expenses: Avg. $1100/mo
* Monthly income: Avg. $1800/mo
* Debts: $12k student loans (currently deferred; 50% is subsidized)
* Assets: $7k - That's $1500 in savings @ 1.15%, $1000 @ 0.1%, $4500 in an traditional IRA CD @ 0.33% (I need to determine how to get a better rate for sure)
* Last two tax returns I qualified for EIC

Historically, my income has varied due to health-related concerns but fortunately that is improving. Now it varies only because of my school schedule. I have been working full-time over the semester and expect to have $2000 saved up before returning to school full-time and working part-time. When I was 23, I had $10k saved up but had to use that to support myself when unemployed due to health. I want to get back to that point as well as begin investing, but I'm at a loss of where to start.

Should I start by rolling my IRA over into something with a higher interest rate and focus on funding that before investing in the market? Would it make more sense to do a Roth IRA? I qualify for EIC, so my income when I 'retire' will almost certainly be significantly higher, but I also would like to FIRE myself before reaching ""retirement age.""

Could I start learning to invest in the stock market through a service like Robinhood/Acorns or should I wait until I can dedicate more than $20-30/mo into it? Or is it smarter to pay down interest on the unsubbed loan (which is 4.29% / $140 YTD) first?

personalfinance,"[Planning] Graduating in December from college, need advice with how to handle student loans","Hey Personal Finance!

I'll be graduating in December with my Bachelor's in Civil Engineering and have landed a job that pays $59,000 in salary. I currently make $19/hr at said company. Come December, I'll have about $10,000 in my savings account. I also have a credit score in the 760s range.

I am planning to move in with my girlfriend in January and have created an excel budget spreadsheet to help me visualize what my costs will be. My girlfriend is currently in grad school and won't be able to contribute too much for another two years. Her mom has offered to pay our apartment security deposit and application fee as a present to us both.

After a 28% tax rate deduction, I approximated that my monthly income will be around $3,540. My excel sheet is for 'worst case scenario' and it looks like I'll have about $870 left over every month after fixed expenses (rent, insurance, utilities, car expenses, food). 

I will be contributing 4% of my salary into my company's 401k (T. Rowe Price) but they won't match me until I've been with the firm for a year. After a year, they'll match 200% of 4% max and contribute an additional 10% of my salary as profit sharing. So the total contributions to my 401k will be 22% of my yearly salary. 

I am currently in debt for about $18,000 in student loans and about a $15,000 car loan. The student loans are subsidized federal loans and won't start accruing interest for another 6 months after I graduate. After 6 months, they'll accrue interest at a 4% rate. My car loan is at 0.00% APR and I currently pay $300 a month for the loan. 

My question is, how should I attack my loans? The car loan isn't accruing interest so I'll continue to pay the $300 monthly. Should I put a big chunk of my savings into paying off the school loans as soon as possible? Or should I hold onto my savings for a rainy day? I've read up on the snow-ball method and it highly interests me but I can't decide what to do. All of my loans float around 3.7%-4.3%. 

Should I also consider investing in a Roth IRA? What about an HSA? My employer will contribute $700 yearly into my HSA account.

And other questions.","Hey reddit! I am posting here because it was recommended by my boyfriend as a good way to get some probably simple questions answered about funding my education for a new career. I've never posted before, so I'll do my best and will put a breakdown of my expenses and budget at the bottom of this post.

A little background...
I am 28, have been in the service industry for 11 years, have Crohn’s Disease (gastrointestinal autoimmune disorder) and quite high medical expenses, including marijuana for pain management. I am going to school to become a massage therapist in a month and will not have time to work at my job much. I was anticipating getting a student loan to help with living expenses so I can concentrate on school. While doing research about loans I have come to find out that my school does not have any lending relationships, meaning that any loan I take would have to be a private personal loan, excluding me from low student interest rates and more importantly, payment deferral. I have narrowed my choices down to two: Georgia's Own Credit Union and SoFi. Neither have an origination fee or a prepayment penalty.  Georgia's Own offers up to five years to repay, and SoFi offers up to seven. The fixed APYs are quite different though. The banker at Georgia's Own told me that based on my high credit score my fixed APY would most likely be 10.99%, 9.99% at the lowest. SoFi offers rates from 5.49% to 14.24%. The problem with SoFi is that they do not offer loans to individuals with fewer than four open lines of credit.  I was denied for ""limited credit experience and excessive obligations relative to income.”  I have three credit cards and am using 5% of my allowed credit limit of $17,100.  My Experian credit score is 722 and my FICO is 799. So my questions are, should I open another credit card to qualify for a possible lower APY and longer length of contract with SoFi or will it damage my age of credit and lower my general chances of securing a loan? Anyone have insights I might not know or consider about getting a personal loan as a first time student and loan applicant?  Should I borrow more money/pay more interest to pay the monthly loan payments? Are there any scholarships or grants to help support those with my type of disability?  Thank you all so much in advance!

personalfinance,Is it worth it to aggressively pay these student loans?,"Hi PF, 

Im mostly looking for opinions here I guess. I recently paid off my last student loan with a fairly high interest rate and now im wondering if its even worth it to pay more than the minimums on my remaining loans since their interest rate is fairly low. here's the situation:

* Loan 1: $4,139.33 @ 3.61%, monthly payment $44.48

* Loan 2: $2,024.98 @ 3.61%, monthly payment $21.76

* Loan 3: $3,207.47 @ 3.15%, monthly payment $33.78

**Total: About $9,371 @ 3.45%, monthly payment $100**

If I were to continue aggressively paying them off, I would have them paid by around early march next year, but is it worth it I wonder?

Currently for savings I put 12% into traditional 401k and company puts in an additional 8%. However, I have no Roth IRA. I was thinking I could just pay minimums on the student loans and max a roth IRA for this year instead.

So what would you do in my shoes? Another option would be to decrease my traditional 401k contribution so I can save some liquid cash for a future down payment (no current plans, I rent for now).

The main question is though, would you pay anything more than minimum payments on a $9,371 loan @ 3.45%, 10 year repayment? or how else would you better use that money if not.

personalfinance,"Moving out of state for college, I have some financial questions.","Okay so first of all this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

But I really need some financial advice.

Okay so I am moving out of state for college in about 3 months. The school is 4 hours from where I currently live, but it's still out of state. 

I have about $1,500 saved up total. As I will be jobless for the first couple of months I am down there. I will be living with 4 other people so rent won't be that expensive(They estimated me $150-$170 a month).

The problem I am having is that I don't have a car. I was thinking about getting a somewhat decent one (5-6 grand) so that I have a way to get back to home to visit family and such when I can. My credit is a good area so I don't think my interest rate would be that bad. But I could be wrong.

This opens up more housing options for me.

The other option is that the school can place me in a house that's on the bus line, and they said it would probably be a little more expensive. And this decreases the amount of housing options I have.


The next question I have, and I guess this is why I am having a lot of anxiety about this.

The school is $27 grand a year. Including books and such.

I have maxed out my pell grant for all 4 years and I've gotten a couple of scholarships. So if I estimated my math right.... I would be $80,000 in debt by the time I would graduate.

IS this too much for a degree. I've only gone to a community school to get all my general education done(Which I have and it only cost me 4 grand total, which is mostly paid off)

My degree will be in the computer science field/video game programming, as video game programming is my dream job.

Also ANY OTHER FINANCIAL ADVICE ABOUT LIVING WITH ROOMMATES AND SUCH would be amazing. I've never moved out of state so all of this is new to me.

Im having to reinvent myself late in life so I am changing careers but because I have no experience Im starting at the bottom and took a pay cut of $1K a month.

My plan is to absorb my credit card debt into my student loans. I was accepted into a graduate program and the school is offering me so much money in loans I want to accept the entire amount for the reason stated above. I know this is not how the money should be used but the school doesnt conduct reviews on how loan money is wasted. 

Pros:
(1) One payment
(2) Low interest rate
(3) Ability to put payments in forbearance in case of hardship
(4) Possibly increase my credit score
(5) Public Service Forgiveness program will cancel the debt based on meeting certain criteria.

Cons:
(1) If Im not disciplined I will charge back on my cc
(2) Very large loan balance

I plan on still living on a tight budget. I need to build up my emergency fund first ($1500). I will pay $600 monthly to the loan  (which is currently in deferment bcs of school) and anything left over at the end of the month will be put towards the loan. The money will go to my unsubsidized loans first, working from the smaller amounts to the larger ones. The subsidized loans will be paid last and I will more than likely consolidate my loans after completing my program. My goal is to pay $1000/month on this loan and once my net income reaches $3000 it will be easily do-able.

So what do you think? Am I crazy? Can you think of any cons that I havent listed?

- he brings home $600 a week after taxes (single person taxes is a lot ) 
- his housing and utilities come to $700 a month
- food is about $500 a month 
- car payment $400 a month 
- student loan payment $400 a month 
- miscellaneous ~ $100-$300 a month

personalfinance,Taxes and wage. What should I do Rednit,"Currently I have an occupation as a cook. I make about $15 an hour. At my job I DO NOT receive
Overtime. 

Firstly. I know that I'm also misclassifed as an employer since I work scheduled hours. For the three months working at this place. I was being paid with no taxes taken out of my checks.( these were personal checks). I was fine with it and KNEW I had to take a portion out to pay to the IRS(just in case to save my ass). 

-About two weeks ago, I was added to their payroll? Bottom says Payroll check by Pacheco INC. I'm not entirely sure why they would switch to this . It lists salary for the week , no hours worked listed.( I know they pay me a set amount wagexhours,no OT)  ALSO on this payroll check taxes are also being taken out. It's about ~30%.  Check#1: Gross$795.Net$567 or check#2: Gross$598,net$437. I'm concerned now to why they switched over to this. I'm not being paid OT so why're they taking out the taxes. It seems like they're really stealing from me and I'm worried. I was fine before with no OT. And being paid as an ""independent contractor"" since some perks came with it but now i think it doesn't benefit me at all. 

 . The shadiness of the employment situation is definitely there and honestly I'm trying to figure out all the knowledge I need before confronting them. In return if they end up paying me more or do pay me OT Then I'm also OKAY with that.",finance
personalfinance,Should I (21) be focusing on saving or start paying off student loans?,"Okay, so I'm 21 and about to head into my senior year of college. I've gotten some scholarships, but I've taken out some federal loans, and my parents have covered the bits that haven't been covered elsewhere. I have about $10,000 in loans right now.

I have $6,500 in savings and like $100 in my checking account. I still live with my parents in an effort to save money, and they pay for everything except my gas and car insurance. I have a separate savings account for my insurance money. I pay it annually, but I break my payment up into 12 months and put back in that savings account the specific amount each month. 

I have a job but the hours are variable and I only work about 8 hours a week give or take a couple of hours. I get paid biweekly and my lowest pay check since working there has been $118. It's almost always around that amount pretty consistently. I house sit and babysit to get some extra money but that's not always consistent.

To top it all off, my boyfriend and I want to buy a house and get married in the next two or so years, once I'm done with school. He's finished with school and has a good job but is bad at saving. That's a totally different story, though.

Bitcoin,ALERT New Bitcoin Scam : 8 Hour Bitcoin Scam,"Hey there,

Disclaimer: I am with the fraud detection team for a startup, allARK (my employer). I used allARK's resources to do this so I am posting on this account with their permission as they are going to use my experience as a guide.

My name is Ryan.

I’ve been involved in the Crypto community for a while now and am experienced with multiple cryptocurrencies, scales, ways to make money legitimately, etc. I am also on the team that evangelizes usage of Crypto at work and have seen success converting many people to it.

I recently came across a new kind of Bitcoin scam, this one was particularly interesting considering the amount of effort the scammer put into it. I first risked $50 worth of BTC then after the first successful transaction where i got my money back plus some interest, I risked a further $150. Why? Because i think this was money well spent, not too much (of course losing any money hurts), but enough to find out if this is the scam and save more over the longer term. 

Now the thing is, i asked for collateral and they said they could deposit cash into my bank account as collateral. He deposited the cash, which I immediately moved into another account, a few hours after the BTC had been sent, I got a call from a Bank Teller saying that they were trying to withdraw cash and had deposited it into the incorrect account which I of course told them not to do.

The whole structure is simple, they contact you after seeing you are selling Bitcoins, either on LBC or anywhere else.  They message you about Bitcoin lending, and tell you that you will be one of the lenders and will get some interest back, and they will find the borrower.

The interest rate is good, nothing major but still decent interest and promises to be back in your account within 8 hours.

So I texted back and forth at first then stopped responding, when I did not reply to the texts after a little back and forth this guy called me. Based out of California, Anaheim. They pretended to be legitimate and had a great sales pitch, not scummy sounding at all, they also invented a wife and family plus an LLC. Apart from that they spent considerable time talking over the phone with me and just the level of effort involved was unbelievable for $50 or even $150.

They talked for over 3 hours on the phone the first time, called me back after being interrupted. So i decided « Well, F it, if this is a scam i am willing to risk $50 to find out this new kind of scam so i can share it publicly and not lose major money in the future ». The first transaction went smoothly and the amount was returned along with interest. 

When i asked for references before sending more, he said he quit social media but would exchange details once we hit the 0.1 BTC threshold, be warned this can be lowered at any time. He also did not have any idea about   etc of the proper regulations for operating something in California, so we will be filing a brief with the Consumer Fraud departments and the Unauthorized Investments Investigators in California.

He also said he was 31, had been in crypto for 2 years and had been doing this for 7 months with 6 other people who were regular « investors »  including one time investors who invested as much as 10 Bitcoin.

So this time he asked for 0.075 BTC and said ""You can invest as much as you are comfortable with"", i decided to up the ante but keep it below what he suggested, i invested $150 with them, they will usually give you some time frame, a number of hours within which they will deposit back the BTC, in this case it was 8 hours. So, the first day, they messaged me back an hour before the deadline asking for the deposit address, and of course, deposited the money back with interest. They were willing to discuss where they found the « borrowers » and mentioned PaxFul, the exchange.

Today, the second day, they said the same thing plus even asked me to set my clock for a start time and end time, well today i got no message after setting the start time, it is now a few hours past the deadline so i texted them the deposit address, and have yet to hear back, it has been about 12 hours past the deadline. I sent them another text, no reply. I called them and the call just went « beep » and then nothing.
At this point I am writing this off as a loss and filing a report on this new scam.

I know you may say, buyer beware etc, but i have enough crypto that at this time it is more profitable for me to gamble tiny amounts to find out if something is a scam or legitimate, and i have done so in the past with overall good profits, i wasn’t really going to invest but just the amount of effort, communication skills and backstory etc was impressive, at a much better level than some scammer sitting in Asia posing as « John »

The guy said he was hispanic and sounded like it as well, also used the name Jeff Rutherford on LBC with profile name « ajrutherford09 » at LBC. Also told me his real name was Jeff Leaty, He said he was calling from Anaheim, California and when i checked the phone number, it was also from Anaheim, CA. So definitely did the homework well.

Have records to prove the conversations etc and transactions.

**TL:DR**

1. New Scam

2. Guy calls or texts or contacts you saying you can send BTC and he will lend to people

3. He says you will get BTC Back in 8 Hours with x% interest

4. He does what he says for first transaction provided it is $50 and lower

5. Next transaction he bails

6. He says he can deposit cash in your bank account as collateral

7. Withdraws cash after deposit

8. Very well spoken

9. Based out of California, Invents details such as wife and family, phone number from the location he says he is in. However, says he quit social media as he doesn't like it.

10. Invents LLC

11. Well, ""I' could see it a mile away, I am Trollar The Destroyer oF Scams, you're an idiot!!! Why did you do it?
Hello, Trollar, i see you are the epitome of politeness. I did it because i was ready (and can afford) to lose a little bit of money to find this scam and share it with the BTC community, and that’s what happened, i lost a little bit of Money to find this new scam so i am not taken in for larger amount in the future. Most new people will get scared off of BTC without the Mental makeup to deal with losses and the more scams we unearth the better chance they have of not being taken in, or being ready.

12. Exchange they mentioned is Paxful which has been widely known as a hotbed of scammers.

13. Profit?? Profit??

The chance they bring btc-e back on another url is slim since it looks like they were not even as prepared as the piratebay or movie streaming sites. Also the trading volume would be low.
All of that raises the chance of them giving up even if they still own an actual backup and full control over funds.
It would be too bad if they really did not have learned of the numerous examples of takeoffs and all the errors others had done. I would have awaited more.

personalfinance,I am in dire straits and need help. This is my do or die moment.,"I committed one of the greatest sins and relied on my partner for financial support. When I met her, I had already been working as a stagehand for nearly a decade, and had made an ok living of it, as far as only needing to support myself. However, when we started dating it was 2008 and the economic crash had a profound effect on entertainment work, so I had spent the better part of that year on unemployment or using my savings (she came into my life on the tail end of this period). 

Naturally, this worried my partner to no end, and after we'd been together about 2 years, she and I and her mother sat down and decided that I would go to college and they would support me fully for the first two years and for the last couple of years I'd work full time and study part time. Things did not go quite that way.

The first year I was fully supported financially.    

The second year I started to take little bits of freelance work and was able to provide for myself for meals and transport for most of the year.  

Third year, I was now working freelance a little more often, and could contribute a few hundred here and there to the household. I was paying my own meals and transport but as far as paying for dates and planning vacations, this stuff was completely out of my range. 

----Mind you, we didn't pay rent. The house belonged to my partner's mother, who paid the mortgage, so we were only responsible for an $800 monthly maintenance payment and utilities.----

Now here's where we get to my present situation. After the third year at school I got a paid internship, making $15/hr at 30 hrs a week. They loved me there and asked me to stay on. The CTO offered to keep rolling my internship over until I got my degree at which point they'd hire me outright. 

To me, this changed the situation significantly, because with that amount of money I could cover my costs and contribute regularly to the house. I also got some bonus payments which I used to put money towards vacations with the ex, since she could never stop griping about how we could never go on vacations. Her financial situation was that she was working a job that she hated but towards a field she loved and was making about $60k for it. By the time we broke up she was in a new job she loved and at $72k. She'd also never struggled for anything since her mom had set her up with a job while she was in college.

So I sat down with my partner and explained to her:
We didn't have to rely on your mom anywhere as long as we expected. I've incrementally increased my ability to contribute to the home. I have this amazing opportunity with this internship that wants to snatch me up and the sooner I finish school the faster I'll be an equal if not greater earner (her job is in non-profit sector, my degree in data science). In my eyes, everything made sense for me to barrel through school, finish it up and be a full partner to her. But this was a suggestion, which she unfortunately took to mean that I'd already decided and this was the way it was going down. 

Well, it took a while but she got fed up with it, and after many solid years of being together, of being faithful and devoted and committed, she sits me down and tells me she's worried about my lack of ambition and that she wants to be alone to focus on her career and how much she resents me for keeping her from going for her Masters. Oh btw, this was two weeks before christmas. 

Later that week I get a call from my supervisor, saying HR has a problem with rolling an intern over and over, they'd already done it twice and they weren't going to do it again. So I was out on my ass. 

At this point, I have lost the partnership, which also means I've lost the comfortable home financial situation. I have lost the internship and so goes stable income. I still have stagehand work but it's woefully slow and not something I want to do as I get older, plus it's not reliable work. I have a $3000 loan with Navient that I have to start paying this month. I still owe $900 in tuition from last semester, which blocks me from registering, which in turn means I may have to reapply when and if I go back. I spent every last dime on moving out to a room I can't afford and have tapped myself out just making the rent through these months so I have about $25 in cash to my name. I'm too poor to even afford to open a checking account right now because it would immediately be overdrawn. No credit cards, bad credit history, no family.

Now the thing I have to consider is, my colleagues at my internship - people with decades of experience working in private and municipal sectors - tell me that the work I produce is on par with theirs. That literally the only thing keeping me from being in their shoes is that little piece of sheepskin. I've even had grad level course professors tell me I was one of the sharpest students in the class. I have a few options to explore:

Option 1.    
I have a friend in California who can put me to work immediately as a stagehand. To consider: living in California has always been my dream.   

Option 2.   
Bury myself in loans, if I can even get any with my shit credit history and no co-signers, finish my degree and not freak out about repayment because my earning potential is high.  

Option 3.   
Give up and be a stagehand, accept whatever slobbish life comes my way.

BlockChain,PBOC Hires Blockchain Engineers Who Will Oversee Creation of the “Digital RMB”,"By Tyler Durden 

For those who can’t quite reconcile the Chinese government’s tentative acceptance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with the inherently anarchistic principles espoused by bitcoin’s creator, here’s yet another clue to support the theory that the Chinese government has decided to tolerate and regulate digital currencies in hopes of learning how to apply the technology to its own digital currency.

At its core, the hypothetical “digital RMB” will subvert bitcoin’s core mission – that is, to enable individuals to circumvent government control and monitoring. Instead, Chinese policy makers intend to use the currency to strengthen the Communist Party’s ability to monitor its citizens for evidence of money laundering and other financial crimes, as MarketWatch noted earlier this year. [4]

Of course, the PBOC’s official line is that it believes a blockchain-based digital currency would allow it to make more accurate monetary policy decisions by improving its ability to gather data on financial flows…but, as with all policies in China, maintaining social control and enforcing laws is the No. 1 priority here. People’s Bank of China Gov. Zhou Xiaochuan has said it will take China approximately 10 years to fully embrace the digital renminbi, though he said later that there is no official timeline.

To that end, the Shanghai Daily reports that the PBOC has officially launched its own blockchain research institute, and is seeking to hire engineers who oversee the creation of what could become the first blockchain-based fiat currency.

“The People’s Bank of China’s institute of printing science is offering six positions for the design and development of digital currency-related software and hardware framework, a recruitment notice said, adding that candidates with experience in blockchain and Big Data technologies will be preferred.

 The candidates must hold master’s or doctoral degree in computer science, information security and cryptography, according to the notice.”

As Cryptocoins News points out, the hiring drive comes soon after the bank’s vice-governor, Fan Yifei, published a Bloomberg column opining that the best way for governments to drive innovation of digital currencies is by creating their own, which will stay under their control. Yifei sees reduced operating costs, increased efficiency and a broad range of new applications as the many outcomes of moving from a paper-based currency to its digital form.

The creation of the institute represents an expansion on a public-private partnership sponsored by the Chinese government that was launched to explore the feasibility of creating a digital RMB. That partnership, which involves experts from Citibank and Deloitte, was first reported in early 2016. China is also already experimenting with using a blockchain-based shadow system for clearing trades in local interbank credit markets.

The PBOC isn’t the only central bank that’s exploring the feasibility of its own digital currency. The Bank of England joined with researchers at University College in London to create RSCoin, a digital currency for central banks. The Bank of Canada has also said it is developing a blockchain-based digital version of the Canadian dollar. Central banks in Russia and Australia have also expressed interest in exploring digital currencies.

btc,How we got here and why Bitcoin cash will give this town the enema it needs.,"Pure opinion, this is how I see it.  

Lets use logic.  If someone is against an idea it's because it will hurt their profitability.

If someone is for an idea it's because it will increase their profitability. 

 If we can assume that we can apply that to the following:

Blockstream creates ""segwit"".    (because it somehow profits them, and if not in money then in power, some suggest its because they want to profit from off chain scaling solutions ) 

Miners don't like segwit, ( because it will block ASIC boost and or reduce profits, no one seems to know exactly what the miners are doing, but it's clear they are motivated by profits to block segwit) 

Users want a scale solution (because it will make bitcoin cheaper to use) 

Blockstream's solution is in questions by miners and users.   (because it blocks ASIC boost and pushes toward off chain scaling that is against the core vision and libertarian principles of the original bitcoin vision,  and miners don't like it because it reduces their profits and those higher fees that will create profit come from the users, this hurts users) 

Bitcoin suddenly has too many transactions, but in recent days no longer has too many transactions.  I as a user suspect I have been getting ripped off by miners who were artificially making transaction volumes high to create higher fees.  ( much like a water company who can only charge high prices for water when there is a shortage and gets caught letting water run down the drain to create a shortage to justify a higher price) 

Users want lower fees and demand a scaling solution,  altcoins start to pop up like ants at a pick nick. 

No scaling solution can push forward because miner, users, and the developers who are employed by a for profit company called blockstream can not get on the same page.  ( because blockstream sees the future of bitcoin as a new visa or master card where they provide solutions for profit.  users have to pay higher fees, and miners get reduced profits due to blocking ASIC boost and other advantages they currently have)  

Blockstream is all in on the push for off chain scaling that will cost users in higher fees and miners in reduced profits, (because they stand to collect those off chain solution's fees as well as take many transactions off chain to the cost of the miners) 

Blockstream goes all in and full retard to force segwit (because they are a for profit company that plans to profit later from off chain solutions)  This pisses users off. 

Miners rebel and postpone (because the longer they can postpone they longer they can keep whatever advantage they are guarding, perhaps it's ASIC boost) 

Altcoins grab huge amounts of the total crypto market cap. 

Users get fed up and hold a gun to everyone's head.....................UASF and or UAHF.  

Blockstream and the miners try to meet in the middle,  segwit2x is proposed and widely accepted (although many think the Blockstream developers don't plan to increase blocksize and will only lock in their step one of segwit and then stall or fail to lock in the promised block size increase) 

The miners and the developers are actual groups with actual board members etc, so negotiating is straight forward.  You can not negotiate with the users all that well, there is no real face for the users.  Therefore Blockstream and the miners try to find a solution that will prevent the users from revolting.  They work to profit themselves as much as they can and keep the users on board.  No one really represents the users so it's hard to know what the users will accept.  They decide to try for the ""get the tip in"" approach and underestimate how pissed off the users are.  They offer a compromise that is self serving but will hopefully keep the users on board. 

segwit2x is that compromise that does little to satisfy anyone,   Part one blocks asic boost, part two is supposed to be a block size increase to 2mb.  Some say after the developers get what they want and block segwit they will refuse or fail to introduce the block size increase.   This makes the miners and the users edgy and more willing to do something crazy. 

After having to sort through all the mud slinging from the developers to the miners and users the users get pissed off enough to start a revolt. 

A group forms and the revolt is put into motion,  a fork of bitcoin with the users in charge, Bitcoin cash is born. 

Users will reward miners in a fair way for securing transactions and development will be kept on track with the constant threat of user revolt as a check to the power of the developers and miners.  

Miners work to secure transactions that users pay for.  The user is the employer, the miners are employees and the developers are supposed to grease the gears and keep things workings for the users and miners.  

Bitcoin cash is where the users, the originators of the transactions and fees are the employers.  

Segwit bitcoin is a for profit company like Visa or Paypal who is offering a solution for a fee,  users only use the service if the fee is reasonable.  Somehow visa gets 2% so maybe this segwit coin wants to cut that in half but keep 1%.  

Compared to Bitcoin cash where the users pay a fee to hire the miners to propagate a transaction and where developers try and stay out of the way of a working system and stop fixing things that are not broken. 

Bitcoin works,  but blocks got full.   This is a scaling issue and the correct fix is larger blocks,  not off chain scaling.  Read the white paper,  bitcoin was not built as a layer 1, it was built as the solution to compete directly with visa.  The only reason there is any block limit at all is to reduce the possibility of certain attacks. 

Bitcoin cash is bitcoin like Satoshi wanted it to be, not to say that some won't profit from some quick minning and price action as the split happens.  There will be wild swings and some will profit from easy mining in the first few hours or days. 


Segwit bitcoin is corporate coin,   I don't say that for any reason other than a corporation is now in charge, and has the power to stay in charge.  

The users will get to pick.  A corp coin or true, raised in the wild bitcoin cash.  

Holders will have both and will get to sit back and watch the dust fly,  and in the end no matter who wins bitcoin is likely to become stronger than ever, just like the last 53 times it died.  

You can call it ""Honeybadger cash"" or ""segwit Honeybadger"" but either way it's a honey badger and i'm glad to be holding some of each.  

The bottom line is that a lot of smart people are really going to be focused on making the system better for the user,,,,,,,,,,,,and that is always a good thing for ""we the users"". 

Today we the users get the attention we need.  Today users get to vote and decide who wins.  

and a quick side note,  if all users with significant holdings were to spend 1% of their holdings to mine the new bitcoin cash chain with a cheap and easy cloud mining contract bitcoin cash would have all the hashpower it needs to stay alive and well.  

I'm going to spend 1% of my holdings on mining the bitcoin cash chian, and not because I think it will win or for profit, but because the bitcoin cash chain is giving this town an enema.

personalfinance,Credit mess,"Hello all. So I have begun the process of buying a home. Unfortunately I just realized that my credit is garbage compared to the last time I checked. My FICO is about 500, down from almost 700 a year or two ago. One part of that is easily fixed, my credit utilization is terrible but I can pay those off fairly quickly. The second part i'm a bit lost on. 

I let some friends get phones on a shared family plan. They were never paid for by Verizon when they switched carriers, Tmobile never notified me of the issue and I only found out about it because a collections agency contacted me. I paid the debt off in full right away but it seems to have made a big dent in my credit despite that. How long does that kind of negative report stay on my file? Other than that I have a basically perfect payment history etc. I am really stressing that this one dumb thing may ruin my chances at a good interest rate.",finance
personalfinance,PSLF issue/question,"So my wife is the perfect candidate for the PSLF program as she works for a non profit and has federal loans. We have about 4 years until she reaches her 120 qualifying payments. I printed off the paperwork and we were going to fill it out and send it in so we can make sure we are on track. Here is the kicker....


I guess I over looked the fact that you had to be in an income based repayment plan. My wife is in the 10 year standard payment plan. While this is a qualified plan we will obviously have a zero balance when we are eligible. 

Now for my question. Since we are able to pay for her loans currently should we.

1. Continue paying like we have been and have it paid off in four years. 

2. Change it to an income based payment and use the extra money to pay down other bills like my student loans or mortgage?

It would be nice to have extra money but if we change the payment terms I think the clock resets and we wouldn't be able to submit for another 120 payments and I don't want to wait that long to have these damn things gone. 

Thanks for your help.",finance

personalfinance,Should I sell or rent my home?,"I bought my first/current home in 2012 (Orlando, FL) on a 15 year 2.5% fixed mortgage. There is a very high possibility I will be moving to D.C. soon for work where I plan to live in the city and rent an apartment. If/when this happens, I have no intention of ever moving back to Orlando. I really don't know if I should sell or rent my home.

Financially, I can afford to turn my Orlando home over to a property management company and have them rent it out. From a cash flow perspective, it will cost me $7,000/year to rent it out, primarily because I still have the mortgage on it. From an ROI perspective (assuming the mortgage was ""interest only"" (which it won't be) and comparing that cash flow to the home's equity) I get about a 9% return. When factoring in the yearly appreciation in home value obviously it's a bit higher.

I really don't know what to do. Part of me wants to sell the house and be done with it that way I never have to worry about it again. The other part of me says to keep it given that the interest rate is very low, and once I'm ready to buy a home again in the future I can always sell the house and use the proceeds as down payment. However, even if I were to sell the house now I plan to take the equity proceeds and place it in a safe interest bearing account (high interest savings account or bonds) and add some cash to it monthly so I can have a down payment in the future.

personalfinance,Should I pay off unsubsidized or subsidized loans first?,"So I'll start with context, I'm ~$30K in debt; mostly federal student debt. My SO is ~$50k in student debt, again mostly federal student debt with some loans through our university.

We both went to school Fall 2013 - Spring 2017 with loans every semester.

That said, now that we've graduated I'm making $60K/year pre-tax/pre-retirement/etc working in software development. My SO and I are working to get them a job in our area for additional income.

My question is, which loan should I start to pay off first? I know I'm in my grace period until January or so, but I want to get a head start on this because we've got a long way to go. I've started putting money back in case of emergencies, (a few hundred month until I hit about $6000,) and I'm putting 5% into a Roth 401k and 3% into a standard 401k with my company matching 2% (5% total.)

Not sure how much of all that is necessary info, but I figured I'd lay all my cards on the table.

I'm also wondering about how marriage and consolidation/liability works, as I know the debt will become OUR debt once we're married, (I'm pretty committed to my SO. Considering proposing soon.)

Edit: I'll be asleep for the next few hours but will answer questions in the morning my time. Thanks everyone.",finance

personalfinance,Ditching a 5 year fixed rate mortgage with 3 years left,"My partner and I bought our first home in 2015 for £170,000 on a fixed 5 year mortgage with 5% deposit. Interest rate is 4.7% meaning the monthly repayment is £745 but we overpay, rounding up to £800.

At the time this deal was perfect as we wanted security and stability knowing my outgoings for the next 5 years with a projection of what the mortgage balance would be after 5 years: £150,000. However now, I am more savy and look to save money where possible. Being a grown up is hard.

The bank will charge me 3% to exit this fixed rate early which is £4,740. The value of my house has increased to £185,000 (neighbour sold theirs for this price last week and it's identical) and we currently have £158,000 remaining to pay. I could remortgage and get 85% LTV at £500 per month with this equity. Interest rate would be 1.8%. No arrangement fee on new mortgage. In fact Halifax bank currently offer £750 cash back for switching to them.

Over the next 3 years I have calculated that, even with paying the £4,740 exit fee I would be roundabout £7,000 better off based on and if we keep repayments at £800 we would be overpaying £300 per month and the mortgage balance in 3 years would be £138,000 rather than £150,000 on our current mortgage.

Can anyone see a flaw in this plan? Am I missing something?

Thanks in advance",finance
personalfinance,20 years old in a never ending pit I can't seem to get out of.,"Forgive my grammar for I am posting from my phone. 

A little back story, I'm a 20 year old male coming from a single parent home. My mother from Latin America has supported me and my sister since I was 5 years old after the passing of my father. She stayed single raised us managed to keep our home and we have been relatively poor Hispanic family all basically living paycheck to paycheck. 

I graduated high school in 2015 and attended university in which I didn't do so well. I worked and lived at home and only finished one year Because I left on academic probation and also because I was ignorant in financial aid and how it worked. I thought my grant would cover all expenses but it didn't and I ended up with a debt of $1,468 at the end of the school year in 2016. I worked a decent job as a line cook at a high end restaurant in my city my plans were to form a payment plan with my university which would allow me to enroll for the coming year and pay off my debt while still going to school. At the time I was in between jobs and was unable to meet the payment plan deadline because they required a down payment that I didn't have money for at the moment.

So In the summer of 2016 I tried my best to save some money and decided to take off a semester and pay off my debt to university and continue school the next semester. But instead I for some reason broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years at the time which led me to develop depression and a drinking problem which led me to be arrested twice in a one and a half month span for having a fake ID and a probation violation. Money I was making was going towards court and probation fees which I am currently still paying since I am on two years probation. My situation has only worsened sense then. I quit my job at the restaurant to go to another restaurant that offered more money but I hated it there which led me to drink more and I ended up getting fired for drinking on the job. I was unemployed for about a month and when I finally got a new job as a bartender I was playing catch up with my finances since I was behind on my car note, probation fees, pawn loans I have taken out to sustain myself while I was unemployed and trying to pay off the credit card that I took out and maxed out like an idiot. Recently my bartending job hasn't been cutting it, we're over staffed so I'm only working 1-2 days a week and business is slow so I'm not making much money When I do work. 

As of right now I make like $80 a week I'm 2 months behind on my car note and I have till the 23rd of august to catch up or my car will be repossessed. My credit card hasn't been paid in 2 months so I know because of my late payments and credit card not being paid my credit is probably shocked. Probation hasn't been paid and my officer is pressuring to make payments soon or he will have to staff it with the court. My money basically goes to the following things: car note, food, gas, alcohol, probation fees and when I can my credit card.

I'm currently looking for a new job and have been for weeks I have 2 interviews this week that I hope go well and hopefully get both jobs. I'm not sure where to even start though. I'm negative in my bank account I don't work till the weekend my car is on E and I have literally nowhere to pull money from  and my family cannot help me. I need to go back to school soon but every time I seem to finally catch up and somewhat get on my feet I get knocked down again. I have taken initiative to slow down and eventually stop my drinking. I drink everyday and can honestly say that if I didn't drink as excessively as I do I wouldn't be in this predicament or it at least wouldn't be so bad. 

How do I manage my finances better? If I get these new jobs what should I do differently how should I go about catching up on my car, getting back my possessions, finally making payments to my school so I can get back in asap and getting probation fees taken care of. 
If I get these jobs I know I'll be getting paid biweekly and can say I'll be making at least $850 every two weeks. My car note is $390 I usually have to fill my car weekly with the amount of driving I do which is $30 to fill, I'm not sure how much I spend on food but can estimate it's around $100ish a week since nobody really cooks at home. Alcohol around 200 a week, when I would go to bars almost daily id rack up a tab of at least 25-35 dollars plus tip. Probation and credit card payments are usually pay what I can and usually isn't much. I know the elephant in the room is alcohol which is something I am trying to take care of. I go to sobriety classes and have been sober for 4 days now which is the longest I've gone in the 2 years. Sobriety is hard I think about drinking very often and I'm not sure what to do or where to start and what's the best thing to do in probably every aspect of my life. Sobriety has really been an eye opener since I have been looking the other way at my problems which are almost reaching a point of things getting extremely worse. 
So far my plan: get two jobs, stay sober, pay what's most urgent, save money. But I'm aware it's not that easy and just need guidance. 

Please feel free to give me any criticism you feel necessary harsh mild or light. Any guidance and what I should have my mind set to. And how where and what to start. Anything and everything is welcome.",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my car that I will pay off early next year?,"So, I don't have my appropriate emergency fund saved up yet, but I'm still living at home and I've been paying on my auto loan heavily to pay it off. Loan was 22k with APR of 6.84%. I'm 21 with a credit score hovering around 710. Credit karma keeps telling me I should refinance. 

I know that if I refinance my score will drop again due to low credit age (oldest accounts was student loans..consolidated them and now my age of credit average is only 8 months [amazon credit card I use responsibly and actively]). However it might be worth it for the potential savings. 

My payment is supposed to be 368 bucks a month. Loan is 74 months (salesman was cool and recommended the longer loan so I can pay towards principal quicker and pay it off sooner since I had low expense and could afford it). Edit: I want to add here that the saleman wasn't trying to win me over here, the price of the car was set before I got there via email negotiation, and he was legitimately trying to help me since he got 0 commission. We made legit attempts to discover what price would allow me to pay the most towards principal the soonest. &lt;end of edit&gt; I pay anywhere from 500 to 550 a month and I've paid it down to 11,900 right now. My first payment was September 11th of LAST YEAR, so I'm doing well. (Edit: I will add, that the loan started July 20th or so..and I had a grace period before first payment.) 

So, I ask the people of PF, is it beneficial to try to refinance and lower the interest rate so I pay less interest (despite barely paying any since I'm paying it off so soon) or just wait it out til I pay it off in about a year? Another option I could see, refinance and make the MUCH lower payment and stop trying to pay it off early and instead build my emergency fund.",finance

I will not be employed until then. I just paid rent, and don't have enough to pay rent next month.

I think I have ~$6,000 invested in a Roth IRA, so I can withdraw from that without penalty, from what I understand. I think I can also take out a direct subsidized loan with ~3.76% interest (last year's rate).

It seems to me the best idea would be do withdraw from the basis, and keep myself out of debt. Is that the best option? Is there some other option I'm missing? Should I withdraw from the IRA until there is nothing left, and then get a loan?

**UPDATE**: Thank you for your help, I'm glad I posted here! We checked our Roth IRA and discovered **the return rate was 0.5%** because we have allocations set up wrong (also no beneficiaries set up - now on some Vanguard plan to automatically adjust allocations over time). Yikes! Glad we found out now instead of 40 years from now... 

Interest rates are higher than what I said (~6%), particularly because I'm a grad student, but now I know more about what sort of returns I might expect from our investments, and how to make that decision. It sounds like leaving it in the IRA will still be a better deal on average. Thank you so much!",finance

here are the options I have looked at.  

Balls to the wall
Continue to save up and pay off my student loans with my life savings. Estimate time I would pay them off would be in October. Leaving me with still a reliable truck, no AC, and spending more money on gas. 

Logical
Find a eco car using my life savings worth under 4K with roughly 100 – 150K miles on it. Find a second job temporally with new car. 

Conservative
Continue working and saving as is. Find a second job using my truck and hope for the best come October if we do or we don’t get cut.

personalfinance,Quick question about my student loan consolidation agreement,"So I've been approved to consolidate my student loans. The interest rate is way better than my previous loans and I didn't need a cosigner, so I'm pretty excited. However, in the agreement, it says ""If you pay the loan off early, you will not have to pay a penalty. You will not be entitled to a refund of part of the finance charge."" The entire loan is $25,440.40 and the finance charge (interest?) is $9,754.52. Does this mean that if I'm able to pay off the loan early, I still have to pay the entire finance charge? So essentially my $25k loan is turning into a $35k loan regardless of how soon I'm able to pay it off?

Fast forward to now, my fiance has a nice career, my job pays a decent amount, and I am SLOWLY paying off my credit cards. Here's the problem I'm having, my card has a 19.99% APR, so for every $300 I pay on the card, I'm also charged around $100 in interest. I'll be having roughly an extra $1,000/month of income coming in starting late August and was thinking about taking out a loan to pay off the credit card. 

Depending on the loan's interest rate, I feel like I would save quite a bit of interest. The loan would definitely be paid off early since the extra $1,000/month would go directly to it, plus the usual amount I'm able to pay towards the card.

I will allocate my monthly investment as followed :



Tier 1 40% | Because
------|-------
LYKKE | Because a free decentralized exchange using multisig made by the guy who made OANDA; will include forex market marking and more importantly PAY OUT DIVIDENDS.I feel like it doesn't even matter what the coin of the day will be. Also, the house always wins. This is the house.



Tier 2 - 8%  | Because
------------|-------
Bitcoin | Because bitcoin IS crypto to every future investor. What do you think he'll buy? What do you think will be implement first by shops ?
Factom | Because of the use case (notarization, data/record storage). Built from the ground up to be audit friendly. Fantastic collaborations already (Dept. of homeland sec, bill and melinda foundation, hyperledger). it's also quite under the radar.



Tier 3 - 4% | Because
-----------|-------
Ripple | Because a fantastic use case (legacy transactions ARE slow and expensive ATM). And regardless of all the cons, this is a very serious company which I think has the best chance of buying around in 10 years. And they won't just abandon their coin as it's their cow. In the worst case, it will probably still go x3. I was also already invested prior to April, so it fed me well.
SingularDTV | Again, the use case (Movie/music etc content creator 2 consumer, no middle man. Kind of like youtube but oriented towards indie movie folk). Also, the guys making it seems to have connections in the showbiz world. Promising under the radar upcoming releases, but slow enough to allow me to gather coin. Holders will also get a share of the fee cake.
Monero | The use case again. THE best anon money, and isn't that what we wanted ? Not user friendly ATM, not the most open community. All those things will change at some point. How is XMR only worth 40$ and btc almost 3000, especially considering there are quite a few less XMR's than BTC.
OmiseGO | Because they are already a succesful payment provider, prior to the token especially now after they bought the 3rd largest provider in Thailand. They are doing a trial with all Mcdo's over there. I could see this take South East Asia, slowly. I have yet top check what's in it for hodlers.



Tier 4 - 1.6% | Because
-------------|-------
NEM | Because their chains do too much to even list. They are serious and established in the east. I can see them doing well in the B2B market.
DOGE | Because do you really think THE dog coin will be left behind if and when adoption. It has too much character, no drama and there's some cheap DOGE for all. I mean, what coin would your kid pick ..
Komodo | I'm looking to swap this for UNITY (the supernet coin) once I install the wallet. But I think their chains are technically the most advanced and that's what will matter in the end. I also can't wait for when all the Supernet shit will get merged.
Antshares | Because I too think the chinese prefer their own. And there are many chinese people with money stuck in china.
Ardor | Because a good contender considering their child chains etc. Not their first day, serious and capable. 
Ethereum | Because yeah, even if there are better things out there, they aren't going anywhere. And i'll probably need ETH to interact with my many tokens in the future.
ARK | I really shouldn't, but their thing always excites me somehow, with their SmartBridges etc. I like their vibe too. Under the radar enough to justify it for now.
Monacoin | Like DOGE, but with the cat. There's dog and cat people u know. Also it's the number 1 coin in Japan, and they love that mona shit.
Funfair | Should look up more, but I hear good things about who they are and what they are doing. They are like the house in that sense that other can build casino games on it. We'll see
Unobtanium | Because the most stable ""collectable"". Their aim is to be very rare. If we expect crypto to stay, in 30 years this shit will be way more valuable.


Tier 5 - 0.56% | Because
--------------|-------
MetalPay | Mainly because that guy from apple. This is what the masses will want when they'll arrive.(it's a wallet or smth)
Byteball | Because I like the P2P, tangle aspect. It's more ""cutting edge"" than blockchain. It's kind of like IOTA I guess
Augur | I can see prediction markets working. REP holders get something too. It's this low because it used to be too high in the list
Blocknet | Because a blockchain agnostic decentralized exchange which can have nodes on any chain. I like the idea
Sia | Because I like the idea (decentralized storage) and I'm looking forwards to participating.
Bitshares | Because the first decentralized exchange i've found and I have too many of them already lol. Might as well see it through ? :p
Decred | Because technically interesting hybrid tech coin and their people seem like they can be pushy/serious enough. Israeli, if i'm not mistaken (important from the which userbase pov)
Dash | I should probably remove this because I hate their 1% thing. But it works well enough, has enough establishement and enough marketing for it to be a ""main coin"" in the medium future.
Edgeless | Because edgeless ETH gambling. They'll get their licenses in order and I can't wait to share the cake. It's this low because I have far too many already.
Steem | Looks like the defacto social media choice for the crypto world. If things keep going in this direction, i'm sure they'll be around.
DIGIXDao | Tbh, all I remember is that I can exchange this for actual gold one day and there is some kind of profit sharing. must look into
Litecoin | Because I guess it will always be around, testbed style. I don't care more than that.
ICN | This low because I have far too much already and in the end I can do what they do on my own. But I can see them thriving somewhat.





Tier 7 - 0.26% | Because
--------------|-------
Melonport | I don't know yet, something about profit sharing
Pillar | Their use case isn't all that bad, we have way too many online profiles and what not (it's kind of a dashboard for your digital life). Cool enough to throw a few bucks, quite the long shot.
Civic | Something about having your digital identity on the blockchain. Not the worst idea.
Quantum | Because their only aim seems to be deflationary lol. I mean we're early enough for this to have made something in 5 years or so.

personalfinance,Where should I focus my earnings?,"Hello everyone,

I have a couple of questions but first I'll give you my background:


$27,000 take home pay 


$18900 in student loans


$3000 in savings


$550/month available after essentials and (thinly) budgeted fun money


No credit debt


3% of income towards employer 403b (Roth option) - minimum to get a 10% contribution after one more year with them. If I were to put any extra towards retirement it would probably go into a Roth IRA with a lower expense ratio.



1) I always hear that you should pay the highest interest loan first. However, in my case:

Loan A: balance $2,103 - interest rate 6.55% - daily interest generated $0.38


Loan B: balance $7047 - interest rate 3.61% - daily interest generated $0.70

In this case it seems to me that loan B is hurting me more though it's interest rate is lower - am I right to tackle that one first? 




2) From what I've read on this forum, some would suggest building my emergency fund, others would suggest paying down my highest interest loan(s) first, and still others would suggest retirement funds as a priority. My gut feeling is to pay off the worst of my loans first then put significantly more into retirement funds. Is that the correct priority given my current income? I do expect to make a bit more and have lower cost of living within a couple of years. 

Thanks everyone for your thoughts and advice!",finance

etc etc etc...

Below are some introductory lessons to help u/guysir grow up and face the reality of how the world actually works.

**Lesson 1:** Money doesn't grow on trees. ~~Nor does it get mined from the ground very much anymore, as gold and silver.~~ (Correction because I was half-asleep when I wrote that: Gold and silver still _do_ get mined quite a bit of course - but most people don't use them day-to-day as money.) And gold and silver prices are probably heavily [manipulated](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=andrew+maguire+gata&amp;t=hb&amp;ia=web) (suppressed) these days anyways - in order to prevent the value of fiat currencies (such as the USD, EUR, GBP, YEN) from collapsing.

So, where does money come from, in the modern world?

**Bankers print unlimited supplies of money out of thin air (which they then _give_ to their buddies).**

That may sound somewhat surprising to someone who hasn't ever sat down and examined how the world actually works - but basically, it's the reality we do live in.

**Exercise 1:** Put on your thinking cap now for 30 seconds and try to imagine what your life would be like if _you_ could ""print money out of thin air"" (and _give_ it to your buddies).

OK, your 30 seconds are up. 

Hopefully you realized that being able to ""print money out of thin air"" (and _give_ it to your buddies) would give you immense _power_ - correct?

This was just a simple exercise, and of course the politics and economics of the world as a whole are much more complicated - but hopefully at this point you have managed to finally grasp one basic concept: 

**The ability to _print money_ (and _give_ it to your buddies) confers _great power_.** 

So, as the saying goes: ""Money makes the world go around."" 

And some lucky people (bankers) have arrogated to themselves the right to _print money_ (which they then _give_ to their buddies). 

These buddies of theirs constitute a kind of exclusive club of mega-rich people who control all the essentials which _you_ need to survive: mainly _housing, education, healthcare._

Notice how the prices of these essentials are always going through the roof - while your salary stays pretty much stagnant. 

And notice how you never have enough cash to buy these things outright using the little bit of cash money that you actually have. 

So these people also control one other thing you need in life - _credit_.

Credit is actually just ""money that you have to buy"" (at a gigantic markup, called ""interest"") from those same mega-rich people in that ""club"", who happen to be lucky  enough to be buddies with the bankers who ""print up money out of thin air"".

It's a very exclusive club, which runs the world - and _you ain't in it_. 

**Extracurricular Activity 1:** Watch this short video by George Carlin for a vivid explanation of this ""club"" which you ain't in:

**George Carlin - The big club** (NSFW!!!)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKUaqFzZLxU

---

**Lesson 2:** Bitcoin is ""peer-to-peer electronic cash"". One of the most important aspects of it is that there will only be 21 million bitcoins (or 21 trillion ""bits"" - where there are a million ""bits"" in 1 bitcoin).

Many people believe that one of the main reasons Satoshi designed Bitcoin this way (with a cap of 21 million bitcoins) was to _take away the power of the bankers and their buddies to keep running the world by printing up money._

**Exercise 2:** Read as much as you can of the Bitcoin whitepaper, and the Bitcoin wiki. Since this is about economics, you can skip over the technical stuff about how this whole thing was programmed in C++ - and just focus on how it works at the level of _economics_.

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page

https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf

Another good site to read about the _economic_ aspects of Bitcoin is Nakamoto Institute:

http://nakamotoinstitute.org/

Again, you can skip the articles about C++ programming - and just focus on articles dealing with the economic (and social, and political) aspects of _having a form of money which an exclusive club of rich bankers and their buddies can't simply print up and use to control your life._

**Extracurricular Activity 2:** Read (or watch a video) about The Creature from Jekyll Island or about the Federal Reserve - which explains how the current banking system in a powerful country (the USA) _really_ works:

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=creature+jekyll+island&amp;t=hb&amp;ia=web

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=crature+from+jekyll+island

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=federal+reserve+conspiracy

Or, alternatively, read up on topics like the petrodollar, quantitative easing, fractional reserve, ZIRP and NIRP, the Austrian school of economics - to start understanding some of the more advanced topics of how a certain exclusive club of bankers arrogate to themselves the right to _print money out of thin air_ (which they then hand out to their buddies, who then use this power to control your access to all the expensive essentials in life).

Yes, there's a lot of tinfoil or Illuminati stuff in there which could be just delusional paranoia - but there's also a lot of cold hard facts about _where money comes from._ And it doesn't come from trees - or out of the ground - instead, it just comes from bankers typing in numbers on a keyboard, and then handing out this freshly-printed money to their friends - who then use this ""fiat"" to control _you_.

---

**Lesson 3:** Do a search on this subreddit for ""AXA"" to learn more about this one particular company.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

You will see that AXA isn't just any old insurance company or financial firm - it actually happens to be the second-most-connected financial company in the world.

&gt; Who owns the world? (1) Barclays, (2) **AXA**, (3) State Street Bank. (Infographic in German - but you can understand it without knowing much German: ""Wem gehört die Welt?"" = ""Who owns the world?"") AXA is the #2 company with the most economic power/connections in the world. And AXA owns Blockstream.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5btu02/who_owns_the_world_1_barclays_2_axa_3_state/

---

In addition, AXA is heavily involved in derivatives - in fact, it is the insurance company most heavily involved with derivatives:

&gt; If Bitcoin becomes a major currency, then tens of trillions of dollars on the ""legacy ledger of fantasy fiat"" will evaporate, destroying AXA, whose CEO is head of the Bilderbergers. This is the real reason why AXA bought Blockstream: to artificially suppress Bitcoin volume and price with 1MB blocks.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4r2pw5/if_bitcoin_becomes_a_major_currency_then_tens_of/?ref=search_posts

---

**Lesson 4:** How do debt-based fiat currencies (and derivatives) work? And how could companies that depend on such ""assets"" (such as AXA) be negatively affected by Bitcoin?

Derivatives are basically the total opposite of Bitcoin, when it comes to something called **""counterparty risk""** .

Counterparty risk is the possibility that _you might not get what's owed to you_ - because ""your money"" isn't actually in your hands, it's in someone _else's_ hands, and all you have is a ""claim"" on what they're holding in their hands: in other words, they have a **debt** to you (a promise to pay you) - and you only get ""your"" money _if_ that other ""counterparty"" actually pays their debt to you, or makes good on their promise to pay you.

Compare that to Bitcoin - which is basically one of the only ""counterparty-_free_"" assets in the world. If you have a bitcoin (ie, if you control your own private key), then you're not dependent on _anybody_ to pay you. You already are holding your own ""cash"". 

You've probably seen company balance sheets, with Assets (including Receivables) and Liabilities (including Payables) and Income and Expenses and Equity. To calculate how much the company ""has"", you just add up all the positive stuff (Assets and Receivables), then subtract all the negative stuff (Liabilities and Payables), and the difference is what the company ""has"": its Equity. (The Income and Expense accounts are just temporary accounts used for incoming and outgoing cash flows.) But a lot of what the company ""has"" also could involve ""counterparties"" - other entities who (in the future) will (hopefully) come through and pay what they promised to pay. 

So there is _risk_ here. Risk of _not getting paid._ Risk of _breach of contract_. Risk of _credit default_. Because most of these ""assets"" are not ""counterparty-free"". Your ""net worth"" on paper might be just that: on paper. In reality (if the people who promised to pay you end up never paying you), then your ""net worth"" could actually turn out to be much less than what it says ""on paper"".

**Derivatives** are just another layer built on top of that: they're basically ""bets"" about whether someone is actually going to get paid or not. (In fact, one of the most important types of derivatives are Credit Default Swaps - or CDOs - which are used to place ""bets"" on whether someone is going to default on their debts.)

So, a company like AXA (which is heavily involved in derivativs) is technically ""rich"" - but only ""on paper"". In reality, like most major financial firms, if you just looked at what they actually have ""on hand"", they'd probably literally be _bankrupt_. 

This may sound shocking, but many economic experts have stated that **a majority of the major financial firms around the world (including most major banks, and most major insurance firms such as AXA) are actually _bankrupt_** - if you just look at the _reality_ of what they actually have ""on hand"" (and not the ""fantasy"" of what they have ""on paper"").

So, in addition to the ability to print money out of thin air, there is this other strange aspect to the world's current financial system: many companies (mainly finance companies) would be considered bankrupt if viewed strictly in terms of what they have ""on hand"" ... but they're are able to parade around acting like they're mega-rich, based on what they have ""on paper"" (most of which is debt-based or derivatives-based).

**Bitcoin coin is a major threat to the existing power system based on debt and dervatives - which AXA is at the absolute center of**

So, the people who are supposedly ""powerful"", who run our world - their power comes from two sources:

- Their ability to print up money out of thin air;

- Debt-based and derivatives-based numbers on paper.

Bitcoin threatens the first item above. 

And the global financial crisis which started in 2008 threatens the second item above. 

In fact, Bitcoin itself also probably threatens the second item above too.

This is because as Bitcoin becomes worth more and more, those debt-based and derivatives-based numbers on paper become worth less and less, in relative terms. 

And if the current financial crisis becomes acute again (like it did when _another_ ""systemically important"" insurance company / derivatives ""playa"" went under: AIG)...

...then a lot of those numbers on balance sheets will get wiped out, written off - because people aren't paying up

...and so companies (including companies like AXA - in fact _especially_ companies like AXA) might go belly up 

...because _they don't actually have any real money ""on hand""_ - all they have is debt-based and derivatives-based numbers on paper.

So nearly all of the world's major banks and insurance companies - especially AXA - are on a mad, mad merry-go-round of debt and derivatives. 

They're like someone with no cash, living on an almost-maxxed-out credit card - desperately hoping that the banks will ~~lend~~ give them more money (a/k/a ""credit"" - a/k/a **debt**), and terrified that the counterparties who _owe_ them money will actually turn out to be in the same boat that _they_ are: ie, _bankrupt_, deadbeats. 

It's actually less like a merry-go-round, and more like a game of musical chairs: and nearly all the major banks and financial companies are terrified of what will happen if/when the music stops, and they're not able to scramble to find a chair - _especially_ AXA.

**AXA is the ""second-most-connected"" financial company in the world**

AXA also has more _derivatives_ than any other insurance company in the world - which means they're basically flat-broke, totally dependent on their ""counterparties"" in this ""web of debt"".

And derivatives aren't just some minor part of the world financial system. Actually, there is currently around 1.2 quadrillion dollars in derivatives - so derivatives are _by far_ the _biggest_ part of the world financial system.

Here's an infographic to give you an idea:

http://money.visualcapitalist.com/all-of-the-worlds-money-and-markets-in-one-visualization/

You'll notice that Bitcoin is also included on that infographic. 

Maybe you look at it and think: Well, Bitcoin is so small, why would _they_ be worried about it?

But size isn't everything. 

Remember that (unlike nearly every other asset on that infographic) - bitcoin is ""counterparty-free"". (Also gold and silver are ""counterparty-free"".) 

So gold, silver and bitcoin are a lot more ""independent"" than all the other so-called ""assets"" on that infographic. In fact, it wouldn't be much of a stretch to say that gold, silver and bitcoin are the only totally _real_ assets on that infographic - and the rest of those assets are to some degree _fake_ (since they could evaporate at any minute - unlike gold, silver and bitcoin, where your ownership is totally guaranteed).

Also, due to the ""law of reversion to mean"", something small on that infographic basically has only one direction it can go: towards getting bigger. We say that Bitcoin has a lot of ""upside"" for growth. 

And something gigantic on that infographic also has one direction it can go: towards getting smaller. We say that derivatives have a lot of downside - derivatives might be in a bubble, or due for a crash.

And one way that could easily happen would be for billions of dollars (or trillions of dollars) to flow into Bitcoin - while flowing out of the other asset classes on that infographic.

Of course, in order for trillions of dollars to flow into Bitcoin... 

**We're gonna need a bigger blocksize.**

And that's actually basically _all_ we'd probably need - the software already runs fine, and (despite the propaganda from Blockstream and r\bitcoin), the network / hardware / infrastructure / bandwidth can already handle blocksizes of 4MB-8MB - so with things like Moore's law working in tandem with Metcalfe's law, it is quite reaonable to assume that in 8-10 years (after the next two Bitcoin ""halvings"") **it is quite possible for 1 bitcoin to be worth 1 million US Dollars**. 

I did some rough growth projections here showing how feasible this actually is:

&gt; Bitcoin Original: Reinstate Satoshi's original 32MB max blocksize. If actual blocks grow 54% per year (and price grows 1.54^2 = 2.37x per year - Metcalfe's Law), then in 8 years we'd have 32MB blocks, 100 txns/sec, 1 BTC = 1 million USD - 100% on-chain P2P cash, without SegWit/Lightning or Unlimited

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5uljaf/bitcoin_original_reinstate_satoshis_original_32mb/

So Bitcoin (with bigger blocks - not under the control of Blockstream or AXA) could be a serious competitor - or a threat - or a safe haven - or an ""inversely correlated"" asset class - versus all the other asset classes on that infographic.

**Bitcoin is an alternative**

Bitcoin is an alternative - an option people might turn to, if they decide to abandon the other options on that infographic.

So AXA - whose wealth and power depends on heavily on the derivatives shown in that infographic - might want to either see Bitcoin fail, or suppress Bitcoin, or eliminate it as an alternative, or simply control it somehow - just to make sure it doesn't ""eat their lunch"".

Remember that one of the tactics used by oppressors is to spread propaganda to brainwash you into giving up hope and believing that [""There Is No Alternative""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_no_alternative).

Bitcoin _is_ an alternative to the current messed-up financial system (which helps prop up bankrupt companies like AXA) - so _for that reason alone_ it's enough for a company like AXA to want to eliminate or suppress or at least control Bitcoin. Not just by buying up some bitcoins - but by paying the devs who write the code that determines the blocksize which ultimately affects the [price](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5uljaf/bitcoin_original_reinstate_satoshis_original_32mb/).

**""Bitcoin users unaffected.""**

If/when the music stops in the game of debt- and derivatives-backed musical chairs that makes the world go 'round, some of the ""systemically important"" financial firms will be exposed as being bankrupt - and it is very, very likely that one of those firms could be AXA (just like AIG in 2008). 

In all honesty, I have to admit that it's still not totally clear to me (or maybe to anyone) precisely how Bitcoin will ultimately impact this whole ""web of debt"". After all, this is the first time the world has ever had a digital, counterparty-free asset like Bitcoin. (Gold and silver are also counterparty-free - but they're not digital, so it's harder to store them and move them around.)

But one basic fact is certain: Bitcoin is really not a _part_ of this whole ""web of debt"". Bitcoin stands quite outside this whole ""web of debt"". Bitcoin is ""inversely correlated"" to this whole ""web of debt"".

Bitcoin is an alternative.

**Voice and Exit**

If you feel like you don't have a voice / vote in the system, it's good to know that you can _exit_ the system.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty

**_Balaji Srinivasan (founder of 21.co) on Voice and Exit_**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A

**Can we ever really know what AXA might be up to with Bitcoin?**

Probably not - because it is unlikely that they would ever tell us.

But, we can make some rational guesses.

On some level, a lot of people whose wealth and power come from this whole ""web of debt"" are probably just reasoning as follows:

- If/when this whole ""web of debt"" goes down, Bitcoin goes up. (This is already pretty much an established fact: money flees to ""safe havens"" like gold, silver and bitcoin when ""traditional"" investments go down.)

- If/when Bitcoin goes up, then the importance and power (and credibility) of this whole ""web of debt"" goes down. (This makes sense: being counterparty-free, bitcoin is obviously a safer investment - and so it's worth more - and so all those other debt-based and derivatives-based investments become worth less, as bitcoin becomes worth more.)

- If Bitcoin goes down (or totally goes away), then this whole ""web of debt"" will probably be able to hang on for a while longer. (This also be more of just just a conjecture - but it seems quite reasonable.)

Maybe they just want to keep you trapped in their system - by destroying (or suppressing) the alternative (Bitcoin) which gives you a chance to exit their system.

**Some more posts about AXA and what they _might_ be up to:**

Anyways, there's a bunch of articles on r/btc about AXA and what they might be up to with Bitcoin:

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on

Finally, if you need some extra help dispelling the quaint notion that the people who run the world are honest and transparent and helpful, then the following two (admittedly highly conjectural) posts might help spell things out a bit more explicitly for you:

Sorry I don't have any more time right now to ""school"" you further on this subject. 

Ideally, learning should be a self-driven process anyways - once someone helps you get started.

---

**Some advice**

Finally, if I may give you some parting advice.

If you want to be truly respected on these forums, you're probably going to have to stop going around acting like such a [doe-eyed](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=doe+eyed&amp;t=hb&amp;ia=web) innocent little [pollyanna](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pollyanna). 

It is assumed that most people here already pretty much know the harsh reality of how the world works, and are trying to use Bitcoin as a way to not get screwed over by this harsh reality. 

So some of the more informed people around here might not have much patience with you (or trust in you) if you don't even understand the basic principles outlined above, namely:

1. Our planet is being run by an exclusive club of rich assholes who have immense power, because _we_ ""allow"" _them_ to _print out money_ (which they then hand out to their buddies, not to us - basically enslaving us).

2. Bitcoin was designed (many believe) to help fix this dire situation.

3. The _ancien régime_ (those people who up till now who have been running the world, due to their ability to print money) _might not like Bitcoin for this reason, and might try to do something to stop it_ - and they might not tell you why they're doing it - and they might not even tell you that they _are_ doing it in the first place!

Sorry to be such a curmudgeon, but pollyannas like you tend to get on my nerves after a while - not least because it seems to me that one of the factors which allows those rich assholes to continue to stay in power and run the world is because so many uninformed credulous people like you either can't or won't just wake up and open your goddamn eyes and see how you're getting fucked over by this whole ""web of debt"" based around that exclusive ""club"" of rich assholes who get free money which the bankers are simply printing up out of thin air.

So, 99% of people in the world are living lives of quiet desperation and oppression, becoming poorer and poorer - while the rich keep getting richer and richer (with all that money they keep printing out of thin air - which by the way, if [you do the math](https://np.reddit.com/user/ydtm?sort=top), ends up making _your_ money worth less) - and now there are finally some serious attempts at revolution or change afoot, to try to fix some of this mess - and you've just wandered in to a meeting where some of these people struggling for change are making plans, and you basically keep going around asking ""What are you guys so worked up about?""

Maybe if you also realized that _you are saying the exact same thing that the oppressors are always saying_ (basically some variation of ""Nothing to see here, move on!"") - then maybe that will provide _another_ hint to you as to why some people have been less-than-totally-welcoming of your non-stop naïve-sounding questions.

**Every subreddit has a topic - plus certain assumptions**

For comparison: Would you wander around on a subreddit about fitness or weightlifting constantly asking: ""Why do you want to get in shape?""? (Or maybe here's an even better comparison: Would you wander around on a subreddit for some oppressed group, and keep asking ""Why would anyone be oppressing you?""?) 

There are certain _""givens""_ which are assumed on a subreddit - and one of the _""givens""_ for a lot of people on this subreddit is that the current monetary regime running the world is not working for most people (or: it is _oppressing_ most people), and so we need something better. (Also another one of the _""givens""_ is that r\bitcoin is censoring everyone's posts - and that Blockstream is damaging Bitcoin.)

Nobody is forcing you to get into fitness or weightlifting - and nobody is forcing you to get into Bitcoin. Maybe you think your physique is already fine the way it is, so you don't see the point of fitness or bodybuilding - and maybe you think that VISA and PayPal and JPMorganChase and Wells Fargo and the Fed and the ECB or whatever are fine for you, so you don't see the point of Bitcoin. (Or maybe you were born a millionaire so you don't feel financially oppressed.) You're free to get involved or not get involved. Most people who are here are involved for some particular reason. And whatever that reason may be, it usually tends to involve using Bitcoin as it was designed in the whitepaper - in order to improve their lives. And part of this also means actually _using Bitcoin as it was designed in the whitepaper_ - free of any interference from companies like Blockstream - or their financial backers AXA - who might not really want us to be able to use Bitcoin the way it was designed in the whitepaper.

In particular, it has been quite obvious for years to people on r/btc that the _actions_ of r\bitcoin and Blockstream have been damaging to Bitcoin (whatever their actual _motives_ may be - which we may ultimately never even be able to find out since they're probably never going to actually _tell_ us) - but meanwhile we've had to fight tooth and nail to get a vast brainwashed army of pollyannas - a lot of whom quite frankly sound a lot like you -  to understand that Satoshi did _not_ design Bitcoin to work like _this_:

&gt; Every Core supporter wants to run their own node. Apparently to help banks settle transactions, instead of their own transactions.

Satoshi designed Bitcoin to work like _this_:

**We all have our own reasons for being here.**

So hopefully that gives you some background regarding why many people are here on this subreddit in the first place, and what some of our goals and desires are. 

We want to use Bitcoin - and we don't want the bankers funding Blockstream or the censors silencing r\bitcoin to get in our way. 

We understand that Bitcoin is a _disruptive_ technology which could be _liberating_ and _empowering_ for many of us in various ways.

We are realistic about the fact (ie, we take it as a ""given"") that certain powerful individuals or institutions might not _want_ us to be empowered and liberated like this (maybe because their power depends on our enslavement).

And so we allow for the possibility that certain powerful individuals or institutions might be trying to stop us - and that they might not even have the courtesy to _inform_ us that they are trying to stop us.

I should of course clarify that these are ultimately really only _my_ reasons for being on this forum. 

Other people may have their own reasons - some the same as me, and some different from me - and so I can only speak for myself. 

It is important for all of us - me, you and everyone else - to have a clear understanding of _why we are here._

**Why people are rejecting Blockstream's heavily modified version of Bitcoin - and sticking with Satoshi's original version of Bitcoin (now called Bitcoin Cash or BCC)**

The above reasons are why many of us will not use [AXA-owned](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) Blockstream's Bitcoin.

We want to continue using Satoshi's original Bitcoin, now being renamed Bitcoin Cash (ticker: BCC, or BCH) - because we want to continue to enjoy the benefits of:

- simple &amp; safe [on-chain scaling](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5uljaf/bitcoin_original_reinstate_satoshis_original_32mb/) for cheaper and faster p2p transactions and higher value for our bitcoins, and

investing,How Citi could rise from $68 to over $120,"At their investor day last week Citi CEO Michael Corbat outlined how the firm could grow EPS from $5 to $9 due to increasing revenues from north America and rising interest rates and reducing overheads by moving to lower cost locations.  

If he's right the SP would rise from the current $68.50 to over $120 if it has the same unchallenging PE multiple of 13.5.  If he's right then the SP may even benefit further from some multiple expansion.

Banking,[US][QUESTION] Need to deposit a tax return check with non-US resident spouse.,"So i received my tax return check which was a joint/married return and it has both me and my wife's name on the check.  I am trying to take it to my local credit union where I bank.  They say it is over a threshold and without my spouse having state ID it cannot be deposited.

Let it be known she has federal ID and a Japanese passport.  She does not have a green card yet and she cannot get state ID because of that.  

It seems this ID rule is one my local credit union itself has.

Has anyone else had this type of situation, what did you do?",finance
personalfinance,"Girlfriend has lots of student loan/credit card debt, trying to figure out the best way to pay it off.","My gf ran up a lot of credit card debt when she was younger but is trying to get back on track. She's always paid at least minimum (not ideal, i know) but always on time. 

I dont have exact interest rates but here is the ballpark

~$6000 at about 18%

~$1800 at about 13%

~$1600 at about 13%

~$1400 at 12.95%

Right now she is paying around 85% of her income to pay these off, focusing on the biggest one. Should she refinance? pay off the largest first? we're new to this thing and could really use some advice.

personalfinance,Financing LASIK - Care Credit vs Personal Loan??,"I'm hoping you all could help me understand some nuances in credit, because I'm having a difficult time understanding how different financing options for LASIK will affect my credit score. As I understand, there are two available options to me:

1. *Care Credit* - A credit card that offers promotional 0% APR for the 24-mo term.
2. *Personal Loan* - From a lender who will probably charge me between 8.66%-12.99%, depending on lender, based on my personalized search on aggregate websites such as Nerd Wallet.

I have always paid off my credit cards in full every single month for every single credit card. But what happens to my credit score if I opt for the Care Credit and have that revolving balance on my card (say $3,600) that takes 24 months to fully pay off? I guess my main confusion lies in understanding how maintaining a balance on a revolving credit line (Care Credit would be the only one I'm not paying in full) would affect credit score.

Would it be better for my credit score to take out a personal installment loan instead, assuming all payments are made on time? I would be willing to pay the high interest rate if it will benefit my credit score.

Some relevant credit info about me

* Credit score: mid 700
* Credit history: 5 years
* Total credit limit: $55,000
* Current utitilization ratio: 1%
* Have student loans and a car loan in repayment

**TL;DR** Trying to finance LASIK, which option will be better for my credit score assuming all payments are on time: Care Credit revolving credit line which will maintain a balance until fully paid off vs Personal Installment Loans?

personalfinance,Thinking of doing Lease-to-Buy on Car and would like financial opinions.,"So I want to purchase a car with an MSRP of $25,000 at the lowest. I have been reading here and there and getting different opinions from people on whether or not to lease-to-buy a car and to straight out buy the car. Unfortunately, my interest rate to pay back is 7% if I take an auto loan from my bank at $25,000. That would mean in 60 months, I would be looking at a total of paying back $29,900 which is more or less an extra $5,000. But looking into the leasing-to-buy prices, I calculated that if I pay about $300 a month for 36 months and put a down payment of $1,000, I will have a remaining residual price of about $15,000. If I ask my bank for the loan then, I will be paying $300 monthly for the next 60 months giving myself a total of about 9 years to pay off the car. Long time, but I save $2,000. 

I read that there are also other factors that can be put into play such as negotiating the sales price. Another factor is that i have already been approved for a loan, but 36 months from now, they can easily deny me and I would have to return the car and get nothing. Is it worth extending my payment to save $2,0000 for 9 years for my car and pay $300 every month? Or is it better to pay an extra $5,0000 on interest rates in 5 years but pay $500 dollars a month? 

On an extra note, I live paycheck-to-paycheck, so I do have to carefully budget the money I spend. I do pay rent and bills. I need some advice. Is there something I may be missing?",finance

personalfinance,"$11,700 unsubsidized student loan at 8% variable interest and two years in school left. Do I have any options to consolidate or refinance this?","*Reposted for contextual purposes.*

Hi all,

I have an $11,700 **un**subsidized student loan sitting at an 8% interest rate with a variable rate of up to 16%. I will have my degree (nursing) in approximately two years. 

I've been looking into student loan consolidation since an 8-16% rate seems astronomically high in today's economy (all of my other student loans are sitting at under 5% fixed rates), but it appears that all consolidation vendors require the individual to possess a college degree prior to consolidation. Co-signers do not circumnavigate this stipulation. 

Am I screwed, and do I need to let this loan fester at 8-16% for the next two years while I finish school, or is there a smarter way to go about this? 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Just recently purchased a new car at a great interest rate. Should I refinance my spouses car as well during this same period?,"I just recently purchased a used vehicle and was able to receive 3.19% APR.

One credit check on  6/26 and twice on 6/29.

My second car is at 4.09% with about 19K to go.Would it be worth it to refinance that car to see if I could get a lower interest rate? The place I've checked my credit at was a major bank who could possibly do it. I don't know how this works as I've just purchased a new car on July 29th.

Thanks for your time.",finance
personalfinance,"Starting law school - $75,000 in savings and don't know when to take out loans","So, I am starting law school in August and lived with my parents for 3 years to save money. I was able to save $75,000, which is currently sitting in my relatively high interest savings account (APY 1.20%).

I am eligible to receive $20,500 a year in federal unsubsidized loans at 5.31% interest rate, with a 1% loan fee. After this and my savings, I will likely rely on a federal Grad PLUS loan (6.31% interest, 4.3% loan fee) for the rest of attendance. I need to shop around to see if I can get a lower rate through a private lender.

Total cost of attendance estimated by the school for all three years will be hefty - maximum $278,718. So, I am estimating that I will need to take out $200,000 in loans. I'm trying to further reduce this cost through government health insurance, and I live with my boyfriend which reduces my rent compared to the school's estimated living expenses. I will be able to pay off one year's tuition with my savings (along with a year of rent). Does it make sense to not borrow anything my first year and pay the bill with my savings, or should I borrow my max amount of federal direct subsidized loans my first year anyway to maximize the amount loaned to me at that low interest rate? I am limited to just $20,500 a year, so if I do not take the federal loans my first year, I will miss out on $20,500 being credited at a low rate. I would need to later take this amount out at a higher rate once my savings are depleted. 

Additionally, how much of my savings should I keep in my bank and not use to pay for school, as an emergency fund?

I am not looking for any ""law school is a scam"" comments. I have thoroughly researched the matter for years and am going to a top school. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"I'm in a significant amount of debt, finally finishing my B.S. after 8 years, and lost my job-- I have $12k more in ubsub loans I can take out, should I?","So at the end of June, I lost my job that was making me about $40,000 a year. My wife currently makes about $20,000 yearly (we're in one of those towns that's too expensive to leave, with zero growth opportunity). Our current housing situation and bills require us to come up with about $2800 a month, and we're pulling in about $1200. 

Starting in the fall term, I am taking the final nine units (between two schools) to graduate with my degree I started in 2009. I have a Pell grant that covers just enough to do this, but I can get $12,000 more in unsub federal loans if I accept the award. We are already at $50,000 and $42,000 in debt on student loans, but are both on PAYE programs for them.

So the question is, given that I don't currently have any job prospects and without taking out loans (of which I have been declined numerous times, as well as for unemployment), should I take out additional student loans to help pay for living expenses? We have no equity, nothing to sell off, and we're going to end up evicted by next month without some financial help. I mostly just want to know if there were other paths I didn't yet pursue, because right now, taking out financial aid seems like the only fix.",finance
personalfinance,Need help with an IRS audit. Turbo tax and the IRS came up with extremely different amounts due.,"I filed with turbo tax as I always do for 2016 federal taxes. I got a letter today saying that I was being audited, and that changes were made by the IRS to my 1040, and that I owed them a lot more money than the turbotax-filled 1040 showed. 

The taxable income on both of these 1040 forms is the same, $56,075. Turbo tax used the tax tables (married filing jointly) to get that taxes due were $7,484. The IRS adjusted 1040 says it used a tax table and that my corrected tax liability is $16,820.

Does anyone know what table the IRS used to get such a vastly different number?

EDIT: I am not self employed, income came from a W-2.

EDIT2: A picture of the form I received. The back goes on to say how I owe some penalties for misrepresenting my due tax. [LINK](http://imgur.com/a/ChZfT)

personalfinance,Refinancing college debt and other questions [NJ/NY],"Hi pf,

So I took out a lot of loans to pay for college, as did my parents, because I went to a rather expensive school. However, I landed a nice paying job in NY while living at home in NJ. So here's my situation:

* Debt in my name: -~$70k (interest ranging from 3-6%)
* Debt in my parent's name (PARENT PLUS):-~$60k (interest ranging from 6-7%)
* Currently $10k in savings, no other investments
* Living at home so no rent
* Gross annual salary: $100k (bonus expectation between $4-6k)
* If I pay into my 401k at 6% I get 7.5% matched. I'm staying on my parent's healthcare. Investing in stocks is tricky due to one of my parents having a job that exposes them to insider info.

I have a few questions:

* How do I refinance Parent PLUS loans? The interest rates on those are horrendous, and if I can bring those down that'd be incredibly helpful in the long run.

* Can I get a tax credit for my student loans? I haven't been paid yet (first paycheck comes Friday) so my MGI will be lower than usual.

* Is there any reason for me to pay more than the 6% into my 401k?

* Finally, provided I'm still dating my girlfriend, and assuming she gets a decent job in her field (STEM-related but not CS/ECE) near me, what should I do to ensure I'm on decent footing if I try to move out in a year?",finance
